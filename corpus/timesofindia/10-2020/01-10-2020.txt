October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Bengaluru poised for a no-frills Durga Puja celebration this year||Every year, Durga Puja is celebrated in a grand manner in Bengaluru. From huge idols, decorated pandals to yummy eats and flea markets, all five days of puja are filled with get-togethers and enthusiasm. None of these will be possible in 2020, though. Blame the pandemic, Durga Puja celebrations are bound to be low-key this year. The government is yet to issue new SOPs. Under normal circumstances, puja preparations usually begin months in advance. But given the rising cases of COVID-19 and hygiene and safety protocols in place, puja committees are still not sure of the scale of festivities this year. “We are hoping to hear the new regulations from the government by October 4, following which we will chalk out a plan accordingly,” says Sweta Chatterjee, core team member of Sarathi Socio Cultural Trust, in Koramangala. Pandals being shifted to smaller spaces; no pushpanjali and bhogConsidering the restrictions, Utsav Durga Puja has been shifted from the JP Nagar to Bilekahalli this year. President Aninda Chatterjee says, “We are opting for a smaller venue, as we have to keep the COVID-19 SOPs in mind.” Adding to that, an Assam Association Bangalore spokesperson says, “Our pujari will come from Kolkata. However, we wouldn’t be conducting pushpanjali and aarti by the devotees, nor will there be any daily bhog or prasad distribution.” Committees say no to big Durga idolsLarge Durga pratimas are the most essential part of the weeklong festivity – from waiting for the arrival of the idol at the pandal to bidding it farewell. This time around, though, several committees have decided not to get big idols. “Instead, we are going for a small Durga idol, made of Ashtadhatu (a combination of eight metals),” says Aninda. “As of now, we are looking at an idol which is two-and-half-foot long. If there will be no idol, then we will do Ghat Puja, an earthen pot that replaces Maa Durga,” adds Nabarun Purkayastha, president of Bangalore Sreehatta Sammeloni. Sanitisation, mask and physical distancing are a mustAccording to Bengalee Association Bangalore’s Achintya Lal Roy, puja celebrations depend solely on the new government guidelines. “We are looking at opening our pandal to the public with all precautionary measures – like sanitisation, the use of masks, restriction on the number of people entering the premise and social distancing.” Durga Puja goes digitalKeeping the Durga Puja spirit alive, albeit in a low-key manner, many committees have already planned a digital puja, this year. “We are planning to do a webcast on our video-streaming portal, website and our social media page. Pushpanjali will also be streamed live for everyone, as there will be limited devotees at the pandal. The evening aarti will also be telecast live along with other cultural performances,” says Aninda. Nabarun adds, “We will also be live-streaming puja this year on our website, as only 15 volunteers will be allowed at the premises. Apart from that, people can enjoy the cultural shows digitally on our platforms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-poised-for-a-no-frills-durga-puja-celebration-this-year/articleshow/78412934.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty
October 1, 2020||India||NCRB places Odisha on top in child pornography cases for 2nd year||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha reported the highest number of child pornography cases in the country in 2019 for the second consecutive year, according to the latest statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday. While Odisha registered 542 child pornography cases (use of child for pornography/storing child pornographic materials under Section 14 and 15 of the POCSO Act) in 2019, Bihar stood second with 164 cases. In 2018, Odisha had registered 333 child pornography cases, the highest in the country. Incidentally, the state was at the seventh position in 2017 for reporting only eight child pornography cases. Police sources said most child pornography cases surfaced following breach of trust or a strained relationship between the accused and victims. In almost all the cases, the accused and the victims were close acquaintances. “After developing intimate relationship with the girls, the accused would cheat them. The accused would click obscene photos of the victims and circulate pornographic material on social media,” S K Swain, a retired deputy superintendent of police, said. Police and child rights activists cite different reasons for the alarming trend. “We cannot tell why other states witnessed less number of cases than Odisha. One possible reason could be that we did not suppress the complaints and registered cases immediately after receiving the complaints. Almost all the cases were solved and the accused put behind bars,” a senior police officer said. Child rights activist Anuradha Mohanty blamed it on the unchecked use of internet and social media by children. “The offence cannot be prevented by police as it is more of a social and familial issue than a law and order problem. Parents and family members have bigger roles to play in preventing this. Social media has its disadvantages. If parents are allowing their children to use internet and social media platforms, they should also ensure that the children do not befriend strangers or watch objectionable content,” Mohanty said. She added that many cases might have gone unreported. “We saw some cases where parents were reluctant to lodge complaints with the police apprehending loss of face in the society. If such cases were reported to the police, other parents would be more careful,” Mohanty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ncrb-places-odisha-on-top-in-child-pornography-cases-for-2nd-year/articleshow/78414664.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
October 1, 2020||India||Its for those against Bengaluru's security to apologise: Tejasvi Surya||BENGALURU: Newly appointed BJP Yuva Morcha chief Tejasvi Surya, MP, on Wednesday virtually rejected the demands for apology over his "Bengaluru terror epicentre" comment which has drawn criticism from opposition parties, saying it has to be tendered by those against the city's security. Bengaluru had given him the identity and those against the city's security should apologise and not him, Surya said adding he was for the safety and security of Bengalurians. The MP, who represents Bengaluru South Lok Sabha segment, had claimed on Sunday that Bengaluru has become an epicentre of terror activities, after requesting Union Home Minister Amit Shah to set up a permanent division of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the city. His comments evoked sharp criticism from opposition Congress and JD(S) with former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy even calling it an insult to Bengaluru had urged BJP to seek an apology from Surya. "Bengaluru gave me education, food, and made me Parliamentarian.... It has given me an identity in the country....I'm identified as a boy from Bengaluru. It is my place," Survya said when asked by reporters whether he would apologise over his controversial remark. Speaking after visiting the state BJP office for the first time after being appointed as party Yuva Morcha National President, he said, if some one recruiting people for ISIS was arrested in Bengaluru it pained him. "If a mob of two thousand people attacks a police station here for some social media post, it boils my blood," he said, referring to the violence unleashed by a mob here in August. "People who don't want NIA in Bengaluru for the safety of the city, those from Congress who nurtured jihadi organisations like KFD (Karnataka Forum for Dignity), PFI, SDPI while in power by withdrawing cases against them and allowed them to do goondagiri. It is they who have to seek apology from Bengalurians as they are against Bengaluru's interest," he added. He said he had advocated for NIA division in Bengaluru so that it doesn't become a place for terrorists. "Those who are worried that Congress and SDPI match fixing politics will get spoiled are opposing NIA for Bengaluru," Surya said. Responding to a question about failure to maintain social distance by gathering a large crowd near the party office and arriving in a procession, Surya merely said, the party workers had gathered out of happiness that one of their own has been given the national responsibility and nothing was planned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-for-those-against-bengalurus-security-to-apologise-tejasvi-surya/articleshow/78414838.cms||---

Although considered to be one of the most conservative parts of India, Raipur’s pride broke the myth with pomp and gaiety. Here's a throwback on how the pride march was... The highlight of the pride parade was the 200-metre rainbow flag made of cloth by the youngsters who held the flag from Ghadi Chowk to Marine Drive.

October 1, 2020||India||Yet another Dalit woman gang-raped, dies in UP||BALRAMPUR: Amid the widespread outrage over the alleged gang-rape and murder of a Dalit teen from Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, yet another scheduled caste woman died in Balrampur district while being rushed to a hospital after she was raped by two men. Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma said the incident happened in the Gaisari area of the district, where a 22-year-old Dalit woman, working in a private firm, failed to return home in time on Tuesday evening, prompting her parents to start looking for her. The woman's parents said she did not respond to calls on her mobile phone, triggering panic among family members, the police said. The woman, however, returned home shortly later in an autorickshaw with an intravascular cannula, medically known as Vigo and used for administering injection, glucose or other fluids in the body, inserted in her hand, the police said, quoting her parents. The girl looked dazed and in a serious condition, prompting her parents to rush her to a nearby hospital, but she died on the way, said the SP. When the matter was reported to the police from the hospital, the parents alleged that their daughter was gang-raped, SP Verma said. Acting on the parent's complaint, police identified the accused as Shahid and Sahil and arrested them, the SP said. Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said, "After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gang-raped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition.

But due to COVID-19, youngsters prefer to avoid renting out clothes and prepare the garba outfits at home... Shreenidhi Yadav is one amongst those who like to be creative with whatever is available at home. Her garba look is quite an example of that. “I have completed my look with whatever I have at my home. I keep on seeing a lot of DIY videos on the net and take ideas from them. The outfit I am wearing is nothing but a pair of jeans, a crop top and a traditional jacket made out of a dupatta. I pinned the dupatta from three sides to turn it into a jacket and wore it over my crop top. It is a different and yet stylish look. Some jewellery on top never harms. It saved my visit to the market and a lot of time too.” Jewellery helps a lot in balancing one’s outfit. Kanika Raghuwanshi upping her glam quotient by making DIY home jewellery. She explains her look, “I have a colourful printed skirt and planning to club it with a white crop top, which is actually a jacket but I made it into a crop top by tying the knot. To avoid my overall outfit from looking bland, I topped up with heavy jewellery like that of a head accessory, neckpiece, and bangles. This look is quite easy and comfortable and it took me just fifteen minutes to get ready. I have a lot of collection of jewellery and thus I go for simple outfits that allow me to play with the accessories.” While Reema Thakur has one of the best style options to carry to the garba place. She explains her look with such an ease which shows how easy it is to carry also. “I will be wearing a crop top over it looks smart at the same time. To give a traditional touch to my outfit, I draped this traditionally printed dupatta around my waist, like a saree. I am fond of accessorizing so picked up my favourite jewellery and completed my look with it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/raipur-youngsters-ditch-renting-garba-outfits-this-year-opt-for-diy-look-instead/articleshow/78416313.cms||---

October 1, 2020||World||Senate approves bill to avoid shutdown, sending it to Trump||WASHINGTON: By a sweeping bipartisan vote Wednesday, the Senate sent President Trump a bill to fund the government through Dec. 11, averting the possibility of a government shutdown when the new fiscal year starts Thursday. Trump is expected to sign the measure before Wednesday's midnight deadline. The temporary extension will set the stage for a lame-duck session of Congress later this year, where the agenda will be largely determined by the outcome of the presidential election. The measure would keep the government running through Dec. 11 and passed by a 84-10 vote. The House passed the bill last week. The stopgap spending bill is required because the GOP-controlled Senate has not acted on any of the 12 annual spending bills that fund the 30% of the government's budget that is passed by Congress each year. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November, it's likely that another stopgap measure would fund the government into next year and that the next administration and Congress would deal with the leftover business. The measure is the bare minimum accomplishment for Capitol Hill's powerful Appropriations committees, who pride themselves on their deal-making abilities despite gridlock in other corners of Congress. The legislation _ called a continuing resolution, or CR, in Washington-speak _ would keep every federal agency running at current funding levels through Dec. 11, which will keep the government afloat past an election that could reshuffle Washington's balance of power. The measure also extends many programs whose funding or authorizations lapse on Sept. 30, including the federal flood insurance program, highway and transit programs, and a long set of extensions of various health programs, such as a provision to prevent Medicaid cuts to hospitals that serve many poor people. It also finances the possible transition to a new administration if Biden wins the White House and would stave off an unwelcome COVID-caused increase in Medicare Part B premiums for outpatient doctor visits. Farm interests won language that would permit Trump's farm bailout to continue without fear of interruption. In exchange, House Democrats won $8 billion in food aid for the poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-approves-bill-to-avoid-shutdown-sending-it-to-trump/articleshow/78417317.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Patna||Many opt for protein-rich diet to boost immunity amid pandemic||PATNA: The raging pandemic has forced people in the city to make substantial changes in their dietary preferences. While consumption of multivitamins and Vitamin C supplements have been on the rise ever since the outbreak of Covid-19, dietary protein, which is known to cure damages caused to body tissues, has emerged as an important choice in many households. Punaichak resident Abhilasha Prakash, who once hated consuming ‘tuar daal’, now eats variety of lentils and legumes twice a day. “My diet was always loaded with carbohydrates, rice being my favourite. I used to hate pulses. But after reading several articles about the potential benefits of a protein-rich diet, I have started including it in my meals,” she said. City-based nutritionist Meghna Krishna said that protein helps in building muscles and greater muscle mass implies strengthened immunity. “The dietary reference intake (DRI) of protein is 0.8 gm of protein per kg of body weight for females and 1 gram of protein per kg of body weight for males. Unfortunately, due to lack of dietary awareness, many people do not get the required amount on daily basis,” Meghna said. However, busting the myth about popular protein supplements, Meghna said, “Not everybody needs to take protein supplements. Our traditional food such as ‘rice-daal-sabzi’, ‘rajma-chawal’ and ‘chole-chawal’ is a great combination in itself and has sufficient amount of protein in it,” she added. While vegetarian sources of protein including lentils, peanuts, milk and curd are used in many households, non-vegetarian sources such as eggs, meat and fish are also making their way to the dining table, more often than usual. People who were wary of consuming meat owing to irrational fears during the initial days of Covid-19 outbreak are less-hesitant now. Rajbansi Nagar resident Nikesh Kumar said that now his mother willingly cooks non-vegetarian meal. “She now prepares ‘ghee roast chicken’ and ‘mutton curry’ once every week,” Nikesh said. “My mother has been doing a lot of dietary experiments ever since the outbreak of the pandemic. She recently learnt about the immunity-boosting properties of animal protein from her friends. I now get to savour my taste buds with non-veg delicacies every week,” he said. The price of goat meat in the city is hovering around Rs 700 per kg since the last two months. Whereas fish (rohu/katla) and chicken are sold in the price range of Rs 280-300 per kg and Rs 200-220 per kg respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-opt-for-protein-rich-diet-to-boost-immunity-amid-pandemic/articleshow/78412942.cms||Arunima Lal
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Auto driver who killed woman for jewellery arrested||Hyderabad: An auto driver was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly murdering a 60-year-old woman at Ibrahimpatnam recently. After killing the woman for her jewellery, the accused even accompanied her family members to a local police station to lodge a missing complaint. Vanasthalipuram police arrested B Satish, 29, a resident of Saheb Nagar in Vanasthalipuram. He is a neighbour of the victim, B Maisamma, a washerwoman. Maisamma used to visit the houses where death ceremonies were being performed to perform certain rituals and she used to travel in Satish’s auto. While Maisamma was travelling in his auto, Satish noticed that she wore gold and silver jewellery. “Satish wanted to buy his own auto. He hatched a plan to kill Maisamma and sell her jewellery,” Vanasthalipuram inspector K Murali Mohan said. As per his plan, Satish became close to Maisamma and her family. On September 27 morning, Maisamma got into the auto of Satish and went to Vaidehi Nagar in Vanasthalipuram to attend a tenth day ceremony. In the afternoon, Satish bought her toddy. “After consuming toddy, Maisamma slept in the auto and Satish drove her to an isolated place in Ramdaspally near Ibrahimpatnam. He then made Maisamma, who was drowsy, get down from the auto and slit her throat with a knife. He also hit her on the head with a stick multiple times, killing her on the spot,” the inspector said. After killing Maisamma, Satish removed her mangalsutra, ear studs, silver toe rings and severed her feet to steal silver anklets. After collecting the jewellery, he poured diesel on her face and set it on fire. Satish also damaged her phone and SIM card. Based on the information given by eye-witnesses, who saw Maisamma travel in the auto of Satish, police interrogated him and he confessed to have committed the offense. Cops recovered Rs 34,000 cash, silver ornaments weighing over a kilo and an auto from his possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/auto-driver-who-killed-woman-for-jewellery-arrested/articleshow/78414518.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Business||Bank bad loans to rise despite RBI’s one-time recast scheme||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Bad loans (gross non-performing assets, or NPAs) for the banking system are set to rise to 10.4-10.8% from 8.6% as of March 2020 despite relief measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) because of accounts that were more than 30 days overdue pre-Covid. “We expect additional slippages of 3.1-3.7% for FY21,” said ICRA vice-president (financial sector ratings) Anil Gupta. He added that such a large chunk of loans would turn bad despite the RBI’s special dispensation allowing banks to restructure standard loans without classifying them as NPAs. This was because the restructuring excludes special mention accounts (SMA-1 and SMA-2) where the borrower has delayed beyond 30 days of the due date but has repaid before the loan could be classified as an NPA. According to Gupta, around 6% of bank loans fall in the SMA category and the new bad loans are expected to come from this pool of advances. He was speaking at a webinar on the credit profile of banks after the moratorium. This year, borrowers were allowed to postpone repayment by six months under a moratorium scheme that ended on August 31. After the moratorium was lifted, the RBI said that banks could give any borrower, who has not defaulted earlier, more time to repay. In the past, banks could manage their ratio of bad loans by growing their loan book. However, in FY21, even as banks add to their bad loans, the denominator is unlikely to change much as credit growth estimates for banks have been lowered to 2-3% because of the pandemic. According to Gupta, the current restructuring guidelines for borrowers hit by Covid are more stringent compared to earlier restructuring norms because it requires borrowers to have a better track record and give up control on their cashflows. However, the financial metric thresholds are lower than what ICRA prescribes for BBB-rated companies, which means that companies that just about manage to stay afloat will qualify for restructuring. The bulk of the NPAs is expected to be in the books of public sector banks who will see their GNPAs rise to 11.1-11.4% (10.7% as of March 2020). Private banks on the other hand are expected to contain their bad loans at 5.7-6.4% as compared to 4.2% as of March. The net NPAs for public sector banks are set to rise to 4.2-4.3% for PSBs (3.3% in March) and 1.7-1.9% (1.2% in March) for private banks by March 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bank-bad-loans-to-rise-despite-rbis-one-time-recast-scheme/articleshow/78415337.cms||Mayur Shetty
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Theatre owners relieved with ‘clarity’ from Centre, posters in press before Oct 2 reopening||Kolkata: Theatre owners in Bengal seem happy that they have got some clarity on reopening of cinemas after the Centre issued a notification, allowing halls to open their doors from October 15 with 50% seating capacity. While most are keen to restart business in the third week of October after the ministry of information and broadcasting issues the SOP, printing orders have already been placed for posters of a Rituparna Sengupta film so that it can rerun in four theatres, planning to reopen on October 2. The Multiplex Association of India, which represents all multiplex chains, including, PVR, INOX and Cinepolis, welcomed the decision to reopen on October 15. For single screens, Piya Sengupta, president of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, said, “Most theatre owners here will follow our CM’s tweet and open this week or on October 9 with 50 viewers each. After October 15, they can run with 50% capacity.” Booker Nimai Panja on Wednesday visited EIMPA to decide on the functioning. “I do film bookings for 25 theatres. On Friday, we are opening with Upohar (Chaitanyapur), Karuna Cinema (Arambagh), Bardhaman Cinema (Burdwan), Ellora (Champati), Miloni Cinema (Basirhat) and Purbasha (Maslandapur). A film we plan to open with is Arun Banerjee and Moushumi Saha’s ‘O Bondhu Amar’. In four theatres, we will begin with Rituparna Sengupta and Saswata Chatterjee’s ‘The Parcel’ that ran for five days before lockdown.” Indrasis Acharya, whose ‘The Parcel’ released in Bengal on March 13, said, “It would be good to re-release it now.” Karuna Cinema owner Champak Kundu is ready with distancing plans before Friday reopening. “Our cinema has 1,200 seats. Since 50 people are allowed, they can sit wherever they want.” Naushad Alam, owner of Evergreen Printers at Tirreta Bazaar, on Wednesday got his first film poster order in seven months, with 800 posters for Sova Talkies Cinema (Betberia), 400 for Karuna Cinema, 500 for Bardhaman and 400 for Kakoli Cinema (Panduah). “Though these orders are small, at least a start is made,” said Alam. Distributor-exhibitor Satadeep Saha of Ajanta Cinema are eyeing October 16. “I have time to plan properly,” Saha said. Arijit Dutta of Priya isn’t sure yet about his reopening date. Mahendra Soni, founder director SVF Entertainment, said, “We are waiting for detailed guidelines and safety protocols before we decide on the opening date. From SVF, we will release Anirban-Mimi-starrer” ‘Dracula Sir’ on October 23.” Distributor Bablu Damani feels 90% theatres in Bengal would not open before October 16. “We might start with a rerun of ‘Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti’. Most big and glossy posters are printed in Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi. It will take seven to 10 days to print new posters and get them in Kolkata,” Damani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/theatre-owners-relieved-with-clarity-from-centre-posters-in-press-before-oct-2-reopening/articleshow/78415926.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

October 1, 2020||Patna||Upendra Kushwaha’s another close aide quits RLSP||PATNA: A day after forming a third front with BSP and Janwadi Party (Socialist), RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha received a major jot on Wednesday when his national secretary general Madhaw Anand resigned from the party. Anand took the decision after his meeting with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Tuesday night though he was with Kushwaha at the press conference earlier in the day. Two days back, RLSP state president Bhudeo Choudhary had joined RJD. Sources said even former MP Nagmani, who had quit RLSP in 2019, is also in touch with RJD. RLSP’s two MLAs and one MLC had already switched over to JD(U) led by CM Nitish Kumar. “Having been a primary member of RLSP for the last four years, it is now time for me to move on. I am rendering my resignation from the primary membership of RLSP. While my aim and purpose are always the same to serve the people of my state and country, I believe I am unable to do this anymore within this party,” read a part of his resignation letter addressed to Kushwaha. Anand also advised Kushwaha to renounce politics and continue with his teaching profession. Talking to TOI, Anand called RLSP ‘a one-man party’. He said many more members will soon quit RLSP, alleging the party boss has no respect for his party workers. “He just thinks of himself and can do anything to become an MP or set his own family members,” Anand said, recalling how his Lok Sabha ticket was cancelled in 2019. When asked if he will join RJD and contest the assembly election, he replied, “I have not taken any final decision as to which party I am joining. I am meeting my well-wishers and taking their suggestions.” However, he, like Tejashwi, talked about migration, unemployment and lack of industrialization in Bihar. Anand said he shares a cordial relation with Tejashwi and both are of the same age group and similar mindset. He even said his meeting with Tejashwi on Tuesday was nothing new. “Whenever I come to Patna, I meet him (Tejashwi),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kushwahas-another-close-aide-quits-rlsp/articleshow/78418735.cms||Sheezan Nezami
October 1, 2020||Mumbai||Hospitality industry will take 2-3 years to recover: ICRA||MUMBAI: The Indian hospitality industry, which was the worst-hit by the pandemic, will take atleast two to three years to go back to its pre-Covid level operations, according to credit rating agency ICRA. The pan-India lockdown led to mass closure of hotels across the country, it said, adding that ‘revenue per available room’ in the premium hotel category fell by over 80-90% in the first quarter with a largely equal fall in occupancy and average room rates. Companies reported an 86% decline in revenues, deep operating and net losses during the first quarter of FY2021 as demand petered off to below sustenance levels, limited to government-mandated quarantine travelers, medics and some business-continuity workers. Pavithra Ponniah of ICRA said, “Occupancies in the premium hotel category fell by 30-40% to about 8-12% in first quarter FY2021 while average room rates fell by 30-50% across various markets.’’ Though the central government allowed hotels to be reopened in June with considerable restrictions and safety checks, operations were opened up only in a staggered manner as the state governments took further time to formulate their SOPs. “Several states have eased inter-state travel requirements like e-passes, mandatory quarantine and Covid tests. Consequently, occupancies inched up to about 20% in July and August with some demand also originating from drive-to leisure,” the company said, adding that it expects pan-India occupancies for FY20-21 to hit 30-35% and the average room rates to correct by about 20%. But even post the initial phase, the unfolding economic crisis is likely to keep discretionary travel low for an extended period because of which ‘revenue per available room’ recovery is going to be gradual, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hospitality-industry-will-take-2-3-yrs-to-recover/articleshow/78416498.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

October 1, 2020||Business||IL&FS to put its engineering arm on the block||MUMBAI: The board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) had decided to put on the block IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company (IECC) as part of the group’s resolution process. IECC comes under the ‘red’ category of subsidiaries, which means that the beneficiaries of the resolution process will be its largest lenders. These include SBI, ICICI Bank and IL&FS Group. The company has an outstanding debt of Rs 4,700 crore, part of which is owed to the promoter group. IECC was incorporated in 1988, promoted by Ramalinga Raju as Satyam Constructions. A decade later, it was renamed as Maytas Infrastructure. The company was acquired in 2009 by IL&FS as part of the resolution of the crisis at Satyam after the fraud by Raju. In his annual general meeting speech on Wednesday, IECC chairman C S Rajan said that one of the options under consideration for resolution is a change in the promoter for this entity, one who can provide the requisite support to the company to enable it to emerge stronger from this crisis and gain its due place in the infrastructure space. The company is listed on the BSE and was last traded at Rs 4, which gives it a market capitalisation of Rs 52 crore. Over 42% of the shares are held by IL&FS with the balance widely distributed. After the acquisition, IL&FS expanded capabilities in new verticals such as power, railways, and oil & gas. Before the IL&FS crisis broke out, the company had built up an order book of $1.5 billion, creating a pipeline for future revenue. EPC companies that are looking to expand their capability in urban infrastructure construction are expected to bid for IECC as it has been part of the metro project in Bengaluru and Gurgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-to-put-its-engg-arm-on-the-block/articleshow/78414780.cms||Mayur Shetty

October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||PSE committee finds Rs 1,168 crore irregularities in metro rail project||GANDHINAGAR: The apex committee of the Gujarat assembly for monitoring public sector enterprises (PSEs), in its report submitted before the state assembly, has noted irregularities worth Rs 1,168 crore in the Metrolink Express for Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad (MEGA) project. The committee, which is headed by BJP MLA and former minister Babu Bokhiriya, has recommended recovery of this amount from the accused and initiating strict action against those involved in futile expenditure and irregularities in the metro rail project. The PSE committee, in its recent report, said that the CAG (comptroller & auditor general) of India, in its 2014-15 report scrutinised MEGA’s financial and actual performance. The Gujarat government, in 2005 envisioned to start a Delhi-like metro rail service between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. In 2010, MEGA company was formed to start the metro rail service. The first DPR (draft project report) was approved in December 2012 and revised estimate of Rs 15,789 crore was made. “However, before the high-powered committee approved the DPR, the MEGA company started making major purchases and issuing work orders without any due process at very exaggerated rates. Rs 584 crore worth 1,868 work orders (June 2011 to September 2013), moreover, total 672 work orders worth Rs 201 crore were also issued without prior permission at higher rates. Even before the central and state government sanctioned the projects in addition to these, 1,196 work orders worth Rs 383 crore were made for land filling, casting and other work,” the report stated. The PSE committee noted that set government processes were not followed in issuing work orders. “When the government realised in various inquiries that the chairman at that time and 43 other contractual workers were involved in the major financial and other irregularities, the government terminated all persons and initiated action against them,” the report said, adding that two complaints had been filed with the CID crime of misappropriation of government funds worth Rs 115 crore. “There are many allegations of giving non-required work at too high rates. A total of 22 other cases in arbitration is ongoing. Since the new management took over, no irregularities have been reported,’’ the committee report said. In its final observation, the committee noted, “There were major financial and other irregularities in the MEGA company under the urban development and urban hosing department. However inquiries are pending at various levels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pse-committee-finds-rs-1168-crore-irregularities-in-metro-rail-project/articleshow/78414973.cms||Kapil Dave

On September 28, it went back to its number three.On Google Play, Signal ranked at number 196 in the communications category on September 14. It peaked at number 168 on September 28.As concerns around Whatsapp chat leaks grew, the messaging app was quick to clarify its stance."WhatsApp protects your messages with end-to-end encryption so that only you and the person you're communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between can access it, not even WhatsApp,” a spokesperson for the app said. WhatsApp added that in case of messages on the device, it encourages its users to take advantage of all the security features provided by operating systems such as strong passwords and biometric IDs to prevent third parties from accessing such content.Open Whisper Systems originally developed the encryption WhatsApp uses. This is the same group behind messaging app Signal, which is relatively lesser used in India.Most security professionals recommend Signal or Telegram for maximum security and privacy of conversations.Telegram, which has around 400 million users globally, ranks high among users concerned about privacy, and is typically used by journalists and public officials here in India.However, the reach of WhatsApp with over 1.6 billion monthly active users is no match for Telegram and Signal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/downloads-of-whatsapp-rivals-surge-due-to-privacy-concerns/articleshow/78413514.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The country’s largest private sector bank plans to expand its merchant franchise and at the same time push card spends by bargaining incentives for its customers with its merchant network. According to RBI data, HDFC Bank customers spent nearly Rs 14,000 crore on their credit cards in July, which is nearly 72% of the pre-Covid peak in January 2020. Since then, in August, the bank entered into a partnership with Amazon for an online sale where the transactions were double of what was originally envisaged. The bank has repositioned its annual ‘festive treats’ campaign, which was launched last year, as a platform for merchants to offer deals and for the customer to avail financing during the October-December festival quarter. Speaking to TOI, country head (payments business, consumer finance and digital marketing) Parag Rao said transactions have already hit 90% of the pre-Covid level. “While the volumes may appear lower than pre-Covid, the usage has increased substantially. The pre-Covid numbers include the use of credit cards for airline tickets, travel, hospitality, and dining which were a large part of card spends. These will take some more months to come back,” he said. Announcing the launch of Festive Treats 2.0, HDFC Bank MD & CEO Aditya Puri said that it was the bank’s way of trying to change the atmosphere of fear and getting people to move on and to live with Covid. “Everyone wants to see a turnaround. Everyone wants to see optimism,” said Puri. He added that the bank has tied up with Samsung, Apple, Reliance, Tata, and numerous other manufacturers and thousands of local merchants who will be on-boarded on to the bank’s SmartBuy platform. “We are looking at connecting the best merchants with our 50 million customers so that both can benefit. This year, notwithstanding Covid, we decided that the festive treat should be bigger as it is not a marketing campaign but a platform,” said Rao. HDFC Bank has also tied up with retail brands to offer discounts, cashbacks, and extra reward points on both in-store and online purchases. Online majors such as Amazon, TataCliq, Myntra, Pepperfry, Swiggy and Grofers will offer special deals during this time. Leading retail and consumer brands like Lifestyle, Bata, Monte Carlo. Vijay Sales, Kohinoor, GRT and ORRA are a few big names that will offer between 5% and 15% cashbacks on various products and services.

Shoppers can avail of a cashback of up to 22.5% and convert their purchases into a no-extra-cost EMI on leading brands such as Samsung, LG, Sony, Godrej and Panasonic. The bank is also offering 50% off on the processing fees on auto loans, personal loans, and business growth loans and zero processing fees on two-wheeler loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-to-push-credit-card-spends/articleshow/78415249.cms||Mayur Shetty

That includes both fuel option as well as segment options. “Tippers are doing better with mining and construction picking up, e-commerce will pick up as the festive season comes closer and fuel bowser (mobile fuel stations) is a new segment that is doing well. We are focussing on all these segments,” said Vinod Aggarwal, MD & CEO, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles. DICV for its part is both expanding its network as well as pushing for efficiency through digital interfaces with customers. The company has already grown its dealer count by 10% in 2020 and will cross 250 outlets by the year-end. The company has also launched its pre-used truck retail —BharatBenz Exchange and expects to add 10% customers to its new truck business through the exchange programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/truck-cos-look-beyond-capex-cuts-to-tide-over-crisis/articleshow/78414015.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Airlines cancel flights in face of state silence on curb relaxation||Kolkata: With the state maintaining silence over lifting the restrictions on flights from six cities, airlines began cancelling services scheduled on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday in the first week of October. While IndiGo has scheduled some departures from Delhi and Chennai late on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday — so that they arrive post-midnight and don’t violate the state’s curbs — other airlines have had to cancel flights and work out alternative arrangements for passengers. Mumbai-based entrepreneur Suman Sen, who was booked on an October 1 Vistara flight to Kolkata received a text late on Tuesday alerting him about the cancellation. “I had called up the airline customer care number earlier in the day, but they had no clue about the cancellation then. But later in the evening, they sent me a text saying Thursday’s flight was cancelled. They rescheduled me on a flight on Friday afternoon, which will leave Mumbai at 3.30pm and reach Kolkata at 6.10pm,” said Sen, a resident of Salt Lake. TOI had written on Monday that all airlines had opened bookings on all days in October in anticipation that the state may relax the three-days-a-week restriction on direct flights from six cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Pune. But they were forced to change their plans after being asked by the Kolkata airport to continue operating flights only three days a week from these cities in absence of a fresh notification from either the state or the civil aviation ministry. The state had announced an embargo on direct flights from the six cities to Kolkata in the beginning of July. After two months, the curbs were partially relaxed with flights being allowed to operate thrice a week. The travel trade fraternity had also written to the state, requesting lifting of the curbs on flights from October 1 in view of the festive season when travel to and from Kolkata usually sees a spurt. But sources said they were told that there was no plan to lift the curbs just yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airlines-cancel-flights-in-face-of-state-silence-on-curb-relaxation/articleshow/78415588.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Cop nod for cyclists on city roads likely till Puja||Kolkata: Traffic police have decided to extend the exemptions provided to bicyclists to ride on city roads till at least the Durga Puja festive season. The last deadline expired on Wednesday and the cycle rules are likely to be extended for the fourth time ever since the pandemic broke out and travel on crowded public transport became a matter of concern. The top brass said there were two primary reasons behind their decision: one, the public transport system is yet to normlaize with local trains still being suspended and two, this being the Puja month, more people might use their cycles to ensure social distancing on crowded roads. DC (traffic) Rupesh Kumar declined to comment but sources indicated a final decision on cycle policy was expected in 24 hours. An officer from the traffic wing said, “Besides places in North 24 Parganas and Howrah, a sizeable number of people from Maheshtala commute by cycling as local trains are not plying.” But some other officers want fewer relaxations for cycles in the south, a large part of which is covered by the Metro, than north and central Kolkata, where people have to depend more on trains. Police have drawn up an elaborate plan for cyclists this Puja. A source said during meets with Puja organizers, police might ask some of them to demarcate a space for parking cycles. The KMC, said the source, had started on patchwork on inside roads to make it easier for cyclists. “It is only natural that we would promote the eco-friendly cycle, which helps maintain physical distancing. This time, most pandal-hoppers are likely to stick to nearby Pujas and many might use cycles,” said an officer from the Jadavpur traffic guard. Lalbazar has instructed police stations to take cycle thefts seriously after several cases were reported. While Bhowanipore police station has recovered a stolen cycle, Tangra cops registered an FIR on Tuesday. “A complaint was filed by Sukhen Koley from New Town, saying his new cycle worth Rs 13,000 was stolen from Rani Rashmoni Garden Lane on September 26,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-nod-for-cyclists-on-city-roads-likely-till-puja/articleshow/78415891.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government announces 25% school fee cut||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Wednesday directed all private schools to cut annual school fees by 25% for the 2020-2021 academic year. The move will benefit more than 30 lakh parents of school-going children at 20,000 schools who have been hit by the economic slowdown caused by the Covid pandemic and the lockdown. The decision was taken at the state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani on Wednesday, keeping in view the representations of parents of students at private schools in the state affiliated to the GSHSEB, CBSE and ICSE and other boards. Gujarat education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said school owners have agreed to collect 25% less fees from students for the current academic year. Parents who have already paid the entire year’s fees are entitled to a refund, the minister said. Chudasama also said that since schools are not functioning physically, they cannot collect charges relating to transport, libraries, computers or sports activities. “We had proposed that the state government reduce fees by 20% provided parents pay the fees for the last two quarters (i.e. from April-September 2020) by October 31. Those who pay the fees after the deadline would not get any relaxation in fees,” said Manan Choksi, president, Association Of Progressive Schools. Two weeks ago, the Gujarat high court had refused to intervene in the matter and told the state government to decide on school fee revision. While disposing of an application seeking the court’s intervention on the fee issue, the HC had said the government can take an “independent decision” under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, which are in force due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In August, the HC quashed a government order which prohibited private schools from collecting tuition fees till they reopen. The court had also asked the government to sit with representatives of private schools and find an amicable solution to the fee issue. The government approached the HC earlier this month, saying no solution was found as the apex school association was not ready to cut tuition fees by 25%, so the court should issue necessary directions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-announces-25-school-fee-cut/articleshow/78414798.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Patna||Bihar assembly elections: RJD raises voters’ insurance demand at EC meet||PATNA: At a meeting of representatives of various political parties with the Election Commission team headed by CEC Sunil Arora on Wednesday, RJD raised the demand for insurance of all voters and free treatment in case anyone gets infected with Covid-19 after coming to the polling booth, while JD (U) leaders requested for awareness regarding the use of postal ballot for elderly and disabled people. The BJP representatives demanded security forces in Dalit tolas, flag march in Vidhan Sabha areas a day before the election and investigation of women who come wearing a veil to vote. BJP state general secretary Janak Ram said, “We held discussions on various issues, but especially requested the EC to get veils of women removed to check their identity. BJP has also requested the EC to keep an eye on the movement of illegal substances via river route, which may be used to lure voters. We also demanded to seal the borders of the district and Vidhan Sabha region.” JD (U) working president Ashok Chaudhary said his party mainly raised four points. Giving the details, JD (U) minister Sanjay Jha said they asked for sensitization on the use of postal ballots, as many people in villages are not aware of its use. JD (U) also requested voter slip to be made available by DLOs three days ahead of the election. RJD state general secretary Chitranjan Gagan said they submitted a 19 point memorandum to the EC and most of their demands were keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic. “Apart from the health insurance of all voters, we have requested that in case any person gets infected during voting, then the government should bear the expense of the treatment. And apart from voter slips, all voters be provided with a mask. However, EC did not seem to be convinced over health insurance demand,” said Gagan, adding verbally they have asked EC to keep an eye on those officials who have personal relationships with politicians. RJD also discussed the security of polling agents, proper security of the strong rooms and arrangement of representatives of political parties near the strong room. Gagan was accompanied by RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha, MLA Shakti Singh Yadav and state general secretary Madan Sharma. Representatives of Congress submitted a nine-point memorandum. It requested the EC to ensure there is no favouritism in allotment of fields for meetings. Congress has requested for guidelines for the use of print, electronic and social media and action (without being partial) on those who violate the guidelines. LJP state office in charge, Rajendara Vishwakarma said his party had kept three demands- booths at panchayat level in Covid-19 pandemic, proper security and arrangement to take voters to the booth in North Bihar which is reeling under flood. Meanwhile, the ECI team headed by CEC also held a marathon meeting with DMs and SPs of 26 districts around 4pm. A state government source said the meeting is expected to continue till late Tuesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-raises-voters-insurance-demand-at-ec-meet/articleshow/78418650.cms||Sheezan Nezami
October 1, 2020||---||Upendra Kushwaha’s another close aide quits RLSP||PATNA: A day after forming a third front with BSP and Janwadi Party (Socialist), RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha received a major jot on Wednesday when his national secretary general Madhaw Anand resigned from the party. Anand took the decision after his meeting with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Tuesday night though he was with Kushwaha at the press conference earlier in the day. Two days back, RLSP state president Bhudeo Choudhary had joined RJD. Sources said even former MP Nagmani, who had quit RLSP in 2019, is also in touch with RJD. RLSP’s two MLAs and one MLC had already switched over to JD(U) led by CM Nitish Kumar. “Having been a primary member of RLSP for the last four years, it is now time for me to move on. I am rendering my resignation from the primary membership of RLSP. While my aim and purpose are always the same to serve the people of my state and country, I believe I am unable to do this anymore within this party,” read a part of his resignation letter addressed to Kushwaha. Anand also advised Kushwaha to renounce politics and continue with his teaching profession. Talking to TOI, Anand called RLSP ‘a one-man party’. He said many more members will soon quit RLSP, alleging the party boss has no respect for his party workers. “He just thinks of himself and can do anything to become an MP or set his own family members,” Anand said, recalling how his Lok Sabha ticket was cancelled in 2019. When asked if he will join RJD and contest the assembly election, he replied, “I have not taken any final decision as to which party I am joining. I am meeting my well-wishers and taking their suggestions.” However, he, like Tejashwi, talked about migration, unemployment and lack of industrialization in Bihar. Anand said he shares a cordial relation with Tejashwi and both are of the same age group and similar mindset. He even said his meeting with Tejashwi on Tuesday was nothing new. “Whenever I come to Patna, I meet him (Tejashwi),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/kushwahas-another-close-aide-quits-rlsp/articleshow/78413681.cms||Sheezan Nezami
October 1, 2020||Patna||Bihar polls: Parties switch to digital raths to woo rural voters||PATNA: Political parties are taking out ‘Digital Raths’ — vehicles equipped with the latest LED screens, hi-tech speakers and broadcast equipment — to take their virtual rallies to remotest corners of the state to woo rural voters. This hi-tech innovation has been necessitated by Election Commission’s curbs on rallies, roadshows and other modes of traditional electioneering to adhere to social distancing norms in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Devesh Kumar, state general secretary of BJP, told this newspaper on Wednesday that around 120-odd digital raths titled — ‘Jan Jan Ki Pukar Atmanirbhar Bihar’, which have been put into service to reach the voters. “About 20 raths have already reached designated places, the remaining would reach the spots in the next 2-3 days,” he said. “Through these raths, we are showing the people small clips on different sub-themes. It includes women’s empowerment, digital and road connectivity in Bihar, law and order among others that have been done by the NDA government under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar,” Devesh further said. JD(U) has hired 200-odd digital raths and two outdoor broadcasting (OB) vans for campaigning. All raths will carry the slogan ‘Pura Bihar, Hamara Parivar’. An official of the JD(U) media cell said each assembly seat will have at least one rath. “Small audio clips and visual would be shown on these screens to woo the voters. While the outdoor broadcasting vans would only show the live streaming of speeches of senior leaders,” the official said. The Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S), which recently joined NDA, has booked 50 digital raths with the theme- ‘15 Saal Ke Jungle- Raj, Banaam 15 Saal ka Sushasan’. Congress spokesperson Madhav Anand said the party's national team is making plans for digital campaigns for the elections. “We would hire digital vans, depending on the seats the party gets. We are already using social media platforms, radio and will use digital raths to reach voters,” he said. The Congress digital vans will have the theme ‘Bole Bihar, Badle Sarkar’. It will show the party’s manifesto, speeches of party leaders and issues such as unemployment. RJD’s digital rath will be on the theme ‘Nayi Soch Naya Bihar, Yuva Sarkar Abki Baar’. Chitranjan Gagan, general secretary of RJD, said, “The party has yet to decide about the number of digital vans, which is going to be hired for the elections. We are in talks for the supply of these vans but a final decision would be taken after seat-sharing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/parties-switch-to-digital-raths-to-woo-rural-voters/articleshow/78418818.cms||Faryal Rumi

The stolen books include a few first edition novels written by Renu and carrying his own autograph. Renu’s daughter Navnita Sinha (78) told TOI over phone on Wednesday that amid stolen items were the first edition of his noted novels Maila Anchal, Thumri, Kitne Chaurahe and Kagaz ki Nav having her father’s autograph. “Among the stolen novels, 10 were written by my father and rest by Munshi Premchand, Nagarjuna and others,” she said, adding people often visit the flat to see her father’s items. The septuagenarian said she doesn’t remember the details of every book kept by her in the flat several decades ago. She said her father’s half jacket (bundi) was also stolen from the almirah along with some daily use utensils from the kitchen and even a defunct handpump. Sinha said her father lived in the flat located on the second floor of the building constructed by the government for several years till his death. “It was constructed in early 1970s,” said Sinha, who lives in a rented accommodation at a walking distance from the place. “Our relatives lived in the flat. It was locked after he went to his village on September 14. One family living on the first floor informed us in the morning that the door latch of my father’s flat was uprooted,” she said, adding her son Prashant Kumar submitted a written complaint to the police in this connection. City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari and Kadamkuan police station SHO Nishikant Nishi visited the spot and investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/renus-autographed-novels-stolen-from-flat/articleshow/78413006.cms||Debashish Karmakar
October 1, 2020||Business||Shareholders vote out Dhanlaxmi Bank CEO||MUMBAI: Shareholders of Thrissur-based Dhanlaxmi Bank have voted out the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-approved MD & CEO Sunil Gurbaxani at its annual general meeting on Wednesday. A filing by the bank said that 90.5% of the shareholders voted against the appointment. The shareholders’ action will pose a fresh dilemma for the central bank, which is still dealing with a leadership crisis at Lakshmi Vilas Bank where the RBI-approved CEO S Sundar was voted out last week. In the meeting, Dhanlaxmi Bank shareholders approved the appointment of C K Gopinathan, G Subramonia Iyer, Suseela Menon, G Rajagopalan Nair, and P K Vijayakumar as directors. They also cleared the appointment of an auditor and an increase in the authorised capital of the bank. However, only 9.5% of shareholders voted in favour of the CEO. The shareholders — who have a widely distributed holding, include foreign portfolio investors (11%), individuals and trusts — had clashed with the management over plans to diversify. Dhanlaxmi Bank also has a strong union presence, which has opposed the management plans to ‘modernise’ and to open more branches in the northern states. On Tuesday, the bank had informed the stock exchanges that the RBI had appointed its general manager at Bengaluru D K Kashyap as an additional director. The largest individual shareholders are B Ravindran Pillai, a Middle East-based billionaire who heads the RP Group and has a 10% stake in the bank. Director C K Gopinathan is the second-largest individual shareholder with a 7.5% shareholding. UAE billionaire, Lulu Group MD M A Yusuff Ali, and DHFL Group’s Kapil Wadhawan both hold 5% each. Dhanlaxmi Bank’s board appointed Gurbaxani as the MD & CEO for three years effective from February 27, 2020 after receiving a clearance from the RBI. Gurbaxani replaced T Latha, who resigned on October 30 last year due to personal reasons. The 93-year-old bank has a long-standing relationship with a large number of temple trusts in southern India, which has given it a strong deposit base. Nearly 60% of the bank’s branches are in Kerala with a major presence in Tamil Nadu. The bank was earlier under the RBI’s prompt corrective action framework, but was removed in February 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shareholders-vote-out-dhanlaxmi-bank-ceo/articleshow/78415429.cms||---

Deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil inaugurated the facility on Wednesday, The paucity of oxygen is among the major obstacles in ensuring critical care for Covid-19 patients. The district hospital in Dharwad is one of the few government healthcare institutions to be equipped with a centralised oxygen plant. There have been repeated complaints from patients about the non-availability of oxygen at the hospital, a cause of some embarrassment to the management and government. Dharwad district surgeon Dr Shivakumar Manakar, who participated in the inaugural ceremony of the oxygen plant, said that the hospital used up to 100 jumbo oxygen cylinders for patients in the Covid-19 ward. “We had to run three trips daily to haul these cylinders from a private agency in Sattur. The oxygen plant will end this problem. We will now have sufficient oxygen at the hospital,” Dr Manakar told TOI. He said that, of the 125 beds at the district hospital, 80 were reserved for Covid-19 patients, while there were 25 in the intensive care unit (ICU). “If the oxygen at the centralised plant is completely filled, we will be able to supply oxygen to patients for five to six days without any interruption,” said Dr Manakar. The hospital has treated around 450 patients who were infected with Covid-19 till date. Dr Manakar said that, although they were doing all that they could to ensure the best possible treatment to those with Covid-19, there were instances of a few people being shifted to Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences in Hubballi. Dr Manakar said that the agency that bagged the tender to set up the plant had managed to install the unit in a month’s time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dist-hospital-gets-a-6k-centralised-oxygen-plant/articleshow/78415201.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||AI extends direct services from Kolkata to London till year end||KOLKATA: The twice-a-week direct flights between Kolkata and London that Air India (AI) had introduced on September 16 will now operate till December 31. The airline announced the extension from October 24 to the end of the year in the early hours of Wednesday. While the present service is part of the civil aviation ministry’s Vande Bharat Mission to primarily repatriate Indians living in the UK or facilitate Indians with valid visa documents to travel to the UK for work, study or to visit people, the subsequent flights will be regular AI services according to the air-bubble agreement between the two countries. The development came as a pleasant surprise for flyers and the travel trade industry. NRIs from Kolkata settled in the UK, as well as their relatives living here, welcomed the move. Anvaya Ganguly, an IT professional originally from Bagbazar who now resides in Solihull in the UK, said the decision to extend the flights till the end of the year will enable many to fly home to visit family and friends in Kolkata during the Puja. “In these gloomy Covid times, this news has brought cheer. I just hope the flight gets a further extension and becomes a permanent connection between Kolkata and Europe,” said Ganguly. Travel agents said the move will help stabilize the flight that has recorded poor economy-class occupancy till now. “Now that flights have been announced over the next three months, it will do well. The initial confusion over whether the flight will be direct or via another city has been resolved. All travel agents will extend their full support to the flight to ensure that the load improves and there is a case for AI to retain the flight beyond December 31,” said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. The AI flight has reconnected Kolkata with London after a gap of 11 years. It is also the first direct service to Europe since Lufthansa withdrew its service to Frankfurt eight years ago. In the absence of any European carriers, Kolkatans have had to either take a Gulf carrier with a stop-over at Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Doha, or take flights out of Delhi or Mumbai. Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi believes the extension will give people the confidence to travel to the UK during the Durga Puja-Diwali holiday or before Christmas. “This is the first time in two decades that we expect more people to travel to London than South-East Asia. Since the UK is issuing all categories of visa, we expect people who have been cooped up at home and are desperate to travel to jump at the opportunity, particularly when the airfare is reasonable and hotel rates are low,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-extends-direct-services-to-london-till-year-end/articleshow/78415542.cms||Subhro Niyogi
October 1, 2020||Business||Google notices to Swiggy, Zomato||BENGALURU: Search engine giant Google has sent notices to online food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato for gamification and promotions related to IPL matches, which led to the offers being taken down. Both the apps were running gamification-related cashback and discount promos since the cricket league began earlier this month in an attempt to revive consumer demand, which has been hit due to the pandemic. Both Zomato and Swiggy have taken down the schemes now. “We have received a notice from Google. We believe that the notice is unfair, but we are a small company and have already realigned our business strategy to comply with Google’s guidelines. We will be replacing Zomato Premier League with a more exciting programme by this weekend,” a Zomato spokesperson said. Swiggy declined to comment when contacted by TOI. The development comes after Google took down mobile payments platform Paytm earlier this month for promoting its fantasy gaming unit and running IPL-related cashback offers. Earlier this week, Google also said it will start charging 30% fees for subscription of services like education technology, fitness and content — which has also led to startups questioning Google’s monopolistic hold on the Indian smartphone market through its Android operating system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/google-notices-to-swiggy-zomato/articleshow/78414694.cms||---

After the raids, it was found that some 12 units in Ahmedabad, Anand, Surat, Surendranagar, Rajkot and Vapi, were operating without a CTE (Consent to Establish), and CCA (Consolidated Consent and Authorization) – which is a consent to operate and is supposed to be obtained from the GPCB before starting operations. Sources also revealed that some 8 of 10 units in raided in Ahmedabad were sealed. These were located in Danilimda, Ellisbridge, Vatva and Naroda. According to state commercial tax department officials, some 60 units were raided. Of these, 20 were found to be non-operational despite having obtained a licence for manufacturing biodiesel. That apart, six were found to be shut down. “The sole aim of conducting this exercise is to ensure that biodiesel is manufactured and the quality standards are maintained so that pollution can be reduced and safety of vehicles ensured,” said a senior official of the department. Representatives of Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA) have made a slew of representations before the state government seeking action against the sale of duplicate biodiesel. In fact, the association members boycotted the purchase of fuel from oil companies for a day, as a mark of protest towards the government’s alleged inaction in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gpcb-gst-dept-raid-manufacturers-of-duplicate-biodiesel/articleshow/78414830.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Delhi||Unlock 5.0: Status quo in Delhi ‘till further orders’||New Delhi: A status quo will be maintained in the capital with regard to further relaxations under Unlock 5.0 till October 31 or until further orders. This order was passed by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday, a day after the Centre allowed opening of multiplexes with 50% capacity, swimming pools, schools and entertainment parks from October 15. States and Union Territories have the final say in this regard. A decision on the relaxations would be taken by DDMA before October 15 after reviewing the Covid-19 situation. Under Unlock 5.0, now two weekly markets can be organised in each zone daily instead of one earlier. As of now, 24 weekly markets have been permitted in the city. Delhi government had requested lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, the DDMA chief, to allow all weekly markets to function, but the proposal was rejected, said sources. The order signed by chief secretary Vijay Dev, the chairman of DDMA’s state executive committee, stated, “The Covid-19 situation has been reviewed and it has been decided that status quo with respect to prohibited/permitted activities (including activities on trial basis) may be maintained in Delhi till October 31 or further orders.” “It has also been decided that opening of two weekly markets per day in each zone of all three municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board may be allowed instead of one,” the order added. A complete lockdown would be maintained in all containment zones. Directions were issued to district magistrates and other field authorities to ensure compliance to the DDMA order. While the Centre has allowed cultural, social, religious and similar functions with 200 participants after October 15, DDMA is yet to take a decision on the relaxations. A decision could be taken before mid-October. “A maximum of 50 people are allowed in marriages and 20 in funerals,” the DDMA order stated. Delhi government wants to permit all economic activities allowed by the Centre, except schools, colleges and educational institutes. Educational institutions would only be allowed to open if the government was satisfied about the safety of students. Delhi is among the most open cities in the country and malls, markets, hotels, gyms, yoga centres, serving of liquor in bars and dine-in services in restaurants have been allowed. If DDMA permits, almost all economic activities permitted by the Centre will resume.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlock-5-0-status-quo-in-delhi-till-further-orders/articleshow/78436112.cms||AlokKNMishra

The complaint was made by the father of one of the victims, Pradeep Dindol (Patel), accusing the contractor Mohammed Mahir Kabutarwala of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Pradeep’s father, Ramesh, told the police that Kabutarwala used construction material like sand, bricks, cement and iron rods of poor quality and in lesser quantity for constructing the building. He also alleged that no safety precautions were also taken regarding an underground water tank. Due to these poor practices, the building did not have proper strength and it tilted before collapsing completely, Ramesh told the cops. “There were some issues with underground water tank as we suspect that there were some leakages in it,” said a police official. “We have not interrogated the contractor yet as his Covid-19 test report is awaited, but once he is formally arrested we will get more information about the kind of material he had used and from where he had bought,” he added. Investigation also revealed that the building was being constructed for residential purpose. However, the owner of the building Mujfara Mohammed Ali Sheikh has not been made a co-accused. “Until the building’s construction is over and the possession is handed over to the owner, the safety is the contractor’s responsibility,” said inspector V S Kolcha of Panigate police station.

October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri Masjid demolition case: Deoband shocked, Zafaryab Jilani to move HC if CBI fails to appeal||AYODHYA/LUCKNOW/MUZAFFARNAGAR: The verdict in the Babri Masjid demolition case evoked varied reactions from Muslim litigants in the Ayodhya title suit, but both communities in the temple town took the judgment in their stride in their greater desire for peace and final closure. However, the judgment sparked off sharp reactions from Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband, which flagged its deep disappointment and Babri Masjid Action Committee convener Zafaryab Jilani suggesting he would move high court if CBI failed to appeal against the verdict. “The court’s observation that there was no sufficient evidence against accused is wrong. There was enough proof to convict all of them who were addressing and inciting the mob on that day,” said Jilani. Vice-chancellor of Deoband seminary Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani said, “The world witnessed the demolition. They also saw the faces who did it. Now, the verdict is shocking.” While Babri plaintiff Iqbal Ansari said, “Just like we have accepted the Supreme Court’s November 9 verdict, we will accept this too. This is the final closure of the Ayodhya episode, peace must prevail.” However, another litigant Haji Mahboob expressed disappointment. “I will appeal in the high court after consulting my lawyer. If everyone is acquitted, who demolished the mosque,” he asked. Athar Hussain, secretary, Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation constituted by Sunni Waqf Board, said, “In its Ayodhya verdict, Supreme Court said the Babri mosque demolition was a violation of law. Now, CBI court delivered its verdict, acquitting all accused. We abide this judgment too, but we hope prosecution will move a higher court to complete the due process of law.” All-India Muslim Personal Law Board said the verdict is “far from justice”. In a press statement, AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Mohd Wali Rahmani said, “The judgment is neither based on evidence nor is it in accordance with law. Though accused have been acquitted, videos and photos of the demolition were seen by many.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/deoband-shocked-jilani-to-move-hc-if-cbi-fails-to-appeal/articleshow/78416500.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Intermediate semesters start on digital mode||KOLKATA: Universities in Bengal have set the ball rolling for intermediate undergradute semester classes after education minister Partha Chatterjee instructed vice-chancellors to immediately begin lectures. For odd-semester students in UG (third and fifth) and PG (third) at Calcutta University, lessons have already started on the digital mode, while some institutes like, Presidency University, will begin classes from October 1. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT) will also start classes in October. Faculty members across universities are making arrangements to ensure final exams are held smoothly, without being hindered by semester classes. TimesViewCovid has left a huge gap in the academic calendar and both professors and students will be under a lot of pressure to bridge that. Curriculum setters, too, will be under pressure to effect drastic cuts in syllabus to keep to long-term timetables while knowing very well that that may leave huge gaps in learning. And, in all this, decision-makers must also keep one eye on the Covid situation. It is an extremely difficult situation but we must keep in mind that any rushed opening-up of classroom teaching may lead to an infection spike. That would be yet another setback that we cannot afford.In a notice on September 25, Presidency registrar Debajyoti Konar said departments beginning classes from October 1 might adopt alternative modes and methods “designed by the departments in an efficient and innovative manner to maintain social distancing and safety and health of students. One such effective mode may be distant-digital mode”. A faculty member at a north Kolkata CU college said for odd-semester classes, they were mostly mailing study materials that could be downloaded when internet was available. “Many of our students live in the northern fringes of the city, where internet is poor. Also, due to excessive data cost, many are finding it difficult to keep themselves up to date with the curriculum,” he said. Only a few CU colleges can offer interactive online classes. Lady Brabourne College principal Siuli Sarkar said, “We have been holding online classes for UG intermediate semesters since July. When the final-year exams begin from Thursday, teachers have been distributed their respective duties to ensure classes are held unhindered, along with tests.” At Jadavpur University, arts and science intermediate semester classes started from August 24 and engineering September 7. “We are holding online classes. But the timings have reduced from one hour to 40 minutes. The recording is uploaded online for students, who may have been disconnected, to access it later,” said teacher Partha Pratim Ray. Pointing out challenges, aVC said, “Without the syllabus being curtailed, universities beginning intermediate semesters late may have to rush through some topics.” Practical classes were another challenge. “Most universities have decided to carry on with theoretical section. As and when campuses reopen, practical classes and lab work may start,” he said. As JU and CU-affiliated colleges begin final-year/semester exams from Thursday, candidates have been told to have a talk with nearest cyber cafes so that in an emergency, they can visit thyere and upload the scanned or images of answer scripts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/intermediate-semesters-start-on-digital-mode/articleshow/78415867.cms||---
October 1, 2020||---||Social media users swamped with online ads ahead of polls||PATNA: With the assembly polls around the corner, viewership of news channels and other digital mediums has peaked as people are hooked to election news. While this trend has been beneficial for the news outlets in terms of increasing ad revenues, it also has an unwanted side-effect for social media users, who are flooded with unsolicited political advertisements. Social media users, especially the youth, are not happy with the plethora of advertisements bombarded on their feeds. “After every three organic posts, there is an unwanted advertisement on my feed on Instagram. It gets annoying after a while. I just hope I don’t start getting recorded phone calls from political parties like it happened in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” rued Boring Road resident Mishal Madhav. Another avid social media user, Urvita Singh of Gola Road said, “These days it has become impossible to watch an entire video on YouTube without two to three ads in between. Unfortunately, not everyone can afford to subscribe to the ad-free version of it and people have to live with unwarranted ads.” Talking about the preference of advertisers, including political parties, RK Chaudhary, manager of a leading ad agency in the city, said social media is a big favourite now with the clients. “Around 65% of my clients want to place their ads on social media channels because of its wider reach and ease of accessibility. Owing to the upcoming elections in the state, the share of ads on television and radios has also increased by 40% compared to last year,” he said. Affirming the emergence of social media as the preferred choice of placing election advertisements, JD(U)’s state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said while newspapers and magazines used to be the party’s preferred choice in earlier state elections, the trend has shifted this time. “We are giving equal importance to social, electronic and print media this time because of the pandemic. The presence and perception of political parties on social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram will play a vital role in the upcoming state elections,” Ranjan said. However, Anand Madhab, chairman of Research Department and Manifesto Committee, Bihar Congress claimed that even though the circulation of newspapers and magazines has drastically decreased due to Covid-19, they remain the most reliable and authentic source of news dissemination. “Even if one newspaper reaches every village, almost everyone will read it and some even read it repeatedly for many days. Print media has its importance in the advertisement space,” Madhab said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/social-media-users-swamped-with-online-ads-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/78413594.cms||Arunima Lal

October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Emergency med unit at airport to be managed by hosp next door||Kolkata: A superspecialty hospital less than 3km from Kolkata airport has taken over the management of the latter’s emergency medical unit. It has replaced a private hospital, 22km away, which had been operating the unit since the modernization of the airport in 2013. Charnock Hospital, the closest medical facility to the airport will take charge from Thursday and be responsible for 24x7 emergency treatment for flyers who fall ill mid-air or before and after taking a flight, along with emergency treatment for anyone meeting with any accident or falling ill on the airport premises. “We will mostly follow the airport protocols. Our team of doctors will be at service 24x7 to handle any emergency situation,” said Ipsita Kundu, the general manager of Charnock Hospital. Before Charnock, Medica Superspecialty Hospital had been in charge of the medical unit with eight doctors, paramedics and an ambulance kept outside the airport. However, post pandemic, with fewer flights in operation, sources said Medica didn’t wish to continue the service to save overhead expenses. While the airport doesn’t pay any fee to the hospital for the service, the hospital have to pay a fee to the airport in exchange for advertisement space. “The location of the hospital is important. Emergency patients cannot risk being taken to a hospital 22km away and since Charnock was the nearest facility, most critical patients were taken to Charnock Hospital anyway. Hence, when they applied to run the unit, they were the first choice,” said an air-port official. In the recent past, Charnock Hospital has handled some major emergency cases, like the mid-air child birth of a Thai woman in February, a flyer from Philippines who needed skull surgery in January and a pilot who suffered cardiac arrest mid-air but still managed to land the plane safely at the airport in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/emergency-med-unit-at-airport-to-be-managed-by-hosp-next-door/articleshow/78415617.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

If schools did not follow it, the state had the powers to cancel the no-objection certificate to defaulting school, he said, invoking a July 20 government circular. The court is hearing a PIL filed by Vineet Ruia, seeking concessions in fees during the pandemic. The case is being heard by Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya. Ninety-seven lawyers from 145 schools were present at the hearing. Schools were asked to submit their objections, if any, to the court by the next date of hearing on October 5. The judges said several schools had been heard already. “Three basic templates have evolved, without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the relevant schools,” the order said, referring to the three concession formulae, as suggested earlier by three groups of schools. The templates suggested that apart from general concessions, some case-basis concessions can be given, if parents apply, and easy instalments may be offered to pay arrears after the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-can-cancel-school-noc-over-fee-circular/articleshow/78415860.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

October 1, 2020||Business||General Atlantic to infuse Rs 3,675 crore in Reliance Retail||MUMBAI: American private equity fund General Atlantic has become the latest high-profile foreign investor to bankroll the retail unit of Reliance Industries (RIL), which could emerge as a formidable rival to Amazon as well as the Walmart-backed Flipkart in India’s booming e-commerce market. General Atlantic, an early investor in Airbnb and Uber, will put in Rs 3,675 crore for a stake of 0.8% of Reliance Retail Ventures, the RIL arm. The deal sets an enterprise value of Rs 4.3 lakh crore for the retail business of RIL, which is a tad higher than the value assigned by the unit’s previous two foreign investors — Silver Lake and KKR. This is General Atlantic’s second investment in an RIL subsidiary after it invested Rs 6,598 crore for a 1.3% stake of Jio Platforms in May. Like other private equity funds, General Atlantic has been scouring the globe for deals across a corporate landscape disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, Silver Lake agreed to put in an additional Rs 1,875 crore in RIL’s retail unit, taking its total investment in the Indian company to Rs 9,375 crore. Silver Lake’s fresh investment has valued Reliance Retail at Rs 4.3 lakh crore, similar to the value assigned by General Atlantic and higher than its previous investment in the Mumbai outfit. Silver Lake, also from the US, will now hold 2.1% in the retail unit as against the earlier 1.8%, thus becoming the largest foreign investor in RIL’s consumer arm. RIL has attracted Rs 18,550 crore of investment from three US funds by selling 5.2% in the retail business in September. The company, controlled by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, is also pursuing more deals in the retail business, which was founded in 2006. It is now the country’s largest (with 11,806 stores) and most profitable (Rs 5,448 crore) retailer. Ambani built the retail unit using cash from his core refining and petrochemical business, enticing customers with superior value and revered international labels. The share sales in the retail unit also pave the way for its initial public offering, expected to take place in the next few years. The unit launched its online grocery service, JioMart — powered by Jio Platforms’ technology — in May, and plans to broaden its portfolio to fashion and electronics in a bid to take on Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players. It plans to combine JioMart with its physical store network, besides enlisting millions of mom-and-pop stores as last-mile delivery agents as part of its ‘new commerce’ strategy. RIL would leverage General Atlantic’s “extensive expertise at the intersection of technology and consumer businesses” as “we create a disruptive new commerce platform”, said chairman Ambani, who, according to IIFL Wealth Hurun India list, has earned Rs 90 crore per hour since March, when India announced its first shutdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/general-atlantic-to-infuse-rs-3-7k-cr-in-reliance-retail/articleshow/78415519.cms||Reeba Zachariah
October 1, 2020||---||Bihar assembly elections: RJD raises voters’ insurance demand at EC meet||PATNA: At a meeting of representatives of various political parties with the Election Commission team headed by CEC Sunil Arora on Wednesday, RJD raised the demand for insurance of all voters and free treatment in case anyone gets infected with Covid-19 after coming to the polling booth, while JD (U) leaders requested for awareness regarding the use of postal ballot for elderly and disabled people. The BJP representatives demanded security forces in Dalit tolas, flag march in Vidhan Sabha areas a day before the election and investigation of women who come wearing a veil to vote. BJP state general secretary Janak Ram said, “We held discussions on various issues, but especially requested the EC to get veils of women removed to check their identity. BJP has also requested the EC to keep an eye on the movement of illegal substances via river route, which may be used to lure voters. We also demanded to seal the borders of the district and Vidhan Sabha region.” JD (U) working president Ashok Chaudhary said his party mainly raised four points. Giving the details, JD (U) minister Sanjay Jha said they asked for sensitization on the use of postal ballots, as many people in villages are not aware of its use. JD (U) also requested voter slip to be made available by DLOs three days ahead of the election. RJD state general secretary Chitranjan Gagan said they submitted a 19 point memorandum to the EC and most of their demands were keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic. “Apart from the health insurance of all voters, we have requested that in case any person gets infected during voting, then the government should bear the expense of the treatment. And apart from voter slips, all voters be provided with a mask. However, EC did not seem to be convinced over health insurance demand,” said Gagan, adding verbally they have asked EC to keep an eye on those officials who have personal relationships with politicians. RJD also discussed the security of polling agents, proper security of the strong rooms and arrangement of representatives of political parties near the strong room. Gagan was accompanied by RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha, MLA Shakti Singh Yadav and state general secretary Madan Sharma. Representatives of Congress submitted a nine-point memorandum. It requested the EC to ensure there is no favouritism in allotment of fields for meetings. Congress has requested for guidelines for the use of print, electronic and social media and action (without being partial) on those who violate the guidelines. LJP state office in charge, Rajendara Vishwakarma said his party had kept three demands- booths at panchayat level in Covid-19 pandemic, proper security and arrangement to take voters to the booth in North Bihar which is reeling under flood. Meanwhile, the ECI team headed by CEC also held a marathon meeting with DMs and SPs of 26 districts around 4pm. A state government source said the meeting is expected to continue till late Tuesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/rjd-raises-voters-insurance-demand-at-ec-meet/articleshow/78413123.cms||Sheezan Nezami

CPI(ML)’s national general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said the party has submitted to RJD a list of 30 constituencies out of which 20 must be given. Otherwise, the CPI(ML) will be forced to field its candidates separately, he said. Dipankar said his party initially asked for 30 seats and later came down to 20 selected seats, but could not reach a consensus with RJD. “They sometimes offer us 14 seats and sometimes 16. But the problem is the assembly segments which they are offering. We asked for Tarari, Agiaon, Jagdishpur, Sandesh, Ara, Darauli, Ziradei, Raghunathpur, Balrampur, Paliganj, Masaurhi, Phulwarisharif, Karakat, Obra, Arwal, Ghosi, Sikta, Bhore, Kurtha, Jehanabad, Hilsa, Islampur, Hayaghat, Varisnagar, Aurai, Gai Ghat, Benipatti, Sherghati, Dumraon and Chainpur seats. But, they are offering us seats where we do not have base,” Dipankar told TOI. “The ball is in RJD’s court. If they agree, well and good. Or else, we will move on,” he added. Congress still undecided: The seat-sharing issue with Congress also remained unresolved as senior Bihar Congress functionaries, including its state president Madan Mohan Jha, participated in a meeting of the national screening committee of the party in Delhi on Wednesday. “We have submitted to the party leadership the list of candidates to contest the elections. Now the party will take a final decision on it,” Jha told reporters in Delhi. Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh said the seats will be finalized in two to three days. On being asked the exit of RLSP and HAM (S), Singh said: “We are comfortable with even the current set of allies. Moreover, alliance trouble is more in the NDA.” Sources said Congress has demanded 75 seats while RJD is offering 56 seats with the Valmiki Nagar parliamentary constituency or 63 assembly seats without Valmiki Nagar seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/cpiml-to-rjd-give-20-seats-of-choice-or-will-contest-alone/articleshow/78413638.cms||Sheezan Nezami

October 1, 2020||Business||GAP, Arvind part ways as Covid hits fashion business||BENGALURU: Iconic US fashion brand GAP is breaking away from its India franchise partner Arvind Fashions, three sources aware of the matter said. This is one of the first casualties in fashion retail due to Covid and may lead to GAP’s exit from India or a significantly reduced presence here, the sources said. Arvind, which brought the San Francisco-based brand to India in 2014, confirmed the development. This is part of Arvind’s strategy to focus on select brands that are doing well and are profitable. Arvind Lifestyle Brands said it has appointed an investment bank to find a buyer for the GAP business. Sources said GAP’s presence in India will become virtually non-existent, though a select few niche boutique firms have expressed interest in the American brand. These talks have not been finalised yet. “GAP was also charging nearly double the royalty from Arvind than other foreign brands. In the current scenario with retail sales falling, premium brands like GAP won’t recover anytime soon,” a senior industry executive, who was aware of the terms, said. As the pandemic still forces a large section of organised workforce to work from home, apparel sales have been hit and premium brands are expected to be one of the last to recover. In the previous fiscal, GAP had a revenue of Rs 182 core with loss before tax of Rs 34 crore. For the current fiscal, losses were pegged at over Rs 50 crore. Arvind declined to comment on this year’s financials. “Due to the pandemic, Arvind Lifestyle Brands, a wholly owned subsidiary of Arvind Fashions and GAP have decided to mutually terminate their franchise business relationship in India. Due to circumstances after the pandemic, both companies agreed that a mutual termination was in both parties’ best interests,” an Arvind spokesperson said. Arvind did not comment on the fate of GAP stores in India and the impact on employees as part of the move. An email sent to GAP did not elicit any response. After midnight on Wednesday, Arvind informed the stock exchange that it is terminating the franchise deal with GAP. This comes when just last week another iconic US brand Harley Davidson decided to shut its India factory as it prepares to leave the market. “In terms of Arvind’s brands in India, Arrow, US Polo are some of the leading ones that are doing well and focus will be on five-six brands,” one of the people mentioned earlier added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gap-arvind-part-ways-as-covid-hits-fashion-biz/articleshow/78415551.cms||Digbijay Mishra
October 1, 2020||Business||Current account surplus nears record $20 billion in June quarter||MUMBAI: The country’s current account surplus jumped to an all-time high of $19.8 billion (3.9% of GDP) for the April-June period — the first quarter of FY21 — due to a collapse in imports. The first quarter of the previous year had seen a deficit of $15 billion (2.1% of GDP). The preceding January-March quarter had seen India’s first current account surplus in 13 years, partly because of slower imports from China due to the Covid outbreak there. Lower imports in the first quarter of FY21 resulted in the trade deficit narrowing to a 15-year low of $10 billion. Services surplus, led by IT exports, were almost steady at $20.5 billion despite a lockdown. Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, amounted to $18.2 billion — a decline of 9% from a year ago. A current account surplus, even though it is brought about by a decline in economic activity, is good from a macroeconomic standpoint as it reduces pressure on the rupee. However, the drop in imports are also a sign of weak domestic demand. Meanwhile, on the capital account front, there was a net outflow of $392 million in the June quarter ($14 billion the year-ago period) in foreign direct investment (FDI). Net foreign portfolio investment was $600 million as compared to $4.8 billion in Q1 of FY20 as net purchases in the equity market were offset by net sales in the debt segment. With repayments exceeding fresh disbursals, external commercial borrowings to India recorded a net outflow of $1.1 billion in Q1 of FY21, as against an inflow of $6 billion a year ago, the RBI said. As a result, the capital account surplus shrunk to $552 million (which was $28.6 billion a year ago) and the overall balance of payments surplus of $19.8 billion was largely supported by the current account. “Despite the economic challenges, India’s strong external balances remain a silver lining. Amid weakness in domestic demand, imports have fallen substantially, which has led to a dramatic improvement in the goods trade balance,” Barclays chief economist Rahul Bajoria said. FDIs are expected to rise in Q2 because of some big-ticket investments announced by Reliance Industries. “Going by the trends seen in July and August, we may expect a surplus to prevail in Q2 too, and with GDP poised to decline in this quarter once again, we can expect a current account surplus in the range of 2-3%,” CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/current-a/c-surplus-nears-record-20bn-in-june-qtr/articleshow/78415264.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Need policy change to save khadi: Arvind Mayaram||JAIPUR: We call khadi ‘freedom fabric’, Gandhiji’s gift to us and a symbol of self-reliance. But former Union finance secretary Arvind Mayaram says time has come to stop romanticising khadi and become practical so that a large number of artisans and weavers do not end up as construction workers in far off Delhi and Mumbai or MGNREGA workers. “We need to look at the development of handloom and khadi from an economic activity perspective. The cost charts prescribed by Khadi and Village Industries Commission are not in the interest of weavers as restricts their earnings whereas when they were introduced way back, they were the minimum an artisan should get,” said Mayaram at a webinar on khadi organised by FICCI-Rajasthan. On the contrary, Mayaram said, the sale price should be made free and the weavers should be given a share in the profit over and above the wages. “The entire value chain should be strengthened and institutions should make suitable interventions for creating products for all classes and at different value chains. It should not be confined to high fashion showrooms,” added Mayaram, who is also the economic advisor to the Rajasthan chief minister. He said institutions like Indian institute of Crafts and Design should provide inputs for making products at every value chain and buyers segment, not just high design fashion market. “We also need to redesign and refine hand tools so that it helps in enhancing productivity,” Mayaram added. Talking about the younger generation, he said they would not be interested in the sector if the occupation does not give them enough earning and dignity. Mayaram said, “The older people may continue to produce, but the younger generation will not take interest in the sector if there is not enough earning and dignity in it.” Dhiraj Srivastava, commissioner, Rajasthan Foundation, said khadi is symbol of our freedom struggle and relevant even today in terms of empowering villages and communities especially women and tribal populations. “There is no lack of interest and demand in handloom products, but we need to strengthen the entire value chain especially designing and marketing to unleash the real value and potential of the sector.” Lack of marketing and improvement in quality of fabrics are also areas of concern highlighted by Laila Tyabji, chairperson, Dastkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/need-policy-change-to-save-khadi/articleshow/78436090.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||TCS collection during pandemic not a wisw decision: Bizmen||LUDHIANA: Under a new step with regard to the business dealings which will come into effect from October 1, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has ordered collection of 0.1% tax collected at source (TCS) on sale of goods totalling more than Rs 50 lakh to one single buyer by the seller. The rule will be applicable on the firms whose turnover last year (from April 1, 2019, till March 31, 2020) is in excess of Rs 10 crore. The development has failed to amuse the city businessmen, who are of the opinion that the timing of imposing this tax is not appropriate and the government should have deferred this in the wake of the ongoing economic crisis caused by coronavirus. Meanwhile, giving more information about the new rule, city-based chartered accountant Ankur Gupta said, “The new provision of TCS will come into effect from October 1 and it is applicable only on the sale of goods. TCS is not applicable on every business, but only on those whose sale of goods last year (April 1, 2019, till March 31, 2020) was in excess of Rs 10 crore.” He added that, “Furthermore, these firms will not charge TCS on every transaction but only in the case where sales to one single buyer are in excess of Rs 50 lakh. The sales will be taken into account from April 1, 2020, and the day the limit of Rs 50 lakh sale gets breached, the seller will start charging TCS at the rate of 0.1%. After charging the TCS its responsibility of the seller to deposit it with the government and the buyer can claim the refund of it.” Speaking on the issue, Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “We do not have any problem with the government levying TCS on transactions of more than Rs 50 lakh with a single party because TCS is refundable. But the only problem is the timing of bringing this law as the government and the CBDT are aware that businesses are not running smoothly as of now and there is a large majority of the businessmen who are struggling hard to save their factories from permanent closure. The government should defer the TCS law at least till March 31, 2021, and let the industry come on track.” According to Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO), “We are shocked that on one side the central government projects itself to be the most industry friendly government, but on the other hand it introduces a law like TCS, which will make the working of businessmen more complex and again will lead to hassles like first depositing the tax then applying for refund. This law exposes the false claims of the government that it has brought revolutionary changes to make doing business easier. The government should have waited for sometime to implement this as this is going to impact the working of the industry as we will have to hire the services of tax professionals and update our softwares for performing the additional task of complying with the TCS.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tcs-collection-during-pandemic-not-a-wisw-decision-bizmen/articleshow/78413061.cms||Mohit Behl

ACB sleuths on Tuesday conducted searches at 13 places in Telangana to gather more evidence against Nagesh, currently in judicial remand at Chanchalguda prison for his role in the Rs 1.1 crore bribery case. “Searches have been conducted at the houses of people linked to Nagesh, including his relatives. We have information that he demanded and accepted parcels of land as bribe from the people who approached his office for various works and got the properties registered in the name of his family members and relatives,” an ACB official said. ACB sleuths were examining details gathered and also talking to some family members and relatives, suspected to be banamis to identify the properties. ACB is also examining a tahsildar of Medak district, who claimed that Nagesh had tried force him to indulge in corrupt practices. “There are allegations that some land parcels taken as bribe were assigned to people from marginalised communities. Information is that all the bribes taken in the form of land are in Medak district, where he has been posted,” an ACB official said.  As of now, one of Nagesh’s benamis, Jeevan Goud, has been arrested.

October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri demolition case verdict: Forget the past and move on, says Ram Temple Trust chief||AYODHYA: There wasn’t much of a ripple in Ayodhya among Hindus after the Babri demolition case verdict. Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, one of the accused in the case and chief of Ram Temple Trust, welcomed the CBI court verdict, saying no Hindu in the country is a conspirator. “The demolition of Babri Masjid was the result of aggression. The solution to the long-pending Ayodhya dispute has made both Hindus and Muslims happy. Lord Ram is everybody’s ancestor. His birthplace is now free. December 6, 1992, is recorded in history. We should forget the past and move on.” He added it was due to the blessings of Lord Ram and Sita that all the accused have been acquitted. Welcoming the judgment, VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said the demolition of Babri masjid was a reaction to incidents that happened on October 30 and November 2, 1990. The accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case were not conspirators, but political scapegoats, he said. “We are not organising any celebration, but it is a big relief for the accused,” he said, adding that the mistakes of the past were rectified. “It’s not about victory or loss, but the property that belonged to Hindus has been restored. Now, all sides are satisfied,” said Sharma. Another accused in the Babri demolition, Santosh Dubey, “We did not demolish any mosque. We have razed the sign of an attacker. We are not against Muslims or Islam, but we are for Lord Ram. Demolition of Babri Masjid was not a criminal act, it was 'dharm karya' (religious work). President of Lucknow Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee, Rajendra Singh Bagga, has welcomed the special CBI court verdict in Babri Masjid demolition case. “We are satisfied and welcome the verdict that has put an end to a long pending dispute. Every citizen of the country should also welcome the decision” Another member of the committee, Satpal Singh Meet, said that “The country has been waiting for this judgement since the past 28 years. Now when justice has been given, our focus should be on construction of the Ram Temple.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/forget-the-past-move-on-says-temple-trust-chief/articleshow/78416525.cms||Neha Shukla
October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||579 cases of stubble burning in Punjab||PATIALA: As many as 579 cases of stubble burning have been reported in Punjab — Amritsar and Tarn Taran recorded over 90% of these cases so far. The officials of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) have also imposed environmental compensation on 76 farmers for violating the norms by setting their crop residue on fire. The PPCB officials said the 76 farmers will have to pay a fine of Rs 2 lakh and the recoveries will be made soon. The officials revealed that around 400 cases of farm fires were recorded till Tuesday in Amritsar district alone, whereas in Tarn Taran, 100 cases of farm fires were recorded.

In 2019, around 55,210 fire incidents were recorded, 50,590 incidents were recorded in 2018 and 45,384 in 2017. Farmers were imposed environmental compensation of over Rs 72 lakh, of which more than Rs 5.5 lakh was recovered and 81,042 stubble burning incidents were recorded in 2016 during Kharif season and farmers were imposed fine over Rs 73 lakh. Similarly, the air quality has come down to moderate within a week while Asia’s iron and steel town Mandi Gobindgarh witnessed the lowest air quality index (AQI) in last one week after the stubble burning cases added to air pollution.

October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||IARI develops low cost technology for converting paddy stubble into compost||Chandigarh: The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) has come up with a low-cost solution to stop farmers from putting paddy stubble on fire, resulting not only in air pollution but also associated health risks aggravating Covid-19 cases. According to IARI, ‘pusa decomposer capsule’ will aid in fast decomposition of crop residue. Y V Singh, principal scientist of the IARI at Delhi, told TOI that their institute’s microbiology division has developed the low-cost technology and the farmers can purchase a kit of four pusa decomposer capsules for just Rs 20 — which is enough for one hectare land. “We have converted this technology into capsules last year. Initially, it was developed in liquid form but there was a problem in transportation,” he said. Though many farmers are approaching IARI individually to purchase capsules, state governments also need to take the initiative and adopt this technology at large scale, he added. The IARI team has demonstrated this technique in Delhi, Haryana and some parts of Punjab. The decomposition process to convert crop residue into compost takes not more than 20 days by using this technology, he said. Usually, it would take at least 45 days. He said the problem of paddy stubble burning started after farmers faced labour shortage and became dependent on combine harvesters. Stubble burning is not only causing pollution but at the same time it causes loss of soil nutrients and beneficial microbial enzymes further resulting in soil fertility degradation, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/iari-develops-low-cost-technology-for-converting-paddy-stubble-into-compost/articleshow/78415980.cms||---

As many as 490 camera traps will be fixed to monitor the animals. The exercise will be carried out continuously for 25 days. The personnel will also study indirect signs such as pugmarks and faeces.While the department ropes in volunteers and students in exercises such as the wildlife census that involves study of carnivores, large and small herbivores and also vegetation in the reserve, only forest personnel will be involved in the task this time, as it involves fixing camera traps and monitoring them, Pugalenthi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/phase-iv-of-tiger-census-to-begin-in-pollachi/articleshow/78415972.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||Review pay of doctors on contract, HC tells Himachal||Shimla: Terming the salary being paid to the doctors appointed on contract as ‘most disrespectful’, the Himachal Pradesh high court has directed the state government to review the same. Pointing out that even a regular Group-D employee, like sweeper, gets a salary of more than Rs 25,000, it said paying Rs 25,000 to a person holding a doctor's degree is most disrespectful. The court’s order came while hearing a petition regarding the shortage of staff in the primary health centres (PHCs) of the state. The division bench of Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy and Justice Anoop Chitkara observed that given the low remuneration, it is hardly a surprise that 124 posts of doctors are lying vacant in the PHCs across the state. Paying Rs 25,000 to a doctor appointed on contract basis and making him work at par with a regular doctor, who gets a handsome salary of one lakh rupees, is atrocious and in violation of Articles 14, 16(1) and 39(d) of the Constitution of India, the HC bench observed. During the hearing, it was submitted that the doctors appointed on contract basis are initially paid Rs 25,000 per month, along with other allowances, which comes to about Rs 45,000 a month. The judges further said when a person becomes a doctor, he has aspirations that he would get a suitable and respectable job or placement, but working for a meagre salary of Rs 25,000 is not encouraging at all and would lead to attrition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/review-pay-of-docs-on-contract-hc-tells-hp/articleshow/78415992.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Opposition misleading farmers on agriculture laws, alleges Piyush Goyal||JAIPUR: Union minister of commerce and industries Piyush Goyal on Thursday said a directionless and issueless opposition is trying to mislead farmers on the new agri laws. “The opposition is directionless and has no issue, so they are trying to mislead farmers. However, they cannot succeed beyond a limited area,” Goyal said at a press conference here. He was here as part of BJP’s offensive against the opposition to address the issues related to farm laws and hold discussions with various stakeholders. President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave assent to the three contentious bills — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020. Goyal claimed that empowering farmers has been the priority of the Narendra Modi government, which believes that if the farmer is empowered, the country will become stronger. He said that the Centre has been working tirelessly for six consecutive years to bring changes in the lives of farmers by increasing production and fetch right price for their produce. Goyal said the farmers have been bogged down for years and the Centre has taken transformative steps to ensure that the farmers get rid of them. “Now, the farmer is free to sell his products to anyone and anywhere. Neither have we abolished the mandis nor the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committee. While maintaining the system, the farmer can sell the product anywhere he wishes,” Goyal said. On the issue of minimum support price, Goyal said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, MSP payments to farmers in the last six years almost doubled compared to the tenure of the UPA government. Union ministers Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Kailash Chaudhary were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oppn-misleading-farmers-on-agri-laws-alleges-goyal/articleshow/78436146.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||District administration nod to land mutation of Sahnewal airport in AAI’s name||LUDHIANA: The Halwara airport project might get a boost as the district administration has ordered the mutation of land at Sahnewal airport in the name of the Airport Authority of India (AAI). The AAI officials had shared that the authority will have something to show as an asset before it spends hundreds of crores on Halwara International Airport. A senior officer of AAI in Ludhiana said that they got the letter of mutation of the Sahnewal airport land last week from the district administration, suggesting that more than 134 acres had been mutated in the name of the AAI. However, he added that they had not got the ‘fard’ (revenue document suggesting that land is in their name) from the revenue office. The officer said that till the time they don’t get the ‘fard’, how could they claim ownership of the land. He added that once they get the ownership of the land, the project would be expedited. “The estimated cost of the Halwara international airport project is around Rs 500 crore and involves setting up of terminals, boundary wall of the acquired land, etc. So, if we have to spend so much on the project, we need to show something as asset. As per the agreement with the state government, they need to transfer land at Sahnewal in AAI’s name and in June this year the state government had already issued a letter to the local administration to get the mutation done but we are yet to get the ‘fard’ of the same,” said the AAI officer. He added that project would get a boost if the local administration got them the ‘fard’ suggesting that land was owned by the AAI after which they would speed up the project. The officer said that the AAI also wanted that the project should start without further delay as they wanted to shift operations from Sahnewal airport to Halwara airport as the later had better facilities, including longer runway and landing at minimum visibility. The district administration confirmed that the land of Sahnewal airport had been mutated in the name of AAI. “We have already mutated the land in the name of AAI and the ownership is with them now. As far as ‘fard’ is concerned, they have to apply for the same and they would get it,” said deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma. He added that from their end there was no delay and they expect the project work to start soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dist-admn-nod-to-land-mutation-of-sahnewal-airport-in-aais-name/articleshow/78413087.cms||Shariq Majeed

The SCB may receive Rs 10 crore as the first instalment. State finance minister T Harish Rao on Wednesday assured the SCB members on Wednesday that they would receive the instalment. Though the state government had promised to clear the dues from July in eight instalments, it failed to do so due to the changed circumstances. “Due to several issues and the assembly sessions, the process of releasing the dues is still pending with the finance department. Now, as minister Harish Rao took the initiative, we are expecting funds in a week,” said SCB ward member J Maheswar Reddy, who led the delegation. “The minister had also said that he would release Rs 1 crore to construct a multi-purpose community hall at Sanjeevaiah Nagar from the schedule caste development fund.

October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri Masjid demolition case: Courtroom tense as judge spoke, Jai Sri Ram cries after acquittal||LUCKNOW: Heavy police presence and multiple levels of barricading that prevented almost anyone from reaching the high court premises in Lucknow’s Kaiserbagh set the backdrop for the pronouncement of the judgment in the Babri Masjid demolition case on Wednesday. Of the 32 accused, which included BJP stalwarts like Lal Krishna Advani and Uma Bharti, only 26 reached for the hearing with Advani, Bharti, MM Joshi and a few others recusing themselves from appearing personally. The accused were not allowed to bring their vehicles near the premises and had to walk to the building from the second level of barricades. With no supporters allowed near the court, the police kept itself busy keeping the media at bay, putting up multiple levels of barriers and ropes to ensure that those attending the hearing had an easy route to the court. The accused started trickling in around 9.15am with BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj the last one to arrive around 11.10am. Some came accompanied by the slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ as others, like Shiv Sainik Pawan Pandey, walked up to the media thumping chests and saying: “This is all for Ram Lalla”. Sadhvi Ritambhara, once the verdict was read out, said that there was never a doubt that they would be charged and added that they were confident even before the verdict was read out. The lawyer of the accused Manish Tripathi however said that the mood was tense in the courtroom before the verdict was read out but once court declared the judgement, there was a sense of jubilation among those in the courtroom. “As soon as special CBI judge Surendra Kumar Yadav read out the judgement, congratulatory messages were exchanged among those who were acquitted. Outside the courtroom, chants of Jai Shri Ram were also raised,” said a person present on the premises. Speaking to TOI, Brij Bhushan Singh, BJP MP from Kaiserganj, said: “Everyone present in the court was relaxed, as we all were expecting this outcome. The prosecution didn’t have evidence. This is a very welcome judgement.” As people slowly left, many of those acquitted hung out of their vehicles and waved at their supporters waiting outside the barricaded areas. The second the first few vehicles made their way out, shouts of Jai Shri Ram rent the air once again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/courtroom-tense-as-judge-spoke-jai-sri-ram-cries-after-acquittal/articleshow/78416544.cms||Neha Lalchandani
October 1, 2020||India||20% spike in city crimes last year, but heinous offences down: NCRB||NEW DELHI: Cases of rapes in Delhi saw a rise of 3% in 2019 while over registration of crimes in the capital witnessed a rise of around 20% in 2019 compared to 2018, a data released by National Crime Records Bureau shows. In 2019, 299475 crime incidents were registered against 2,49,012 incidents in the previous year. However, overall heinous crimes saw a decline in registration. Robberies, for example, dipped with 1,956 cases last year against 2,444 cases reported in 2018. This is a fall of around 20% but can be categorised as highest when compared nationally. In Delhi, the robbery rate -- number of crimes per 100,000 population -- in 2019 was 9.8 against the all-India rate of 2.3. Last year, 1,253 cases of rapes were registered compared to 1215 cases in 2018, a rise of 3%. However, molestations came down in 2019 with 2,355 registered cases against 2,705 in 2018. In 2019, five cases of murders with rape were reported in Delhi against three in 2018, the NCRB data shows. 456 cases of sexual harassment were reported in 2019 against 552 in 2018. The NCRB data also shows that registration of “crimes agar the state” witnessed a rise of 136% in 2019 compared to previous year. In 2018, 11 cases under this head were registered in Delhi whereas the figure jumped to 26 in 2019. Similarly, cases of corruption by public servants, which are registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act show a three-fold rise in 2019. In 2018, six cases were registered under this Act where as 18 cases were registered in 2019, a rise of 200%. The incidents of vehicle thefts dipped slightly with 46,215 cases reported in 2019 compared to 46,433 cases in 2018. However, the rate of this crime per lakh population was recorded at 231.8 in 2019 against 17.8 nationally. The murders saw a marginal rise with 521 cases being reported in 2019 against 513 in 2018. The data suggests that a big chunk of the overall registered crimes were those of thefts — 2,45,985 cases in 2019 against 1,95688 in 2018. The figures suggest that thefts constituted over 80% of the registered crimes. In 2018, a little over half the crimes pertained to thefts. The theft rate in Delhi was around 1,233 while the rate recorded nationally was merely around 50. Economic offences and cybercrimes showed a decline in 2019, NCRB data suggests. Crimes pertaining to economic offences saw a slight reduction of around 0.5% from 4,918 in 2018 to 4,889 in 2019. The maximum number of cases reported were of forgery and cheating, 4533 cases were reported last year. Also, registered cases of cybercrime saw a decline of around 35% from 189 in 2018 to 115 in 2019. In maximum number of cases, the motive of criminals was to dupe people, extort money and even revenge was seen as a reason. A total of 17 cases of online stalking of women were reported last year. Human and child trafficking cases reported a slight decline in 2019 with registration of 93 cases against 98 in 2018. In the 93 reported cases, 536 of the victims were below 18. In many of the cases, the victims were in groups. In 2019, Delhi reported one custodial death and the person was not on remand. The NCRB, which functions under the Union home ministry, is tasked with collecting and analysing crime data as defined by the Indian Penal Code and special and local laws in the country.

October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri Masjid demolition case: On verdict day, it’s business as usual in ‘sleepy’ Ayodhya||AYODHYA: When a CBI court was pronouncing verdict in Babri Masjid demolition case in Lucknow, it was business as usual 130 km away at ground zero. The temple town, on Wednesday, in fact was quieter than its sleepy self, barring of course when the town hosts pilgrims on special occasions. It was weekly closure at several local markers. Barring radio sets in few shops, that aired news about the Babri masjid demolition verdict, there was none talking about it. Though people were aware that the verdict in the 28-year old case was to be announced, it was not dictating their routine. “Yahan par kisi cheez ka koi prabhav nahin hai, na faisle ka na corona ka (There is no impact of anything here, neither the verdict nor Corona),” said shopkeeper Mohit Srivastava, at Hanumangarhi. The weekly closure made the streets of Ayodhya even more deserted. “Jo sannata aapko dikh raha hai woh faisle ke karan nahin hai, aaj saptahik bandi hai (the deserted look is not because of the verdict but weekly closure),” said medical store owner Bhaskar Verma at Naya Ghat. Ajay Kumar, a cop deployed in Ayodhya from Farrukhabad, said at least seven policemen were present at every crossing. At the house of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, an accused in the case who couldn’t travel to Lucknow due to ill health, there were 38 policemen present. There was heavy deployment of police and checking at all prominent locations and crossings. At RJB complex, the scene was no different. Metal detectors at VHP workshop screened every visitor though this did not deter people. “Like everyday, we are getting customers today as well,” said a shopkeeper outside Hanumangarhi temple. In Katra, a predominantly Muslim locality, people said they never waited for the verdict. “It is a very old matter. We do not even relate to it. To us, it sounds as an episode from a bygone area,” said 19-year-old Haroon. His friend sounded equally detached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-verdict-day-its-business-as-usual-in-sleepy-ayodhya/articleshow/78416557.cms||Neha Shukla
October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||Akalis, Congress lock horns over Jagraon bridge completion delay||LUDHIANA: After the completion of Jagraon bridge and its formal opening a war has started among the politicians on social media. While Akali leaders held the Congress responsible for the delay in the completion of the flyover, Congress leaders blamed the railways for the entire delay. The Youth Akali Dal district president, Gurdeep Gosha, went live on FB and told residents that at last the flyover had been thrown open to public by the MC. He claimed that initially the former mayor and Akali leader, Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria, had taken up this flyover matter with the state government, but then the government changed and Congress took at least two years to realise the need of constructing the flyover again. He said if NGOs and residents had not protested then it might have had taken a longer time to see completion. Gosha said Congress government could not fulfil one flyover in time whereas during their government many development projects were taken up. Meanwhile, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu put a message on her FB account and blamed the railways for the entire delay. She wrote, “I request everyone to restrain from using half-baked information about Jagraon bridge that is misguiding the public. We all know that the delay in completion of this project was due to the careless attitude of officials of the railways department, that falls under the Union government. So people should understand that the Jagraon bridge project was delayed due to the dilly-dallying attitude of the railways department.” She added that, “Ludhiana mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had written several letters to the railways department to complete this project on time. So, the people spreading lies regarding this project should act responsibly and stop misleading the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/akalis-cong-lock-horns-over-jagraon-bridge-completion-delay/articleshow/78413092.cms||---

Acharya Pankaj Sharma, principal of Maharshi Bharadwaj Ved Vidyalaya, Prayag, told TOI, “We have been connecting with Hindu families to promote Vedic gyan and vigyan and telling people about Vedas, Vedic culture and traditional education system.” We tell them the difference between old and current education systems and are promoting Gurukul parampara and laying stress that every child should know about Vedas, their importance and meaning in daily life, Sharma said. “Since we have started the campaign on social media, over 42,000 people have liked the page and are connecting to know more about Vedas and Vedang,” he added.

October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||Nodal officers to keep tab on crop residue burning||LUDHIANA: To prevent the crop residue burning during the kharif season, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the district administration has appointed nodal officers for paddy growing villages, where stubble was being traditionally burnt. Seeking wholehearted support and cooperation from the farmers, Ludhiana DC Varinder Kumar Sharma on Wednesday, appealed to them to refrain from burning paddy straw, which could further aggravate health issues of those people who were already suffering from several diseases. He further said that the state government had decided that there was a need to pull out all stops and fully involve administrative machinery for ‘on the ground’ activities at the village level. Therefore, nodal officers have been appointed for each village where the paddy is grown and its stubble is being burnt. The DC said that these nodal officers would perform their duties in the villages till November 15. The staff of cooperation, revenue, rural development and panchayats, agriculture, horticulture and soil conservation departments and Punjab Pollution Control Board, besides guardians of governance would coordinate further to intensify the efforts. He said that these officers had been assigned the task to ensure that harvester combines operate in the villages only with super SMS system properly installed on them. They would also prepare the list of owners who have given their land on contract and then call each land owner on phone to impress upon them to ensure that no paddy straw was burnt on their land, otherwise, the red entry shall be made in land records. These officers will also identify those farmers who are likely to burn paddy residue, to convince them against the practice. The DC stated that various sites had been identified/ earmarked in the district for collection of residues on common lands/cattle ponds and gaushalas, where farmers or any entrepreneur would be able to store paddy straw. Paddy has been grown in 27 lakh hectares of land in Punjab, which includes cultivation of basmati on 7 lakh hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/nodal-officers-to-keep-tab-on-crop-residue-burning/articleshow/78413107.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Vadodara||Dahod sees dip in cases after July peak||VADODARA: From a peak of 39 Covid-19 cases on a single day in July to new cases in single digits, Dahod district seems to have slowed down the spread of the viral infection significantly. The district, particularly the district headquarters Dahod town, had been reeling under the epidemic till September. The relaxation in lockdown guidelines had brought in bad news for the district as cases started spiraling. Officials were kept on their toes and many including the district development officer, the chief district health officer and district education officer, too, suffered from Covid-19. But September seems to have started slowing things down considerably with only one case being recorded on Monday and six on Tuesday. Officials, however, say that the lower numbers do not imply that the administration or people start taking things easily. “There have been days when we registered new cases in single digits. But these have not been continuous. We have been monitoring the situation very closely and discuss it daily night at 9pm with health officials, including those at the primary health centres,” said Dahod collector, Vijay Kharadi. Kharadi pointed out that around 200 persons very examined every day by health workers as a part of extensive contact tracing drives. “Even if a person who is in close contact with a positive case is not identified and moves around for two-three days without being traced, he can spread the disease widely,” he said. Apart from contact tracing, extensive door-to-door health survey drives have been taken up. Kharadi said that out of 55 Dhanvantari Arogya Raths in the district, 33 had been deployed in Dahod town. “Most of the cases were being reported from the town and it was important that we control the situation there,” said Kharadi. Kharadi added that even till a handful of cases were being reported, the administration will have to remain alert. “We will have to monitor the situation closely in the coming months,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dahod-sees-dip-in-cases-after-july-peak/articleshow/78412610.cms||Sachin Sharma

They started executing such crimes to meet their need for drugs. Mohit is already facing a trial in a snatching case of 2016. While talking about their modus operandi, Dhindsa said that the accused used to stand outside ATM kiosks. They used to carry a few non-functional debit cards with them. They used to observe people coming for cash withdrawal and would offer help to those who were unaware of the withdrawal process. On the pretext of helping them, the accused used to swap those debit cards with theirs. They also used to check the PIN while helping them. Then they used to withdraw money from their accounts. The DCP added that the accused were active in areas like Daba, Sahnewal, Subhash Nagar, Moti Nagar and Rahon road.

The fire brigade employees brought the workers out of the factory with the help of a ladder. It took almost two hours in controlling the situation. The fire officials claimed that the fire took place due to a short circuit in the electricity meter. Sub-fire officer Aatish Rai said, “We had received information about the fire in Bilal Enterprises adjoining a private bank in Sunder Nagar around 4.40pm. The fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The fire had started from the ground floor while labourers were on the first floor of the building. They were working unaware about the fire and the moment they came to know about the fire they started screaming.” He said the firemen on reaching the spot helped those workers to come out with the help of a ladder. Rai shared that he inspected the site after the fire came under control and said the incident happened due to a short circuit in a meter from where the fire reached inside of the building through wiring. He said fire reached the stock of jackets kept inside and it spread to ground floor. He claimed that with the help of eight fire tenders they could control the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/12-labourers-escape-unhurt-in-factory-fire/articleshow/78413127.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Chennai||Flyers in a fix as services to Europe cut last min||Chennai: The sudden cancellation of Lufthansa flights, after the directorate general of civil aviation refused permission for the airlines to operate its schedules in October agreed under ‘air bubble’, has hit several travellers from the city. Students joining universities and those returning to work are among those affected. As most of the universities reopen mid-October in Europe, students who had booked tickets for travel next week onwards have now been forced to shell out more to rebook their flight, repay quarantine fees and other expenses. There is no certainty if there will be enough options to fly out as fewer services are available. “Lufthansa had allowed 50kg baggage for students. Many preferred the airline because of easy onward connections from Frankfurt,” an airport official said. While Air France can an option, the airline will start flights only on October 26 from Chennai by when it may be too late for many. Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels said, “Rebooking and finding convenient schedules are not easy. Students had booked to travel to Ireland, Germany and France. A few were also scheduled to travel to Lithuania via Frankfurt. Most of them wanted to fly before October 10, in time for colleges reopening from October 12 to 15. People who wanted to travel for jobs are also stuck.” “Suspending the schedule after finalizing them creates further confusion as Air India cannot serve all the destinations either,” he added. Lufthansa was in good demand and people spent Rs 40,000 to Rs 55,000 on the tickets, said Basheer Ahmed of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI). “Some of the students had also taken pre-travel Covid-19 tests too. The airline will issue refunds but rescheduling the travel will be a hassle for students. They will not get the same baggage allowance with other airlines and will end up paying extra for excess baggage.” This has caused anxiety among parents and travellers, added Balan. The uncertainty triggered by the decision has affected the travellers who now hesitate to make advance booking, said Ahmed. About the move, DGCA has said, “there are restrictions on Indians desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage, resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa. As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. Despite this disparity, we offered to clear seven flights a week for Lufthansa, which they did not accept.” Nevertheless, irate passengers took to social media to criticize the DGCA for the sudden turn of events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/flyers-in-a-fix-as-services-to-europe-cut-last-min/articleshow/78414559.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Bareilly||Pilibhit: 25-year-old woman dragged to sugarcane field, assaulted||PILIBHIT: A 25-year-old woman was assaulted with a sharp-edged weapon by her husband and his two colleagues. The woman, who had been living at her parents’ home in Umaria village under Barkhera police station after she was thrown out from her husband’s home for dowry, was dragged to a sugarcane field at 1am on Wednesday. The police have lodged an FIR in the matter. The woman was initially admitted to Barkhera community health centre from where she was shifted to the government district hospital as her condition was critical. Later, she was referred to a higher medical facility. The woman married a resident of Pandaria village under Banda police station in Shahjahanpur three years ago. “My daughter was thrown out of the house by her husband who was demanding dowry. Since then, she had been staying with us,” woman’s father said. Barkhera SHO Kamal Singh Yadav said that two named and one unidentified accused, including the victim’s husband, have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to kill), 498A (subjecting a woman by husband or his relatives), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt of IPC and section 3,4 of dowry prohibition act) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/25-year-old-woman-dragged-to-sugarcane-field-assaulted/articleshow/78410969.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri masjid: Eyewitness priest’s deposition helped defence demolish conspiracy charge||LUCKNOW: The big win for the defence side in the nearly three-decade-old Babri masjid demolition case came through after it managed to bust the conspiracy theory put forward by CBI in court. The prosecution side, however, is planning to take up the case afresh with the central investigation agency and seek opinion on moving a higher court. Defence lawyer Vimal Srivastava said, the defence side successfully punched holes in the evidence put forth by CBI on the conspiracy angle in the demolition. Talking to TOI, Srivastava said, “CBI paraded the Ramjanmabhoomi chief priest as a witness, who said the mob demolished two domes, before preparing to pull down the third one, when he sneaked in and took out the Ram Lalla idols in the nick of time.” “The priest’s deposition enabled us to drive home the point that if there was a conspiracy, kar sevaks would have moved Ram Lalla idols to a secure place before pulling down the domes. How is it possible that accused were unaware of Ram Lalla idols at the site and were razing the structure,” he asked. Srivastava said, this proved either those demolishing the structure had no faith in Ram Lalla or were oblivious to the fact that idols were under the structure. Hence, they were outsiders who infiltrated the kar sevak ranks, he said. “CBI was thus unable to prove the association or alliance between Hindu leaders and those demolishing the disputed structure,” Srivastava said. The defence lawyer said, even the LIU report, approved by CBI, stated since December 1, 1992, local Muslim leaders were instigating youth to disturb the symbolic ‘kar seva’ scheduled for December 6. The LIU report stated there were instances of graves and shrines being desecrated by anti-social elements to disturb peace in Ayodhya, he said. “The matter did not pertain to kar sevaks and no FIR was lodged against them,” he said. He said, those on the dais at the Ram Katha Kunj began instructing RSS and VHP volunteers to identify miscreants and take them out of Ayodhya. “BJP leaders were trying to stop the demolition even as senior VHP leaders, including Ashok Singhal were manhandled by the mob,” he said. Prosecution lawyer Lalit Singh said, the next course of action would be taken by CBI’s legal cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/eyewitness-priests-deposition-helped-defence-demolish-conspiracy-charge/articleshow/78416597.cms||Pankaj Shah

For the admission in the academic session 2020-21, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) has been entrusted with the responsibility of Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB). MNNIT will conduct admissions for centrally funded institutions of north-eastern region including 31 National Institutes of Technology (NITs), 26 Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) and 29 Central Institutes. These admissions are to be undertaken based on the all-India rank of the candidate in JEE (Main) examination, informed MNNIT director Prof Rajeev Tripathi, who has been appointed the chairman of CSAB-2020 by the Ministry of Education (erstwhile MHRD). Admission to all undergraduate degree programmes of engineering and technology as well as architecture/planning in 31 NITs, IIEST-Shibpur, 26 IIITs and 29 GFTIs (NIT + system) of the country, will be done by Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA-2020) which consists of Joint Admission Board (JAB) for IITs and Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB) for NIT + system. A dedicated CSAB-2020 headquarters has been set up on the MNNIT-Allahabad campus with a team of institute officials bearing various responsibilities of counselling for the academic session 2020-21. The core committee of CSAB-2020 consists of representatives of MHRD, directors of NITs and IIITs. CSAB-2020 is closely working with NIC and JAB to make JoSAA counselling and admission process smooth, said Prof Tripathi. “These admissions will be based on the All India Rank of the candidate in JEE (Main) examination.

In compliance with the Ministry of Education’s order, CSAB-2020 will be responsible for fixing supernumerary seats for girls to ensure that percentage of girl students goes up to 20% in NITs and IIEST-Shibpur in this academic session. CSAB is also responsible for the implementation of 10% EWS reservation in NITs, IIEST-Shibpur and some participating GFTIs, he added. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, physical reporting for the counselling process has been eliminated. “Suitable changes have been incorporated in business rules in terms of online reporting, online document verification and online admission process, thereby keeping the safety of aspirants and stakeholders on priority. Due to the Covid crisis, this year, Ministry of Education has relaxed the criteria of minimum 75% or 65% (SC/ST) aggregate marks and above 20 percentile of class 12, so that maximum number of seats can be filled,” said Prof Tripathi. Seat allocation process this year will involve six rounds of seat allotment known as JoSAA rounds to be conducted by JoSAA-2020 for admission to IITs and NIT+ system from October 6 to November 9. This will be followed by two special rounds to be held by CSAB–2020 only for NIT+ system.

October 1, 2020||Kochi||Ramakrishnan alleges discrimination by academy||THRISSUR: Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy has courted controversy with its alleged decision to reject an application from dancer and actor RLV Ramakrishnan for presenting Mohiniyattam as part of the academy’s online cultural festival. According to Ramakrishnan, brother of late actor Kalabhavan Mani, the academy rejected his application saying that male artists cannot be allowed to present Mohiniyattam. Ramakrishnan said that Mohiniyattam was his principal discipline. He completed MA in Mohiniyattam with first rank and completed MPhil, and PhD. Prior to that, he completed diploma and post-diploma also in Mohiniyattam. He has been working as a temporary teacher for the last 12 years in Mohiniyattam section after qualifying in NET conducted by UGC. “The academy chairperson KPAC Lalitha informed me that its secretary Radhakrishnan Nair had told her that the academy will have to face a host of criticisms if male artists were permitted to perform Mohiniyattam, and that I would be allowed to participate if she was ready to own up the criticisms,” Ramakrishnan said. “The secretary’s discriminatory approach on the basis of gender and caste has pained me. Instead of giving an opportunity to a person like me from the SC community to perform Mohiniyattam, he has insulted me, and I am deeply disturbed by this,” Ramakrishnan added. He has sent memorandums to the chief minister and cultural affairs minister requesting them to take steps to permit male artists to perform Mohiniyattam. He has also demanded action against the academy secretary. When contacted, the academy secretary denied the allegations and said that the academy has not yet taken a decision to accept or reject applications to participate in the online arts festival. “The academy has so far scheduled only items like Thullal, Mizhavu, Chenda, and Kathakali for the online programmes. We have not taken any decision on the dance participants. It is the experts in each field, and not me, who select the artists,” he said. When asked about not meeting Ramakrishnan, Nair said, “I am 79, and have several health issues. I am not entertaining visitors to my office, as part of Covid-19 protocol.” Meanwhile, BJP’s SC Morcha activists, led by state president Shajumon Vattekkad took out a march to the academy office on Wednesday to protest against the alleged “discrimination against an artist from the scheduled caste community”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rlv-ramakrishnan-alleges-discrimination-by-sangeetha-nataka-academy/articleshow/78414599.cms||T Ramavarman

October 1, 2020||Delhi||DJB-corporation battle takes ‘taxing’ turn||NEW DELHI: The mayors of the three municipal corporations on Wednesday countered the claim of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman and AAP MLA Raghav Chadha that they owed the water utility Rs 2,595 crore by raising objections to the commercial rates imposed on schools, hospitals, polyclinics and other facilities. They added that, in such a scenario, even the corporations would be forced to levy property tax at commercial rates on Delhi government schools, offices, hospitals and other properties. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said soon action would be taken on outstanding property tax on various properties of Delhi government. “Delhi secretariat, PWD, Delhi Transco and DJB never give property tax to the corporations. But now we will take action against them. While Raghav Chadha has asked us to pay water bills of Rs 2,466 crore, Delhi government has announced waivers till December. They have imposed commercial rates on 700 schools, six hospitals, 17 polyclinics and offices of the corporations, which provide free education and health facilities to poor citizens,” Prakash added. The mayor said, “The principal amount owed to DJB is Rs 261 crore, while the remaining Rs 2,173 crore is penalty and interest. DJB has not paid Rs 216 crore property tax and Rs 293 crore for road cutting to north corporation. Besides this, Delhi government has not given Rs 955.84 crore due for the first and second quarters this fiscal.” East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor Nirmal Jain claimed that Delhi government was destroying constitutional institutions. “Chadha says EDMC owes DJB Rs 49 crore, but he hasn’t mentioned Rs 176 crore the water utility needs to pay us,” he added. Anamika Mithilesh, SDMC mayor, said, “Delhi government owes Rs 10,000 crore as property tax for its buildings in our four zones.” Sources in AAP, however, stated that the mayors had released false figures. “While SDMC says Delhi government owes it Rs 10,000 crore, their total property tax collection last year was Rs 940 crore from around 12 lakh properties,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-corpn-battle-takes-taxing-turn/articleshow/78414588.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Chennai||HC stays granite mining auction in Dharmapuri||Chennai: The Madras high court on Wednesday restrained the state government from confirming the auction floated for mining black granite in Dharmapuri district. A division bench of Justice M M Sundresh and Justice R Hemalatha passed the interim order while hearing a plea moved by former DMK MP R Thamaraiselvan, which alleged that the auction was conducted without obtaining environment clearance from the Centre. The plea further said the government was permitting indiscriminate mining of minerals in the area, causing adverse impact to the environment. “The petitioner has made out a prima facie case. The state has also, before commencing the auction, failed to assess the environmental impact and whether such mining activity is even required,” the bench said. Opposing the plea, advocate-general Vijay Narayan said, “Neither the Environment Act nor the rules mandate obtaining prior environment clearance from the Centre before commencing auction.” The auction comes first followed by selection of the highest bidder. The bidder then submits a mining plan to the state government for approval, he said. After approval, the bidder obtains all necessary clearances, including environment clearance. Only after that is the mining lease is signed and mining commences, Vijay Narayan said. In the present case, the auction has been completed and sent to the government for approval, he added. Representing the petitioner, senior advocate R Viduthalai submitted that calling for such tender without prior environmental clearances is against the guidelines issued by the Centre under section 20A of The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957, and the ruling of the Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-stays-granite-mining-auction-in-dharmapuri/articleshow/78414642.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Delhi||NDMC idea: Ride a cycle, cock a snook at pandemic and traffic||NEW DELHI: At a time when physical and sports activities have been drastically curtailed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Delhi Municipal Council has initiated a move towards road safety and normalcy by organising cycling events in Lutyens’ Delhi. A guided tour called ‘Cycle 4 Change’ will be held over nine days from October 2 to 10 and will be open to everyone who brings their own cycles or rents one from the public bike sharing stations in NDMC areas. To be organised for three hours in the mornings and two in the evenings, the pilot event will cover six kilometres starting at Bikaner House at India Gate and reaching Jorbagh metro station via Lodhi Garden and the cycle plaza in the same colony. At least four public bike sharing stations fall on this route, including at Bikaner House and Lodhi Garden. E-scooters or motorcycles will not be allowed to participate. To ensure safety of the participants, NDMC is removing hindrances from the cycling corridor and also beautifying the stretch with road and wall artworks, for which it has engaged public art undertakers, St+Art India Foundation. St+Art is known for transforming Lodhi Colony into India's first open public art district by using the open walls and spaces as canvases. “We have used vibrant colours on a 400-metre stretch in Lodhi Garden that should energise participants,” said an artist working with the NGO. “Some university students will help us in creating the required designs.” An NDMC official added, “The use of the stretch connecting Lodhi Road and Amrita Shergil Marg by cyclist has declined for various reasons. For this event, we have got the 800-metre stretch repaired and checked the traffic lights to ensure cyclists can drive without worry. There will be marshals deployed during the specified timings to make sure walkers and cyclists are safe.” Besides the beautification, NDMC has paid special attention to marking the route corridor and making the roundabouts and roads intersections safer with the installation of safety devices. At least five such intersections or roundabouts will fall on the Cycle 4 Change corridor. “The roundabouts on Amrita Shergil Marg and Rajesh Pilot Marg have been demarcated for cyclists with cycle symbols and temporary/ permanent retro reflective markings,” revealed the official. “The safety of commuters and cyclists has been enhanced by putting up cones, bollards and speed calming strips. Similar arrangements will be made on Jorbagh Road and 2nd Avenue Road intersection.” The official requested the participants to remain in groups and follow other people for safety reasons. Each group will have 8-10 cyclists, with one person making use of a bicycle at a time. All Covid precautionary norms will be followed. The event aims to make city roads safer and convenient for the use for cyclists. Based on the success of this event, many more will be organised in other NDMC areas in the coming winter months, disclosed the NDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-idea-ride-a-cycle-cock-a-snook-at-pandemic-and-traffic/articleshow/78414647.cms||Vibha Sharma
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Lucknow: Dengue cases among kids up, parents asked to stay cautious||LUCKNOW: As if Covid-19 was not enough, dengue is out on the prowl in the city. According to information from the Lucknow chapter of UP Neonatology Foundation (UPNNF), pediatric OPDs in the city have witnessed a surge in the number of dengue positive children. The fact came to fore during the pre-conference workshops organizedahead of UPNNF’s annual state-level conference starting on Thursday. “About a third of children heading to us with fever these days eventually test positive to dengue,” organising secretary Dr Sanjay Niranjan said on Wednesday. Urging parents to stay cautious to the ills of dengue among growing children, he added: “extra care needs to be taken this year on account of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.” Dr Niranjan stated that dengue was coming up as a challenge for doctors too. “The early signs and symptoms are common and there have been occasions where the paediatrician contracted Covid-19 from a baby assuming it was dengue. One of them has also died in the line of duty. Therefore, prevention was the need of the hour,” he said. Talking about the annual conference, he said that all the continuing medical education lectures would be held online in wake of the pandemic.  But more than 300 pediatricians from across UP and neighbouring states would be attending the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dengue-cases-among-kids-up-parents-asked-to-stay-cautious/articleshow/78416626.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Pune||Pune: Epass rollback paves path for travel without hassles||PUNE: The city police on Monday said the epass system for inter-district travel would be discontinued after the midnight of August 31, following the Maharashtra government’s fresh unlock orders. Pune deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh told TOI, “As per the Unlock 4.0 guidelines, there will be no requirement for epass or any other permission for inter-district movement after 12am on August 31.” The web portal (www.punepolice.in) being used for epass would also be discontinued. The state government order on Monday said, “There shall be no restriction on inter-district movement of persons and goods, including those for cross land-border trade under treaties with the neighbouring countries.” The epass system came into effect after the lockdown began because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The new decision of the state government came as a huge relief to travellers. Girish Makhijani, owner of Hare Krishna Comfort Tours, told TOI, “We started getting WhatsApp forwards on Monday evening that the epass system was done away with. With epasses gone, people can now travel without hassles.” (With inputs from Joy Sengupta & Rujuta Parekh)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/epass-rollback-paves-path-for-travel-without-hassles/articleshow/77860869.cms||Neha Madaan
October 1, 2020||Coimbatore||Corpn to screen passengers at bus stands||Coimbatore: The city corporation is likely to start screening people arriving from other districts and states in buses and trains by this weekend for temperature and basic Covid-19 symptoms in an attempt to prevent them from infecting others in the district and spreading the virus. People with symptoms will be made to undergo Covid-19 testing. The drawback is that only people with fever or severe cold and cough would be detected, while asymptomatic patients would walk free and transmit the virus. City corporation commissioner Kumaravel Pandian confirmed that monitoring people coming from other states and districts at bus stands and railway stations was one of the strategies to control the virus spread. “We will write to the railways to start screening passengers. At Gandhipuram, Ukkadam, Singanallur and Mettupalayam Road bus stands, we will screen the passengers ourselves. For this purpose, two counters will be set up in each bus stand. We will ensure that nearly every passenger passes through the counters.” Meanwhile, two more trains from Chennai and Karaikal to Alappuzha and Ernakulam, respectively, would pass through the city from October 4. Civic body officials admitted that only a few passengers would have symptoms and just screening them for temperature might not be adequate. “We can ask people what other symptoms they have, but that might result in long queues during peak hours and create issues. On seeing our awareness boards, we hope people with other symptoms would divulge the same at the counter voluntarily,” the corporation head said. Another source said the screening desks at the bus stands would become operational by Friday. Already, passengers arriving at the city airport are tested for the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-to-screen-passengers-at-bus-stands/articleshow/78416062.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Aurangabad||Aurangabad cops asked to make list of drug peddlers||AURANGABAD: Police commissioner Nikhil Gupta has directed all police stations to compile a data of all city-based drug peddlers. The directives came after city police seized 1,500 nitrazepam tablets, a hypnotic drug, apart from MDMA and hasish on Tuesday. Authorities said that though the city police have data of tens of hundreds of criminals involved in property and body offences, this would be for the first time that a data on drug peddlers would be compiled. Gupta has ordered compiling of the data of drug peddlers along with those dealing in psychotropic, hypnotic substances and cough syrups. Even misuse of whiteners, thinners and vaporizers are on the rise in the city. “Two major cases in a single day indicate that drug peddling is rampant in Aurangabad. So, we have asked to profile each peddler in the city and prepare their records so that appropriate stringent action is taken,” Gupta said. Expressing concerns about youth, even minors readily falling prey to the trap of substance abuse, Gupta said that he is expecting parents as well as responsible citizens to come forward with whatever information they have about the sale, supply and consumption of such substances. “People have lot of information but they hesitate to come forward. I appeal to them to trust us and directly reach out to me about specific information, and it will be ensured that their trust is cemented,” Gupta said. Sources said that there are also instructions at the police station level to compile data of pharmacy stores that are reportedly selling cough syrups and other psychotropic and hypnotic drugs. “Once the data is compiled, the suspects would continuously remain on our close watch and action will be initiated as soon as they are found involved in sale, supply or consumption of these substances,” a deputy commissioner of police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-cops-asked-to-make-list-of-drug-peddlers/articleshow/78411991.cms||Mohammed Akhef
October 1, 2020||Kanpur||Kanpur to get oxygen park on Gandhi Jayanti||KANPUR: In a bid to increase the green cover in the city and check air pollution and climate change, 14,500 saplings are being planted at Jageshwar hospital in Kanpur South, and the ‘oxygen park’ will be dedicated to the public on October 2, the day of Gandhi Jayanti. Trees absorb harmful carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change. Trees also help conserve environment and ecosystem. Govindnagar corporator Navin Pandit told TOI, “More than 14,500 saplings are being planted in this hospital which is one of the biggest in Kanpur South. Kanpur Municipal Corporation is working on this park and plantation is going on. Saplings of various species, including peepal, banyan, fruit-bearing trees are being planted under a proper plan.” Trees also purify the air by absorbing pollutant gases like nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulphur dioxide and trapping little particulates, he said. Pandit appealed to people to plant trees to help increase the green cover in the city and ensure less polluted oxygen-rich air for breathing and good health. The ‘oxygen park’ would be dedicated to the citizens on October 2, the day of Gandhi Jayanti, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/city-to-get-oxygen-park-on-gandhi-jayanti/articleshow/78413788.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||UP becomes first state in India to conduct 1 crore Covid-19 tests||LUCKNOW: With 1.61 lakh tests in past 24 hours, UP became the first state in the country to be undertaking over 1 crore tests to screen coronavirus. As on Wednesday, the total number of tests conducted in UP stood at 1,00,98,896 as per official data released by the state medical education department. Of these, nearly 42% of tests were done through the RT-PCR method. UP’s share in the total tests conducted in the country now stands at 13.6%. Data from Indian Council of Medical Research stated that 7,41,96,729 Covid tests have been conducted in the country. Also, nearest contenders Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are several lakh tests away. “UP’s daily average over the past few days has been 1.5 lakh tests. The credit for the benchmark goes to public and private labs engaged in different levels of testing,” said Rajneesh Dube, additional chief secretary, medical education. Secretary to CM overseeing testing work, Alok Kumar said that the landmark of one crore tests was more than just numbers. “It includes the launch of pioneering activities like pool testing, accepting use of TB testing machines for Covid-19 tests and use of antigen kits for bulk testing as in case of students from Kota and migrant workers,” he said. Testing behind low case positivity: A key indicator of the pandemic situation was case positivity. According to WHO, a positivity rate of 3-12% is what health systems must eye. Also, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has asked states to try and keep positivity rate around 5%. Officials pointed out that UP’s positivity has never crossed the 6% mark, hovering around 5% in July, August and September when the state progressed fast towards peak. As on Wednesday, the Covid-19 positivity rate for UP stood at 4%. “Testing enabled our surveillance in several ways. RT PCR came handy in segregating positives from contacts while antigen tests helped in screening hidden cases from containment zones and vulnerable pockets. TrueNat and CBNAAT grossly aided in resuming non-Covid services,” said an officer in the state surveillance team. Active infections down, recovery rate up: Due to the strategy, UP’s active infections went down to 50,883 while the overall recovery rate went up to 85.8% on Wednesday. ACS health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that 4,271 fresh cases were reported in past 24 hours taking the total to 3.99 lakh, with 69 deaths taking the toll to 5,748. “The situation is slowly coming under control but this is the time for utmost caution to ensure that the virus doesn’t raise its head for the second time,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-becomes-first-state-in-india-to-conduct-1-crore-covid-19-tests/articleshow/78416652.cms||Shailvee Sharda

October 1, 2020||Aurangabad||Wildlife Week: Greens see red over lack of planning||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad forest division has allegedly not planned any awareness or promotion activities for the public during the Wildlife Week — to be observed from October 1 to October 7. ‘Let’s know, the lesser known: The fauna, flora and the practices’ is the theme of Wildlife Week this year for which other forest divisions in the state have taken proactive measures by organising the desired activities by keeping in mind the local connect. When contacted, assistant conservator of forest (wildlife) Rajendra Nale said the Wildlife Week is being celebrated in the shadow of Covid 19. “At the state-level, Maharashtra forest department has planned online activities on the theme of Wildlife Week. At our end, we have organised staff-training programme and planning to hold online lectures by experts, but the details are yet to be chalked out,” he said. Notably, even if restrictions are in place on public gatherings due to outbreak of Covid 19, other forest divisions have planned events through social media and cloud-based virtual meetings. Meanwhile, wildlife enthusiasts have flayed the local forest department authorities for failing to celebrate the Wildlife Week in letter and spirit. Waseem Quadri, a wildlife enthusiast, said holding such events shave deep thought behind it and therefore must be celebrated religiously. “The Wildlife Week aims at spreading public awareness and therefore it must be celebrated by involving public at large. Unlike Aurangabad forest division, other forest divisions have not cited any excuse and organised public events virtually to tide over the situation,” Quadri, who has his own YouTube chancel dedicated to wildlife, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wildlife-week-greens-see-red-over-lack-of-planning/articleshow/78412025.cms||Prasad Joshi

October 1, 2020||Delhi||In a first, DU plans another open day for admissions||NEW DELHI: Delhi University plans to conduct a round of open day for aspirants before college admissions begin. Unlike before, when open days would take place only at the time of registration, the university administration has decided to conduct the event after October 5, as this years’ admission process is completely online and doubts of students need to be cleared. Speaking to TOI, DU’s dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said that “we would be having an open house before admissions begin. We are planning an online webinar for all applicants to help them with the calculation of cutoff percentage, and other issues.” Bagai claimed that DU might not have much time in hand for multiple events, hence this would be a one-time opportunity for students to clear their doubts. While undergraduate admissions at DU are slated to begin with the release of the first cutoff from October 12, the varsity has also announced the date for the new academic session — November 18. The dean of admissions said that DU had also initiated the option for applicants to edit their forms from September 12 till October 5. “So the open house will most likely be held after that. We would be recording it and putting it on social media so that it becomes a guide for other students.” An official from the admission department said: “Most students will have doubts regarding their best-of-four subjects or what they should do when they do not have a certain subject and may have to tolerate a percentage cut in their best-of-four.” The official said that all doubts regarding document verification will also be clarified at the open day session next week.With an extended period given for the registration process, DU has witnessed application numbers shooting up to 3,53,919 — the highest ever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-a-first-du-plans-another-open-day-for-admissions/articleshow/78414650.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
October 1, 2020||Agra||In Hathras village, Dalit families say they live alone, eat alone||HATHRAS: The 19-year-old girl, who was allegedly gang raped and then brutally tortured before being killed by four upper caste men, had always kept to herself. The village she grew up in had contained within it two disparate worlds — one which she lived in, another in which upper caste communities did. “Breaching the barrier would never occur to us,” said a Dalit man. In the Hathras village where the girl lived and died, Dalit families are painfully aware of the lines they must not cross. “We eat by ourselves, talk among ourselves, live by ourselves. Unse koi lena-dena nahin hain (they have nothing to do with us),” a Dalit youth told TOI. The small village is home to 64 families. Only four are Valmikis, living in a tight cluster within a half-km radius of one another. They have marginal landholdings, own cattle and fall back on MGNREGA when money runs out. “We had to sell a buffalo when corona came,” a woman from one of the families said. On Wednesday, when TOI visited the village, the turmoil over the cremation of the gang-rape victim had given way to an uneasy silence. “We don’t have anything to say about the upper caste families. We don’t know anything,” said 50-year-old Kiran Devi. “They don’t acknowledge us. It’s as if we don’t exist,” the victim’s brother said. An eight-year-old ambled by. Does he go to school? The boy said he does but keeps away from the “other side” of the village. “Their children don’t play with us.” For years, Dalit children in the village were not sent to school. “We were afraid,” the brother said. “We are socially disconnected even though we live in the same village,” said Shilpa, a 14-year-old, who studies in Class VIII. “It is a fact that we don’t invite them into our houses," the village priest said. ''But we live with them in the village. Isn’t that enough?” The pradhan’s son, Ramkumar Singh, was dismissive: “Khaana-paani toh nahin karenge na unke saath (It’s not like we can eat or drink with them).” The last engagement with upper castes that the Dalit families remember is one 20 years ago, when the gang-rape victim’s grandfather had lodged a complaint against the family of two of the four men accused of raping her. One of them, Sandeep, lives right across the victim’s family. When asked about them by this correspondent, all the Dalitmen and women TOI was talking to walked away, silently. No one turned back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-hathras-village-dalit-families-say-they-live-alone-eat-alone/articleshow/78414665.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Dungarpur teacher discovers new butterfly species||UDAIPUR: Another cheerful news during the Big Butterfly Month — a campaign to celebrate the butterfly species across the nation. Spialia Zebra known as the Zebra Skipper, spotted in 2014 in Sagwara town of Dungarpur district, has been recognized as the 1328th species of butterflies in the country. A government school teacher Mukesh Panwar spotted the butterfly at a farmhouse on November 8, 2014. He clicked pictures of the butterfly and sent it for further study to the Butterfly Research Center at Bhimtal, Uttarakhand. After six years of intense research, the institute finally recognized it as the 1328th species found in India, on Tuesday. Panwar told TOI, "The butterfly is distinguished by the discal band on the underside hindwing being continuous with the outer spot, the inner spot being adjoined to the basal cell spot. On the underside, the hindwing discal band is straight and directed to the tornus. On the upper side, the basal cell spot is absent". In the Indian subcontinent, it is reported from the Margalla hills, the northern part of Punjab, Pakistan occupied Kashmir, Islamabad and south-eastern part of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. The habitat is dry xerophyte places and cultivated areas in lowlands or arid foothills. The butterfly is difficult to observe because it is quite small and flies rapidly low over the ground. According to Peter Smetacek, founder of the research centre, Spialia Zebra was described from 12 specimens taken at Chittar Pahar, Attock- a settlement in Pakistan in 1888. The city was then known as Campbellpore and the butterfly also finds mention in a book called Butterflies of Pakistan (2016). Panwar has special interests in lepidopterology and has been studying moths and butterflies for past 15 years.

While setting the context, Rakhee Badhwar, deputy director, CFAR, focused on the life-threatening challenges that the urban-poor communities were facing in view of the weak and inconsistent delivery of WASH services to their settlement. “The human cost of weak water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is very high and unless government, community and civil society come together to set model practices at the ward level, we cannot achieve much success, especially in the present pandemic,” she said.  Mobilising, facilitating and replicating socially inclusive WASH initiatives in India’s urban slums, supported by Water for Women Fund, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australian Government. In his inaugural address, Arun Garg, deputy commissioner, JMC, stated that the government’s primary focus is to help marginalised sections access water and sanitation services and an all-out effort is being made to make it happen. But at the end of the day, the government also realises, “If this effort has to succeed then they have to strengthen connect between the government and community so that the latter benefits from all the improvement.’’ Devraj Solanki, additional chief engineer, Public Health and Engineering Department, Jaipur, said, “Our efforts are in full swing, we are supplying water tankers to low lying areas, laying metallic pipeline to prevent contamination with dilapidated sewer lines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-focus-is-to-ensure-access-to-water-sanitation-to-marginalised/articleshow/78414663.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Goa||Pothole repair tender: Will Panaji civic body be third time lucky?||PANAJI: Despite having floated the tender twice, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has not yet been able to find potential bidders for its contract to fix potholed roads. “The tender was floated for the second time in August, just before Ganesh Chaturthi. However, no one has quoted yet. As a result, we will re-tender it for a third time. Further, we will request the selected contractor to complete the repair work soon,” Panaji mayor, Uday Madkaikar, said. Across Panaji, roads have been riddled with potholes putting motorists at risk – especially on the road leading from the Mala bridge to the Panaji Community Centre. In other parts of Panaji, some of the potholes are so deep, they almost resemble craters. “Roads in Panaji have turned into nothing less than a deathtrap. Riding my two-wheeler through the potholes, especially when it rains, is a great challenge during the peak hours. A slight misjudgment could lead to a tragedy,” a senior citizen and businessman from Panaji said. With the monsoon battering roads annually, authorities usually fix them before Ganesh Chaturthi, undertaking work on days when there are dry spells. This year, however, the increased amount of rainfall, combined with lack of migrant workers owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, has delayed repair works, leaving some them unattended till now..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pothole-repair-tender-will-panaji-civic-body-be-third-time-lucky/articleshow/78416073.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Aurangabad||Latur officials told to look into voter registration plaints||AURANGABAD: The general administration department of Aurangabad divisional commissionerate has written a letter to the Latur district administration asking the officials to look into complaints of alleged lack of transparency in the voter registration process for the election for Marathwada graduates’ constituency. The letter, issued on Tuesday, has also asked the authorities concerned to submit an action taken report on the matter at the earliest. TOI, on September 24, had carried a report highlighting how several graduates, who have enrolled online for registering as voters, were facing inordinate delays in getting their documents verified. The document verification process is done offline. Advocate Vivekanand Ujlambkar, one of the poll aspirants, had lodged a complaint with the authorities concerned alleging bias in the process of verification of documents. A section of other poll aspirants had also voiced similar apprehensions. Ujlambkar said authorities must ensure that every eligible graduate, who has enrolled his name online as prospective voter, must find his or her name in the electoral roll. “The voter registration process is the base of any poll and therefore must be accomplished in a transparent and accountable manner,” he said. While the term of existing public representative for Marathwada Graduates’ Constituency has expired on July 19, the polls that have been deferred due to Covid-19 pandemic. The fresh electoral rolls were prepared for Marathwada Graduates’ Constituency and around 3.47 lakh graduates had registered their names during the first phase of registration, before the process got extended due to deferred polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latur-officials-told-to-look-into-voter-registration-plaints/articleshow/78412055.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: Murders by juveniles rise by 24%, overall cases up by 2%||NEW DELHI: There was a sharp rise of 24% in murders committed by juveniles in 2019 compared with 2018 in Delhi. The overall crimes committed by juveniles increased by 2% with 2,783 cases being reported in 2019 compared with 2,727 in 2018, data released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) stated. While murder and theft saw a rise, other crimes like robbery and rape committed by juvenile delinquents saw a decline. In 2018, 58 murders were committed by juveniles compared with 72 last year. The number of minors involved in thefts rose from 1,372 in 2018 to 1,568 in 2019. From 278 robberies committed by minors in 2018, the number reduced to 158 in 2019. Similarly, rape cases reduced from 112 in 2018 to 99 in 2019. Various schemes have been started by Delhi Police to rehabilitate juvenile offenders. “Young boys are majorly involved in robberies and snatching cases. The gangs include them because they don’t raise suspicion and being juveniles they are let off after a few years. We identified juveniles who wanted to change their lives and included them in our programmes. Many got employed in the private sector as lab technicians, operators, paramedics, etc,” said a senior police officer. The number of crimes committed against children also saw a decline of around 5% from 8,246 in 2018 to 7,783 in 2019. Similarly, crimes against foreigners have also decreased. In 2018, 189 such crimes were reported in the city compared with 123 in 2019, showing a decline of around 30%.

October 1, 2020||Aurangabad||After Bamu, SRTMU postpones exams||AURANGABAD: A day after Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) postponed its final-year examinations, Nanded-based Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU), another state-university from the region, also followed suit on Wednesday. Citing reason of the current state-level indefinite strike by the non-teaching staff, the SRTMU said they are not in a position to conduct the examinations which were scheduled to begin from October 6. “The Board of examinations and evaluation held an urgent review meeting on Wednesday, during which it was decided to postpone the examinations till further notice. The revised time-table of examinations will be shared with students shortly,” Ashok Kadam, public relations officer of SRTMU, said. Kadam said the government should consider the demands of the agitating staffers. “While members of teaching staff are getting the desired pay benefits, we are deprived of it for a long time. We are not demanding immediate release of the benefits and the same can be offered after a gap of few months. However, the state government must give a written assurance in support of our demand now,” he said. Meanwhile, Bamu on Wednesday uploaded the question-paper for mock-tests of examinations, which were scheduled on October 1 and October 3 as per earlier time-table. Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said students can appear for mock-test even if the examinations are postponed. “The question papers of other mock-tests will be uploaded in phases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/after-bamu-srtmu-postpones-exams/articleshow/78412070.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Coimbatore||16,000 tested +ve for Covid in dist in September||Coimbatore: The district saw Covid-19 cases doubling to 32,000 from 16,000 in 29 days in September, even as 574 people tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, the last day of the month. The tally now stands at 32,068. There was a marginal dip in active cases, which stood at 5,027 on the day against 5,161 on Tuesday, despite the district adding more than 1,000 cases in less than 48 hours. Coimbatore is the only district in the state other than Chennai with more than 5,000 active cases. The recovery rate remains steady at 82.9% with 697 patients getting discharged from treatment centres. At least 26,605 patients have recovered from Covid-19 in the district so far. The toll, meanwhile, shot up to 436 with the state recording 11 deaths that occurred in the district in the past two days in the bulletin. Among the deceased were two 80-year-old men, two 75-year-old men, a 74-year-old woman, a 62-year-old man, a 61-year-old man and a 52-year-old man, who died in the ESI Hospital on Monday and Tuesday. While the woman had hypothyroidism and bronchial asthma, the men had hypertension, diabetes and renal failure. The district has once again started seeing patients succumbing to the virus within 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization. This again points to delay in seeking medical attention and this doesn’t augur well for the district. At least eight of the 11 deaths that were recorded on the day had occurred within 24 hours of hospitalization. A health department official said they didn’t know why people were seeking medical help too late, despite them conducting fever camps in containment areas and awareness creation programmes across the district. With the doubling time increasing to 29 days, the spread of the virus, meanwhile, seems to have slowed down. It was on September 1 that the Covid-19 tally crossed 16,000-mark in the district. Twenty-nine days later, it has zoomed past 32,000-mark on Wednesday. “The number of new cases has begun dropping slightly from 650 a day to less than 600 to 575-odd and is expected to dip further over the next few days. Now, we are more careful about case repetitions and cases from other districts creeping into our list,” the official said. Primary health centre doctors and nurses are doing their bit to create awareness among the people, who come for testing, about the ban on home isolation. People who test positive would now be taken to treatment centres in ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/16000-tested-ve-for-covid-in-dist-in-september/articleshow/78416131.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||Starting to turn corner, garment inc suffers due to farmers’ stir||LUDHIANA: Already facing problems due to limited number of trains running ever since the coronavirus outbreak, the local garment industry is now hit by the ongoing farmers’ agitation in Punjab. The industry depends upon the railway network for the movement of their goods from Ludhiana to other parts of India, as to some states and cities road transport takes a long time to reach but railways makes faster delivery, charges less freight and is safer as well. But even after lifting of the lockdown, there were a limited number of trains in operation due to which bookings and delivery of consignments were badly affected. The situation became worse since September 24 as railways cancelled several passenger and goods trains running on Ludhiana route due to farmers’ agitation. On Wednesday, about 10 trains remained either cancelled or some were allowed to run only till Ambala, keeping in view the agitation. Businessmen say since the agitation is not on the line from Ambala to Ludhiana, railways should consider running trains till the city to facilitate movement of their goods otherwise they will suffer huge losses on account of late delivery. Vinod Thapar, Chairman of the Knitwear Club, says, “Railways plays an important part in the garment industry as the freight charges are very low. Earlier when railways started goods trains, it didn’t benefit us at all as we did not have any orders due to the lockdown. Now when we have orders and our goods are also ready, there are not enough trains. At present, not even a single train is running due to farmers’ protest. It is our request to the railways to allow special trains till Ludhiana as the situation is normal here else our industry will suffer heavily.” Dinesh Kalra, president of Ludhiana Business Forums, rues that just when orders started flowing, the industry has been hit by logistics. “Garment industry prefers railways over any other modes of transportation due to trains’ ability to make delivery to small and far-flung stations promptly. Now trains have been cancelled due to farmers’ agitation, but compared with the pre-pandemic period, only few trains are running from Ludhiana. We request the state and the Centre to find a solution to our problem,” he says. Tarun Kumar, station director, Ludhiana, says, “Keeping in view the agitation in Punjab, several trains were cancelled, diverted, short terminated and short originated on Wednesday. Some of the major trains, like the 02425 New Delhi-Jammutawi Rajdhani Express, 02426 Jammutawi-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, 02054 Amritsar-Haridwar Express and 02053 Haridwar-Amritsar Express commencing on Wednesday, will remain cancelled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/starting-to-turn-corner-garment-inc-suffers-due-to-farmers-stir/articleshow/78413242.cms||Mohit Behl

October 1, 2020||Goa||Season ends on record note for state, highest avg rain since 1961||PANAJI: Goa’s average total rainfall this monsoon, from June 1 to September 30, stood at 4,203.7mm. As per figures of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the highest seasonal total prior to this was 4,097.7mm, which was recorded in 1961. The IMD on Wednesday shared a comparison between the state’s monthly average rainfall values this monsoon and in the past. Figures reveal that the state’s average rainfall in June, July and August were the fourth highest over the past decades. However, in September, it was the second highest with 754mm rainfall recorded. Prior to this, the highest was recorded in September 1950 with a total of 771.5mm recorded. “This monsoon season was different from previous ones in not only recording the highest seasonal rainfall total as per records, but also in the consistency of rainfall in all four months of the Southwest monsoon season,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. It may be noted that as of 2020, the IMD has 13 rain gauge stations in Goa focused on recording daily rainfall, but in 1961, the daily data of only five stations is available with the IMD. Figures shared by the IMD show that the June and July months recorded 15% and 17% higher than normal rainfall, mainly due to cyclone Nisarga, other monsoon enhancing systems formed over the Arabian Sea and circulations over Konkan area. August and September recorded 67% and 146% higher than normal rainfall because of back to back low pressure areas that formed over Bay of Bengal. “When these systems moved westwards to the Indian mainland, it enhanced monsoon currents over the west coast and Goa experienced continuous normal or active monsoon periods,” Rahul said. August and September rainfall were among the highest four recorded values this year and it is this consistency in high rainfall in all four months that resulted in highest recorded total this year. “The August and September rainfall has made the difference in the seasonal total and contributed in making it the highest seasonal rainfall for the past 100 years. Usually July and August are supposed to contribute the maximum rainfall for the seasonal total,” said former NIO scientist, M R Ramesh Kumar. He attributed the rise in this year’s rainfall to La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean. “This year we did not have even a single depression either in the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal. The last time such a scenario occurred was in 2002, where we had drought or deficit monsoon conditions. But it was more than compensated by low pressure systems, which have lots of rainfall for most of the meteorological subdivisions of the Indian subcontinent this year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/season-ends-on-record-note-for-state-highest-avg-rain-since-1961/articleshow/78416103.cms||Nida Sayed
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||RHB receives possession of 24 MLA bungalows||Jaipur: The work to generate revenue for the construction of luxurious eight-storey building to accommodate 160 MLAs has gathered steam.  Out of 54, the Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) has received the possession of 24 MLA bungalows and started the demolition drive. The revenue earned after selling the land of these bungalows at Lal Kothi and Jalupura will be utilised to construct the apartments. RHB, commissioner, Pawan Arora said, “We are receiving to expect the possession of entire bungalows in next two months. The bungalows in RHB possession are being demolished,” The RHB is taking the demolition work at steady pace as the permission to increase the height of the building is awaited. An official informed, that the RHB has proposed to construct an eight-storey building in the periphery of legislative assembly to accommodate 160 MLAs. Considering the project as a special case, the 28-metre building height has been proposed against the 15-metre mentioned in the building bylaws.  Although, the design has received in-principle approval, the final nod to provide relaxation in the bylaws will be received by the urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal, as for the assembly’s structural dominance, in the 100-metre periphery, the height of the buildings is restricted up to 15 metre. At present, RHB has proposed to construct the apartment till the base height of the dome. After the work was awarded to RHB, a design of the apartments has been prepared. The flat would measure 3,200 square feet and comprise of four bedrooms, one drawing room, a kitchen and one room for domestic help. As per the previous design, the JDA has proposed 176 flats. However, the idea did not go well with the committee which is overseeing the project, as the open area was less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-receives-possession-of-24-mla-bungalows/articleshow/78414678.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Delhi||Delhi clocks higher Covid death rate||NEW DELHI: Despite the availability of multiple treatment modes and a better understanding of Covid-19, deaths continue to be high in Delhi. In the last 30 days, 917 fatalities have occurred. This figure doesn’t include patients who came to Delhi from other states. The weekly data released by the state government showed the death rate at 1.15% in the past 10 days. However, the cumulative mortality rate was 1.92% against the national average of 1.56%. In September, Delhi recorded an average of 31 deaths daily. The daily average in April, May, June, July and August was 2, 14, 77, 41 and 16, respectively. Hospitals said while beds were available in general wards, ICUs, with or without ventilator support, were in huge demand. “One of the major reasons for increased severity is delayed diagnosis and treatment. Many patients delay getting the Covid-19 test done even when they have clear symptoms. Also, after testing positive, people wait at home and only rush to hospital in an emergency,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, critical care and respiratory medicine at Apollo Hospital. Chawla added that they had only one ICU for Covid-19 patients when the outbreak started. “Now, we have two ICUs, but no beds are available. Many patients from other states are also admitted here,” he said. Lok Nayak Hospital, the biggest Covid-designated healthcare facility run by Delhi government, has 2,000 beds. Of them, nearly 400 beds have advanced equipment, including mechanical ventilators and non-invasive ventilators, among others. Hospital authorities said around 650 people were admitted at present, of which a majority had severe symptoms requiring oxygen therapy. Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, chairman neurosciences and director of clinical services at Vimhans Nayati Super Specialty hospital, said diabetics, those with kidney diseases and obese patients constituted a majority of severe cases. “The death rate is also higher among Covid-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities,” he added. Stressing on the need for timely diagnosis and treatment, Dwivedee said, “If a person has fever, cough and breathing difficulty and he or she tests positive for Covid-19, it is advisable to seek medical supervision because, we have observed, the condition can deteriorate suddenly.” Some patients with Covid-19 suffer from cytokine storm or severe immune overreaction by the body. Simply put, when a person is infected with the novel coronavirus, his or her immune system tries to fight back. Too many cytokines (small proteins important in cell signalling) are released into the blood very quickly, thereby leading to a storm. This has been linked to many complications, including respiratory failure and heart attack. Dr Sumit Ray, chairperson of critical care at Holy Family hospital, said there was no cure for Covid-19 as yet. “Drugs like Remdesivir and Dexamethasone do help in certain cases. But we need proper monitoring of critically-ill patients and ventilation in the right manner to prevent lung failure, a key cause of death in such patients,” he added.

October 1, 2020||Aurangabad||Contract staff demand reinstatement||AURANGABAD: The contract employees — who were appointed under the Maharashtra State Rural Livelihood Mission (MSRLM) — staged a demonstration outside the Beed district collectorate on Wednesday, demanding that the state government should withdraw its letter dated September 10 asking all the zilla parishad chief executive officers not to renew the contract of staff whose contract ended on or prior to September 10. The letter signed by Pravin Jain, chief executive officer of MSRLM, also pointed out that a process to this effect was already in progress. Hence, the ZP CEOs should not send proposals for renewal of contract of these employees. Manisha Pawar, who has been a contract employee since 2011, said that this was sheer injustice and distressing for around 3,500 employees. “We don’t want the government to provide us with provident fund or other benefits or appoint us on regular basis. At least, allow us to continue to work for 11 months till we achieve the age of 58 as we have become completely dependent on this job. We suspects that it is a ploy to outsource the job done by us. That again would be more expensive for the government,” she said. Shaikh Tufail, joint secretary of the Karmchari Mandal, said in the wake of Covid-19 they don’t have any alternative at hand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/contract-staff-demand-reinstatement/articleshow/78412085.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||BJP launches 11-day drive to promote farm bills in state||Jaipur: State BJP president Satish Poonia has asked the Congress to list out measures taken by them for the benefit of farmers since Independence. While launching an 11-day campaign on farm bills on Wednesday, Poonia said that the bills will bring a transformational change in the life of farmers. In the next 11 days, the party will run mass awareness campaign at all booth level, he said. He said that it is unfortunate that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has directed Congress-ruled states to look for a legal way to oppose the farm bills. “It appears that Congress doesn’t want to see the financial empowerment of farmers. It also shows that they have no regard for the cooperative federalism,” said Poonia. He said that BJP is committed to responding to the lies being spread by the Congress. “Our campaign will run across the state and it will reach out to each and every farmer in the state explaining them about the benefits of the new farm bills,” said Poonia, while addressing his party workers virtually. He told that Congress is spreading the lies that Minimum Support Price (MSP) will be out of the system. “I would like to tell them that selling through MSP has already started and in the last 48 hours alone sell of Rs 10.53 crore has been made. PM Narendra Modi has repeatedly assured the farmers that MSP will never go from the system,” said Poonia. He said that the farm bill is paid the way for the farmers to double their income in the coming years. “It will allow them to sell it where they will get a good price,” said Poonia. He said that during former PM Manmohan Singh, the agriculture budget was Rs 12,000 crore, which has gone up to Rs 34,000 during the Modi regime. “The total loan to farmers was Rs 8,000 crore, which has doubled in the Modi government and touched Rs 15,000. It shows who is serious for the farmers and who is working for them,” said Poonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-launches-11-day-drive-to-promote-farm-bills-in-state/articleshow/78414750.cms||---

A team from Jagraon City police station reached the crime spot and started investigation in the matter. The accused was then booked for murder. SHO of Jagraon City police station Inspector Nidhan Singh said the accused was yet to be arrested and he had attacked his uncle as the latter would often scold him.

October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s only Sanskrit university fails to fill 50% seats||JAIPUR: Nearly two decades have passed since the establishment of Jagadguru Ramanadacharya Rajasthan Sanskrit University (JRRSU), Jaipur, but every year, the administration fails to fill up half of the seats. This year, even after postponing the admission dates twice, around 300 forms have been received for 1,200 seats. JRRSU, the only Sanskrit university in Rajasthan, was established in 2001 to promote the ancient language but after two decades, the varsity is still not able to attract students. In Sanyuktacharya course i.e. five-year UG + PG course for 640 seats, only 169 admission forms have been received by the university. The last date of admission has been extended to October 12, but every day, not more than two forms are being received. In all, the university has around 6,000 seats, but not more than 700 students are studying here. University sources said, “These are just admission forms by the students. No one has paid the fees yet and it is possible that only half the students will finally join the university.” According to the university administration, in the 44 sanctioned posts, only 22 are being filled. Since, July 2018, the university does not have any professor. In Shastri i.e. BA course, a student has to study two Sanskrit subject and three general subjects (English, Hindi, Political Science or Public Administration). In the two decades not, a single permanent teacher has been appointed for these subjects. However, last year, no teacher on contract was appointed for the subject as well, leaving students fend for themselves. Ghanshyam Gauttam, a former student union president of the university, said, “The administration is very negligent towards the problem of students which is why their number is decreasing. We studied with the help of private coaching or self-study as not even contractual teachers were made available. We complained to university administration, but no one paid heed to it.” In Dahrshan Shastra, Jain Darshan and Puran & Itihas only one form has been received. Highest number of forms are received in Sahitya and Vyakaran department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajs-only-sanskrit-univ-fails-to-fill-50-seats/articleshow/78414716.cms||Parul Kulshrestha

Congress councillor from ward 64 Rakesh Prashar said, “The flyover was thrown open at 8am for vehicular traffic. Now, it will not be closed. With this, we have fulfilled the long-pending demand of residents.” A resident of Civil Lines, Mahesh Sharma, said, “Due to the closure of the flyover, jams choked Lakkar Bridge and bus stand flyover, too. Now that it is open, we can travel through it without any problem. This will lessen vehicular burden on other roads as well.”Harjit Singh of Model Town Extension said, “This project took less time to complete if we consider past records of MC as well as the railways. For instance, the construction of Lakkar Bridge took 15 years. Pace of work should be increased for other ongoing projects as well, especially elevated road project, to bring an end to traffic jams.”The MC officials claimed they had completed construction on their part a few days ago and that the railways took time to wind up work on their portion. Trending on social media Jagraon Bridge was trending on social media too. Taking a dig at boards installed by mayor Balkar Sandhu near the bridge that congratulate residents for the flyover completion, netizens said instead of putting up such boards, the MC should seek their forgiveness for delaying the project. Memes on the project, too, did the rounds.InquiryTwo months ago, a resident had filed a complaint with the local bodies department, saying the MC officials changed the flyover design of their own which escalated its cost as well. The officials concerned were issued show-cause notices. They have filed their replies to MC. The mayor said they have submitted their replies along with a report to local bodies department for further action.

October 1, 2020||Delhi||DoE cleared school’s fee hike without nod: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has informed Delhi High Court that the directorate of education (DoE) cleared the fee hike proposals of nearly 75% for Sanskriti School without his approval. In an affidavit filed before justice Jayant Nath, Sisodia has also urged the court to disregard an earlier reply filed by DoE approving the fee hike and bypassing the education minister. “The Department of Education has granted approval for hike in fee vide the impugned orders without taking any formal approval from the minister in charge. And since the said orders and the hardship occasioned by them were brought to the knowledge of the deponent (Sisodia) by some affected parents, I have issued two written directions to DoE to withdraw these orders dated 22.04.2020 and 10.09.2020. But owing to reasons best known to DoE, both the directions were ignored,” said the affidavit. Sisodia’s stand came in response to the petitions filed by 26 parents of students enrolled with the school, who have opposing the fee hike through advocate Khagesh Jha. The parents had challenged DoE orders permitting fee hike of 20% for the academic year 2019-20 (with effect from 01.04.2020) followed by another order permitting a hike of 35% for the academic year 2020-2021 (with effect from 01.10.2020) and an earlier order permitting 20% hike (with effect from 01.04.2019). The minister informed the court that the affidavit was filed through a counsel from the panel constituted to handle cases for the services department, who was not authorised to represent DoE. “The filing of the affidavit in the manner as has been done in the present case is an aberration without precedent as it does not have the education minister’s sanction,” Sisodia contended. The affidavit highlighted that Sanskriti School was run on land allotted by DDA and the allotment letter mandated it to seek prior approval from DoE before any hike/increase in fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doe-cleared-schools-fee-hike-without-nod-sisodia/articleshow/78414794.cms||Abhinav Garg
October 1, 2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to spray stubble killer on 800 acres||NEW DELHI: A few days after reviewing a chemical made by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), through which crop stubble can be decomposed, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that it would be sprinkled on 800 hectares of paddy fields in the capital. This would not only curb stubble burning, but also turn the crop residue into manure. Compared with the neighbouring states, Delhi has a negligible number of paddy fields. However, Delhi government has decided to do whatever it can within its jurisdiction to check stubble burning, which chokes the city during the winter months. Sprinkling of the solution will start in mid-October with the consent of farmers and it will be free of cost. Kejriwal has also appealed to other state governments to use the affordable solution. All arrangements for spraying the fermented solution would be made by Delhi government under the guidance of the agricultural scientists. The entire process would cost around Rs 20 lakh. “Stubble burning poses a hazard for everybody, including farmers living in the countryside. Every responsible government must devise alternative systems for their farmers so that they are not forced to burn the crop stubble,” said the chief minister. Four capsules of the chemical developed by IARI scientists mixed with jaggery and gram flour can be made into a solution, which can be sprayed on one hectare of land. The mixture softens the straw and decomposes it. Farmers usually start preparing for the next sowing season around October 15 every year. “Delhi government will start the process of preparing the liquid by October 5 and complete it by October 12-13. We will then visit the farmers to spray the solution on their farmlands. As there will be no time to distribute the capsules among farmers, we will carry out the spraying ourselves,” Kejriwal said. The scientists said that once stubble would decompose into manure, it would improve the fertility and productivity of the land and decrease the usage of fertilisers. Burning stubble can kill the useful bacteria in the soil. Kejriwal had earlier written to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar requesting the Centre to implement this innovative solution in other states to whatever extent possible to address the issue of stubble burning. Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other states start burning stubble in October. By the time winter arrives, Delhi gets converted into a gas chamber with air quality dropping to dangerous levels. The adverse effect is also felt in the NCR and cities of neighbouring states bordering the capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-spray-stubble-killer-on-800-acres/articleshow/78414801.cms||AlokKNMishra
October 1, 2020||---||Election Commission removes Bihar excise commissioner||PATNA: The Election Commission removed the state excise commissioner B Karthikey Dhanji from his post with immediate effect on Wednesday for not coming up with an “effective plan for preventive measures” and “grossly inadequate preparedness” for prohibition measures ahead of the upcoming polls. The decision was taken at a review meeting of poll preparations of several enforcement agencies in the state held at a hotel on Exhibition Road on Wednesday. Dhanji, a 2008-batch Bihar cadre IAS officer, was posted as excise commissioner nearly two years ago. The information regarding his removal was officially released by chief electoral officer HR Srinivasa late in the evening. This is the first assembly election in the state after prohibition was enforced in April 2016. Sources said action against Dhanji was taken within few hours after he gave a PowerPoint presentation before CEC Sunil Arora and other ECI members during the review meeting. Another source said earlier it was IG (prohibition) from the state police headquarters who was expected to give a presentation before the CEC on prohibition enforcement in the state for assembly polls. The excise commissioner’s name reportedly cropped up at the last moment for giving the presentation before the CEC following which everything was prepared within a few hours on Tuesday night. Sources said Dhanji was not seen in another review meeting of the EC with enforcement agencies on September 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/ec-removes-state-excise-commissioner/articleshow/78414806.cms||Debashish Karmakar

October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||‘Lockdown’ struck Baba Nand Singh Nagar residents early||LUDHIANA: The residents of Baba Nand Singh Nagar in Flower Enclave area here claim that they have been facing a lockdown-like situation since long, even before the pandemic-triggered lockdown occurred, as the road in their area was dug up around a year ago for construction of a new road with interlocking tiles, but the same has yet not happened. Blaming the area’s sarpanch for their plight, the residents said he would start the work and after a few days, stop it midway. They claimed that due to the pathetic condition of roads, it has become difficult for them to take out their cars or two-wheelers from houses. They have now approached Punjab rural development and panchayats minister Tripat Rajinder Bajwa demanding an inquiry into the matter. However, sarpanch Parminder Singh Kainth on his part claimed that the residents are interfering in the work and that is why it is getting delayed. A resident of the area Sukhwinder Sekhon said, "Almost a year ago, the road construction work started, and after a few days, it was stopped, leaving the residents in the lurch. The old road was dismantled and even the ramps outside houses were removed, due to which we can neither take out our vehicles nor move anywhere." Another resident Jagmohan Gulati said after the lockdown, the work was resumed again, but it was again stopped. He said it seems that the sarpanch does not have adequate funds for completing the work and that is why he has been delaying the work for a long time. He said earlier, a 14-feet-wide road was approved, but now the width has been reduced to 10 feet, which calls for a proper inquiry into the matter. However, trashing the claims of the residents, sarpanch Kainth said, "I got approval for this road under the MNREGA scheme around a year back in November and work was also started, but then some technical issues cropped up and it had to be halted. After the lockdown, it resumed, but whenever we try to start work, the residents create problems." He said the colony is developed in an unplanned manner, due to which there is no levelling of roads, but for constructing interlocking tiles, proper levelling of the road is required. He said some of the residents even argue with the labourers working at the site, which often results in the work coming to a halt. As for the reduced width of the road, he said they had got approval for a 10-feet-wide road only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lockdown-struck-baba-nand-singh-nagar-residents-early/articleshow/78413286.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Chennai||TN mobile phone subscriber base drops by 22L in 11 months||Chennai: The craze over individuals holding multiple mobile numbers seems to be fading in Tamil Nadu. The subscriber base in the state has shrunk by more than 22 lakh mobile phone connections, both pre-paid and post-paid connections, in the past 11 months, impacting the wireless tele-density. Data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in its Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicator report says Tamil Nadu including Chennai Circle had nearly 8.3 crore pre-paid and post-paid connections in September 2019. The decline then started, with December 2019 recording a drop of 9.4 lakh connections compared with September (2019). Though as many as 1.8 lakh new connections were added during the first quarter of 2020, between January and March, the number nosedived to 6.7 lakh in just April. This has further led to the total number shrink to a little more than eight crore connections, sources told TOI. The development also decreased the wireless tele-density in the state by 7%, from 112.9% in December 2019 to 105.7%, according to the Trai report. Tele-density is the number of telephone connections (fixed lines and mobile phone subscribers) per 100 inhabitants within a geographical area. Telecom industry sources attributed the decrease in number of connections to most telecom operators discontinuing with the free lifetime validity that does not require subscribers to pay for retaining their pre-paid mobile numbers. “But, the market dynamics have changed over the past one year. Subscribers are retaining only one number that offers the best network coverage and ignoring other numbers,” a senior official with a telecom company said. In the event of a pre-paid number not being recharged for a specific period, it gets disconnected, he said. C K Mathivanan, senior vice-president of the National Federation of Telecom Employees, said BSNL was still sustaining itself in the mobile phone sector despite all the odds. The state-owned telecom operator is completing 20 years on October 1 since its formation. BSNL currently has 1.25 crore pre-paid and post-paid mobile connections in the state, of which 22 lakh are in the Chennai circle that comprises the city and its neighbouring districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-mobile-phone-subscriber-base-drops-by-22l-in-11-months/articleshow/78414824.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

The accused was arrested from Mumbai. According to officials, the accused, Rupak Chatterjee (37) who hails from West Bengal has similar cases against him in various states. “After we received information about the matter from Delhi police, we started the investigation. The accused would get in the touch with the women through social media and once they came to India, he would rape them. The accused also told the women that he was interested in doing online business,” said an official of Sadar police station. The cops traced the accused to Mumbai and a team was sent there to arrest him. Police said that the accused used the same modus operandi in other states of the country as well. “As Rupak would frequently travel to other states, he was well versed with the local languages as well. To trap women, he had also learnt 12 international languages as well,” added the cop. While one case of rape was registered at Sadar police station, two others were registered at Vidhayakpuri police station. The women had lodged a zero FIR in Delhi following which the cases were transferred to the respective police stations in Jaipur. The accused is being interrogated. Police said, “We are checking his other cases as well and getting more details about his criminal history. He appears to be a seasoned criminal when it comes to trapping foreign nationals.

October 1, 2020||Delhi||Civic services at 568 centres soon in south Delhi||NEW DELHI: South Delhi residents will soon be able to avail various useful services in their neighbourhood by paying a nominal fee ranging from Rs10 to Rs 100. Fifteen services, including birth and death certificates, health trade licences, factory licences, property tax payment, veterinary licence, hackney carriage, tehbazari and hawking, park booking, pet licence and community hall booking, will now be available at all the 568 citizen service centres located in south Delhi areas. The standing committee of South Delhi Municipal Corporation has cleared a policy for the scheme, which will help senior citizens to a great extent. Residents will have an option to apply for e-mutation, filing conversion and parking charges and matters related to trade and storage licences, said an SDMC official. “An applicant will have to pay Rs10 fees to these centres to get a birth/death certificate made/updated,” added the official. The civic agency is going to sign an agreement with CSE e-gov services India Ltd. for providing these services. “These centres will help people as they will now be able to avail most of the useful services in their own area,” said standing committee chairman Rajdutt Gehlot. The additional commissioner (IT), SDMC, said these centres already existed and they would integrate SDMC-related services in their operations. “The number of service centres will also go up as the company increases its units,” he added. A senior SDMC official said that even though most of these services are available online, people still visit SDMC zonal offices for getting their documents issued. “We aim to save their time as well as the cost of transportation and that’s why we have decided to provide at least 15 services through these centres. These centres will be monitored by SDMC,” added the official. SDMC rejects proposal for compensation levyThe standing committee of the south corporation has rejected the proposal for imposition of a new tax in the form of compensation or regulatory charges. The executive wing of the civic body had earlier put forward a proposal of levying such a tax, which would have been taken at the time of sanctioning a building plan.

October 1, 2020||Goa||NGT: No violation by MRF on river banks||PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has disposed of an application by activist Kashinath Shetye asking for expansion of the Madras Rubber Factory (MRF) plant to be stopped. Shetye’s contention was that the embankment of the Khandepar has been encroached upon. The tribunal said that there is no material to show any violation of either wetland rules, damage to any water body or evidence of violation of environmental norms. Based on this, it said, there were no grounds to pass any further orders in the matter. “We have heard the learned counsel for the state authorities as well as the project proponent. Their stand is that there is no violation of the wetland rules or forest law. The project is not within the buffer zone of any water body and is a ‘zero liquid discharge’ project. It has been in operation and no pollution has ever been found,” the NGT has said. In its order, the tribunal said that the expansion of the project will also not affect the river or any other wetland. “The issue of protection of wetlands is being independently dealt with and 10 wetlands around the project in question are likely to be notified as protected, including the Khandepar river. The Goa Wetland Authority, in its letter dated September 23, 2020, has written to the state’s water resources department that a buffer zone of 50m is required to be maintained as protected, till declaration of a water body as wetland,” the NGT has said. Shetye, in his application to the NGT, had said that MRF was established in 1973 on the banks of the Khandepar. “Over the years, it expanded its operations causing rampant pollution. In 2016, it purchased more land and though the aggrieved villagers approached the authorities, no action was taken,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-no-violation-by-mrf-on-river-banks/articleshow/78414804.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||DB Gupta appointed advisor to CM for a year||Jaipur: Former chief secretary D B Gupta, who retired on Wednesday after putting in over 37 years of service, has been appointed as advisor to chief minister Ashok Gehlot for a year from October 1. The appointment order, issued by the department of personnel, said that Gupta has been appointed to the post of advisor to the chief minister for a period of one year from October 2020 and his salary and perks would be decided after approval from the finance department. Gupta, a1983-batch IAS officer, has been holding the post of advisor to the chief minister for the last three months after he was removed from the post of chief secretary. Gehlot in a surprise move on July 2 removed D B Gupta from the post of chief secretary just three months before his retirement and named Rajeeva Swarup, a 1985-batch IAS officer, as chief secretary. On July 5, Gupta was appointed as adviser to Gehlot. During his long years in service, he had handled almost all important departments, including agriculture, finance, energy, UDH, PWD among others. The state IAS association and the staff gave a farewell to the senior most bureaucrat on his retirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/d-b-gupta-appointed-advisor-to-cm-for-a-year/articleshow/78414805.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Mobile teams for Metro awareness||Kolkata: “Please don’t stand close, keep your distance.” Two persons, standing close to one another on board a Kavi Subhas-bound Metro on Tuesday evening, quickly moved apart as men in khaki addressed them through a loudhailer. “The loudhailers work wonders. We can be heard while being polite,” said RK Meena, a constable of central post, Metro Railway. With him was ASI SP Laskar, his colleague from central post (the RPF division, under which come five stations like Central, Chandni Chowk, Esplanade, Park Street and Maidan). The crisp words in Hindi kept breaking the buzz inside the train. But their warnings against possible transmission of coronavirus, caused by physical proximity, made sense. Armed with these loudhailers — Metro Railway’s frontline workers — move around in trains, keeping people apart to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. They also quietly check the e-passes that are now mandatory to access the north-south Metro. “Our RPF personnel have been told to be respectful when they are checking the e-passes and when they are cautioning against the contagion,” Metro Railway general manager, Manoj Joshi, told TOI. “It’s been a huge challenge opening the country’s most congested Metro amid the pandemic. We couldn’t have made it without our sentinels who stand in the forefront to ensure seamless operations,” said Joshi. While mobile teams travel on the trains, there are static ones posted at the stations. They also use loudhailers to ensure that people board a particular coach. They tell people to keep space while disembarking and boarding. TOI on September 23 wrote how “social distancing was being ignored as people crowded the first few Metro coaches to reach exists faster.” Even the e-passes helped limit per train per ride passenger count to 400. The 50- commuter cap for some of the coaches was going haywire as commuters crowded some compartments for convenience. “Counselling is the only way we can tackle this problem,” said Joshi.Unlike carriers like Delhi Metro, where flying squads have been deployed to make people follow Covid protocols, Metro Railway, Kolkata has preferred to persuade and advise commuters on protection from the virus. “The loudhailers help disperse crowd. People listen because the sound is amplified,” said Amresh Kumar, chief security commissioner, RPF, Metro Railway. His team of 750-men has turned out to be the face of the Metro.  “They have been working in tandem with Kolkata Police to check e-passes of commuters at the entries of Metro stations,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mobile-teams-for-metro-awareness/articleshow/78414808.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
October 1, 2020||Chennai||In fight for CM post, O Panneerselvam may be losing base to Edappadi K Palaniswami||MADURAI: While the AIADMK has stated that the party would name the chief minister candidate for the 2021 assembly election on October 7, party workers, including former supporters of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, from Madurai and other regions are strongly pitching for Edappadi K Palaniswami. Sensing the mood within the party, OPS backers are shifting allegiance and openly expressing reservations about their leader, who drew popular support with his ‘Dharmayudh’ in February 2017 when he rebelled against former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s aide V K Sasiakala and her family. In private, party leaders too had revealed that majority of the members present at the executive council meeting, held on Monday, too were seen to be supporting ‘EPS for CM’. The voices of support for OPS in party forums are growing weaker over the issue of naming the chief minister, multiple sources said. “There is no division in the party as to who would be CM candidate EPS or OPS. Here, it is about EPS continuing as CM and being named as the CM candidate,” an AIADMK leader said. The view is starker among partymen down the order. Melamadai A Jeyakumar, a former Madurai corporation councillor said he has switched sides, though he was one of the earliest to extend support to OPS for his dharmayudh. “Due to the turmoil, I thought I should support OPS as Amma had picked him, but I began to realize my mistake when he did not seem to show any consideration for our hard work,” he said. S Uma Ganeshan, former Madurai AIADMK IT wing president, said EPS was the right choice. “He has proved it to the people of the state. What more do we want?” he asked. Shankar, a primary member of the AIADMK, said it was best to go with popular minister from Madurai region R B Udhayakumar. “We feel that our minister is in favour of EPS and I would definitely follow him,” he said. Another worker, Jeyakumar too chose to go with Udhayakumar in extending support to EPS. T Gowri Shankar a IT Wing member, hoped that the matter would be resolved by October 7 and they, as the IT wing, can gear up to work for the party’s victory in the next elections. “The party is immensely popular with the people, and it is disturbing that OPS is trying to mar the party’s image with his recent actions,” he said. While EPS has solid support in the western region, he has covered his base in the central region too, whose leaders, too, are now backing EPS against OPS. “I supported OPS during his dharmayudh right from the start. But he could not take care of his supporters, when it mattered and lost his support base,” said a senior leader and former minister in J Jayalalithaa’s regime.

October 1, 2020||Hubballi||Hampi to soon get diesel buggy train||BALLARI: If everything goes as planned, world heritage site Hampi will soon have a well-equipped diesel buggy train to attract more tourists. After a hiatus of six months, tourist activities are slowly picking up in Hampi. The Ballari district administration and Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority (HWAMA) have decided to increase footfall in the days to come by introducing better facilities for tourists. HWAMA commissioner PN Lokesh told TOI that tourists were allowed to visit Hampi from last month. “Nearly 150 to 200 tourists are visiting Hampi daily. More than 800 tourists flock to the world heritage site during weekends. We have already introduced battery operated vehicles for the convenience of the tourists and many plans are afoot to improve the facilities in Hampi,” he said. “As a first step, a trackless diesel train service will be launched either in the first or second week of November as installation work is under way,” said Lokesh. “A Bengaluru-based company is installing the trackless diesel train which will have 42 seats. Once the train is operational, we will charge a nominal fee of Rs 300 per person. Once tourists board this train, they can see all important monuments which come in the 7km stretch from Kamalapur Mayur Bhuvaneshwari temple to Veerupaksha temple. There will be five stops on the route including at the Queen’s bath, Kamal Mahal and Krishna temple. During their journey, tourists can also make use of battery-operated vehicles at each stop to visit monuments,” he added. Lokesh said the diesel train will be operated on a revenue-based system. The company which is installing the train must share some revenue with HWAMA every month. The district administration and HWAMA will regularly monitor the functioning of the train to ensure the safety of tourists, he added. “We will also ensure all precautionary measures suggested by the government of India to contain the spread of Covid-19 are strictly being followed while operating the train,” said Lokesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hampi-to-soon-get-diesel-buggy-train/articleshow/78415214.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani
October 1, 2020||Ludhiana||Police hand over kids of murder accused to her friend and forget||LUDHIANA: Daresi police’s apathy has added to the woes of a Ludhiana couple who lost their livelihood during lockdown and are struggling to fend for their two children. In May this year, Daresi police had handed over to the couple two children of their family friend, requesting to keep them for a few days. However, the police are now not checking the status of the children, and the couple are forced to look after them. On May 24, a woman, with the help of her 20-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, had killed her husband, a building contractor, as he wanted to have physical relations with his daughter and had earlier allegedly raped his step-daughter too. On the fateful day, the building contractor had beaten up his wife and daughter and then wrapped a television wire around his own neck to pressurise them to allow him to have relations with the minor girl. However, the trio overpowered the man and strangled him with the same wire. The woman, her son and minor daughter were arrested and are in judicial custody. This woman has two more sons, aged eight and seven. When relatives allegedly refused to take the younger children with them, the police called Rupa Devi (name changed), a resident of a village in Ludhiana who was a friend of the family, and sent them with her. Rupa said, “Earlier, we were neighbours of the family. A few years ago, we moved to the village, but I would often visit their house. After the murder, the police called me and the investigating officer asked me to take both the children along, saying due to lockdown the relatives could not come. The cop said both the accused children of the woman would come out of jail in 15-20 days. When I refused saying I don’t have enough money to feed my own family, the cop said he would provide ration and other help too.” Alleging that the police pressurised her to take both the children home, she said, “I thought it was a matter of a few days. The cop did provide me with ration for a few days, but after the lockdown the investigating officer was transferred. My husband used to run a juice stall and I worked in a hosiery factory. But we lost our livelihoods in the pandemic and I had to borrow money to feed everyone.” “My friend’s children have lived a good life with all the facilities, good food and clothes and were studying in a private school. My friend would give her children’s old clothes for my kids. But everything has changed now. Now, those kids are wearing my children’s clothes and are not even getting good food,” she said. About the apathy of the police, Rupa said, “I have been doing rounds of the police station to ask when they would take back custody of both the children, but nobody pays any heed. There is a cop, I don’t know his designation, who abuses me whenever I go there. The police have cheated me. I was asked to take care of the children for a few days, but now they are forcing me to raise them, which I cannot afford.” Sanjay Maheshvari, a member of the district child welfare committee, said, “The police cannot hand over children to any third person. It is illegal. In such cases, the police have to report to the district child welfare committee or the district child protection office. Then we try if a close relative can take care of them. If any relative is interested, children are handed over to them after they given an affidavit. If no one is ready to keep them, we send them to child care homes.”  SHO unaware Daresi police station SHO sub-inspector Davinder Singh said, “I am not aware of the case as it took place before I joined here. I will call the woman and check the matter.”  ‘Will send them to child care home’ Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “I will check the case and will send the children to a child care home.”  ‘Child welfare panel helps in such cases’ Sanjay Maheshvari said the district child protection office or child welfare committee helps children in such cases. Children below the age of six are sent with the mother in jail and those elder are either handed over to the relatives or sent to the child care homes. In Ludhiana, there are two such homes, one an orphanage in Sarabha Nagar and another is a child care institute on Chandigarh Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/police-hand-over-kids-of-murder-accused-to-her-friend-and-forget/articleshow/78413300.cms||Payal Dhawan
October 1, 2020||Goa||Melauli villagers march to police station after 2 held for IIT protest||VALPOI: The vehement protests against the proposed IIT project by Melauli villagers continued in Sattari on Wednesday. Hundreds of villagers marched to the Valpoi police station, chanting slogans to demand the release of the two protesters arrested on Tuesday. The Valpoi block congress committee president Dasharath Mandrekar and social activist Vishwesh Parab had been arrested for obstructing government servants from discharging their duties during Tuesday’s protest. Both were later released on bail on Wednesday and were given a heroes’ welcome by the villagers, who garlanded them and chanted slogans. During the protest at the police station, villagers said they would continue to camp outside the station until Mandrekar and Parab are released. The villagers dispersed from the site only when the two were released. The protesters were seen telling the police personnel present not to arrest individuals, but to arrest all the demonstrators together. Melauli resident Sadayo Melekar said that the government will have to face the consequences ‘if justice is not served to the villagers’. “Now the villagers are very angry and will organise many more protests if the government fails to give us justice. All the women will carry their kids along with them and the elderly persons will also voluntarily participate in future protests if the government continues to harass us,” he said. Sankalp Amonkar, vice-president of Goa Pradesh Congress committee, said that the two protesters were arrested due to political pressure. “The protesters had not harmed the government officials or anyone, yet they were arresteds,” he said. Mandrekar said he was called to Valpoi police station on Tuesday night and was thrown into the lockup without warning, like a criminal. “No problem if I get arrested over and over again, I will not be afraid and will always oppose the IIT project,” Mandrekar said. The Congress delegation met DySP Gajanan Prabhudesai and said that the arrest of the peaceful protesters was wrong. Aam Aadmi Party members and members of various social organisations also participated in the demonstration along with Melauli villagers Wednesday. Meanwhile, Mandrekar and Prabhu were granted bail by Valpoi JMFC court on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each with a surety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/melauli-villagers-march-to-police-station-after-2-held-for-iit-protest/articleshow/78414811.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Agra||Plea to remove mosque from Krishna’s birthplace junked||MATHURA: A Mathura court on Wednesday dismissed a petition filed by a Lucknow lawyer and five others on behalf of Lord Sri Krishna Virajman seeking ownership of the 13.37acre-Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi land and removal of the Shahi Idgah mosque within it. The suit, filed on Friday by lawyer Ranjana Agnihotri, claimed that the mosque is exactly where Lord Krishna was born. The Mathura court’s decision came hours after a special CBI court in Lucknow acquitted all 32 people accused in the demolition of Babri mosque. Additional district judge Chhaya Sharma, while rejecting the petition, cited the Places of Worship Act, 1991 as the reason for it. She said the law bars her from hearing the case. According to the law, passed a year before demolition of the Babri mosque, the religious character of any place of worship built before August 15, 1947 cannot be changed. The law had also barred any legal proceedings to change character of any religious place. But it had left out the Babri dispute case from its ambit. One of the petitioners, Karunesh Shukla, said, “Our petition has been rejected. But we will move the high court soon.” The petition had claimed that Lord Krishna was born in a prison in King Kans' land and the entire area is known as Katra Keshav Dev. Also that the place of birth lies beneath the present structure of Shahi Idgah mosque. “Every inch of land of Katra Keshav Dev is sacred for devotees of Lord Krishna and the Hindu community,” the petition said. Several prominent Hindu priests and organizations had said that the suit was “politically motivated”. All India Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, which has over 90 organisations of temple priests across the country as its members, had slammed the petition. “This is just an unnecessary diversion after 52 years of agreement between the managements of Shahi Idgah mosque and Sri Krishna Janamsthan Sansthan in 1968,” said Mahesh Pathak, national president of the priests’ body. “We don’t want what happened in Ayodhya to happen here,” Pathak said, adding that the issue is being raked up again for “political gains.” While seeking possession of the entire 13.37acre land, the petition had sought cancellation of the compromise decree between the governing body of the temple and management trust of the mosque in 1968. After the initial hearing, the court deferred the matter for September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-court-nixes-petition-seeking-removal-of-mosque-from-sri-krishna-janmabhoomi-land/articleshow/78413301.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||In unique trend, crime cases by foreigners go up||LUCKNOW: In a unique trend, crimes committed by foreigners have increased in Uttar Pradesh while crime against them have registered a dip as compared to previous year. According to the annual ‘Crime in India 2019’ report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), crime against foreigners declined by 66.1% in 2019 as compared to 2018 while crimes committed by them went up by 17.1%. In 2018, 35 cases were registered against foreigners in connection with various offences while the figure went up to 41 in 2019. In contrast, 62 crimes were committed against foreigners in 2018 which dropped to 21 in 2019. In states like Goa and Rajasthan, which have a high presence of foreigners, crimes committed by them have decreased. In Goa, 138 crimes were committed by foreigners in 2018, but it went down to 110 in 2019. Likewise in Rajasthan, 33 crimes were committed by foreigners in 2018 while last year only 12 cases were registered. A senior police officer at the DGP headquarters said most of the foreigners involved in crimes in 2019 were booked for theft or under the Passport Act. He said over 80% of the cases were reported from Mathura, Varanasi and Agra which are common destinations for foreigners in UP. Inspector general of police, Agra range, A Satish Ganesh attributed the decline to a slew of reforms initiated by the UP police in strengthening tourist police. “A robust CCTV network was put in place near ASI-protected sites, while gangs of touts near railway stations and hotels were busted. All these measures led to a drop in crime against foreigners,” he said. “In Varanasi, patrolling and rounding up of touts near ghats and temples helped in checking crime against foreigners,” said additional superintendent of police Vikas Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-unique-trend-crime-cases-by-foreigners-go-up/articleshow/78416705.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Goa||New masterplans for Goa’s nine river basins on cards||PANAJI: Environment impact assessment (EIA) studies will be carried out on some rivers in the state to gauge the changes that have taken place in the ecology around it over the years. New masterplans for the nine river basins in the state will also be drawn up after more than 20 years. These works are being taken up under the National Water Mission, under which Goa has to draw up a state specific action plan for its water resources. Water resources department chief engineer Shrikant Patil said that Goa has received Rs 30 lakh to carry out the work and a steering committee headed by the state chief secretary has been formed to oversee this work. “Goa is divided into nine river basins. The earlier masterplans for the rivers were drawn up more than 20 years ago. They will be revisited to consider the environmental aspect, to which much thought was not given earlier. EIA studies will be taken up for some of the main rivers. A new water policy will be drawn up accordingly for the state,” Patil said. The objective is to plan Goa’s water resources and their usage up to 2051, he said. By assessing potential of both surface and groundwater resources in Goa and studying withdrawal from these sources, the committee will give the way forward in water resource planning for the state, the chief engineer said. “The committee consists of 48 members, representing all departments in Goa which are related to the water resources in some way. The work has begun and the report has to be submitted within six months’ time,” Patil said. The National Water Mission has initiated the work to prepare state-specific action plans for water sector covering irrigation, agriculture, domestic water supply, industrial water supply and waste water utilisation in all states and UTs. The plan will present situation of water resources development and management, water governance, institutional arrangements, water-related policies, cross-boundary issues, agreements etc. Status reports on issues related to all the aspects of water resources specific to Goa as also a set of probable solutions will be part of the state-specific plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-masterplans-for-goas-nine-river-basins-on-cards/articleshow/78414822.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Baba duped family for treating cancer, booked||Udaipur: A police complaint has been lodged against Baba Bhagwandas of Baba Ghat Ashram under Chanderiya police station limits in Chittorgarh district for allegedly tricking people with the promise of ayurvedic medicines for treating cancer. Bhagwandas examined and treated patients without any valid degree in ayurveda and charged huge amount for medicines made at his ashram. One Jagdish Sharma of Gandhinagar colony lodged the complaint claiming that his son Rahul's condition deteriorated after taking Baba's treatment. Sharma told the police that Rahul injured his tongue while chewing food some nine months ago and he was taken to a hospital in Gujarat for treatment where the doctor advised for a surgery costing around Rs 2.5 lakh. The family returned to Chittorgarh to arrange expenses for the treatment and happened to visit Baba's ashram when someone advised them that the old man treated serious ailments. Sharma said they visited the ashram 16 times and paid Rs 6,000-8,000 per visit for medicines, honey and ghee that were given from the ashram. Despite spending huge amount, when Rahul's condition did not improve, the family realised that they had been tricked. Suresh Giri, the investigation officer, said that practising medicine without a valid degree is a punishable offense and Baba Bhagwandas does not have any degree. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/baba-duped-family-for-treating-cancer-booked/articleshow/78414818.cms||---

Members of the association ratified the election after his name was proposed by a number of scholars and professors from various universities in North America. Honorary fellows are defined by the MLA’s constitution as “distinguished men and women of letters”. Chaudhuri joins the likes of Claudia Rankine, Milan Kundera, Adrienne Kennedy, Peter Handke, Amitav Ghosh, Louise Erdich and JM Coetzee in the honour roll of writers and poets. Founded in 1883, the MLA provides opportunities for its members to share their scholarly findings and teaching experiences with colleagues and discuss trends in the academy. Chaudhuri, who is professor of contemporary literature at the University of East Anglia and also teaches at Ashoka University as professor of creative writing, said he was pleasantly surprised by the honour. “I have relatively little connection with American academia, and so the news was a great surprise. It’s also a surprise to join such a distinguished list of past and present fellows, many of whom I greatly admire,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/us-lit-honour-for-amit-chaudhuri/articleshow/78414833.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 1, 2020||Goa||Stop political interference, IT professionals tell government||PANAJI: The state government needs to do away with political interference, introduce simplified norms and bring in deemed approvals, said Goa IT Professionals (GITP) here on Wednesday, becoming the latest industry stakeholder to flag concerns. While advocating for a slew of measures to be taken, GITP said that the government must recognise the urgency and take steps towards economic revival and business reforms. “Eliminate the practice of obtaining approvals from ministers and chairpersons for investment proposals,” said GITP president Gurudev Naik. “It has been proved time and again that this centralised file movement process is a major bottleneck.” GITP, in its recommendations, has urged the government to bring in an online single-window system for all government services with deemed approvals within 30 days. Goa’s position on the ease of doing index has slipped to 24 from 21 prompting Goa State Industries Association and CREDAI to flag several issues, including corruption within the government departments. “Despite having the highest per capita number of government employees, if Goa shows such a dismal performance, it is clear that we need to fix the bottlenecks in the processes being followed,” said Naik. GITP said it believes that if reforms are implemented in letter and spirit, it will also help further Sawant’s vision of Swayampurna Gaon, Sampanna Goem. The government is in the process of reviewing the implementation of the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 and is collating data and inputs from various departments. GITP’s other recommendations are closure of “irrelevant” departments, setting up of industry-academic partnerships, simplified registration process and use of e-governance systems. GITP also asked the government to efficiently utilise consultants such as E&Y to bring in new industries. Goa also needs to develop power infrastructure explore alternative sources and renewable sources of energy, GITP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stop-political-interference-it-professionals-tell-govt/articleshow/78414836.cms||Newton Sequeira
October 1, 2020||Agra||SIT formed to probe Hathras gang-rape||HATHRAS: The UP government on Wednesday set up a high-powered three-member SIT to investigate the gang-rape and death of the 19-year-old Dalit girl from Hathras. Later in the day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued a notice to the state government and the police chief, seeking a response within four weeks. “The team led by home secretary Bhagwan Swaroop, with DIG Chandra Prakash and IPS officer Poonam as its members, has been asked to submit its report in seven days,” a state government spokesperson said. The SIT arrived in Hathras in the evening. “They are speaking to the investigating officer and recording the sequence of events over the past few days. The team will stay in town for a couple of days,” inspector general (Aligarh range) Piyush Mordia said. Later in the evening, the NHRC issued a statement saying that it had taken suo motu cognizance of media reports “which are very painful”, adding, “It is apparent that the police was not able to take timely action to trace and save the victim girl due to which the young woman could not be saved from being subjected to grave cruelty. The way the perpetrators have acted shows that they had no fear of law in their mind.” NHRC has asked the state government to provide “adequate protection to the family of the deceased” and told the DGP to “look personally into the matter to ensure a speedy trial.” UP State Commission for Women also served a notice on the DG, ADG (Agra zone) and inspector general (Aligarh range) for "lapses" in the investigation and handling of the case, asking for a detailed report on steps taken to ensure justice for the victim. The Delhi Commission for Women wrote to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and other Supreme Court judges, urging them to take cognizance of the case. An Allahabad high court lawyer also wrote to HC chief justice Govind Mathur seeking “fair investigation into the Hathras rape case” and that the case be transferred to a special agency. Parallel to the legal recourses sought, demands for justice sparked angry protests across the country. In Hathras, police lathicharged Dalit protesters and Congress workers in the morning. “Protesters were pelting stones and forcibly closing shops in Hathras. Police had to use mild force to disperse the crowd,” ADG (Agra zone) Ajay Anand said. In response, Dalit protesters in Hathras announced a “no sanitation” strike until the accused are punished. About the Agra-Hathras border being barricaded, Anand said it is a “precautionary measure”. At night, Hathras police registered an FIR against 146 persons — including district Congress committee president Chandragupt Vikramaditya and 120 unidentified persons — for wrongful restraint, acting rashly or negligently to endanger human life or personal safety, voluntarily causing hurt, assault to prevent public servant from discharging duty under the IPC, under Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.

October 1, 2020||Delhi||Fix rental cost of machines, says EPCA||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has once again written to Punjab and Haryana over the recent instances of stubble burning being reported in both the states. It has asked both the state governments to fix and declare the “operational cost” or “rental cost” of machines being provided to farmers through Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), stating a lack of clarity on these could leave it open to misuse. EPCA also stated that the costs should be set as low as possible in order to ensure farmers are not dissuaded from approaching these centres to hire machinery to manage stubble in their fields. EPCA chairman Bhure Lal, in separate letters to the chief secretaries of the states, stated that after fixing these costs, wide publicity and awareness needed to be created to ensure farmers availed the facility of these machines, which were provided at a subsidy of 80 to 100% to the state-run CHCs. In his letter to Punjab, Lal said while the state had told them that there was no rental cost and the operational cost, which included the source of power and operator wages was minimal, it needed to be fixed for the clarity of farmers. “The rate for rental, which is being waived off is not apparent; the cost of operation is also not laid down,” said Lal. In his letter to the Haryana government too, Lal sought more clarity. “There is a clear directive on the rate or free use of machines to small and marginal farmers.” Meanwhile, EPCA has also submitted a report on stubble to the apex court, stating the daily contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s air quality is highly variable and can vary from 4% to 30%—depending on the intensity of fire and direction and speed of the transporting wind. The report states the impact of stubble burning is generally highest around the end of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fix-rental-cost-of-machines-says-epca/articleshow/78414820.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Agra||In Hathras village, Dalit families say they live alone, eat alone||HATHRAS: The 19-year-old girl, who was allegedly gang raped and then brutally tortured before being killed by four upper caste men, had always kept to herself. The village she grew up in had contained within it two disparate worlds — one which she lived in, another in which upper caste communities did. “Breaching the barrier would never occur to us,” said a Dalit man. In the Hathras village where the girl lived and died, Dalit families are painfully aware of the lines they must not cross. “We eat by ourselves, talk among ourselves, live by ourselves. Unse koi lena-dena nahin hain (they have nothing to do with us),” a Dalit youth told TOI. The small village is home to 64 families. Only four are Valmikis, living in a tight cluster within a half-km radius of one another. They have marginal landholdings, own cattle and fall back on MGNREGA when money runs out. “We had to sell a buffalo when corona came,” a woman from one of the families said.

Her relatives saidOn Wednesday, when TOI visited the village, the turmoil over the cremation of the gang-rape victim had given way to an uneasy silence. “We don’t have anything to say about the upper caste families. We don’t know anything,” said 50-year-old Kiran Devi. “They don’t acknowledge us. It’s as if we don’t exist,” the victim’s brother said. An eight-year-old ambled by. Does he go to school? The boy said he does but keeps away from the “other side” of the village. “Their children don’t play with us.” For years, Dalit children in the village were not sent to school. “We were afraid,” the brother said. “We are socially disconnected even though we live in the same village,” said Shilpa, a 14-year-old, who studies in Class VIII.

October 1, 2020||Goa||With CM in Delhi, Mopa planning meet postponed||PANAJI: A meeting of the Mopa Airport Development Authority (MADA), which was scheduled for Wednesday, was called off due to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s commitments in Delhi. Member secretary and director of civil aviation Suresh Shanbhogue said that a new date will be fixed for the meeting. MADA’s board meeting has gained focus after Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte, a fortnight ago, pointed out that GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL) has been granted a construction licence to build the new airport at Mopa without the requisite fees being paid. At that time, Shanbhogue said that the fees are under dispute and MADA would take a decision “shortly” to decide the fees to be paid by GMR. Khaunte had said that GGIAL had failed to pay Rs 49.3 crore as construction licence fees, but the state government said that GGIAL has asked MADA to reduce the fees. “The third meeting of the Mopa Airport Development Authority (MADA) scheduled for September 30, at 5.30 pm stands postponed,” said Shanbogue in a circular. While admitting that GGIAL had yet to pay any construction fees, Shanbhogue said that MADA issued the construction licence due to the importance of the project. A meeting of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) steering committee was also postponed. The steering committee was slated to discuss the construction of the Goa Bhavan at Vashi – Mumbai, construction of the Panaji bus stand and expenditure mandate for the solar plant. Several Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) projects were also meant to be discussed and cleared by the PPP steering committee. Wednesday was supposed to be the first meeting of the steering committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-cm-in-delhi-mopa-planning-meet-postponed/articleshow/78414857.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Delhi||Monsoon leaves 5 days late, but Delhi left with 20% rain deficit||NEW DELHI: The monsoon officially retreated from Delhi on Wednesday — five days later than normal withdrawal date. The capital recorded an overall 20% deficit rainfall, said scientists from India Meteorological Department. A scientist at IMD said, “The monsoon withdrew from the capital on Wednesday after change in low wind pattern into north-westerlies, reduction in moisture content and cessation of rainfall.” Delhi recorded 467.7mm of rainfall this season against the normal level of 585.8mm of rainfall. “There has been an overall deficit of 118.1mm rainfall this monsoon season,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at IMD. Despite prolonged monsoon, the month witnessed only three rainy days on September 5, 6 and 8. Only “trace” rainfall was recorded on September 4, while 0.8mm of rainfall was recorded on September 5. Safdarjung — Delhi’s base station — recorded no rainfall since September 9 even after the extended monsoon. However, the city saw two “heavy” and a “very heavy” rainy day in August. Though the Safdarjung observatory observed excess rainfall in both June and July, it recorded 11 per cent deficit this season after less rain in August and September. The observatory recorded 81.8mm rainfall in June, which was 25% excess than normal 60.5mm rainfall. With 236.9mm rainfall in July, Safdarjung observed 12 per cent excess rainfall. However, in August, Safdarjung received 237mm rainfall against 247.7mm normal rainfall, while it recorded only 20.8mm rainfall in September. This monsoon season, no district in Delhi recorded “excess” rainfall. However, three districts, including New Delhi with 12 per cent deficit, North Delhi with 5 per cent excess rain and South West Delhi with 3 per cent deficit, made it to “normal” category of rainfall. The IMD classifies a rain deficit when it is above -19 per cent. East Delhi, North East Delhi, North West Delhi and South Delhi districts were in “deficit” category. Central Delhi, which has only received 250.2mm of rainfall against 674.9mm normal rainfall this season, fared the worst with a “large deficit” rainfall of 63 per cent. Delhi’s maximum temperature on Wednesday was recorded at 35.6 degrees Celsius, one notch above the normal. The minimum was 21.8 degrees Celsius. Humidity levels oscillated between 34% and 86% in the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monsoon-leaves-5-days-late-but-city-left-with-20-rain-deficit/articleshow/78414868.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

After a meeting at party’s national president J P Nadda’s residence in Delhi on Wednesday, BJP’s national general secretary Bhupender Yadav said the three NDA partners will go to the Bihar polls together. However, Chirag told a group of LJP workers at his residence in Delhi to be ready for any eventuality as he will not let his party get marginalized. “We will not tolerate if anyone tries to pressurise LJP or reduce its size and end its existence ... Papa (Ram Vilas Paswan) always says country comes first, then comes party. Whatever decision will be taken will be in the interest of the party to increase its size and stature,” Chirag told party workers on Wednesday. Insiders said BJP and JD(U) are likely to contest equal number of seats. BJP will accommodate LJP from its share while JD(U) will adjust former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM (S). LJP workers insist on fielding 143 candidates out of total 243 assembly segments going to polls in three phases from October 28 to November 7. Meanwhile, following the BJP’s meeting attended by Union home minister Amit Shah and others, Bhupender said senior party functionaries have been tasked to hold talks with allies over the next two to three days. “All issues related to seat sharing will be sorted out,” he said. Bhupender said NDA will go to the Bihar polls with PM Narendra Modi’s face at the Centre and CM Nitish in Bihar. “We would take forward the development in Bihar in the last 15 years to make the state atmanirbhar (self-reliant) as we will win 3/4th of the seats,” he said. Union minister Nityanand Rai, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and state health minister Mangal Pandey among others attended the meeting. Meanwhile, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has been formally appointed BJP’s Bihar election incharge. Bhupender announced it after the meeting. Fadnavis said he would fulfil the responsibilities given by the party with full commitment. “Party’s state president Dr Jaiswal and Bhupender ji have already done commendable work in Bihar. The affection for PM Modi and works done by CM Nitish will ensure impressive victory for NDA,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-claims-nda-is-intact-ljp-sings-a-different-tune/articleshow/78418374.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Holding a meeting of heads of several departments at Jal Nigam office here on Wednesday, the minister discussed in details the measures to be taken to check the discharge of pollutants into the rivers mainly in rural areas. “Before the Mahakumbh, we would have to restore the past glory of the Ganga and the Yamuna. We would also have to maintain a smooth flow of water in both the rivers,” the jal shakti minister said, expressing concern over underground water being polluted due to discharge of effluents by illegal industries and slaughter houses. Singh said that he has received reports that illegal slaughter houses have mushroomed in western Uttar Pradesh and residues from abattoirs are causing pollution in the underground water which has to be checked at any cost. He directed UP pollution control board (UPPCB) authorities to draw a plan in this regard. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are committed to make the Ganga pollution free, the minister said and added that the UPPCB should identify illegal units discharging effluents into rivers and take appropriate measures. Regretting that the pollution level in the Hindon river in the western UP has risen alarmingly, the minister laid stress on the need for launching an awareness campaign to apprise people of the dangers posed by the rising water pollution levels, Principal secretary of the Namami Gange department Anurag Srivastava said that the work related to plugging of nullahs discharging pollutants in the rivers is in full swing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/restore-ganga-yamunas-past-glory-before-mahakumbh-min/articleshow/78416741.cms||---

In the last 15 days, two such incident have been reported in Ajmer and Alwar Gate police on Wednesday registered a case in the matter. According to Alwar Gate police, Saroj, a resident of Ashok Nagar, who was working somewhere else, lost her job because of the pandemic. She was looking for a job when she got a call saying that they run a HR company helping people get jobs. The accused then offered her some jobs in management, hotel industry and MNCs and asked Saroj to fill an online form with Rs 10 as a form-processing fee, police further said. Saroj said that after she filled the form and paid the token Rs 10 via a link sent to her by the accused, she got a message saying Rs 42,000 had been deducted from her account instead. She tried to call the accused but the number was out of network and it was then that she went to police and registered a complaint. Similar incident took place with Astha, a resident of Naka Madar, on September 19. She was looking for a job when she got a call from a ‘job providing company’ and was asked to fill the form on the link the caller had sent and to deposit Rs 100 as form processing fee. Astha proceeded with filling the form and then paid the online fee, but the link showed message of form submission failing over three times. Later, she got the message that Rs 1 lakh and 20 thousand were deducted from her bank account. She tried to call the caller but the number was out of network coverage. The case was also registered in Alwar Gate police station. There are about eight cases of online fraud registered in Ajmer wherein the caller asked people to deposit money in mutual fund for good returns within one month or people getting calls to update debit cards to continue services. Police further added that they are regularly asking people not to share any important information or OTP with anyone over mobile and even different banks advertise that they don’t call any customer for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyber-criminals-target-job-seekers-in-ajmer-district/articleshow/78414863.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Trichy||Sex ratio up marginally in Trichy||Trichy: The sex ratio in Trichy district which has been showing an inconsistent trend over the years has seen a mild increase in favour of the girl child in 2019-2020 compared to the previous year. According to the district social welfare office, 946 girls were born for every 1,000 boys in 2019-2020 as against 936 in 2018-19. Going by the data, the sex ratio stood at 924 female births in 2015-16, slumped to 897 in 2016-17 and again climbed to 959 in 2017-18 in the district. The trend indicated the possibilities of many women undergoing medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) in case of female foetus. Though marginally up last year, the new statistics are small relief considering that the birth of girl children has been declining since 1991. Revealing the statistics at a review meeting of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), Trichy collector S Sivarasu insisted on the need for ramping up measures to improve the sex ratio. The sex of the foetus can be determined in the 12th week of pregnancy. Sources said that some scan centres gave pregnant women a clue by mentioning a soft drink starting with ‘M’ for male baby and another carbonated drink starting with ‘F’ in case of female baby. Such centres also applied some other code words such as profit and expense for male and female babies respectively. N Krishnamoorthy, member of child welfare committee (CWC) in Trichy, said that “female foeticide could be a reason for female sex ratio trailing behind males at birth.” Joint director of health services (JDHS), Trichy Dr S Lakshmi said strict guidelines were in force to make scan centres comply with norms. “We are closely monitoring the scan centres which are also submitting the necessary documents of pregnant women. There is no complaint regarding sex determination female foeticide nowadays,” she told TOI. According to rules, scan centres should comply with the checklist mandatorily. In case of any discrepancies during inspection, these centres would be booked for violation of the pre-conception and pre-natal diagnostic techniques (PCPNDT) Act which awards punishment up to 10 years jail for revelation of sex of foetus to the pregnant woman or her family. The officials pointed out that female foeticide was prevalent in urban areas undertaken by educated people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sex-ratio-up-marginally-in-trichy/articleshow/78416155.cms||Gokul Rajendran
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||After Babri demolition verdict, judge brings gavel down on a historic note, retires||LUCKNOW: Justice Surendra Kumar Yadav began his judicial career as additional munsif judge while being posted in Faizabad between June 1990 and May 1993 — coinciding with the period when the Ram temple movement was at its peak and the demolition of the Babri Masjid. On Wednesday, his last day in office, Justice Yadav observed that “the conspiracy was not pre-planned”, as he read out the verdict, acquitting all 32 accused, including LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, in the 28-year-old Babri Masjid demolition case. In August 2015, Justice Yadav was appointed as additional district judge, Ayodhya Prakaran, in Lucknow, at a time when the case was lying dormant for five years, before the Supreme Court put it on the fast track in April 2017. The apex court invoked its inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and directed the sessions court to complete the trial and deliver its judgment within two years. The SC also transferred the trial from the court of the special judicial magistrate of Rae Bareli to the court of additional sessions judge (Ayodhya Prakaran) here, to be heard together. In 2018, the Allahabad high court appointed Justice Yadav as the district and sessions judge of Lucknow and asked him to continue to preside over the Babri demolition case. Justice Yadav had been appointed district and sessions judge of Badaun six month ago but the order was cancelled on the ground that the SC had earlier ruled that the judge conducting the Ayodhya trial would not be transferred till the trial was complete. So, despite his elevation to the post of district judge, Justice Yadav had been functioning as additional district judge. He had then pleaded in the apex court that he enjoyed an unblemished career of 28 years but was now approaching superannuation. He said that his batchmates and juniors had been appointed district judges. Justice Yadav moved the apex court complaining that the Babri case was stalling his promotion and requested to be given the posting he was naturally entitled to after the promotion order. But, time was running out for Justice Yadav, whowas to retire on September 30, 2019. In July 2019, Yadav sought more time to conclude the case. Eventually, on September 13, 2019, Yadav got the service extension for a year. And in August 2020, a bench of Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee granted one month time till September 30, 2020, to complete the proceedings including delivery of the judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-verdict-judge-brings-gavel-down-on-a-historic-note-retires/articleshow/78416757.cms||Pankaj Shah

We are finding it difficult to arrange for food now." District civil supply officer Umesh Chandra Mishra said, “We are regularly generating new ration cards following the Covid-19 lockdown. Of the 66,000 pending applications, around 35,000 are of the rural areas and 31,000 in the city. The physical verification of these applications is in progress.

There is not a shred of truth in their claims because of which we decided to submit a complaint with the cops to ensure that they are not allowed to hold a rally with their lies.” The cops have also denied permission to the NGO to organise the rally citing Section 144 which is in place and police officials claimed that in case the organisation still went ahead with the rally, then action will be taken against them. Last month, the NGO had written to the state government claiming concern about the deaths of four elephants at Hathigaon. The claims of maltreatment at the elephant village were refuted by both the mahouts and the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hathigaon-staff-submits-complaint-against-ngo/articleshow/78414914.cms||---

Mining engineer K C Goyal has written a letter in which he had forbidden the entry of the other employee Ajit Singh Shekhawat from entering the office complex in Alwar. The mining engineer has also lodged a complaint with the local police alleging that Shekhawat was conspiring to kill him and he feared for his life. The enginer claimed that Shekhawat had immense local influence due to which he had spent majority of 20 years of service being posted in Alwar itself. The senior also alleged that Shekhawat spent most of his time in the office and hardly went to field. Meanwhile, Shekhawat has refuted these claims and has also submitted a complaint with the cops and even written to senior officials regarding the matter.

October 1, 2020||Agra||In dead of night, no family present, Hathras gang-rape victim cremated by cops||HATHRAS: Before daybreak, in an explicable hurry the family says it doesn't understand, the body of the 19-year-old Dalit girl who had been allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men in her village was cremated by police at 2.40am on Wednesday. Her family said they never consented, police and administration said they did. Around 12.50am, a black car rode into the girl’s village, an ambulance behind it. The girl’s father and cousin were in the car, a police officer in the ambulance from Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. “Police wanted us to cremate her body without any delay. We wanted to wait until morning,” the girl’s brother told TOI on Wednesday. Hathras district magistrate Praveen K Laxkar said the ambulance was parked outside the house. District officials and police reached the girl’s house to negotiate with the family. In a video that has been circulating, the family can be seen arguing that they would want to follow funerary rituals, to which a police officer responds by saying that rituals “should adapt”. “An administration official came home and told us that someone from the family should go with him to cremate her. We didn’t go, assuming they wouldn’t cremate her without anyone from the family. Some time later, people from the media came asking us what we would do now that she had been cremated. That’s when we got to know,” the girl’s sister-in-law told TOI. Those present at the site later said the police had cordoned off the area where she was cremated. The DM dismissed that. “There was no pressure. Permission had been taken from the family,” Laxkar said. He did not answer questions about the time chosen. He did not deny, however, that family members were absent. Police, later in the day, shared a video that shows a person standing next to the pyre, implying family was present. The girl’s sister-in-law refuted that: “Not a single family member was present at the cremation. We were all home, scared of being beaten up by the police.” When the family did get to know, they said, they rushed there to find a burning pyre in the middle of the fields. Her mother broke down before the ambulance, locals turned irate and chaos ensued. “All I wanted was to see her off the right way. She will never come back,” the inconsolable mother told TOI in the morning. By then, the village had turned into a fortress with heavy security. When Hathras MP Rajveer Singh Diler got to the village to meet the family in the afternoon, he was driven away with slogans of “go back”. The BJP MP admitted that the "clandestine cremation" was wrong: “I will speak to the chief minister and inform him about police behaviour. Action will be taken against them.” Outrage over what was seen as a continuing tale of horror led to the opposition demanding chief minister Yogi Adityanath's resignation. Just outside the village, in Hathras town, police lathicharged Dalit protesters who were allegedly pelting stones and pulling down store shutters. Over the course of the day, protests were reported from across the country. Adityanath tweeted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to ensure strict action against the accused. In the evening, the CM spoke to the family over a video call, promising them Rs 25 lakh in financial aid, a government job for a family member as a school teacher, a house under a government and that the trial would be taken up in a fast-track court. The forensic report, meanwhile, is not in yet. The medical report, based on an examination a week after she had been hospitalised, had not found evidence of rape given the long time that had passed. The rape, officially, has not been confirmed two weeks since she was brutalised.

October 1, 2020||Trichy||Blood volunteers help needy in Pudukottai||Trichy: A group of people in Pudukottai district, on realizing the ordeal faced in getting blood donors for critically ill patients during Covid-19 pandemic, have started a WhatsApp group with voluntary blood donors. They help in getting the required units for people in need. Named ‘Kuruthikoodu’-- meaning blood nest-- the group now has members who were benefitted by this initiative. The 50-day-old group has expanded to over 200 members and have managed to get 102 units of blood for patients in Pudukottai government medical college hospital so far. While National Voluntary Blood Donation Day is observed on October 1 every year to highlight the importance of safe blood to save lives, the group is planning to launch a website to help the needy free of cost. While the number of non-Covid patients frequenting government hospitals for treatment has increased as private hospital are closed, donors still feel scared to visit government hospital. Pudukottai government hospital has attended over 3,000 deliveries since Covid-19 outbreak. This is 30% more than the normal, which has increases the need for blood donors, but the number of donors has come down amid Covid fear. Syed Ibrahim, 23, one of the core members of the group said that when we went to Pudukottai government hospital for donating blood, we came across people in desperate need for blood for surgeries. We come across numerous messages seeking blood donors for emergency surgery or treatment. We, then, formed Kurithikoodu to ensure that if a request comes from any source and if it is genuine, we fulfil their need, he said. Last week, we went to donate two units of blood, but we came across more need as a woman was to deliver twins and they urgently needed two units of O-negative blood. A relative of the person, who we recently helped, arranged for O negative blood by calling his friends. Now, he is part of our group, said K Muthuramalingam, another member of the group. We have a database of over 200 donors, who will be ready to donate blood whenever needed. As soon as a request comes and it is verified, one of the members will post it in the group and we will identify the nearest possible donor, said Ibrahim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/blood-volunteers-help-needy-in-pudukottai/articleshow/78416159.cms||Sampath Kumar

As per the ‘Crime in India-2019’ report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Tuesday, Bihar recorded 66 deaths due to ‘negligence by civic bodies’, followed by Karnataka (50) and Telangana and Chandigarh (5 each) last year. Altogether 154 deaths due to negligence of civic bodies were reported nationwide. Altogether 31 deaths ‘due to medical negligence’ were recorded in Bihar, followed by UP and Madhya Pradesh (26 each). Altogether 216 deaths due to medical negligence were reported nationwide last year. Bihar ranked second in cases of dowry deaths. Altogether 1127 dowry deaths were reported in state. Uttar Pradesh topped the chart with 2424 dowry deaths. Madhya Pradesh was third (550) in the country, which had 7162 dowry deaths last year. There were 7,262 cases of rioting in Bihar in which 10,773 persons became the victim last year. As per categorisation of rioting cases, Bihar remained on top with 135 cases of communal violence in which 207 persons became the victims. Jharkhand was second state with 54 cases of communal violence, followed by Haryana (50). Nationwide, 440 communal violence cases with 593 victims were reported last year. Bihar also remained on top with 29 cases of sectarian violence, followed by Gujarat with 26 cases. In rioting over caste conflicts, Bihar remained way ahead of other states with 131 cases and 269 victims. Overall, 492 such cases with 721 victims were reported countrywide. As per the NCRB report, 940 cases of agrarian violence were reported in Bihar with 1136 victims. This figure is also maximum among the states and UTs.

Bihar stood second in rioting over money dispute with 184 cases and 386 victims. Maharashtra topped the chart with 416 such incidents and 531 victims. Sociologist DM Diwakar said poor medical infrastructure in state might be a reason behind the medical negligence cases. “Most of the districts don’t have ventilator support. Posts of doctors are lying vacant. ASHAs and auxiliary nurse midwives are ill-paid and don’t visit places where they should,” he said. The rise in crime graph, he said, is due to weak political will and loose grip on administration after 2015. “Another reason for rise in crime is that people now resist and approach police which reflects in increased number of criminal cases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ncrb-bihar-tops-in-deaths-due-to-negligence-of-medical-civic-bodies/articleshow/78414946.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Her relatives said they never consented; police and administration said they did. “Police wanted us to cremate her body without any delay,” the girl’s brother told TOI.

The CPR hospital administration has denied the allegation. The CPR hospital authorities claimed that the death audit has been done and none of the patients died because of the incident or while shifting them to a safe ward. The hospital administration has claimed that only one of the three who died was from the room where the fire broke and the remaining two were from the other rooms of the centre. Mali said the panel will focus on the reasons for the fire. The panel checked the electrical circuits and the ventilators. The CPR hospital has claimed that the short circuit of the electrical board took place and not the ventilator. Meanwhile, minister of state for health Rajesh Patil-Yadravkar visited the hospital. He lauded the efforts of the nurses and other staff involved in shifting the patients. He said the fire audit of the hospital will be done soon and measures according to the audit will be taken to stop such incidents in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/inquiry-panel-checks-out-site-of-fire-at-cpr-hospital-to-submit-report-soon/articleshow/78412271.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Kolhapur||Beds vacant but Covid deaths on higher side||KOLHAPUR: The daily Covid deaths in Kolhapur district continues to be on the higher side despite a dip in the daily Covid-19 cases and an increase in the number of beds with oxygen and ventilator beds vacant in hospitals. Higher number of deaths are being reported from private hospitals and the administration will audit the causes of death. On Tuesday, 205 Covid cases were reported and 25 patients succumbed to the infection. Earlier the deaths were mainly due to delay in treatment as beds for not available. However, now 61% of beds are vacant of which 260 are beds with oxygen. The health officials have taken up the task to audit the cause of deaths in such large numbers to frame the strategy for bringing the death rate to zero.  A senior health official requesting anonymity said, “After analysing the statistics, we found that most deaths are being reported from private hospitals. For instance, Of the 25 deaths, 16 were recorded in private hospitals while the rest were reported in dedicated Covid hospital and Covid care centres.” The official said, “The experts of the task force will be asked to audit the deaths from the private hospitals and find out whether the death is due to faulty treatment. The critical patients are mostly referred to government hospitals. We have a good recovery rate of the critical patients admitted in our hospitals.” The dip in the number of fresh cases is mainly due to slowing down of the community spread, the official said.  The epidemic cycle of 120 days is completed and this is the phase where the number of cases reduces. “The curve of the epidemic cycle is declining. However, the carelessness of some people may lead to a further spike in the number cases as we are observing at many places. The slowing down phase is for the next two weeks as per our estimates,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/beds-vacant-but-covid-deaths-on-higher-side/articleshow/78412317.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Meerut||Woman cop complains of sexual harassment||MEERUT: A woman constable - in her mid-20s - posted at Bulandshahr's Mahila thana has levelled allegations of molestation and harassment against the SHO of Gulawati police station. An inquiry under a special team has been ordered. After lodging her complaint on the chief minister's portal and also to other senior cops, she has appealed to the state saying, "When big talks are being done in the name of women's safety, I petition the government to take cognizance of what wrong has been done to me and take appropriate action." Ironically, the woman constable is deputed in anti-Romeo squad, a special force carved out of UP Police to keep a check on sexual harassment, soon after BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Taking cognizance, SSP Santosh Singh has instituted an inquiry under a special team. "I have received the constable's complaint and have ordered an inquiry into the matter with clear directions that the report be submitted to me within a week. If the accused is found guilty, strict action will be taken against him," the SSP said on Wednesday. The woman was posted at Gulawati police station from July 2017 to July 2020 and was later transferred to Bulandshahr Mahila thana. In her written complaint, she claims, "SHO Sachin Malik was posted in Gulawati police station in February this year and ever since passed lewd remarks and would even touch me inappropriately. He also wanted me to befriend his male friends and once dragged me into a room where his friends were consuming liquor.” The complaint further states, "My protests had little effect on him and on the contrary he would hurl abuses at me and threatened to ruin my career. I was much relieved when I got transferred but even now he continued with his tirade against me through character assassination and keeping tab on my whereabouts." SHO Malik, meanwhile, has refuted all the charges. "When I took charge here [Gulawati police station], I found her work shoddy. She was a record keeper and all the registers and documentation were incomplete. Despite giving her warnings - both in written and verbal - she did not improve. Later, a new record keeper was deputed. In July, she was transferred. Now, a gym owner who she was friendly with has been arrested for harassment in some other case which is why she has levelled these allegations," the SHO, who is in his mid-30s, said.

October 1, 2020||Lucknow||All 32 accused in Babri demolition case let off as CBI fails to produce evidence||LUCKNOW: A special CBI court on Wednesday acquitted all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, giving major relief to saffron stalwarts like former deputy PM L K Advani, former UP CM Kalyan Singh, former Union minister M M Joshi, former MP CM Uma Bharti, Bajrang Dal founder Vinay Katiyar and three BJP MPs — Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Lallu Singh and Sakshi Maharaj. In his order running into 2,300 pages, the judge, Surendra Kumar Yadav, said the demolition was not pre-planned and was the handiwork of “arajak tattva (unruly element )” among the kar sevaks. Also, the CBI couldn’t prove that the accused Sangh Parivar functionaries were behind any conspiracy to demolish the 16th-century structure on December 6, 1992. He said the CBI could not produce any conclusive evidence against any accused. “Even VHP leader late Ashok Singhal was trying to stop kar sevaks from demolishing the disputed structure because the idol of Lord Ram was also inside the structure,” the judge wrote in the verdict, delivered on the last day of his tenure. The court also accepted the defence's plea that Ram Lalla’s idols were not removed from the mandir-masjid complex and it was left to the priest, Satyendra Das, to take those out at the last moment, showing that the accused had no plans to demolish the structure. Judge Yadav also agreed with the defence that the structure was demolished by miscreants who defied the directive by BJP and VHP leaders assembled at Ram Katha Kunj to restrict themselves to symbolic kar seva in the vicinity of the now-demolished mosque. When asked, CBI counsel Lalit Singh said a copy of the judgment would be sent to the agency headquarters in Delhi which would take a further decision. Just as the accused were acquitted, some of them in the court loudly chanted "Jai Shri Ram" in the presence of the judge. In the much-awaited hearing, the judge occupied his chair in the courtroom at 12.10pm and within five minutes read out the operative part of the judgment, pronouncing acquittal of all the accused. The judge had superannuated on September 30, 2019 but the Supreme Court had extended his service period till delivery of the judgment. The judge did not accept newspapers as pieces of evidence as the original sources of them were not produced and proved. He also did not rely on the photos of incidents as their negatives were not produced. "The video cassettes were not sealed and even the videos were not clear and as such the same cannot be relied upon," observed the judge. "We have been reiterating from the very beginning that there is no evidence in the case and all accused were falsely implicated by the CBI under influence of the then Congress government," said defence counsel Vimal Kumar Srivastava. In his verdict, the judge also observed that there was an intelligence report that some untoward incident might take place on December 6, 1992 but it was not probed. He referred to a note that then Union home secretary Prabhat Kumar had sent on December 5, 1992, which said that elements backed by Pakistani agencies had mingled with kar sevaks. A meeting was also held to discuss this note and there were reports that 100 anti-national elements from Kashmir's Udhampur had entered Ayodhya, but this part was never probed, the court observed. The CBI had filed a chargesheet in October 1993 against 49 accused. Out of them, 17 accused, including Ashok Singhal, Bal Thackeray and Vijaya Raje Scindia are no more. The agency produced 351 witnesses and over 600 written documents, apart from video and audio evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-32-accused-in-babri-demolition-case-let-off-as-cbi-fails-to-produce-evidence/articleshow/78416833.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Shahar Qazi, Maulana Jartab Raza Khan, one of the most eminent clerics, said that the verdict was delivered by the court of law and everyone in the country, regardless of religion, was supposed to abide by it. “The present period of time is extremely sensitive due to mounting tension on the India-China and India-Pakistan borders. The country is already confronting Covid-19 that has hit our economic growth. In such a situation, the restoration of development work, education of children and better medical facilities to corona-infected people should be the only priority without any tussle over religious issues,” Khan said. Another cleric, Mufti Sajid Hasni, said, “We have a responsibility to project a united India today before China and Pakistan, rather than indulge in fighting over temples and mosques." Meanwhile, a heavy police force was deployed to prevent any untoward incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/clerics-in-pilibhit-want-people-to-abide-by-courts-babri-verdict/articleshow/78411259.cms||---

All the jawans belong to the same battalion. While the number of cases continue to rise in the district, the infection rate has dropped. The low infection rate points out to the fact that the number of cases found positive out of the total people getting tested is on the decline. For instance, on Tuesday, out of the total 4,173 samples tested, 238 people tested positive which is 5.7% infection rate - a dip from the earlier recorded 10% infection rate. “As many as 34 jawans from 108 rapid action force tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. All their contacts are being traced and their testing is being done. This is even as the infection rate in the district is on the decline,” Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut's chief medical officer, said. The total tally of Covid-19 cases in Meerut has crossed 9,000 and death toll has touched the 200-mark. “Testing is being done on a daily basis and a record of Covid patients is being kept and containment activities in the district are on to check the spread of the virus,” Dr Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/34-jawans-test-covid-ve-in-meerut-infection-rate-drops-to-5-7/articleshow/78412323.cms||Ishita Bhatia
October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Murphy Town rejoices as ground back with residents||BENGALURU: On Wednesday morning, young sportspersons dressed in their favourite team jerseys lined the narrow bylane leading to the Murthy Town ground, also known as the Dr Ambedkar playground. There was hope in their eyes and prayer on their lips as they joined hundreds of sport enthusiasts and residents as they waited for CV Raman Nagar MLA S Raghu. The people’s representative did not disappoint. On September 24, TOI had reported on the BBMP’s plan to convert the public ground — which is home to the Primrose Hockey Club and Murphy Town Football Club — into a nine-a-side football stadium. The residents had appealed to the authorities not to deprive them of their multi-sport ground and lung space. They opposed the move which would have also seen commercial establishments come up along the periphery of the ground. The bhoomi puja for the same was held on September 7. Following the report in TOI, the MLA and BBMP officials met the residents and assured them that they would reconsider the proposal. On Friday, Raghu visited the ground along with BBMP officials and met the residents. After a lengthy discussion, they decided to shelve the plan to construct the football stadium and consider the residents’ plan. The civil engineers among the residents have come up with a plan to give the ground a facelift. The ground will be redone into a hockey/football gravel ground with a 70x100m dimension and will include a sports complex with dressing room facilities, washrooms, indoor games hall and a fitness centre. One end of the ground will also have basic fitness equipment for public use. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 7 crore with a drainage facility being one of the prime expenditure. Speaking to TOI, Raghu said, “When the residents met me, I understood their needs and assured them that their ground will be renovated according to their requirements. We want the children of the locality to have the best sporting facility. I have asked their representatives to meet the architects and work on the blueprint. The facility will be completed in two phases. Phase One will be completed by April 14, while the facility will be ready with all amenities by August 15.” Seasoned hockey coach Edward Brient, who was part of the meeting, said, “We are very grateful to the MLA, who responded to our plea in quick time. The upgrade is a dream come true for us and we are happy that we get to keep our ground. The bhoomi puja for the renovation will be held on Friday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/murphy-town-rejoices-as-ground-back-with-residents/articleshow/78413634.cms||Manuja Veerappa

October 1, 2020||Meerut||Babri verdict: Darul ‘disappointed’, Zafaryab Jilani to move high court||Muzaffarnagar: Renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband on Wednesday flagged its “disappointment” with the CBI court verdict acquitting all the 32 people booked 28 years ago for their alleged role in demolition of Babri mosque in Ayodhya. Vice-chancellor of the seminary Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani said, “The entire world witnessed the demolition which took place on December 6, 1992. They also saw the faces of those who did it. And after all that, such a verdict is a big disappointment. Even the court had earlier said that the demolition of Babri mosque structure was against the law. Now this verdict is beyond our understanding. This is a high time when we should try to improve the image of our courts.” Zafaryab Jilani, one of the most prominent faces in the Ayodhya case, suggested that he will move the high court if the CBI doesn’t file an appeal against the verdict. “Observation of the CBI court that there was no sufficient evidence against the accused is wrong. There was enough evidence to convict all of them who were addressing and inciting the mob on that day,” said Jilani, the convener of Babri Masjid Action Committee. He added, “We will challenge the verdict in the high court.” In Deoband, a city with prominently Muslim population, life went on as usual. But a few elderly and clerics, who witnessed the demolition of the mosque in 1992, recalled the day again. About after nine months when the Supreme Court had paved the way for a grand temple at the spot where the dilapidated structure once stood. Maulana Asad Farooqi said, “We had respected the Supreme Court verdict, and we respect this also. But, if I speak my mind, it is gross injustice to entire Muslim community.” Another cleric Maulana Asad Qazmi asked, “What else can you expect from this kind of government? If no one razed it, did it fall on its own?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/babri-verdict-darul-disappointed-zafaryab-jilani-to-move-high-court/articleshow/78412334.cms||Mohd Dilshad

For example, a trader operating from the rented shop at Millennium paying a monthly rent of Rs 40,000, shifted to some small market in Begumwadi where the rent is one-fourth.The survey also analysed the traders’ responses towards the Covid-19 situation and the market condition. Almost 95% of them stated their revenue have dropped to to about 70% compared to the pre-Covid period.Devkishan Manghani, chairman of SGCCI’s textile committee told TOI, “The main aim of the survey was to understand the condition of the textile markets. It is very disheartening to know that over one lakh people have lost jobs. We also found that about 20% of the shops on rent in the textile markets are yet to reopen post-lockdown.”With the Covid-19 cases on the rise in Surat during unlock-4, the buyers from other cities including Kolkata, Delhi, Punjab, Ludhiana, Haryana, Chennai, Hyderabad etc. are avoiding visit to the wholesale markets for placing new orders. This has resulted in the huge losses to the textile traders, who were anticipating good business during the approaching Diwali and marriage season starting October.On the other hand, the traders are facing biggest challenge of recovering outstanding payments for the fabrics supplied before lockdown starting from July-19, estimated at Rs 15,000 crore.Manoj Agarwal, president of FOSTTA told TOI, “An estimated Rs 15,000 crore worth of capital of Surat’s traders is stuck in various wholesale markets across the country since July 2019. Without money, traders are not able to process fresh stock. The sale of fabrics from Surat is less than 30% or Rs 40 crore per day. In such situation, traders are laying off their office staff to lessen the financial burden”Rajnish Lilah, a textile trader told TOI, “I had three staffers in my shop who were paid Rs 30,000 per month each. Since there is no business and our capital stuck in the outstanding payments, I decided to shift to other market having low rent to sustain my business. I don’t think the demand for fabric is going to come any time soon”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/one-lakh-jobs-lost-in-surat-textile-sector/articleshow/78413559.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nashik||Nashik collector okays partial restoration of O2 supply to industries||NASHIK: In a huge relief to the industries that need oxygen for their operations in Nashik, the district administration has announced partial restoration of supplies to ensure that the work can restart and employees get their wages. “Over the past few days, we have ensured increased oxygen production. At the same time, we have curtailed misuse in medical institutions. We are now in a position to restore oxygen supply to the industries, though rationing would continue,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said. The district administration had stopped supply of oxygen for manufacturing and industrial purposes on September 12 citing a shortage of oxygen for Covid-19 patients. This, however, adversely affected several industries — especially the steel sector — in the district. “At that time, our demand was for 34 tonne of oxygen while about 40 tonne was being produced. Since then, we have increased oxygen production capacity to 50 tonnes. We streamlined the use in the medical sector with the demand there now below 30 tonne. We also improvised on transportation systems and ways to get liquid oxygen from other areas and bottling systems in our district. We are in a position to partially restore the supply,” the collector said. He also cited the drop in the number of patients requiring oxygen — down from 1,140 per day to 800 per day now. Mandhare added that labour-intensive industries that require less oxygen will be given preference so that more people can earn their livelihood. Medical us, however, will remain top priority. Ambad Industries Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) president Varun Talwar welcomed the decision. “Oxygen is also required by the manufacturing sector that designs and builds products for the health sector. Due to lack of oxygen, the production of goods required in the health sector and their fabrication had taken a backseat,” Talwar said. Ajay Baheti, of Bhagwati Steel, said: “All nine steel industries in the district are shut. We will begin operations only if oxygen cylinders are made available. We have decided to carry out the production at a minimum level and have sought just five oxygen cylinders out of the 33 required per day. This will help at least 500 people get their wages,” Baheti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-collector-okays-partial-restoration-of-o2-supply-to-industries/articleshow/78415067.cms||Abhilash Botekar

October 1, 2020||Dehradun||Several shops gutted after massive fire in Kashipur’s vegetable market||Rudrapur: At least fifty temporary shops were gutted at a local market in Kashipur town of Udham Singh Nagar district on Tuesday late night. However, there has been no report of any lives being lost. The cause behind the fire is told to be a short circuit. The fire broke out in the old mandi area, located in the middle of the city, in which goods worth crores of rupees are said to have been charred. The blaze was detected at around 10:30 pm at a garments store. Soon after, the fire engulfed the surrounding shops, the shopkeepers told TOI. By the time the fire extinguishers were brought to the spot, several shops were already burning, the locals said. “As many as 50 shops were reduced to ashes as firefighters struggled for three hours to contain the blaze. Two cooking gas cylinders kept at a tea stall also exploded due to the fire and as a consequence, the firefighters had to pull back for a while,” said Prabhat Sahni, member of Kashipur traders’ union. Several fire tenders were pressed into service to ensure that the flames were contained and did not spread to the residential area nearby. “These shopkeepers have incurred cumulative losses of more than Rs 1 crore. We demand compensation from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for these small shopkeepers, who have already suffered immensely due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown,” said Sandeep Sehgal, another local trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/several-shops-gutted-after-massive-fire-in-kashipurs-vegetable-market/articleshow/78412383.cms||Aakash Ahuja

October 1, 2020||Kolhapur||Nationalist Congress Party trains guns on Udayanraje, Sambhajiraje||KOLHAPUR: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has targeted Udayanraje Bhosale and Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje, both from the family of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, over the Maratha reservation issue. NCP chief Sharad Pawar told the media in Pandharpur on Tuesday that both should get the issue resolved by BJP as both of them are Rajya Sabha members due to the party. “Both should take the initiative and put pressure on the Union government. They can do this as both of them got Rajya Sabha nominations because of BJP,” Pawar said, adding that it was the final responsibility of the Union government to grant reservation for the Maratha community. Sambhajiraje, in his Twitter handle, wrote on Tuesday that he was the first member of Parliament to raise the issue of Maratha reservation. Hours after Pawar’s remark, his daughter Supriya Sule, who is Lok Sabha member from Baramati, put up a FB post saying that she was happy that Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje was taking the initiative for Maratha reservation. Pawar’s comments on Udayanraje and Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje come amid strong demand from various Maratha organizations that one of them should lead the agitation over the issue. NCP’s close ties with both the representatives of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s family have turned sour since last year. Udayanraje, who was associated with NCP for a long time and represented Satara Lok Sabha constituency, joined BJP, and contested a byelection in 2019. Pawar was upset with his decision and ensured his defeat in the by-election. While Udayanraje’s decision to join BJP was mainly attributed to local politics in Satara district, NCP leaders were bitter as he had been given the nomination despite strong opposition from the party. Relationship between Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje and Sharad Pawar also has a similar history. Sambhajiraje was an NCP candidate from Kolhapur in 2009. He, however, lost the election with 45,000 votes against Sadashiv Mandlik, an independent, who was a close associate of Sharad Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ncp-trains-guns-on-udayanraje-sambhajiraje/articleshow/78412380.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Surat||Spike in Surat’s semi-urban neighbourhood||Surat: It’s not just Diamond City, but even the semi-urban pockets surrounding it too have come under Covid-19’s unrelenting grip. Of the nine talukas in Surat district, four semi-urban talukas — Palsana, Kamrej, Choriyasi and Bardoli — teeming with industrial and real estate activities, are the worst-affected with sharp spike in Coronavirus cases after unlock-1. Going by health authorities’ data, about 140 people on an average are getting infected daily in the district, of whom nearly 70% cases are reported from these four talukas alone. While Palsana, Kamrej and Bardoli are located around 20-40km off Surat, Choriyasi taluka shares its border with the city. Palsana and Kamrej talukas are the industrial hotspots housing many textile, chemical, textile ancillary and engineering units. With huge presence of migrant workers in these talukas, cases spiked especially after the migrant workers returned to work here from their natives. District health authorities stated that these semi-urban areas have high concentration of industrial units including textiles, chemical, and engineering among others where many migrant workers get employment opportunities. Till now, the district has reported a total of 7,500 Covid-19 cases while 250 have succumbed to the deadly virus. According to health authorities’ figures, Kamrej taluka has recorded 1,457 positive cases and 82 deaths due to Covid-19. Choryasi taluka recorded 1,379 cases and 31 deaths, Palsana taluka 1,100 cases and 23 deaths while Bardoli reported 1,244 cases and 37 deaths from coronavirus. The other districts including tribal dominated Umarpada taluka, however, has recorded 70 cases till now with only one death. Mandavi recorded 341 cases with 15 deaths, Mahuva 357 cases with five deaths and Mangrol 681 cases with 20 deaths. In the last couple of years, Choriyasi taluka has seen a lot of development in the real estate sector due to its proximity to Surat airport. The world’s largest Surat Diamond Bourse (SDA) is coming up at Khajod village in Choriyasi taluka while Surat International Exhibition and Convention Centre (SIECC) of the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) too is located in Sarsana village of Khajod. Many residential projects too have come up in Choriyasi taluka in the past two years, owing to its proximity to the airport as well as the SDA. Dr Hasmukh Chaudhary, chief district health officer (CDHO) told TOI, “Majority of Covid-19 cases are reported from four semi-urban talukas which comprise 70% of the population of the district. This spike can be attributed to violation of social distancing norms and people not protecting themselves by wearing masks.” Dr Chaudhary further said that cases started spiralling during unlock-1 with the inflow of migrant workers after resumption of industrial activities. Also, travelling frequently to Surat for work and business purposes also added to spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/spike-in-surats-semi-urban-neighbourhood/articleshow/78413615.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||After hiccups, kids now again getting vaccines||Nagpur: Vaccination schedule for kids is slowly coming back on track after being almost put on hold in the early days of the pandemic. In April, and first half of May, both parents and paediatricians were vary about risking kids’ health and no proper guidelines were available from authorities.Senior paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari said now parents too are comfortable with bringing their little ones to clinics. “Earlier it was obviously fear which kept parents away. That had put affected the schedule but now things have started to normalize. A new schedule has been planned and parents are following the updated version,” said Dr Deopujari. Paediatrician and adolscent counselor Dr. Rajiv Mohta said “WHO released guidelines later on the vaccination process so there was some clarity. It was obviously important for kids to be vaccinated so that they do not contract other diseases. Missing MMR makes them susceptible to Measles, and can complicate health issues. Swine Flu and Pneumonia vaccination is also crucial during this Covid-19 pandemic.” Dr Mohta added that most doctors are making changes to the way their OPD now functions. “Patients are divided between infectious and non-infectious (basically coming for vaccine). Those coming for vaccines, and are non-infectious, are called in the morning when no other patients are there. This way they are in a premises which has no germs present,” said Dr Mohta. Paediatrician Dr Ravi Bhelonde said the backlog of vaccination is now getting cleared very fast. “I would almost 90% of those who had missed the schedule have come regularized the schedule. There is no shortage of vaccines in the market due to which we are also able to administer all the doses properly,” said Dr Bhelonde. USA-based Centre for Disease Control (CDC) says getting a “flu vaccine is more important than ever during 2020-2021 to protect yourself and the people around you from flu, and to help reduce the strain on healthcare systems responding to the COVID-19 pandemic”. The organization in its online portal goes on to say that one must get a “flu vaccine before flu viruses begin spreading in your community, since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against flu”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-hiccups-kids-now-again-getting-vaccines/articleshow/78415097.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

October 1, 2020||Kolhapur||Marathi film body insists on following rules||KOLHAPUR: Taking serious note of veteran Marathi actress Ashalata Wabgaonkar’s death due to Covid-19 during shooting of a serial, the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal has stepped in to ensure all the norms laid down by the government are followed. Mahamandal has 47,000 members including artists, directors, musicians, producers, camera personnel and all those associated with the film industry. The Mahamanda has warned all the production houses, involved in serials and films, that it would not hesitate to take legal action with the help of police and local administration if they receive complaints about violation of government rules. Meghraj Bhosale, the president of Mahamandal, told TOI that they had received feedback about norms like social distancing, medical check-up and washing of hands not being followed at many shooting locations. “We have received complaints of one room being shared by three or four people”, he said. Bhosale said that Mahamandal was in contact with its members for the feedback after Ashalata’s death to know the ground reality at the shooting locations. Bhosale said it was the responsibility of the industry to follow all the rules. However, sources in the Marathi film industry said things were getting compromised mainly because of the cost factor. “We will have to inflate our budget if the government rules are to be followed, which is not possible”, said a prominent producer on the condition of anonymity. Bhosale, however, said he has communicated to all the producers to take special care of the elderly, who might have health issues due to the age. “Government will be forced to rethink about the permission if an incident like this happens again. It will create more problems for the industry”, he said. The shootings are being opposed at few villages after the death of Ashalata Wabgaonkar, said the sources. The residents have approached the administration with complaints about Covid rules not being followed. Film and serial shootings are currently taking place at around 150 places in Maharashtra. Officials in Satara district said shootings of 15 Marathi serials were in progress while more applications for permission are pending. Satara and Kolhapur districts are favourite destinations because of their scenic beauty and infrastructure.  On September 22, veteran Marathi actress Ashalata Wabgaonkar succumbed to Covid-19 in a private hospital in Satara. She was in Satara for the shooting a serial. Officials had identified 22 Covid patients involved in the shooting of the serial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/marathi-film-body-insists-on-following-rules/articleshow/78412416.cms||---

Consequently, the forest department placed cages at two places and CCTV cameras at six spots in an effort to track and capture the animal,” said sub divisional officer of Pithoragarh Naveen Pant. On September 28, hunter Sayed Allauddin Hadi reached Pithoragarh from Meerut, as two teams of the forest department constantly remained on the lookout for the animal. At 4 am on Wednesday, some villagers spotted the animal and informed Hadi, who then reached the spot and killed it. “It was an 11-year-old, 7 feet and 4 inches long male leopard. It had an injured tooth which is why it was unable to hunt and preyed on humans,” Pant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-eater-shot-dead-in-pithoragarh/articleshow/78412410.cms||Prem Punetha

October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Ease mobile ban in Covid hospitals: Calcutta HC to govt||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Wednesday eased cellphone restrictions in all Covid hospitals, including Medical College Hospital and MR Bangur hospital — the biggest state-run Covid facilities — unless “compelling circumstances” but added it didn’t find the April order banning cellphones in Covid hospitals unreasonable. The HC said it had “full faith and trust” that the state will not unnecessarily restrict cellphone usage in hospitals and take steps to lessen — and eliminate — any problem the patients and their families may face due to such restrictions. A division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee passed the 14-page order on four writ petitions challenging the state’s cellphone ban order. The state government had told the HC that the April order was based on medical suggestions that phone usage could spread infection. But now it has been largely relaxed. In addition, there are intercom facility and wireless GSM-based phones in Covid wards in which relatives can call directly. There were video-calling facilities as well and the Covid-19 Patients Management System (CPMS) also helped patients’ kin to track daily health status, it was told. In MCH and MR Bangur, some restrictions are in place because of the higher percentage of critical patients, the state added. The petitioners challenged this alleging no state other than Bengal has done this. Without a cellphone, a patient will be cut-off from their family. This, the petitions argued, is infringement on the right to communicate – a fundamental right – and singling out and banning mobile phones is absurd, since anything can be a potential Covid carrier. Instead, they argued, cellphones will keep patients in a better frame of mind and help recover quickly. Advocate Indrajit Dey said: “This ban impacted not just patients but more critically doctors and health workers.” The HC said: “It is true that there is no conclusive evidence that mobile phones are potential carriers. It is equally true that there is no conclusive evidence that mobile phones cannot be potential carriers. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that it was wholly unreasonable, imprudent or arbitrary to impose a ban on use of phones inside Covid hospitals.” The HC further added: “The situation was such that everybody was groping in the dark in search of ways to restrict the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. In such a situation, often it becomes necessary for the people in governance to take a decision on a trial-and-error basis or to impose certain restrictions on the members of the society for the safety of their health which may have the effect of curtailment of some of their constitutional rights.” The HC said it isn’t convinced with the state reasoning on the continuing cellphone restrictions in MCH and MR Bangur because they have more critical patients. “It is not quite acceptable that all the other hospitals are treating less critical patients than the aforesaid two hospitals,” the HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ease-mobile-ban-in-cov-hosps-hc-to-govt/articleshow/78415135.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Surat||Of 64K migrant workers tested, 1,108 found infected||Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has tested over 64,000 migrant workers who returned to the city in last one and half months. Of these 1,108 have tested positive for Covid-19. In wake of this, the SMC has asked diamond and textile units to ensure that they get their workers checked. The civic body has also asked them to check the temperature and oxygen level of the workers twice a day and if they are found below the standard level, they should be referred to hospitals for treatment. A SMC official said that a large number of migrant workers, who had gone to their native in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha were returning for work. “Workers coming from other states need isolate themselves for seven days and remain in quarantine to stall the spread of the virus,” said the official. SMC officials also asked industrial units to keep record of visitors so that they can be traced if required. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, SMC’s enforcement teams closed the vegetable market near APMC in the city a huge crowd had turned up to buy vegetables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/of-64k-migrant-workers-tested-1108-found-infected/articleshow/78413649.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Dehradun||HC-appointed monitoring committee for Doon suggests complete 15-day lockdown||Nainital: The district-level monitoring committee in Dehradun, formed to tackle the coronavirus situation on direction of the Uttarakhand high court (HC), has suggested a “complete lockdown” for “at least 15 days”. Uttarakhand has been recording close to 1,000 fresh Covid-19 cases of late and recently lifted the mandatory Covid-19 negative report clause for those travelling to the state. “All the present, learned officers suggested a complete lockdown for a minimum period of 15 days after giving prior notice to the public, so that they can arrange required supplies in advance, subject to the economic activities,” read the report, a copy of which is with the TOI. The court has given the state government a week to respond to the suggestions made by the committee. The committee also suggested that all political activities like rallies, political meetings, assemblies and processions be restricted to prevent gatherings. In view of the large number of cases surfacing among security personnel, it suggested that a mechanism should be developed for their safe movement and lodging. Meanwhile, the reports submitted by districts like US Nagar and Nainital suggested that challans for not wearing masks should be hiked at least four times and that the government should ensure enough quantity of oxygen supply at hospitals. As reported by TOI last week, the bench of Acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe had directed the constitution of district level monitoring committees, which would visit the state’s quarantine centres, hospitals and all other medical facilities and suggest ways to tackle the pandemic. All the committees, except the one from Bageshwar, have sent in their reports. “The court had directed the state government to inform by the next date of hearing (October 7) what can be done to implement the suggestions made by the committee,” said Shiv Bhatt, the counsel appearing for one of the petitioners. The court has also directed the committee from Bageshwar to submit its report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-appointed-monitoring-committee-for-doon-suggests-complete-15-day-lockdown/articleshow/78412429.cms||Prashant Jha
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Sharod Samman for best Covid-compliant Puja||Kolkata: With apprehensions of a surge in number of Covid cases post Durga Puja, the Covid Care Network (CCN) has stepped in to advocate safe practices for the prevention of virus spread during the festivity. The organisation will be awarding Sharod Samman to organizers on the basis of compliance with Covid-preventive measures in and around pandals. “This year, Durga Puja is under extraordinary conditions. If people come out in hordes and throng pandal unrestricted, we might have to bear with heavy consequences post the festival. The most guarded Puja as far as health norms are concerned should be the best ones this year. Revellers also should understand that this year is not ideal for the usual pandal hopping in groups,” said SSKM hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury of CCN. The organisation was set up by Covid winners, their families and healthcare professionals to demystify unscientific information on Covid-19 and eradicate the fear and stigma attached to the infection. “Our volunteers will visit randomly selected puja pandals and observe how well the latter are following Covid-preventive guidelines and also attempt to motivate people for behavioural modification. We have to live with the new normal as Covid is not going to go away soon. We need to be practising the preventive measures all the time,” said public health activist Partha Sarathi Mukherjee, treasurer of CCN. Volunteers of CCN will also be working on raising awareness on the importance of preventive protocols like wearing masks, hand washing, maintaining physical distancing and no spitting during the festivity. The organisation might set up kiosks near the pandals for such campaigns and organize cycle rallies in different towns with Covid awareness messages. Its volunteers will be carrying out similar activities in the districts as well. Doctors said that staying indoors during the festivity is the best way to protect oneself from getting infected and also containing the spread of the virus. But they apprehend that many are going to come out for pandal-hopping. “The government has already issued guidelines to make the celebrations safe. But we as citizens should also have to behave responsibly to follow the health guidelines that are key to preventing the spread of the infection,” said Chowdhury. The organisation has units in 10 districts. Its 24X7 helpline service will run during the festival to help Covid patients in distress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sharod-samman-for-best-covid-compliant-puja/articleshow/78415184.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
October 1, 2020||Surat||No trace of former MLA’s son even after 37 days||Surat: Even after 37 days of being booked in an extortion case, the city police are clueless about the whereabouts of Anirudhsinh Jadeja, son of former MLA Mahipatsinh Jadeja from Ribda in Gondal. Earlier, police had checked at his residence and other places of possible hideouts, but he was not found. Jadeja and nine others were named in the complaint lodged in Sarthana police station by Raju Desai, a real estate developer, who alleged that he borrowed Rs four crore from Shailesh Bhatt, one of the key accused in multi-crore crypto currency case of 2015. Despite repaying the borrowed money, the accused demanded more and then involved Jadeja who sent his men and encroached an apartment in an underconstruction property of 17 residential buildings in Laskana area. Desai is also one of the accused in the crypto-currency case with Bhatt. Considering the involvement of some high-profile criminals, the case was transferred to detection of crime branch (DCB) by city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. However, crime branch teams are yet to trace Jadeja. Police have already arrested nine accused in the case including Bhatt.“Jadeja is on the run but we are making all efforts to nab him. He will be arrested soon,” said Tomar.Sources in police informed that Jadeja was running a racket of extortion and land encroachment in parts of south Gujarat with the tacit support of some police officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/no-trace-of-former-mlas-son-even-after-37-days/articleshow/78413682.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Kolhapur||452 cases & 18 deaths in Kolhapur district||KOLHAPUR: The district reported 452 fresh Covid-19 cases and 18 deaths on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 44,434. The death toll has now risen to 1,441. A total of 34,064 have recovered while 9,929 cases are active. Of the 18 deaths, 9 are reported in private hospitals. From seven, the number of hotspots in Kolhapur city has come down to three. Currently, Rajarampuri, Kasba Bawda and Shivaji Peth are the hotspots. Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti, who rode his bicycle to work, warned citizens not wearing masks and those not wearing it properly. “We have undertaken a campaign to make people aware of wearing masks. During my journey on the bicycle, I appealed to the citizens to wear masks. I have asked officials to fine those violating this simple rule,” said Kalshetti. Meanwhile, Sangli district has reported 580 fresh cases and 23 deaths on Wednesday. The total number of cases has risen to 36,815, of which 1,354 have succumbed, 28,097 patients have recovered and 7,363 patients are undergoing treatment. District civil surgeon Sanjay Salunkhe said the blood banks in the district has sufficient blood for just a few days. As very few blood donation camps are being organised, the banks have less stock of blood. “Most critical surgeries require blood. Currently, many surgeries are postponed due to shortage of blood,” said Salunkhe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/452-cases-18-deaths-in-kolhapur-district/articleshow/78412426.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Lean-hour discounts, no bargain: New-normal shopping mantra in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Brisk, off-peak hour shopping and faster dispersal are the must-dos of festive shopping in the new normal. Traders and hawkers are offering special lean hours discounts — keeping a minimum margin of profit — to encourage shopping in the morning or early afternoon and avoid peak-hour overcrowding. Worried over the possibility of infection spread following the weekend shopping frenzy at the city’s shopping districts, traders have proposed to the police and civic body to extend shopping hours on the weekends. After doing away with odd-even shop opening schemes at three major shopping districts — Gariahat, New Market and Hatibagan — hawkers are now ready to keep shops open early and close late — if allowed by the administration — to avoid overcrowding at any particular time of the day. Wholesale markets in Burrabazar and Posta are already opening early and closing by 6pm to avoid evening peak-hour rush. “We are asking shoppers to come in the morning or early afternoon, when they can shop peacefully without jostling. Some traders are offering morning shopping discounts that may not be available during the peak hours,” said Sushil Poddar, president of the Confederation of West Bengal Traders’ Association. “Since it is a matter of public health, people are also very conscious. They also want brisk-shopping. We have asked our hawker-members not to think of wider profit margin at this time of distress. They should not get into hard bargain with buyers. If they buy things at a reasonable price, people will complete shopping fast and disperse early. We are thus asking hawkers to sell merchandise at a fixed price. It will also reduce the hassle for buyers,” said Debraj Ghosh, general secretary of Indira Hawkers’ Union, Gariahat. As far as last Saturday and Sunday are concerned, Hatibagan proved to be better-managed when it comes to social distancing compared to New Market and Gariahat. It was possible owing to the personal supervision of Atin Ghosh, former deputy mayor and currently the deputy head of KMC board of administrator. “He has given strict instruction not to violate social distancing norms,” said Tuhin Dey, member of of the Hawkers’ Coordination committee at Hatibagan. Pandemic has changed the shopping pattern and preferences, but not the volume. “In the last few days, we have tested water on the buyers’ preference. We are thus giving more importance to utilitarian products rather than high-fashion items. People are careful not to overspend or buy something that has little value for money,” said Jagdish Mohta, a garments wholesaler at Burrabazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lean-hour-discounts-no-bargain-new-normal-shopping-mantra/articleshow/78415155.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||CP back at Lalbazar; active cases in KP dip below 200||Kolkata: Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma, who was working from home for the past couple of weeks after being infected with Covid-19, rejoined office at Lalbazar on Wednesday. Sharma had tested positive on September 10 and had opted for home isolation after he showed some mild symptoms. On Wednesday, he tweeted about his return to Lalbazar. “Back in office after recovering from #Covid-19. Was working from home for the last few weeks. Thank you all for the good wishes!! #fightagainstcorona #WearMask #WeCareWeDare,” he tweeted. In between working from home, Sharma presided over a number of important police activities that included arrangements for reopening of Metro services, the NEET exams and the special night checks besides supervising the police preparedness for Durga Puja. Lalbazar sources said that DC DD Sudip Sarkar, too, has rejoined work after recovering from Covid-19. A joint commissioner heading a critical department and a DCP of an important division are still recuperating. On Wednesday, 17 new Covid cases got reported in Kolkata Police, pushing up the total infected in the force to 2,506. A total of 2,317 policemen have recovered, 15 of them on Wednesday. The total number of active cases is now 189. Kolkata Police has lost 11 personnel to Covid, including an ACP and an inspector, none of them had any major co-morbidity issue. Those who got infected are aged between 45 and 55 years. “The fact that the chief is back at Lalbazar will instil confidence in the police force. The recovery of Beniapukur OC Aloke Kumar Sarker from such a critical stage will add to the confidence,” stated a retired IPS officer. Before mid-September, active cases had gone down to 130. But it is now hovering around 150-200 per day. The average daily new cases that went down below 10 in August is now back between 15 and 20 per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cp-back-at-lalbazar-active-cases-in-kp-dip-below-200/articleshow/78415195.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Day 4 of operation to find girl in Pirana, debris choking hope||AHMEDABAD: This will be one of the longest rescue operations undertaken at the city’s largest garbage heap, Pirana. As the effort to rescue Neha Vasava, 12, entered the fourth day on Wednesday, intimations of a tragedy hung in the air like the stench of garbage. Neha along with her friend had climbed the mound of filth to look for discarded toys, on Sunday. Five earth movers have been pressed into service but Neha has not been found. AMC officials at the site are not optimistic that the girl will be alive, especially because toxic landfill gases trapped within the garbage heap can asphyxiate anyone within seconds. According local residents and police, Neha was playing at the dump along with a boy called Anil when she sank into garbage. “They had climbed the mound to search for toys, lost their balance, and collapsed into the garbage mound,” an official said. “Some passers-by managed to rescue the boy but could not find Neha.” The boy, who was finding it hard to breathe, said his head remained above garbage so he was seen and saved. Officials said that since Saturday night, the fire department has deployed five earth movers to find the girl. The officials said that several tonnes of garbage has been removed from the area but no sign of the girl has been discerned. The officials said that the operation is risky because the dump is currently soggy and vehicles can easily get stuck. Feral dogs roam the area freely, so they pose a danger as well. Besides, officials said, extreme care must be taken to ensure that Neha is pulled out without using too much force. The officials said that according to one account of the events, a landslide buried Neha in debris. Fire department officials said that they will continue the operation till Neha is found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/day-4-of-op-to-find-girl-in-pirana-debris-choking-hope/articleshow/78415194.cms||---

The woman’s husband had also shot a video of the man — whose clothes had been removed to humiliate him and hands and legs tied up — pleading for his life and uploaded it on social media. The couple was arrested after an FIR was lodged against them. The incident occurred on Tuesday night when Akram Hussain, a resident of Manauta village who worked as a labourer, went to meet a married woman at her house in the same village. Hussain was spotted in the house by the woman’s husband and son who allegedly tied him up and thrashed him. The deceased’s family has alleged conspiracy by the woman and her husband. According to the complaint filed by Hussain’s elder brother, Aslam, the woman, identified as Qamar Jahan, had called Hussain to her house where he was thrashed by the family. The victim was admitted to Sambhal district hospital where he passed away on Wednesday. Station house officer (Asmoli) Ranvir Singh told TOI that the husband and wife have been arrested. An FIR has been registered against them under section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC. When asked why charges of murder were not part of the FIR, SP (city) Yamuna Prasad said the exact cause of death was not yet known as an autopsy report was awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-thrashed-with-bricks-sticks-for-affair-with-married-woman-dies-video-of-him-pleading-for-his-life-up-on-social-media/articleshow/78411331.cms||Maria Khan

The image of the collector sitting on the floor, clicked by a man accompanying the disabled man, has gone viral, attracting appreciation.

The 50-year man, Rasul Syed, had gone to the district collector’s office over his long pending application for some issues. “When I could not sit on the chair near the collector, he sat next to me on the floor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/collector-sits-on-floor-to-listen-to-grievances-of-disabled-man/articleshow/78412445.cms||Mohammed Akhef

October 1, 2020||Surat||Businessman suicide investigation transferred to Surat crime branch||SURAT: Gujarat’s director general of police (DGP) Ashish Bhatia has transferred the controversial suicide case of billionnaire businessman Durlabh Patel to Surat’s detection of crime branch (DCB), a move that is said to be unprecedented in the Surat police’s recent history. The case of Durlabh Patel’s suicide case lodged in Mandvi police station was being probed by Surat rural police and the investigation was led by deputy superintendent of police (Bardoli), Rupal Solanki. The investigation officer has handed over papers related to the case to the RR Sarvaiya, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime branch, who will now probe the case. The custody of the five including suspended cops - police inspector LP Bodana, assistant sub inspector Kiransinh Parmar, two constables Ajay Bhopala and Vijay Shinde and local journalist Mukesh Kulkarni - was also handed over to the DCB. It is believed that the investigation was transferred after the Surat rural police accelerated investigation into the Mulad village land fraud case in which deceased Patel and his family members are suspects. The complaint in this case was registered in Kim police station of Surat district which was also transferred to the local crime branch 10 days ago. “Patel and his son Dharmesh, a complainant in his suicide case, are suspects in the land fraud case. Hence, doubts were raised that police are probing the case in a hurry so as to indirectly benefit those accused of driving the businessman to suicide,” a senior police officer told TOI. “We are satisfied that we could do a thorough investigation so far and gathered all the crucial evidences,” said Raj Kumar Pandian, inspector general of police, Surat range. Two other accused, Raju Bharwad and Bhavesh Savani, both land brokers, are in judicial custody while police are yet to arrest Kishore Koshiya, Kanaiyalal Narola and Hetal Desai named in the suicide FIR. “The investigation has been handed over to the crime branch and police will arrest the accused on run,” said Ajay Tomar, Surat police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bizman-suicide-investigation-transferred-to-surat-crime-branch/articleshow/78413713.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Madurai||HC seeks state govt response in cases of murder, farmer’s ‘custodial torture’||Madurai: Madras high court on Wednesday sought response from the state government in the Thattarmadam murder case as well as another incident in which a farmer was subjected to alleged custodial torture by Sathankulam police. The court was hearing the suo motu public interest litigation initiated following the Sathankulam custodial deaths of the father-son duo. The public prosecutor for CBI cases said that the final report filed against the nine accused policemen in the custodial deaths of P Jeyaraj and his son J Beniks, submitted before the Madurai CJM court on September 25, is yet to be taken on file. With regard to the alleged torture meted out by Sathankulam policemen to S Raja Singh, who was arrested in another case, the CB-CID which had filed a status report sought time to complete the investigation. R Sathiamoorthy, executive trustee of NGO People’s Watch who had filed an impleading petition in this case sought probe into the murder of a youth called Selvan over a property dispute this month. Several people including suspended Thattarmadam inspector of police Harikrishnan and a former AIADMK functionary M Thirumanavel were booked for their involvement in the murder. He also sought probe into the incident in which a farmer C Martin was subjected to alleged custodial torture by the Sathankulam policemen in August. A division bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam sought response from the state government with regard to these incidents. The judges directed CB-CID to submit further status report with regard to Raja Singh’s case. The judges also sought response from the state government on the feasibility of passing a comprehensive GO based on the circulars issued by the DGP prescribing standard operating procedures to be followed during arrests. The case was adjourned to November 5 for further hearing. CBCID seeks custody: Meanwhile, in the Thattarmadam murder case, CB-CID filed an application before Kovilpatti judicial magistrate I court seeking custody of Thirumanavel, Muthukrishnan, Chinnadurai and Muthuramalingam for investigation. The court granted permission to CB-CID for custodial interrogation of the four till October 6. Justice V Bharathidasan granted anticipatory bail to Selvan’s brothers T Bangaru Rajan alias Rajan and T Peter Raj alias Peter in a case registered by Thattarmadam police. PDJ seeks clarification: In a related development, a special bench comprising Justices M Sathyanarayanan and V Bharathidasan reserved orders on a reference sent by Tuticorin principal district and sessions judge (PDJ) N Logeswaran seeking clarification on jurisdiction to try the Sathankulam custodial deaths of the father-son duo. This was because the bail applications of the accused in the case are being entertained and disposed of by the Madurai principal district court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-state-govt-response-in-cases-of-murder-farmers-custodial-torture/articleshow/78416241.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Dist saw top of peak, plateau of Covid-19 in Sept: Expert||Nagpur: Though it registered the highest positive cases, deaths as well as recoveries compared in the last six months, September also brought hints of the Covid-19 curve flattening in the district. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde has said the district has probably witnessed the top of its peak and also plateau of the pandemic, with chances of flattening of curve in the last week of October. Dr Shinde told TOI, “The district’s Covid-19 data hints that the peak of Covid-19 started in second week of August. Top of the peak was probably in second week of September. New positive cases, deaths and active cases are on decline since third week of September. Test positivity rate (TPR) is yet to fall and active cases are not in negative. Average TPR of India is declining and active cases on negative growth for a week.” He added, “We can say probably the district’s peak is over. We are likely to see plateauing of active cases for 2-3 weeks in October, however, those numbers might be low. Then, the caseload will definitely decline after that. Thus, there are chances of flattening of curve from last week of October.” Daily average of tests was 2,305.6, positive cases 539 and deaths 22.33 in first 15 days of August. It increased to tests 8,795.81, cases 1,004.81 and deaths 36.5 in the second half of August. September was scary for the district. The district registered 1,465 (58.36%) of total 2,510 deaths in Vidarbha in September, which was 140% of cumulative of last six months.

October 1, 2020||Nashik||Fewer cases of dengue than last year during monsoon||NASHIK: The city has recorded 37 dengue cases this month (till September 26) as against 28 in the previous month, taking the total number of cases to 152 since January 1, but the situation is much better this year. A total of 348 dengue cases were reported during the corresponding period in 2019 because of efforts by the civic health department, like removing mosquito-breeding spots and fumigation during the monsoon. Civic officials said they have successfully brought the dengue cases under control as compared to that of last year, when 165 cases were reported in September and 117 in August. Last year, there was a spike in dengue cases following the onset of the monsoon in July, when the number was 48. The number of cases, however, increased from September. Moreover, the NMC also started 35 fever clinics in the city for screening of patients with fever and segregating them into Covid and non-Covid cases like malaria, dengue and typhoid. The civic body also conducted antigen tests on people with fever at the fever clinics for early detection of Covid-19 and provided treatment to both Covid and non-Covid patients. It also issued an advisory to the citizens in the beginning of the monsoon. The advisory included precautions such as drying water storage units like tanks once a week and covering all household storage items to prevent mosquito breeding spots, besides removing scrap material, keeping schools and office premises clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fewer-cases-of-dengue-than-last-year-during-monsoon/articleshow/78415196.cms||Tushar Pawar
October 1, 2020||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19 cases in rural AP outnumber those in cities||Visakhapatnam: Despite a stabilising trend for the last two months, Covid-19 has made strong inroads into rural areas of the state, which are reporting over 60% of cases at present. Till two months ago, urban pockets were the major contributors to the growth in numbers, with cities and towns like Vijayawada, Guntur, Kurnool, Narasaropeta, Nandyal, Anantapur, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry, Kakinada, Nellore and Kadapa accounting for a majority of cases. New clusters, however, sprang up with the gradual resumption of economic activity and the phase-wise reopening after the lockdown. For instance, in East Godavari, urban areas such as Rajahmundry, Kakinada and their surroundings contributed close to 80% of cases in the initial months of the outbreak. Now, for the last few weeks, Amalapuram revenue division has consistently outnumbered urban areas in terms of daily new infections in the district. The division alone recorded around 16,500 Covid-19 cases as of Tuesday. In Krishna district as well, Vijayawada initially accounted for between 80 to 90% of all cases, but over time, the outbreak spread to Machilipatnam and Nuzvid revenue divisions and Mudinepalli, Kaikaluru, Mopidevi and Kalindi mandals. Meanwhile, of the 50,000 cases reported from Visakhapatnam district, around 41,000 were from under Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) limits, which comprises close to half the population of the district. It was only later that new cases started to emerge from the rural and tribal pockets of Chodavaram, Paderu, Payakaraopeta, Anakapalli, Araku, Kasimkota and Sabbavaram. In West Godavari, Guntur and Kurnool, the virus has spread to almost all mandals. Special chief secretary, medical and health department, Dr KS Jawahar Reddy said new clusters have cropped up even as the state has seen a significant improvement in the number of daily infections, deaths and positivity rate. “As the districts are already self-reliant in testing capacities and treatment facilities, we asked the district collectors to prepare sub-district level plans to analyse the disease trends in the new areas and take corrective steps. Active surveillance will be conducted in these new clusters,” said Dr Jawahar Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-19-cases-in-rural-ap-outnumber-those-in-cities/articleshow/78413745.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
October 1, 2020||Vijayawada||Clamour grows for safe relocation of those displaced by monsoon floods||Vijayawada: With floodwaters receding, the call to relocate displaced families to safe areas has grown louder. Opposition parties have joined in on the demand, insisting that houses be provided to the flood-affected in Ranigari Thota, Taraka Rama Nagar, Bhupesh Gupta Nagar and other low-lying areas in the city. Over the last two years, heavy rainfall in the catchment area of irrigation projects during the monsoon has led to floods in the Prakasam Barrage. In 2019, the crest gates of the barrage remained open for 94 days, while this year the gates have been open for the past 20 days. Several areas in the city continue to get inundated once floodwater levels cross 2.2 lakh cusecs. Nor has the retaining wall along the Krishna river been able to control inundation of low-lying areas. Residents of Bhupesh Gupta Nagar, Taraka Rama Nagar who have been sheltering now for 20 days at flood relief camps arranged by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) expressed their unhappiness with the situation. Officials held a survey last year, they said, and promised them new houses in safe areas. “We lost everything in floods and are taking shelter in VMC stadium. We are unable to go for work. Floods are a major problem in the monsoon season but the government should relocate our colony and provide new houses to us,” said K John Babu, a resident of Taraka Rama Nagar. Opposition parties claimed that the delay in the construction of the retaining wall is to blame for the periodic inundation of residential colonies downstream of the Krishna river bund. “Conducting namesake surveys will not help flood victims. Government should provide them houses in safe areas. Retaining wall construction will take many more years,” said Jana Sena spokesperson Pothina Venkata Mahesh. Meanwhile, VMC authorities said they have identified beneficiaries for affordable housing in flood-affected areas and new houses will soon be allocated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/clamour-grows-for-safe-relocation-of-those-displaced-by-monsoon-floods/articleshow/78413802.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 1, 2020||Trichy||BDU VC selection: Vacant syndicate posts raise doubts||Trichy: Even as two-thirds of elected and nominated syndicate members’ posts in Bharathidasan University are either vacant or scheduled to go vacant in the next few days, the syndicate is set to start the process of selecting the next vice-chancellor on Thursday. Academicians say that the syndicate posts could have been filled earlier, but it was left vacant with an intent to influence the selection process. The tenure of vice chancellor P Manisankar, who assumed charge on January 8, 2018, ends on January 7, 2021. A three-member search committee has to be constituted to recommend a panel of three names to the chancellor for appointing the next VC. The process will start with the nomination of a member from the syndicate for the three-member committee at the special syndicate meeting on Thursday. There are a total of 18 members in the syndicate excluding the vice-chancellor. Of these, nine members — six ex-officio members and three members nominated by the chancellor — are outsiders, while the remaining nine members are teachers from within university and its affiliated colleges.These include five elected and four nominated from among teachers of the university. Out of these nine, two posts are remaining vacant while the tenure of four members will be ending in the next two weeks. “While no efforts whatsoever were taken by the university to fill the two vacant posts, the meeting of the syndicate to find its nominee was scheduled before the tenure of four of the syndicate members gets over,” said senior members from the syndicate. “In this way, the nomination process isn’t going to be impartial and a person with vested interest may become member in a responsible committee which will select the next vice chancellor,” said a syndicate member. S Mohan, former syndicate member of Alagappa University, is expected to be the syndicate nominee for the VC search panel, according to sources in BDU. The syndicate is meeting on Thursday to nominate him as the syndicate nominee. Senate nominee will be announced on October 9, following which the state government will be appointing a convener to complete the search committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-vc-selection-vacant-syndicate-posts-raise-doubts/articleshow/78416243.cms||Sampath Kumar
October 1, 2020||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh 8th in overall crime rate as per NCRB data||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh ranks eighth in India in terms of overall crime rate in India as per the latest Crime in India 2019 report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday. The state witnessed a 6.2% decrease in cognizable offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 2019 compared to the previous year. Overall, the state accounts for 3.7% of cognizable IPC offences in India. AP saw a 46% rise in number of Special and Local Laws (SLL) cases booked by cops in 2019. The state also ranks eighth in terms of crimes against women following a 7% increase in cases in 2019 compared to 2018. Meanwhile, murder cases saw 7% decrease in the same period. The state sees two murder cases on a daily basis. As per NCRB’s data, disputes pertaining to property, family, petty issues, money, and water accounted for 369 murder cases followed by 164 cases of illicit relationships. Apart from that, personal vendetta or enmity were the cause in 56 murder cases. The state stands second in terms of crimes committed by Naxalites. The state saw 1,104 cases of rape registered in 2019 with victims in over 50% cases being minors. The most common crimes against women were dowry harassment or cruelty by husband under IPC section 498-A. Sexual assault was the second-most common offence against women followed by rape. Coming to crimes against members of scheduled caste (SC) communities, AP saw a nearly 13% rise in 2019 while rate of crimes against members of scheduled tribes (ST) remained the same as the previous year. The state has an unwanted distinction of being first in terms of crimes against SCs in south India. In a worrying trend, 112 cases of rape against Dalit women and children were recorded while 37 cases of murder of Dalits were reported in 2019. The state also saw 94 cases of outraging the modesty of Dalit women. “The manner of implementation of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has been a major concern among Dalits and tribals,” said Dalit activist Kothapalli Venkata Ramana. The state also holds the dubious distinctions of having the costliest scams in India and most cases registered against police personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-8th-in-overall-crime-rate-as-per-ncrb-data/articleshow/78413704.cms||Nalla.Babu
October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Firm told to replace customer’s damaged tyre, pay Rs 4,000||BENGALURU: A firm which refused to replace a damaged car tyre under warranty or refund its cost has been ordered by a consumer court to give a brand new tyre to the customer and pay him a compensation of Rs 4,000. Umesh G Patel, 33, a resident of Vidyaranyapura, had lodged a complaint with Bangalore 1st Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on November 20, 2018 against the regional sales manager of Continental Tyre India Private Ltd in Kalasipalya. On November 12, 2016, Patel had purchased four car tyres for Rs 4,628 each from a Continental Tyre dealer and was promised a warranty period of five years. On September 21, 2018, he spotted a cut on one of the tyres and immediately approached the seller, who directed him to the regional sales manager. While Patel insisted he be given a new tyre as the product was under warranty, the manager said the damage was caused by a sharp object due to careless driving and couldn’t be covered under product warranty. The company offered to give him a new tyre at half the price in place of the damaged one, but Patel declined and approached the court. Patel presented the case on his own by producing proof, including photographs of the damaged tyre, while the regional manager’s attorney argued the complaint was false and misleading as the complainant had not even made the tyre manufacturer a party in the case. The lawyer stated it was not a manufacturing defect and the customer had damaged the tyre during driving and was attempting to make unlawful gain. After 21 months of litigation, judges of the consumer forum held that the opposite party couldn’t prove the damage was caused by an external object. In the verdict pronounced on August 17, 2020, they ordered the regional sales manager and his firm to replace Patel’s old tyre with a new one or refund him the money if he is not ready to accept the replacement. The forum also directed the company to pay Rs 2,000 towards the customer’s court expenses and an additional Rs 2,000 for causing him mental agony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/firm-told-to-replace-customers-damaged-tyre-pay-rs-4k/articleshow/78414290.cms||Petlee Peter
October 1, 2020||Nashik||Nashik: Saptashrug temple trust gets first woman trustee||NASHIK: For the first time in 45 years of its history, the Shree Saptashrung Niwasini Devi, Saptashrung Gad Trust, Nashik, has appointed a woman trustee on the board for a term of five years. Manjyot Patil was appointed as a trustee by the constituting committee comprising principal district and sessions judge Abhay Waghwase and Ganesh Deshmukh, chairperson of the trust who is also the district judge-7 of Nashik. The appointment of Patil was carried out through a process that involves inviting applications from people, going through their educational qualifications, their experience in social services, their ideas about the growth of the temple, among others. Patil was among the five candidates, including Lalit Nikam, Deepak Patodkar, Prashant Deore and Bhushanraj Talekar, who were appointed for the five-year term starting October 1, 2020. According to sources of the trust, quite a few woman candidates had applied for the said post in the past, but none of them could meet the criteria for the same. Besides, there were other women candidates who could fit the requirements, but they had never shown interest in the trustee position, the sources added. “This year, some women candidates had applied for the trustee position. After interactions with the candidates, considering their bio-data and seeking opinion of charity commissioner of Nashik, the final appointments were declared by the committee on Tuesday evening,” the sources further said. Speaking about her appointment, Patil said that she was fortunate to have been appointed on the trust of Goddess Saptashrungi. “I have got an excellent opportunity to take up the work of the trust. Besides planning to bring in funds from industries, my aim would be to undertake various steps in healthcare and education by support of the trust,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/saptashrug-temple-trust-gets-first-woman-trustee/articleshow/78415205.cms||Abhilash Botekar
October 1, 2020||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Restrictions likely to be in force during festive season||VISAKHAPATNAM: The dip in number of Covid-19 cases in the city notwithstanding, the district administration is not prepared to take any chances and plans to impose restrictions during the upcoming Dasara and Diwali festivals to contain the spread of the virus. Officials said they will formulate a series of guidelines to restrict mass gatherings at shopping localities and prominent areas where the festivals are celebrated in a big way. “Several restrictions would be in place. We are thinking of restricting any gathering beyond 30 to 40 people at any time. The guidelines are expected to be announced soon,” said a senior district administrator. Both Dasara and Diwali are big festivals in Visakhapatnam. Being a cosmopolitan city, people from Bengali community celebrate Durga puja and Kali puja in a big way. Around 10 to 12 community Durga pujas take place in the city every year. Not only that, many Telugus and non-Telugus travel to and fro their work places and home states during the festive season. This year could be different though, due to the pandemic situation. “We are happy that residents followed the restrictions imposed during the Ganesh Chaturthi. We are now reaping the benefits. We all know what happened in Kerala post Onam. Being big festivals, we don’t want the same thing to happen here after Dasara and Diwali,” the official added. After Onam, which fell on August 22, Kerala saw a 126% increase in Covid-19 cases. On the other hand, Visakhapatnam has been seeing a stabilizing trend as the daily cases have dropped to around 400, from over 700 cases a day some weeks ago. In fact, in the last one or two weeks, only 150 to 200 cases were reported on some days. “Most festival committees usually apply for permissions by now. However, this year we have received only two or three applications, which means most committees are unlikely to organise the pujas this year,” said a senior police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/restrictions-likely-to-be-in-force-during-festive-season/articleshow/78413874.cms||Arpit Basu

October 1, 2020||Nashik||Work underway to increase oxygen beds at CBD hospital||Nashik: The Cantonment Board Deolali (CBD) hospital which has been converted into a dedicated covid health centre (DCHC) ever since cases started increasing, has decided to increase the number of oxygen beds in view of the rising need of oxygen support to patients. Senior officials of the CBD said that they would initiate oxygen supply to 30 beds by Thursday evening. Earlier, only six of the 90-bed facility were equipped with oxygen supply. Due to the limited amount of oxygen beds at the hospital, the admitted patients had to be shifted to other facilities, mainly at the Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) at Nashik civil hospital and NMC’s Zakir Hussain Hospital. Cantonment board officials said that with the rising number of coronavirus cases in and around the Deolali Camp area, the board was putting in all the necessary infrastructure to provide the best possible treatment to patients who are admitted at the DCHC. Apart from the residents of Deolali Camp, many villagers in and around the area approach the hospital for treatment. So far, over 1,300 Covid-19 patients have sought treatment at this facility. Senior officials of CBD said that earlier oxygen was provided only to six beds through oxygen concentrator machines and cylinders. However, they have now procured 12 additional big oxygen cylinders in addition to the existing three big oxygen cylinders and 10 small oxygen cylinders. All of this put together would be sufficient for providing oxygen supply to at least 30 beds. The cantonment board office of Deolali is putting in efforts to spread awareness among citizens to wear face masks and maintain social distancing in public places. In addition, three vehicles have been dedicated for spraying disinfectants in various parts of the cantonment board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/work-underway-to-increase-oxygen-beds-at-cbd-hospital/articleshow/78415208.cms||Santosh Sonawane
October 1, 2020||Madurai||Case filed, SHOs must act fast to thwart offenders escaping: HC||Madurai: Madras high court on Wednesday observed that once a case is registered, especially cognizable offences of serious nature, the station house officers are expected to act swiftly and see to it that the offenders do not escape from the clutches of law. A division bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation filed by an advocate P Rathinam, who sought compensation for the authorities’ inaction in an incident wherein a man and his wife were assaulted in Sivaganga district. This, despite a retired judge of Madras high court, Justice A Selvam, staging a protest against police apathy. The petitioner stated that Senthil and his wife Priyadharshini, residents of Poolankurichi village, were assaulted by Prakash and three other women in an altercation between them on August 1. The judges observed that Senthil sustained fracture on one of his hands due to the assault. Since no steps were taken by the sub-inspector of police (SI), retired Justice Selvam, who is a native of the village, staged a protest in front of the Poolankurichi police station. The judges noted that it was only following news reports about the former judge’s protest the SI was transferred, the investigation handed over to another official and the final report filed before Thirupathur judicial magistrate court and the case is yet to be taken on file. The judges observed that fortunately for the victim Senthil, former Justice Selvam came to his rescue. The police, who are guardians of law and order, are provided with sufficient powers under the statutes for prevention of crimes and also to take appropriate actions against the offences, especially cognizable offences. To prevent such incidents, the superintendent of police of the concerned districts shall conduct a review meeting periodically in a meaningful and objective manner and can take action against the officials if they identify any infraction or misconduct on discharge of duties. The judges observed that though the petitioner had made a plea seeking compensation, the same shall be granted by the trial court after the completion of the trial, and hence closed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/case-filed-shos-must-act-fast-to-thwart-offenders-escaping-hc/articleshow/78416244.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Drugs worth Rs 20 lakh hidden in handbag seized at Kempegowda International Airport||BENGALURU: After a brief hiatus, the cargo section of Kempegowda International Airport has witnessed yet another drug haul — this time of banned sedative methaqualone. The contraband, worth Rs 20 lakh, was hidden in a women’s handbag couriered from Nigeria. Customs officers suspect a Nigerian national, who was arrested in connection with smuggling of ecstasy pills worth Rs 1 crore through KIA cargo in early September, is behind the methaqualone smuggling bid as well. Sources with the Cargo Intelligence Unit (CIU) of Bengaluru Customs at KIA said on Monday evening, they received a parcel via FedEx air courier addressed to Sylvester Henry Owen, 41, in Bengaluru for clearance. “Sylvester, a Nigerian national, was arrested by our team on September 10 in a case involving smuggling of 1,980 ecstasy pills from Belgium, which were concealed in a foot massager. The name on the fresh consignment led our team to examine the contents thoroughly,” a customs officer said. The new consignment sent from Nigeria by an unknown source contained synthetic women’s hair, men’s T-shirts and a black ladies’ handbag. “Scanning of the handbag revealed a bulge at the bottom. We immediately cut it open only to find a yellowish black pouch with the drug hidden in plastic covers,” explained the investigator, who unearthed the methaqualone weighing 400gm. Tests confirmed it was the banned sedative. Methaqualone is used as a recreational drug and often goes by the street name Quaalude. The seized drug is estimated to be worth over Rs 20 lakh in the international market, sources said. Preliminary probe by customs sleuths revealed the methaqualone was ordered and smuggled through air courier by Owen. He had been nabbed from Hommadevanahalli near Bannerghatta Road in a joint operation by CIU and Bengaluru police, following recovery of the ecstasy pills from the foot massager that was flown from Belgium through DHL air courier on September 1. He was booked under the NDPS Act and is lodged in prison. Further probe is on to ascertain the involvement of more suspects in methaqualone case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/drugs-worth-rs-20l-hidden-in-handbag-seized-at-kia/articleshow/78414269.cms||Petlee Peter
October 1, 2020||Rajkot||Ayurveda doctor, two others held for remdesivir injections in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Illegal sale of the remdesivir injections seems to be flourishing in Rajkot. After two rackets of black marketing this crucial drug for treatment of Covid-19 patients were busted within just 24 hours, the city police on Tuesday night arrested an ayurveda doctor for illegally procuring remdesivir vials to be administered to a corona patient on Kalavad Road in Rajkot. Along with Deepak Gadhia, who has a BAMS degree, the police also detained a medical store employee, who had sold the injections and an agent, who is the supervisor of Neelkanth Covid hospital. Gadhia was treating the Covid-19 patient Dhiraj Bhensdalia at the latter’s house in Kalash Apartment near Speedwell Party Plot. After testing positive, Bhensdalia was home quarantined. As his condition deteriorated, Gadhia said he needed to administer her with three remdesivir injections. The cost of one remdesivir injection is Rs 4,800 but Gadhia told her family that each injection would cost them Rs 7,000, and took Rs 21,000 from them. Bhensdalia’s son Tushar suspected a foul play and informed the police. “We kept a watch on Gadhia. He contacted Mukesh Rathod, the medical supervisor at Neelkanth Hospital. Rathod in turn approached Pankaj Domadia, an employee of the hospital pharmacy who supplied the injections,” said V K Gadhvi, inspector with Rajkot detection of crime branch. “We first detained Gadhia, who named Rathod. When Rathod was grilled, he gave the name of Domadia, leading to his detention,” he added. “At present, we have detained the accused trio. They will be formally arrested after they undergo Covid-19 test,” said Gadhvi. The accused have been booked under sections 420 and 114 of Indian Penal Code, dealing with cheating and abetment, sections 3, 7 and 11 of Essential Commodities Act and section 53 of Disaster Management Act. Gadhia runs his clinic at Nanavati Chowk on 150-feet Ring Road in Rajkot and lives in Wankaner Society on Jamnagar Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ayurveda-doctor-two-others-held-for-remdesivir-injections/articleshow/78413228.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Former girlfriend of former minister’s son circulates his morphed photos, gets bail||BENGALURU: A 24-year-old woman has been accused of morphing the photographs of her alleged former lover, an ex-minister’s son, and his wife into pornographic images, sending them to multiple people and uploading them on porn websites. The East CEN crime police arrested the woman on August 28 but kept the issue under wraps even as she was remanded in judicial custody and sent to jail. A city civil and sessions court granted her conditional bail on September 25. The former minister’s son lodged a complaint with CEN crime police on August 7, alleging his family members, his mother-in-law and her employees were receiving pornographic pictures and messages from unknown numbers since April 5, 2019. Pictures of him and his wife had been morphed, he claimed. “The miscreants sent the morphed photos to staff at my mother-in-law’s company along with links to pornographic sites, where the pictures were uploaded,” the complainant alleged. Based on the mobile numbers provided by the complainant, police traced the woman and arrested her on charges of creating and circulating pornographic photos. The trial court rejected her bail plea on September 8, but she approached the sessions court, which granted her bail last week. The prosecution argued she was trying to defame the former minister’s son and his family. She allegedly affixed faces of the ex-minister’s son’s family members on to nude photos of others. The woman was booked under various sections of IT Act and IPC sections 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and 509 (intending to insult the modesty of any woman). False plaint: Defence counselCounsel for the accused claimed there was a love affair between the complainant and his client. When they broke up, the man filed a false complaint against his former girlfriend and sought to harass her using his father’s connections. The accused contended that she is innocent and unmarried and false allegations may affect her future. Her counsel said there was a delay in filing of the complaint. According to the complainant, the accused was sending pornographic photos since April 5, 2019 but he filed a complaint only in August 2020. Neither the complainant nor the prosecution cited any reason for the delay in reporting the crime, it was argued. The defence counsel contended that the woman’s mother has a heart problem, adding the former was not in a position to influence prosecution witnesses as the complainant is a son of a former minister. Considering the sections booked against the woman are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life and her mother’s health condition, K Subramanya, 67th additional city civil and sessions judge, granted her bail. The accused has been told to execute a personal bond for Rs 1 lakh along with two sureties for the like sum. She should not tamper with prosecution witnesses, appear before the trial court on all hearing dates, not leave the jurisdiction without the court’s permission and not indulge in any offences, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ex-lover-of-former-mins-son-circulates-his-morphed-photos-gets-bail/articleshow/78414307.cms||Santosh kumar.B
October 1, 2020||Vadodara||Cash-strapped student cooks up loot plaint||VADODARA: A candidate for competitive exams was booked on Wednesday late night for registering a false complaint of chain snatching with the police. The accused, a native of Dahod and living on Waghodiya Road in the city, created a charade on Wednesday afternoon to hide the truth behind his gold chain ‘snatching.’ Investigation revealed that the student had actually sold his gold chain for money as he had exhausted all cash meant for house rent and education fees. In order to hide this fact from his family, he called police to inform them that two persons looted his chain by holding him at a gunpoint near Vaikunth Society on Waghodiya Road. On getting the complaint, the detection and prevention of crime branches and local police swung into action to trace the thieves. Meanwhile, the complainant was brought to Panigate police station to get more details about the crime. When questioned about the gun, he told cops that the gun was not like the one that police use. On hearing this reply, policemen became suspicious. A team went to a departmental store which he had visited before calling for police help. In the footage of CCTV cameras, cops did not see any gold chain on him. Later, they summoned his friends whom he had called during the day. All of them said that he had called them requesting money saying that he was completely broke. Realizing that his bluff had been called, the student admitted that he had made a fake complaint. “We have registered an offence against him for giving false information to police and misleading us,” said SG Patil, assistant commissioner of police||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cash-strapped-student-cooks-up-loot-plaint/articleshow/78413508.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Officials ask Bhavani devotees to postpone Deeksha this year||VIJAYAWADA: Controlling Bhavani devotees will be a big challenge during Dasara celebrations at Durga temple managed by Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devastanams scheduled to start from October 17. Bhavani devotees, usually dressed in red, are a major attraction during the last five days of Dasara celebrations but this year officials have started a campaign requesting devotees to cancel their program in the wake of Covid-19. Dasara celebration have a great significance in the city as it was declared as a state festival by the government. Lakhs of devotees, who take up Deeksha for 10 days, visit the temple and offer special prayers. Out of the 16 lakh devotees who took darshan during Dasara in 2019, around 7.8 lakh devotees are Bhavani devotees from various parts of the country. Homa Gundam, Giri Pradakshina, holy dip in river Krishna are important parts of Bhavani Deeksha viramana during Dasara. As the temple authorities have decided to celebrate Dasara on a low key this year, officials decided not to make arrangements for Bhavani devotees. “Huge gatherings will increase the risk of Covid-19. So we have decided to permit only 1,000 devotees per day for darshan during Dasara days. Bhavani devotees from various parts of the state are requested to postpone their Deeksha for this year as Covid-19 cases are increasing drastically,” said temple trust board chairman Paula Sominaidu. Endowments department had decided to take up publicity camps in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts from where the maximum number of devotees come. Meanwhile, the temple authorities have decided to limit the number of people for special offerings like Kumkuma Archana, Chandi Homam and others during the festival days. Limited number of tickets for these sevas will be issued online soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/officials-ask-bhavani-devotees-to-postpone-deeksha-this-year/articleshow/78413893.cms||Venu Lanka
October 1, 2020||Mysuru||Non-clinical staff at Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences demand ex-gratia||MANDYA: The non-clinical workers of Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS) staged protest on hospital premises by boycotting work. They also urged the state government to sanction them Covid-19 ex-gratia. The workers alleged that the state government has been meting out step motherly treatment to them as they were excluded from being considered for ex-gratia while doctors and other medical staff are being paid the ex-gratia. “The government announced to pay ex-gratia for doctors, lab technicians, and pharmacists for doing extra-work to combat covid-19 while non-clinical workers were excluded. How fair is it?” the protesters said. MB Nagannagowda, state president of Non-clinical Contract Employees Association, accused state government of insulting non-clinical workers who worked hard in combating Covid-19 by denying them the ex-gratia. “There is no logic behind the government’s decision to exclude non-clinical workers from being paid. How could doctors and other medical staff fight Covid-19 without the help of non-clinical workers?” he added. “If the stage government doesn’t pay ex-gratia to non-clinical workers, it should have not used them to fight Covid-19. By denying them ex-gratia, the government not only discriminate against them but also insulted them,” Nagannagowda alleged. MIMS director GM Prakash met the protesting workers. He said the workers are being hired by agencies and hence neither MIMS nor the state government had any responsibilities towards paying them ex-gratia. Prakash’s denial infuriated the protesters. They warned him they would not resume work until they get an assurance from the government and MIMS that they will also be paid ex-gratia. The protesters withdrew their protest after the medical superintendent promised them that the ex-gratia would be paid from next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/non-clinical-staff-at-mandya-institute-of-medical-sciences-demand-ex-gratia/articleshow/78413232.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Will give fitting reply to Andhra Pradesh on water sharing at meet: Telangana CM||HYDERABAD: When the Apex Council meets on October 6, Telangana will raise the issue of various irrigation projects taken up by Andhra Pradesh and the Centre’s indifferent attitude towards river water allocation for the last seven years. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who held a meeting with water resources department officials on the strategy to be adopted at the Apex Council meeting, said AP government was intentionally creating problems on river water sharing. “We will give a befitting reply to AP’s arguments at the council meeting. We will also clarify on every point raised by AP so that the neighbouring state will not raise these issues again in future,” the CM said. Training the guns on the Centre, KCR said: “As per the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, whenever a new state is formed, it should be allocated its water share. Telangana state was formed on June 2, 2014 and the state government wrote a letter to the PM on June 14, 2014. In the letter, the Telangana government had requested for allocation water to the state. The government stated that water could be allocated by constituting a special tribunal under section (3) of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act 1956 or through the existing tribunal. The government also wanted the allocation of water to be done between Telangana and AP,” the CM said in a press release. He said even after seven years, there was no response for the letter written to the Prime Minister. He said they would take the Centre to task at the October 6 meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-give-fitting-reply-to-ap-on-water-sharing-at-meet-kcr/articleshow/78415218.cms||Koride Mahesh

October 1, 2020||Madurai||Girl, 2, kidnapped from Bengaluru rescued from TN-Kerala border||Madurai: A two-year-old girl kidnapped from the Majestic bus terminal in Bengaluru was rescued by Kanyakumari district police at the Kaliyakkavilai bus stand on the inter-state border with Kerala in the early hours of Wednesday. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the girl was trapped by a couple on the pretext of getting her ice cream on September 18, and taken to Thiruvananthapuram. Police said that in the wee hours of Wednesday, a man in his fifties with a plastered hand reached the Kaliyakkavilai bus stand from Thiruvananthapuram with two children in an autorickshaw. He was waiting with the girl and a boy, aged about five years, when the girl was spotted crying by two sub inspectors on night rounds. On inquiry, police came to know that the man, Joseph John from Kattakada in Thiruvananthapuram, had kidnapped the girl from the Bengaluru bus terminal by giving her ice cream laced with a sedative. The man who was residing in Bengaluru with his third wife Esther Latha told the police that he found the girl seeking alms and took her along.“He could not answer why he did not hand her over to the police,” Thuckalay DSP M Ramachandran said. The man took the girl and the boy (whom he claims to be the son born to his second wife) to Thiruvananthapuram about 10 days ago. He started for Kanyakumari on Tuesday night when the local police got information about a man seen under suspicious circumstances with two children. At Kaliyakkavilai, they were waiting for Esther Latha who was supposed to join them from Chennai. The police took John and Latha into custody while the children were sent to a children’s home for temporary custody. Meanwhile, based on the information given by the boy, Kanyakumari police got in touch with their Bengaluru counterparts. The police also came across a video released by the girl’s mother Karthikeshwari in tears on social media. The woman said they took the girl to a temple as she was unwell and that on their way back home she had gone missing at the Majestic bus terminal on September 13. Police suspect that the man and woman could be kidnappers or middlemen engaged in trafficking children. On an alert from the Kanyakumari district SP V Badri Narayanan, Karnataka police and the girl’s parents are heading to Kanyakumari. “The girl and boy and the couple will be handed over to the Karnataka police on Thursday,” the SP told TOI. Police suspect that the couple could be part of the network kidnapping children from poor families in Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/girl-2-kidnapped-from-bengaluru-rescued-from-tn-kerala-border/articleshow/78416247.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Madurai||Construction on college ground: Court seeks report||Madurai: In a plea, which sought not to construct buildings on the playground of Periyar EVR College in Trichy district, Madras high court on Wednesday permitted the petitioner and college principal to carry out a joint inspection and submit a report. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by R Senthil Rajan who is the secretary of the old students’ association of the college. The petitioner stated that Periyar who is a well-known social reformer, had donated 9.65 acres of land and Rs.3.5 lakh for starting the college and it was inaugurated by former chief minister M Bhakthavatchalam in 1965. The petitioner stated that at present, the college campus is expanded to 52.62 acres and the college not only excels in education, but also in sports. The grievance of the petitioner is that under the grab of constructing offices of controller of examination and other offices, huge pits are dug on the playground where volleyball, badminton and basketball courts are situated. He sought not to put up construction on the playground. Pursuant to the earlier order, the principal of the college submitted a status report in response to the queries put forth by the court with regard to the extent of the college campus, buildings constructed, and plan of new buildings and feasibility of constructions on the campus. DMK Rajya Sabha MP Trichy Siva who is an alumnus of the college also filed an impleading petition expressing his sentiments about the college and the playground and sought not to allow constructions on the playground. Taking into consideration the sentiments expressed by the alumnus, a division bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam permitted the petitioner along with two others and the college principal to carry out a join inspection on the campus by following the necessary Covid-19 protocol and asked them to submit a report in this regard. Since the status report submitted by the principal had not dealt with the previous queries put forth by the court in the previous order, the judges directed the principal to submit another status report responding to these queries. The judges observed that the status report submitted by the principal should also have details about the encroachments on the college campus and steps taken for its removal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/construction-on-college-ground-court-seeks-report/articleshow/78416245.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||60% of total Covid-19 cases & deaths, 70% recoveries in September alone||Nagpur: Covid-19 scenario in Vidarbha has been scary in the month of September, which is now being considered as Covid-19 peak month for the region. But, on the other hand, highest number of patients recovered in this month only, which could be the indicator of good Covid-19 management in Vidarbha. September alone accounts 60% of Covid-19 cases and deaths happened in Vidarbha during last seven months. Out of total 1,49,117 Covid-19 cases, 88,779 came in September while out of 3,997 total Covid-19 deaths, 2,408 happened in September alone. On the positive side, more than 71% recoveries in last seven months were also recorded in 30 days of September alone. Out of 1,14,728 total recoveries, 81,568 recovered in September. The month has also seen a significant 13% jump in recovery rate from 63% to 76%. The only parameter that remained more or less constant was the case fatality rate (CFR). The CFR was 2.7% on September 1 and it remained almost same (2.68%) on September 30. Nagpur has recorded highest Covid-19 deaths and now, all districts in Vidarbha are also witnessing Covid-19 deaths daily. The least-affected Gadchiroli has also seen 20 out of 21 deaths in the month of September. While different districts in Vidarbha are witnessing the surge in number of cases at different times, it is expected that the Nagpur division comprising of Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia and Wardha are going to see more cases in the next month. On the other hand, the curve of Amravati Division comprising of Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim is expected to move towards flattening. Experts told TOI that Covid-19 data analysis depends on different parameters and only higher number of cases and could not be taken as an indicator of worsening condition. “We must see the other side too. More patients are recovering daily across the region,” said epidemiologist Dr Anil Giri from Akola. “Statistically, we can consider last two weeks of August and three weeks of September as peak of Covid-19 in most districts of Vidarbha. After this, cases or deaths won’t come down suddenly. It’s a time-taking process,” he said. According to Dr Giri, it took nearly two-and-a-half months post lockdown for the region to reach the peak and will take almost same period to confirm that Vidarbha’s curve has flattened. “Cases will definitely grow if we conduct more tests. If more patients continue to recover, deaths count continues to go down, and our case doubling rate continues to increase, then only we can confirm that we are in better condition,” he said. Vidarbha’s death toll which used to remain in 90s during second and third week of September has started coming down in last six days. Doubling rate in Nagpur, which accounts more than 56% of total cases in region is now 45 days. In Akola, which used to be worst-hit till June-July, doubling rate is 55 days now. In short, September has been the month of highest cases and deaths, but it has also seen highest recoveries. Government authorities and doctors working in government set-up are still not commenting on record about the peak and flattening of curve in Vidarbha. But, many of them who attend daily briefing of state and national Covid-19 scenario told TOI that the condition will improve by the end of October. “It’s difficult to give a particular date or week. Government has already increased lockdown regulations till October 31.But, at the current pace, we will be in better position by the end of October. People must continue following the Covid distancing, masks, and hand hygiene,” said a senior member of a Covid-19 task force in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/60-of-total-covid-19-cases-deaths-70-recoveries-in-september-alone/articleshow/78415253.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
October 1, 2020||Aurangabad||Lockdown travel: 3 held guilty, fined||Aurangabad: A magisterial court in Parbhani has held three men — including the first person in the district to test positive for Covid-19 after he had travelled from Pune to Parbhani on a motorcycle during the lockdown in April — guilty of negligence which was likely to spread an infectious disease. The court imposed a fine of Rs500 on each of them. In case of failure to pay up, they would have to serve five-day simple imprisonment. Gajanan Panchal (21) and his elder brother, Sachin (31), both hailing from Basmath in Hingoli district and residing at Bhosari in Pune, had travelled 370km from Pune to Parbhani on a motorcycle on April 13 without pass and permit. They dodged police checkpoints on the way. They stayed at the house of their relative Maroti Panchal (39). Within two days, Gajanan fell ill and later tested positive for Covid-19 to become the first case of infection in Parbhani, which was till then in a “green zone”. Parbhani has, so far, reported over 5,300 cases and 225 deaths. An offence under Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infectious disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the trio on April 17 with the New Mondha police station. All three pleaded guilty for the offence during the trial. However, CJM Tiwari observed in his order on September 29, “There is no past criminal record of the accused, but at the same time it is necessary to impose punishment of such type so that the people should not take the decision of competent authority lightly.” “Admittedly, it is mandatory to follow the direction of competent authority and not to travel during lockdown period and to follow the norms of social distancing in public places to avoid spread of the Covid-19 infection,” the court said. Public prosecutor Shobha Deshmukh had argued that Gajanan and Sachin had negligently and knowingly travelled from Pune to Parbhani on a motorcycle during the lockdown while Maroti helped them with the intent of spreading the infection, which constituted a serious offence. On the part of the accused, it was submitted that they did not have any source of income due to the lockdown and that there was no intention of committing any offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/lockdown-travel-3-held-guilty-fined/articleshow/78412474.cms||Mohammed Akhef
October 1, 2020||Madurai||Curtain comes down on sixth phase of excavation at Keeladi||Madurai: The sixth phase of excavation at Keeladi in Sivaganga district came to an end on Wednesday. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had officially inaugurated the sixth phase of excavation by the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department through video conferencing on Feb 19. However, the work was temporarily halted due to the lockdown, from March 24 and resumed on May 20 after a gap of two months.For the first time, excavation work was taken up in the neighbouring villages of Keeladi, Konthagai, Agaram and Manalur in the sixth phase. While the five excavations earlier had resulted in discovery of artefacts that showed that Keeladi could have been an industrial site, the inclusion of Konthagai in this phase resulted in the unearthing of many skeletons and burial urns. Some of the interesting finds in this phase were dice used for board games, shell and glass ornaments, smoking pipes, terracotta figures, spherical weighing stones made of basalt, a gold coin like that was used in the 17th century AD. Rains played spoilsport on the last day, as the trenches were filled with water hindering work. Deputy director of archaeology, R Sivanandham, said that they were officially closing the sixth phase on Wednesday, but the documentation process would go on for a few more days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/curtain-comes-down-on-sixth-phase-of-excavation-at-keeladi/articleshow/78416255.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||‘Our aim is not votes, we want to get rights of farmers back’||A day before Shiromani Akali Dal’s biggest protest against the central government’s three agri-marketing laws, party president Sukhbir Singh Badal was busy at his sprawling residence in Badal village making last-minute preparations for the protest march from three different Takhts in Punjab to Chandigarh. He spoke to TOI’s Neel Kamal on the issues leading to SAD snapping ties with NDA. Excerpts: You admitted recently that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders never took NDA allies on board before taking important decisions. Why did it take so long for the SAD to sacrifice its ministerial berth in the Union Cabinet and break ties with the BJP? Akali Dal is the founder member of NDA. We are not a party that puts conditions. Once we join hands with someone, it is a long-lasting relationship. We don't react to smaller things. It is very unfortunate we had to leave the NDA. Farmers for us — for Punjab and for the country — are the most important. Punjab farmers provide food to the country and the farmers are upset and the present government should have taken this into consideration finalizing these ordinances. We were hopeful of the government listening to us and the farmers, which ultimately did not happen but there was no delay on our part and when we found that our voice was not being heard, we left the alliance. So, nothing was discussed with SAD or the then Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal? No, nothing was discussed. Why did you so long in exiting the alliance? We tried our best to convince the Government of India that this law should not be made, they should include the legal provision on (MSP) to it. Till the last minute, we tried. And when it didn’t happen, we had no choice, we had to leave the alliance. Can you reveal the initiatives the SAD was taking to get BJP to listen to its opinion on the farm ordinances? We met every kisan union, we met agricultural intellectuals and economists, we met farmers and even arhtiyas. We had three-four rounds of meetings. We wrote letters on the issues to ministers and got letters from them. We don’t want to leave anything. We tried to bridge the gap. Since we were part of NDA, it was our duty to do that. What about the initiatives with the BJP? BJP means the government, we were talking to its president and the ministers. Your party’s divorce from the BJP is turning into an acrimonious one. Did you expect this? It is not acrimonious. We have some principles and we left on those principles. We never expected this (outcome). We were sure that we would be able to convince them and they would agree to whatever we were saying — we were very confident. But it didn’t happen. Why couldn’t you convince them? It was not that. They didn’t agree to things, they should have. We were not asking for more seats or something but were talking for the people, for the farmers. The Punjab BJP has said that the SAD pullout and Harsimrat's resignation was due to your party’s political compulsions. How did the relationship, which goes back almost quarter of a century, between the two parties deteriorate to this level? We represent the farmers and when some law is against the people who we represent, how should we react. If the whole farmer community is upset, we have no choice but to go with them. We have been fighting for the farmers and we have sacrificed all our lives for the farming community, my father spent 16 years in jail for the farmers and this is a pious act for us not any political compulsion. What is next on the agenda of SAD? We are starting a huge protest tomorrow. After that, we will meet again and decide on the next steps. The protest will be peaceful, violence has never been part of our agenda. Our aim is not elections, our aim is to get the rights of the farmers back. We will try and convince the (central) government. India is a democracy. I think it is the duty of the government to listen to the voice of the people. I think they should do this sooner than later. As the three contentious farm bills have become laws, what purpose would SAD’s agitation and rallies serve now? It is not that nothing could be done now. Just because these have become an Acts does not mean they can’t be changed. They can be changed and should be changed. These laws can be withdrawn too. We want that legal right to MSP should be incorporated in these laws. Did Prime Minister Narendra Modi or any of the BJP leaders try to contact the SAD after you announced in the Lok Sabha that Harsimrat Kaur Badal would resign from the Union Cabinet? No, no one contacted us. With the advantage of hindsight, do you now think BJP took you for a ride? Every party has its own agenda. Farmers may not be a priority for some. For us, for SAD, farmers are our main priority. This question, they (BJP) should answer this. JJP leader Ajay Chautala has revealed that had both of you had been assured by BJP national president J P Nadda and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar there would be no dilution of MSP for crops after introduction of the three contentious bills in Parliament. He was convinced, but you weren’t. What were your apprehensions at the time? By just saying, does not mean it will… you will continue. We want legal provisions added in the law, which they did not do. As far as Chautala is concerned, that is up to him to be convinced. However, I feel and all the farmers of Punjab feel that by just saying something, it is not enough. Today, I say something and tomorrow… there is no legal binding on it. There is anger amongst the farmers of Punjab on the issue. Have you decided your strategy of channeling this in the right direction? I have appealed to all farmers and their organisations that we should all work together with one mission, so that… We have to get some results. The Punjab government is also siding with the farmers. Captain Amarinder Singh is playing games. He called a special session of Vidhan Sabha before the act was brought by the central government to Parliament. The session passed a resolution (against the ordinances). But he never sent the resolution to the Government of India. This shows his seriousness! The Punjab govt is planning to move the Supreme Court on the issue. Before going to the Supreme Court, they should consult the legal experts and complete legal work and there should not be any shortcoming. Whatever matter is possible, everyone should try. Our ultimate goal is to get the farmers’ rights. We are ready to go with anyone on the issue. Whatever we have to do, the party will decide. Opposition has been accusing the Modi government of unleashing central agencies on political opponents. Do you have any such apprehensions about your family or party leaders especially when bitterness is increasing between you and BJP? I have nothing to hide, our life is an open book. I can’t say what is in the mind of others. It is up to them. I have nothing to hide. Why is SAD silent on issue of over 328 missing saroops of Guru Granth Sahib? We are not silent on it. SGPC is an independent body. It is its responsibility to do all that and it is looking into it. The investigators have pointed out that actually the saroops were given … to some people but money has not been taken. The SGPC at the moment is trying to locate all persons whose money was received but has not been added. SGPC represents the Sikh parliament, we are the only community in the world that has an elected body. So in a democracy, there are certain people who have always been opposing SGPC. This is such a serious issue. I think we should not throw mud at each other. Do you think handling of the missing saroops issue has caused damage to SAD image too? SAD is something else and SGPC is an elected body. SGPC represents Sikh community, it is the Sikh parliament…The last executive was also given religious punishment and they also apologized. The SGPC is the right forum to answer that. If, as you say, people think SAD controls SGPC, do you also say that BJP controls the central government? It is a democratic institution. Akali Dal fights the elections. This is the centenary of SGPC — every five years in these 100 years elections have taken place and for 100 years people have given support to SAD. This clearly shows the community’s faith. We fight the elections as a party.

According to NMC officials, the tally of Covid-19 patients may reach from present 51,000 cases to 75,000 by October end. Civic officials said that in the last one week, the daily positive cases have been hovering around 600-700 unlike previous weeks where the cases were close to 1,000 a day. They claimed that the trend of having a lesser number of positive cases would continue this month too. Earlier, the NMC had projected a total of 60,000 cases by September end, but the total positive cases were below the projection i.e around 51,000. “Moreover, the number of recoveries were more than new cases in September” said NMC officials. The trend of positive cases in Nashik has changed in the last few days because of the various measures undertaken by the civic body. The average daily cases between September 16 and 22 were around 986 per day. However, there has been a drop in daily average cases to 769 cases per day in the last one week between September 23 and 29. “We have increased contact tracing and testing of Covid suspects for early detection of the infection which is yielding results. The number of per day cases have started reducing since the last week. Moreover, the recovery rate has also increased up to 92% and the Covid death rate has reduced to 1.44%,” said NMC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-reduces-covid-19-cases-projection-for-oct/articleshow/78415282.cms||Tushar Pawar
October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||MC to install no parking boards at 2k spots in city||Chandigarh: The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has started installing no parking boards throughout the city by covering all the V-3, V-4 and V-5 (sector dividing, markets and residential) roads of the city. The Punjab and Haryana high court had issued orders to the civic body authority in this regard last year to install no parking boards due to haphazard parking outside the residential areas, market areas and along the internal and external roads of the sectors, the engineering department had consulted the matter with the Chandigarh traffic police to decide the locations. The municipal corporation has identified approximately 2,000 locations across the city to install these boards and they have already installed the boards at around 1,000 locations in different parts of the city. The engineering department of the civic body authority had floated Rs 1 crore tender for the work, but received the lowest tender of Rs 49 lakh. “We had kicked-off the tender process and even selected the company, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, things were stalled. Now, these boards are being installed at the decided locations of V-3, V-4 and V-5 roads. Though earlier, V-6 roads (extreme internal roads of the residential areas) were also considered for installing the boards, but the traffic police have raised objections and deliberation is going on with them,” said an official. The numbers of the vehicles in the city are increasing day-by-day and are creating huge parking problems in all the parts of the city. From markets to residential areas, residents are facing shortage of space to park their vehicles and they use the non-designated areas for parking their vehicles, leading to chaos. Last year, the MC had carried out a drive to challan illegally-parked vehicles. However, the civic body faced criticism from residents as it had not installed boards mentioning no parking zones at places where violators were challaned. “While the MC slapped Rs 1,500 as fine for illegal parking, residents demanded that the civic body should first identify places where parking was not allowed and install no parking boards at those spots before issuing challans,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-install-no-parking-boards-at-2k-spots-in-city/articleshow/78416271.cms||Deepak Yadav

It is only the media that is speculating about problems,” he said. “All of us are united and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerslevam will jointly announce the CM candidate on Oct 7,” he said. Asked why the deputy chief minister had boycotted the meeting of the chief minister on the lockdown review, he said that it was not mandatory that the ministers participate in all the events of the chief minister with officials. “If we have other events, we can be excused,” he said.

October 1, 2020||Dehradun||CM inaugurates solar and pine needle power project plants in Uttarkashi||Uttarkashi: Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Wednesday inaugurated a 200 KW solar power plant and a 25 KW pine needle (pirul) power plant at Indra Tipri and Chakon villages respectively. “The state government is encouraging green energy-based power projects with an aim to generate employment and protect the environment. These projects can also save nearly Rs 1,000 crore, which the government has to spend for purchase of electricity from other states,” said CM Rawat during his visit to Uttarkashi on Wednesday. While addressing the gathering, CM Rawat said, “Nature has blessed us with enormous resources, which we can use to produce green energy. This will not only reduce the environmental degradation but also provide employment opportunities for locals. Therefore, villagers, particularly youths, should set up these micro power plants in their respective areas instead of migrating outside the state in search of small jobs.” He added, “To develop self-employment opportunities in hill districts, we have directed all district magistrates to spend 40% money of district plan on projects like agriculture, horticulture, fishery, animal husbandry, and bee keeping. Moreover, the government has also produced job opportunities for 25,000 people under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act (CAMPA). There is no barrier of education qualification for these jobs.” “To ensure the success of small scale industries and progress of local villagers, the government is also developing basic facilities like roads, communication, health and education in rural areas,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-inaugurates-solar-and-pine-needle-power-project-plants-in-uttarkashi/articleshow/78412473.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala
October 1, 2020||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Can’t get engineering degree without clearing arrear exams, says AICTE||CHENNAI: The AICTE (All India Council For Technical Education) on Wednesday told the Madras high court that the Tamil Nadu government’s order cancel ling arrear exams for engineering students is against norms and degrees will not be awarded to students who have not cleared their backlogs. AICTE made the submissions through its reply to two PILs filed by former vice-chancellor of Anna University, E Balaguruswamy, and advocate Ramkumar Aditiyan challenging the government order cancelling arrear exams in the state. “The council has not exempted students from appearing for examinations or allowed them to move to next year without being assessed by exams. Degree cannot be awarded to a student who has failed to clear arrears. This is not acceptable to the industry too,” M Sundresan, AICTE’s south regional officer, said. The state’s claim that the GO cancelling arrear exams and passing all students who paid exam fee was as per the guidelines of the AICTE was wrong, the council said. Only the UGC through a circular permitted promoting students to the next year without exams in view of the pandemic. That too only to continue studies through online classes, the council added. On September 8, the state government justified its decision to cancel arrear exams and contended that the decision does not violate UGC norms. “The government has passed the order under Disaster Management Act exercising the powers vested with the state disaster management authority under the legislation. Even the apex court has upheld such rights and powers of the state authority under the Act if it is not in conflict UGC guidelines,” advocate-general Vijay Narayanan said. The order is not in conflict with any UGC norms. As per UGC guidelines only final exams cannot be cancelled, he added. Earlier, advocate E Vijay Anand, counsel for Balaguruswamy, contended that only universities have such powers and not the state government. According to Balaguruswamy, the decision will demoralise good and meritorious students who have toiled hard to clear exams. The government order will lower the education standard of students and the university. It will badly affect the reputation, credibility, and prospects of meritorious students and quality of education, he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cant-get-engg-degree-without-clearing-arrear-exams-aicte/articleshow/78412479.cms||Suresh Kumar
October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||No additional financial aid for MC, gets Rs 30 crore again||Chandigarh: The developmental works of the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) will continue to be put on hold as the civic body authority has not received any additional financial relief from the finance department (FD) of the Chandigarh administration. Like previous months, the FD has released Rs 30-crore grant-in-aid (GIA) to the MC for September. Significantly, the move has come after the MC wrote to the administration for additional funds to run the civic body authority in a proper manner and to restart the developmental works. Moreover, the matter of extra money was also raised in the routine meeting with the senior officers concerned, but all in vain. The MC had recently written a letter to the UT saying, “Majority of the work given to the MC are related to public utilities services, which contribute negligible towards revenue generation. Consequent upon this, the corporation largely remains dependent upon financial assistance provided by the UT in the shape of grant-in-aid (GIA). From the last five-year data, it is abundantly clear that there is a wide gap between the GIA received and expenditure incurred by the MC on various development works apart from establishment expenses of employees like salaries, wages to regular or work charged and other contractual and outsource staff and other committed expenditure like electricity and water charges, telephone etc. In addition, there is recurring liability of pension and other benefits for the retired staff of the MC.” When asked, a senior engineering official said, “Since the civic body authority is struggling to meet its committed liabilities, we are unable to prepare any developmental agenda due to paucity of funds. The accounts department is releasing money only for emergency and necessary maintenance works and that too after getting approval of the senior officers concerned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-additional-financial-aid-for-mc-gets-rs-30-crore-again/articleshow/78416273.cms||Deepak Yadav

October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||Video-making event on safety measures disappoints schools||CHANDIGARH: The UT education department has decided to organise a video-making competition regarding safety measures to be taken by schools during the C0vid-19 pandemic for safe teaching and learning process. However, not more than 12 schools out of the total 93 government high and government senior secondary schools will be able to participate. According to the notice issued by the district education officer, only those schools, where minimum 50 students are coming daily, are eligible. Maximum number of schools will be ineligible owing to less strength of students per day. The move has been criticised by teachers of various schools, who wish to participate, but cannot as the strength in their school is much less, especially in high schools where only classes IX and X students are coming. The details sent to the heads and principals read as, “A video-making competition is being organised by the the education department, UT Chandigarh. All the principals and heads of those schools, which have daily average attendance of 50 students per day, are eligible to participate in the competition.” According to the details, the time duration of the video will not be more than 100 seconds. The video will be motivational in nature that will showcase the efforts made by schools to provide safe and conducive environment to the teaching and learning process. The narration and captions if any can be in English, Hindi or Punjabi. The last date for submission is October 10, 2020 and each school will send one video only and send the same through an email. A teacher requesting anonymity said, “Only 10 to 15 students are coming to our school daily. The number of students shouldn’t be a parameter for such competitions when they are meant to highlight safety measures and motivate students and parents to come to schools, which are providing all safety measures.” While the education department started this competition on Tuesday, some schools have already made their own videos, showing safety precautions that they have taken to motivate parents to send their children to school. They have shared the videos on the social media pages of the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/video-making-event-on-safety-measures-disappoints-schools/articleshow/78416277.cms||Kamini Mehta

October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||We are the best, people careless: Fire department||AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services has claimed that it is one of the best fire departments in the country, but getting regular fire safety audits done is the citizens’ duty and they are not vigilant in following rules. In response to a PIL seeking action in the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s chief fire officer, M F Dastoor stated on Wednesday that the AMC’s fire department is equipped with all the latest and necessary machinery and is one of the best fire departments in the entire country. This was in rebuttal to allegations that the department lacks adequate infrastructure and human resources. While it claimed to be one of the best, it shifted the blame to the people for renewal of ‘No Objection’ certificates of buildings, which are mandated and indicate that fire prevention equipment is in place. The issue of renewal of NOCs emerged because Shrey Hospital’s fire NOC had lapsed and was not renewed. Dastoor stated, “As per the prevailing policy and CDGCR, the owner/occupier is supposed to obtain an NOC from the fire department, if the concerned building is falling within certain criteria for obtaining such certificate. It is the duty of the concerned occupier/developer to get renewals every 11 months and it is unfortunate to note that even at the stake of risk of one’s life, citizens are not vigilant to comply with these conditions of periodical renewal.” The fire officer has claimed that about 5,000 fire and rescue calls are effectively managed in the city in a year. It has 15 fire stations and four new stations are coming up in the next 18 months. It has spent Rs 270 crore on upgradation in last 15 years. However, when it comes to renewals of NOCs, he reiterated, “Citizens are required to perform their legal, statutory and constitutional duty and in the facts of the case, the duty of getting periodical renewal is moral as well as social.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/we-are-the-best-people-careless-fire-dept/articleshow/78415331.cms||---

It has been stated that not more than 12 students will be made to sit in one room. The result of the compartment examination will be declared latest by October 10 at 1pm. If any school prepares the results early, it can be declared before October 10 as well. “Some schools have only a few students for appearing in compartment exams and therefore, such schools will get free with the exams sooner and so the resukts can be declared early,” said the authorities. Schools will have to send a compiled result to the office of the district education officer by 4 pm on October 10. Over 4,000 students of class IX and 550 of class XI will appear for the compartment exam. A circular issued on Tuesday evening by the education department stated that the CBSE conducted the compartment examinations for classes X and XII from September 22 to 29, and on the same lines, second chance to students of classes IX and XI will be given. The other reason for holding these tests at school-level is due to the central health ministry’s guidelines for containing the spread of Covid-19. It was further mentioned that all the second Saturdays from October will be working for the current academic session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/schools-get-guidelines-on-holding-compartment-exams/articleshow/78416275.cms||Kamini Mehta

October 1, 2020||Dehradun||10,000 trees to be cut for Dehradun airport||DEHRADUN: In order to facilitate the expansion of Doon’s Jolly Grant airport, Uttarakhand forest department has decided to give up 215 acres of land of Shivalik Elephant Reserve, one of the premier elephant reserves in the country. The move will mean not only a further shrink in the area for elephant movement but also lead to cutting of almost 10,000 trees. TOI exclusively accessed details of the proposed transfer of land that shows that a total of 9,745 trees (including precious species like khair (3405), sheesham (2135), sagon (185) and gulmohar (120) along with 25 other species of trees are among those that are proposed to be cut so that work on the airport can be facilitated. The move, conservationists say, is going to be “devastating for the fragile ecosystem of Doon valley” since the forest is home to not just elephants but also leopards, cheetal, sambhar and several other wildlife species. Further, the area proposed to be given for airport development falls within a 10-km radius of the Rajaji National Park Eco Sensitive Zone and notified elephant corridors are also located within just a 3-km radius of the proposed area. The proposal letter accessed by TOI says that in the area, “there is regular movement of wild animals especially elephants, leading to man-animal conflict affecting humans as well as wild animals.” Reacting sharply against the move, Gauri Maulekhi, member secretary of the Uttarakhand chapter of the NGO, People for Animals, said, “Forests and wildlife are the unique selling proposition of Uttarakhand’s tourism and employment. To preserve it must be the sacrosanct duty of the government but it is highly unfortunate that they are doing the opposite. The loss of 215 acres of Shivalik Elephant Reserve will start a vicious cycle which will end in doom for the state. Loss of habitat will mean more loss of forest and thereby, further human-wildlife conflict.” She further added that “rapidly shrinking corridors from Rjaji to Corbett were a blow to the traditional movement of elephants anyway.” “The stark hypocrisy on the ground is brazen and bewildering. Now a total loss of 215 acres will only be a death blow to the species, already reeling under the adverse impacts of inbreeding due to loss of corridors. With the forests and wildlife gone, one piece at a time, and consequent shrinking tourism, who will ever need larger airports?” The DFO of Dehradun, Rajiv Dhiman, meanwhile told TOI that the clearance for the proposal was given in the state wildlife board meeting and a wildlife mitigation plan has also been submitted to the chief wildlife warden for clearance. “Currently the proposal is with the central government for approval,” he added. The move to transfer forest land for airport development comes soon after the Doon valley is on the verge of losing 2500 British-era sal trees to facilitate a 4-km-stretch of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway which was reported by TOI earlier. It also comes in the wake of rising man-elephant conflict due to shrinkage in space for elephant movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/10000-trees-to-be-cut-for-doon-airport/articleshow/78412489.cms||Shivani Azad

This announcement came after traders started a campaign on Sunday demanding for the works to be completed before festival season.S Arasu, the city engineer from the corporation, said that the contractor has been instructed not to take up any new excavation works till the end of Diwali and finish the ongoing works soon. He added that the corporation will extend its full cooperation for the traders and shoppers during Diwali shopping.“There will not be any new excavation works. We will resume works after the festival is over,” he said. The civic body has taken up landscaping of four Masi Streets under the Smart City scheme-- construction of storm water drain, underground drainage, providing platform for pedestrians and ducting of cables underground. The works were carried out in a phased manner till lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19. With the majority of work being completed in South Masi and West Masi Streets, works to lay cement road at South Masi – West Masi Streets commenced recently. Irked over the excavation works for the road works, traders initiated a campaign by sending postcards to air their demand seeking stoppage of works from October 5 onwards to facilitate Diwali shopping. While they have faced heavy loss due to lockdown and poor sales in the last six months, they are heavily banking on Diwali sales to come out of the crisis.Secretary of Tamil Nadu textile merchants’ association, Ashraf Tayub said that they were relieved after hearing the positive decision taken by the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traders-relieved-as-corpn-vows-to-end-masi-streets-work-in-a-week/articleshow/78416276.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Madurai||Sewage overflow on Vaigai River Bank Road troubles residents||Madurai: A few manholes on the Vaigai South River Bank Road at Ismailpuram are overflowing and sewage water is flowing in the streets for past few months creating hardship for commuters and the residents. The local people said that they have taken up the issue with Madurai Corporation authorities in the past, but the issue has not been sorted out so far.Residents said that overflowing of sewage water is a regular affair. It is gushing out of the manholes and flows towards the retaining wall of the Vaigai, where it gets stagnated. It has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. “We are living in the stink through the day, which gets worse in the morning, when the overflow is high. During nights, it’s the turn of the swarm of mosquitoes,” said R Vijaya, a resident of Ismailpuram, 4th Street.Motorists are affected as sewage water is splashed on them. Sewage is overflowing from at least five manholes at a distance of every 20 to 50 metres. Commuters said that it delays them from reaching their destinations on time. Many take up alternative Vaigai North Bank Road and the congested Kamaraj Salai.P Jayachandran, a resident of New Bangajam Colony, said that he used to take Vaigai South Bank Road to reach his office in Simmakkal since it is the short route. Due to sewage water, he now takes up Kamarajar Salai Road though it takes 10 minutes more to reach his office. “I do not want to soil my dress, while going to office. Hence, I take circuitous and crowded roads. To adjust the timing, I start a bit early now,” he said.City engineer from Madurai Corporation S Arasu said that the civic body is very much aware of the issue. The overflowing is due to population increase in the locality, resulting in increased water usage. “A tender has been floated to carry out the work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sewage-overflow-on-vaigai-river-bank-road-troubles-residents/articleshow/78416274.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Two tragedies, 30 deaths later, Gujarat govt to include cities||AHMEDABAD: A day after justifying in detail why municipal corporations have not been placed in the purview of the Gujarat Fire Safety Act, the state government on Wednesday took a U-turn and told the Gujarat high court that the law will be made applicable to all eight municipal corporations. The high court had raised the question after petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal pointed out the exclusion of city areas from the law enacted in 2013 while demanding action against the culprits in the Shrey Hospital fire incident, in which eight Covid-19 patients died on August 6. The petitioner has been agitating this issue even as an advocate in a separate petition for applicability of new fire safety laws in municipal areas, because it empowers authorities to take certain penal actions against defaulters. Earlier, the issue was debated when 22 youngsters died in Surat coaching class fre tragedy in 2019. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice J B Pardiwala found the exclusion of city areas form the purview of the law very surprising. The chief justice even remarked that it amounts to fraud on people. To HC’s question, the state government filed a detailed affidavit on Tuesday evening and gave seven reasons for not including municipal corporation areas under the purview of the Act. However, during the hearing, the advocate general made a statement that process will be initiated soon to apply the fire safety law to all eight municipal corporations of the state. The court also recorded this statement in its order as the development took place after filing of the affidavit. In its affidavit, the state government, however, relied on the efficacy of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, Gujarat Municipalities Act, Comprehensive General Development Control Regulations Act and Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act for not covering the cities in the Fire Safety Act. It claimed that the civic bodies in large cities have their own local fire services and they are governed by these laws. Moreover, the municipal corporations are financially resourceful to look after their fire emergencies and they have adequate fire staff. Ahmedabad has got 880, Surat has 1,093 and Vadodara has 483 fire staff. However, the judges posed a question to the government about training and quantification of fire staff in municipalities to deal with fire accidents and sought details about it. The petitioner was not satisfied with the details placed in government reply and pointed out that the high court had ordered to supply details about fire safety position in the entire state and not about the city of Ahmedabad only. He complained that the government was silent on details about human resource and preparedness in this regard. The HC has posted further hearing on October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2-tragedies-30-deaths-later-guj-govt-to-include-cities/articleshow/78415359.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Chandigarh||Sweet shops to display ‘best defore’ date from today||Mohali: Shopkeepers selling sweets will now have to tell the expiry date or ‘best before’ date of all sweets available in their shops. While disclosing this, district health officer Dr Subhash Sharma said in order to ensure availability of quality and hygienic sweets for people, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued new directions. He said in case of non-packaged or loose sweets, containers or tray holding sweets should display the ‘best before’ date of the product with effect from October 1, 2020. “However, in addition to this, the food business operator or the shopkeeper, will also have to display the date of manufacturing, which shall be purely voluntary and non-binding,” he said. Dr Sharma said sweetmeat shopkeepers will have to decide and display the best before date of sweets depending on the nature of the product and the local conditions. “An indicative list of the shelf life of various types of sweets is given in the guidance note on the safety of traditional milk products, which is available on the FSSAI website,” he said. These directions have been issued by the authority which is the statutory body under the health and family welfare ministry, he maintained. “The purpose of showing date is to protect the health of people so that customers could know whether the sweets they are buying are fresh or expired,” he added. The DHO asked people to purchase pure food items and asked shopkeepers to pay special attention to cleanliness and hygiene. He said the new norms were not meant to harass shopkeepers, but to ensure that clean and quality food items are made available to customers. He solicited cooperation in implementing the new guidelines for a healthy society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sweet-shops-to-display-best-defore-date-from-today/articleshow/78416278.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Nashik||Nashik FDA streamlines Remdesivir drug supply||NASHIK: The supply of Remdesivir drug for treating Covid-19 patients in Nashik has been streamlined following the painstaking efforts made by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) authorities who ensured distribution of 3,247 vials between September 29 and 30 to pharmacy outlets attached with 64 hospitals. The total Remdesivir vials available at present at these outlets is 4,050 vials. The daily requirement of the drug in Nashik is between 300 to 400 vials. District collector Suraj Mandhare said that Nashik does not have any shortage of the drug at present as all necessary steps were taken to strengthen the supply. “There is complete transparency in the sale of the drug,” he said. Nashik FDA assistant commissioner Madhuri Pawar said that her department has been working overtime to co-ordinate with drug companies and hospitals to step up the supply. “Our team comprising three drug inspectors Chandrakant More, Prashant Brahmankar and Mahesh Deshpande, along with tehsildar Shivkumar Avalkanthe, are putting in untiring efforts to ensure that there is no shortage, hoarding and black marketing of the drug,” said Pawar. According to Pawar, the FDA teams are visiting hospitals randomly to check the requisition of the drug by doctors in the prescriptions and verifying if patients were administered it or not. “So far, our teams have not come across any malpractices from any hospitals and their pharmacy stores. We have warned the pharmacy outlets that they would face music if there is any clandestine sale of the medicine at premium,” said Pawar, adding that the department is getting all help and guidance from the district collector. Meanwhile, Pawar said that arrangements have also been made for retail sale of the drug through prescriptions at the medical stores of Ashoka Hospital, Appolo Hospital and Wockhardt Hospital. The helpline numbers are 9766811279/8780186682.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-fda-streamlines-remdesivir-drug-supply/articleshow/78415373.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
October 1, 2020||Madurai||Surgeries, accidents raise demand for blood||Madurai: Performing surgeries that were postponed during the lockdown and increase in road accidents due to unlock are the major factors reflected in the increased demand for blood at hospitals. On the other hand, closure of colleges that used to be the main source of blood in cases of emergencies and fear among voluntary donors and their kin is affecting donations. “Online classes and work from home are also affecting blood donation. Usually when hospitals sent requests to colleges a group of students would be organized for donation. But now they are unable to come during the day as the attendance is marked based on their presence during online classes,” says R Rahul Kumar of Nanjil Blood Donation Foundation. The Kanyakumari-based organisation has a network of 10,000 active donors including 4,900 negative group donors, spread across the state. Though all of them are from Kanyakumari district, 70% are living in Chennai and other cities for a living. “We get requests from Chennai and try to coordinate with our volunteers there, but they are back in their hometown due to work from home,” he said. Sharmila N of Boom Welfare Community, Madurai, that has 4,000 regular blood donors, said they received requests for 10 to 15 patients in need of blood from March to May during the strict lockdown. “It was primarily for deliveries and unavoidable surgeries that needed two or more units of blood. Now we are getting around 40 of which we are able to meet the requirements of only around 20 to 25 requests,” she said. One of the major inhibitions is fear of contracting Covid-19 by going to a hospital to donate blood. “Last week we had a request from a youth seeking blood for his grandmother for a surgery. He refused to donate blood due to some wrong advice by relatives. But he donated blood, after we convinced him with facts. But how many can we convince in person,” asks Srivatsa Vema of the Plate Club, Chennai. Srivatsa said that the requirement of major government hospitals in Chennai now is only 50% to 60% compared to normal situation, but closure of colleges has made it difficult to meet the requirement. On the other hand, the organisations pointed out that blood bank in most government hospitals are open only till 1 or 2 pm and rarely till 3 pm, unlike private blood banks that are open round-the-clock. They made an appeal to the health department to keep blood banks at government hospitals open till evenings during the Covid-19 pandemic to motivate donors. “Once a new donor goes to a blood bank and is rejected due to the time factor, the possibilities of him or her not donating blood again is very high. It affects those in need in the long run and sends a bad message,” Rahul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/surgeries-accidents-raise-demand-for-blood/articleshow/78416280.cms||M K Ananth

October 1, 2020||Delhi||How new decomposing solution will help turn crop residue into mulch||NEW DELHI: Scientists in the microbiology division of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), who have developed a microbial solution to decompose crop stubble into manure, are all prepped up to release their technique after carrying out trials for nearly 18 months. Known as “Pusa decomposer”, the solution would be made by adding four capsules to jaggery, gram flour and 25 litres water and leaving it to ferment for 10-12 days. After this period, the solution would again have to be diluted with 500 litres of water to be sprayed on crop residue spread over one hectare of land. Explaining the technique, IARI microbiology division head Dr K Annapurna told TOI, “Different types of fungi have been used together for the degradation process and the capsules have fungal spores.” A farmer would have to first boil five litres of water with 150 grams of jaggery. He would then have to add 50gm of gram flour and four capsules to the lukewarm solution and mix it. The growth of fungi would then start. The process would have to be repeated till the solution reaches a volume of 25 litres, which would take 10-12 days. “The solution of 25 litres will have to be diluted with 500 litres of water and then sprayed on crop residue in one hectare. Farmers can use rotavator machines to ensure proper mixing of the solution with the stubble. This will have to be followed by irrigation for faster decomposition. The compost will be ready in 25-30 days after which wheat sowing can begin,” said the scientist. As paddy straw is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, the compost will enrich the soil with nutrients. “The health of soil after the use of the bio-decomposer technology can be tested later. This will help farmers cut down the use of chemical fertilisers from the next year,” said Annapurna. The scientists at IARI had been working on this technology for nearly five years, but they prepared it in capsule form around 18 months ago. They validated the technology in farmlands of Punjab and Haryana over the past one and a half years. The capsules are priced at Rs 20 a packet, but IARI has commercialised the technique and sold it to six companies so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-new-decomposing-solution-will-help-turn-crop-residue-into-mulch/articleshow/78415390.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
October 1, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Vigilance probe go-ahead seen as ploy to trip CBI FIR||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government, that gave the go-ahead for the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to investigate irregularities in the Life Mission project, on Wednesday approached the high court with a plea stating that CBI’s FIR in the case, also registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), has mala fide intent. In a petition filed by chief executive officer of Life Mission, the government contended that CBI’s FIR is an abuse of the process of law and is liable to be quashed. On the basis of government clearance, vigilance registered an FIR in the special court, here, on Tuesday. Sources termed the move a ploy to counter the central agency’s FIR in high court. Since vigilance has no power to seize files under a preliminary inquiry, the hurriedly registered case could also be an attempt to legitimize holding on to files relating to the project it had seized from the local self-government department, they said. Allegations in the complaint, that two companies that undertook construction under the project accepted foreign contribution directly, do not make out any offence under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010, the government petition in court contended. The companies – Unitac and Sane Ventures – do not come under categories of persons prohibited from receiving foreign contribution under section 3 of the act. Therefore, even if it is assumed that they had received any foreign contribution, no offence can be said to have been committed, it said. Experts say several court rulings have held that there cannot be two FIRs relating to the same cognizable offence. While CBI’s FIR has cited “unknown officials of the Life Mission” as third accused and has also added PCA along with sections of FCRA, the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau has slapped only sections of PCA in its FIR. “Since both are dealing with the same matter, it is likely that CBI would have an edge over vigilance as it is the agency which is empowered to probe sections of FCRA. It is also possible the vigilance FIR could be merged with that of CBI and the CBI is asked to investigate,” a senior official with the law department said.

AMC’s chief fire officer M F Dastoor has claimed so in an affidavit filed in the Gujarat high court. He, however, has not clarified whether 1,300 hospitals and clinics had fire NOC in the first week of August or by end of September. He has stated, “Out 2,022 hospitals and clinics within city limits of Ahmedabad, about 1,300 units are having valid NOC and numbers are increasing day by day, as after August 2020, intensive procedures are set in motion by the fire department and all hospitals and clinics are directed to comply with the conditions of obtaining fire NOC.” Dastoor has also stated that due to the prevalent Covid-19 situation, owners and occupiers of buildings including hospitals are facing difficulty in installation of fire equipments. “However, the process is on and expedited and the fire department would see to it that all hospitals and clinics are covered with the net of valid NOC,” he submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1300-of-the-2022-hospitals-in-city-have-fire-noc-now/articleshow/78415387.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Delhi||After years of wait, NDMC plugs leak at Delhi's Palika Bazaar||NEW DELHI: The long-pending issues of seepage from the roof, damp walls, non-functional toilet blocks and waterlogging in corridors during rain at Palika Bazaar have finally been addressed by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). Traders claimed that the lawn above the underground market was leading to damp walls. Also, no repair work had been done for a long time and waterlogging was prevalent for the past 6-7 years. “Watering of the lawn results in water seeping into the shops below. NDMC is now fixing the roof with reinforced cement concrete and laying a 3mm polyurethane coating to avoid leakage. Other chemicals and iron mesh are being used to fix the problem permanently,” said Baljit Kohli, chairman of Palika Bazaar Shopkeepers’ Welfare Association. An NDMC official said the work would take 7-8 months to complete and the shopkeepers won’t face any civic problems during the next monsoon. “The terrace of Palika Bazaar is a huge green lawn, which is why it has been divided into four parts to carry out dense repairs. The soil and plants are being removed before carrying out the repair work,” added the official. Once the roof was fixed, the civic agency would redevelop the park, which was closed for visitors during the pandemic. “We will place carpet grass, decorative plants and lights in each of the four portions one by one,” said the official. The 10 toilet blocks, which were in a pathetic condition and remained unused by shopkeepers and visitors, have also been repaired. They now have new flooring, exhaust fans, doors, taps, etc, said traders. “During the pandemic, only two toilets had been opened. As hundreds of people use the toilets, it can result in unhygienic conditions. To ensure that people don’t get infected, urinals in other blocks will also be used. Before the repairs, people avoided the toilets owing to their deplorable state with no proper lights, exhaust fans, etc,” said Kohli. Another trader said, “Some repair work was also done in the main complex. Now, the central airconditioning has started operating. Visitors have also started trickling here.” Watch After years of wait, NDMC plugs leak at Delhi's Palika Bazaar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-years-of-wait-ndmc-plugs-leak-at-palika-bazaar/articleshow/78436924.cms||Vibha Sharma
October 1, 2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Unlock 5.0 gives hope to cine hall owners||BHOPAL: Though the Central government on Wednesday indicated that cinema halls/ cineplexes/ multiplexs will be allowed to open in Unlock-5 with 50% sitting capacity, cinema hall owners feel it may not happen soon, may be next year. “I have also come to know about the decision. But, we don’t expect spectators in this situation. As far as I know, the cinema halls can open from October 15 but for whom? Let alone 50%, we are not expecting even 10% of the capacity. For a handful of people, all the staff, eilectricity load as usual and maintenance, it’s not viable,” said Bunny Singh, owner of two cineplexes in Bhopal.. The cinema halls, where movies changed every week till the pandemic broke out, stand deserted for over six months now. “Cinema halls will not open at least this year. The manner in which the coronavirus infection is spreading, opening of cinema halls anytime in 2020 doesn’t seem possible,” said president of Bhopal Cinema Association, Aziz Ahmed. He further said that the film industry, too, is not keen to see cinema halls open during the pandemic. When asked whether new films are not ready due to the prolonged ban on shooting or there is some other reason for the film industry's reluctance to release new films, he said, “There are 11 films ready for release, but they are all big budget films -- over Rs 200 crore. Why would producers and distributors release the film now when only 50% or even less of the capacity will be allowed to sit and watch the film in a cinema hall?” he asked. Bunny Singh, owner of the two-screen cineplex in new Bhopal, also expressed similar sentiments. He said, “The central government is postponing opening of cinema halls and I don't think there will be any difference even if the cinema halls are allowed to operate. The kind of situation we are in, who will come to see films?” When asked about estimated losses to cinema hall owners due to closure of over six months, Aziz Ahmed said, “We have stopped counting losses now. But, we do want that the minimum electricity charges, which comes to around Rs 40,000 and property tax charged by the BMC, waived, but nobody is hearing us,” he said. Bunny Singh said that he has power connection of 165 KW and minimum charge for each KW is Rs 16, 500 and this way, he has to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh as minimum charges to the power company. “We are not earning anything from the cinema halls, but power company is earning at our cost. This is not justified in any sense,” he said. When asked whether there is any chance of cinema halls and multiplexes opening this year, film distributor and office-bearer of Central India Cine Distributors' Association, Jai Prakash Chaukse, said, “It is difficult. With coronavirus cases spiralling, it looks difficult, at least till Diwali. Some big budget films are ready for release and the biggest of them all is ‘1983’. They have declared date of its release even - December 5. See if it happens?” Cine buffs, on the other hand, also seem to have forgotten the silver screen for now and have taken to watching web films and now IPL. A district administration official said that guidelines on opening of cinrma halls, entertainment parks and swimming pools were expected towards the end of September, but it didn’t happen. “It is a tricky issue. Hundreds of people watching cinema in a AC hall for 2 to 3 hours and even if 3-4 of them are infected, many more in the hall could get infected. That's why government seems to be extra cautious in allowing cinema halls and multiplexes to come alive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cine-hall-owners-seek-powerful-relief/articleshow/78413923.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Over 60% Covid positive cases are from rural Andhra Pradesh||Visakhapatnam: Despite a stabilising trend for the last two months, Covid-19 has made strong inroads into rural areas of Andhra Pradesh, which are reporting over 60% of cases at present. Till two months ago, urban pockets were the major contributors to the growth in numbers, with cities and towns like Vijayawada, Guntur, Kurnool, Narasaropeta, Nandyal, Anantapur, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry, Kakinada, Nellore and Kadapa accounting for a majority of cases. New clusters, however, sprang up with the gradual resumption of economic activity and the phase-wise reopening after the lockdown. In East Godavari, urban areas such as Rajahmundry, Kakinada and surroundings contributed 80% of cases in the initial months of the outbreak. Now, for the last few weeks, Amalapuram revenue division has consistently outnumbered urban areas in terms of daily new infections in the district. The division alone recorded around 16,500 Covid-19 cases as of Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-60-covid-positive-cases-are-from-rural-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/78415453.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Society chairman to face jail if fire NOC not valid||AHMEDABAD: Now get ready for a jail term if you fail to renew your fire NOC in the coming months. With the state government committing to enforce the Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2013, across all municipal corporations, the onus will now be on the resident welfare association (RWA) chairman, secretary or the building administration of a commercial complex to procure a fire safety certificate every year and upload it onto an Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation website to get an NOC. The website is being currently developed at the AMC. But this raises another question. Who will inspect the roughly 30,000 buildings that require fire safety NOCs in Ahmedabad? Senior officials at the urban development department and a few officials from a handful of municipal corporations have suggested to the government to authorize building architects, along with existing fire safety agencies, to inspect and then issue fire safety certificates to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). “The AMC does not have staff to inspect 30,000 buildings. Also, building architects submit fire safety plans before they are issued Building Use (BU) permissions. They can very well process NOCs for the buildings they have designed each year. There are such suggestions being made to the state government,” claims a senior urban development department official. While that takes care of tragic building fires like the one in Takshashila building fire of Surat, but more tragic accidents have taken place in hospitals. The Shrey Hospital fire in early August in Ahmedabad is still raging in the city’s conscience. “It is true, state health department is yet to enforce The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 that has special clauses to ensure fire safety measures for special buildings like hospitals. Gujarat and Goa are the two states that are yet to enact this law,” said a senior urban development department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/society-chairman-to-face-jail-if-fire-noc-not-valid/articleshow/78415422.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Tiger reserves to open today after Covid, monsoon break||JAIPUR: Tiger reserves in the state, Ranthambore and Sariska, which are known worldwide for its tiger sighting, will reopen to the public on Thursday after approximately five months break. In March, all zones of the reserves were closed for tourists during the peak wildlife tourist season to curb the spread of coronavirus. However, parks were once again opened for tourists on June 21 for nine days, before they were finally closed on July 1. During the three-month monsoon break, zone 1 to 5 at RNP and zone 1 to 3 at STR where closed for tourists, while the safaris in outer zones of the jungles were allowed. An official at RNP said, “The online booking for tourists is open for all zones. The number of vehicles has not been increased in this new tourist season. Following the previous season pattern, 140 vehicles per day will be given entry to the park.” The time of morning shift at Ranthambore and Sariska will start from 6.30am. Timing for evening safaris start from 3pm. The gates of the core area of tiger reserves will be opened for safari, with a slew of measures to prevent the spread of Covid. In view of the preparations to reopen reserves for tourists, the department officials held a meeting with the representatives of drivers and guides, where new rules were discussed. A senior forest official at STR said, “It will be mandatory for all the drivers, nature guides and tourists to wear mask. Without a mask entry would be denied. As a precaution, all tourist vehicles will be sanitised before going and after coming back from the park tour. Sanitisers will also be arranged for tourists.” The opening of the parks has brought a sigh of relief in the related business community. The industry has already suffered heavy losses due to coronavirus in the past after most hotel bookings were cancelled. “All types of related businesses and industries had suffered – tourism included. It was peak tourist season for wildlife. We are hoping the new season will help recover the industry soon,” said a tour operator Box Tiger strays into farm The incidents of young tigers straying into human habitation on the fringes of Ranthambore continue. On Wednesday, panic gripped Shyampur village under Kundrea range after a one-and-half-year-old tiger reached inside a farm. The animal went outside on its own without hurting any villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tiger-reserves-will-reopen-in-state-after-covid-and-monsoon-break/articleshow/78415441.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Students slam striking varsity staffers as exams deferred||Nagpur: With final year exams of Nagpur University deferred due to statewide strike by non-teaching staffers, students are in a fix yet again. Student activist Ajit Singh said delaying the exam was a bad decision. “One of the worst decisions taken by the NU. It will affect not only final year or semester students, but all others also. Those going on strike are not concerned about future of students. They know that their jobs are safe and hence not much thought is being given before taking any such step,” said Singh. Student Aadit Ved said the exam has been delayed quite a bit already. “A cloud of uncertainty has been looming over the heads of final year students since April. This postponement of the exams will affect the students, especially those who want to pursue further studies as UGC has already published calendar for the new academic year,” said Ved. Another student Disha Goje said deferring the exam was not the right step. “Postponing exams is the worst decision taken ever. When the exam was about to take place, it was to be held online and for just one hour and single exam a day. The pattern must be changed and all subjects could be taken on the same day,” she said. “We got more than six months for preparation and there are just a few subjects. All the exams should be taken on the same day with half-hour break in-between,” she added. Another student Sachet Makhija said, “In this pandemic situation, it is clearly visible that NU suffers from red-tapism and has made a mockery of students’ future. Looking at this conduct of the university, in near future, students would prefer to study in a private university which has better administration.” Dimple Anandani, NU student, said, “Whenever the delay is beyond what one would expect, it gets frustrating. You are bound to feel stressed about the long wait. NU should take serious note of this and come up with different techniques of examination.” Student Riya Jishnani said the online exams must go ahead as planned. “NU should take online MCQ pattern exams as soon as possible as it is more convenient for the students to appear for it. This way, students can prepare for their future studies and apply for job,” said Jishnani.

October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||People must be cautious, abide by regulations: Govt||Hyderabad: After pubs and parks, the state government has now decided to unlock Hyderabad’s tourism sites, playgrounds, sports facilities and swimming pools from October 1. As part of unlock 5.0 it’s given the go ahead for all tourist attractions — including historic sites, forts, museums and stadiums under the department of tourism and archaeology — to be thrown open to the public. Even a boat ride on the iconic Hussainsagar Lake is now off the barred list. “All historical sites under the state government and buses to these sites will be opened to the public. We will ensure all Covid-related measures are in place,” said B Manohar, managing director, Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation The Golconda Fort, which falls under the Archaeological Survey of India, was opened earlier this month. Speaking about it, V Srinivas Goud, minister of state for excise, sports, tourism and culture said that boating services at Mir Alam Tank and Durgam Cheruvu would also resume from Thursday. Along with the lakes and archaeological spots, even private sports centres including swimming pools, have been allowed to start operations. “People should be cautious and abide by all Covid-19 regulations,” said Goud while urging citizens to follow social distancing while visiting these facilities. In light of Covid regulations, temperature of tourists will be checked through the thermo scanners at tourist centers. Tourism staff must wear face masks as well as hand gloves. Goud suggested that visitors maintain a physical distance of six feet while also directing authorities to allow digital payments, online ticket booking and online payments at tourist destinations to encourage tourists. Apart from precautionary measures at tourist sites, the department of tourism has suggested that bus seats be cleaned with sanitizers. Tour operators have been instructed to arrange seats in the buses so that tourists can maintain physical distance. Sign boards are to be set up at tourist centers to make the Covid-19 regulations visible to visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/people-must-be-cautious-abide-by-regulations-govt/articleshow/78415472.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 1, 2020||Madurai||In fight for CM’s post, OPS losing supporters to EPS||Madurai: While the AIADMK has stated that the party would name its chief minister candidate for the 2021 assembly election on October 7, party workers, including former supporters of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, from Madurai and other regions are strongly pitching for Edappadi K Palaniswami. Sensing the mood within the party, OPS backers are shifting allegiance and openly expressing reservations about their leader, who drew popular support with his ‘dharmayudh’ in February 2017 when he rebelled against former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s aide V K Sasikala and her family. In private, party leaders too had revealed that majority of the members present at the executive council meeting, held on Monday, too were seen to be supporting ‘EPS for CM’. The voices of support for OPS in party forums are growing weaker over the issue of naming the chief minister, multiple sources said. “There is no division in the party as to who would be CM candidate EPS or OPS. Here, it is about EPS continuing as CM and being named as the CM candidate,” an AIADMK leader said. The view is starker among partymen down the order. Melamadai A Jeyakumar, a former Madurai corporation councillor, said he has switched sides, though he was one of the earliest to extend support to OPS for his dharmayudh. “Due to the turmoil, I thought I should support OPS as Amma had picked him, but I began to realize my mistake when he did not seem to show any consideration for our hard work,” Melamadai A Jeyakumar, a former Madurai corporation councillor, said. S Uma Ganeshan, former Madurai AIADMK IT wing president, said EPS was the right choice. “He has proved it to the people of the state. What more do we want?” he asked. Shankar, a primary member of the AIADMK, said it was best to go with popular minister from Madurai region R B Udhayakumar. “We feel that our minister is in favour of EPS and I would definitely follow him,” he said. Another worker, Jeyakumar too chose to go with Udhayakumar in extending support to EPS. T Gowri Shankar, a IT wing member, hoped that the matter would be resolved by October 7 and they, as the IT wing, can gear up to work for the party’s victory in the next elections. “The party is immensely popular with the people, and it is disturbing that OPS is trying to mar the party’s image with his recent actions,” he said. While EPS has solid support in the western region, he has covered his base in the central region too, whose leaders, too, are now backing EPS against OPS. “I supported OPS during his dharmayudh right from the start. But he could not take care of his supporters, when it mattered and lost his support base,” said a senior leader and former minister in J Jayalalithaa’s regime.

The college officials said that through the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) mandate, the lab also performs the role of quality control testing. “About 40 labs in Gujarat are performing RT-PCR tests. To check the efficacy of the tests, several of their samples are sent to our lab monthly to ascertain whether the results are the same. The report of the same is also sent to ICMR,” said Dr Deepa Kinariwala, a lab tutor. In recent times, the lab has also been performing the validation of rapid antigen tests (RAT) in the state. Over 500 such samples are checked at the facility, said officials.

October 1, 2020||Jaipur||State to launch e-classroom on Oct 6||Jaipur: State education minister Govind Singh Dotasra will launch e-classroom for students on October 6. The e-classroom will have a collection of videos on different chapters of all subjects for students so that everyone can access it either on the YouTube or WhatsApp. The schools are closed due to the pandemic and government sees very little possibility for schools to re-open soon. Dotasra said chief minister Ashok Gehlot will launch these videos on October 6. “Our department has made these videos on their own. These videos will be uploaded on our official website, YouTube channel and other social media platforms. The idea is that students can see these videos which will help them connect them with studies,” said the minister. The minister added that it also had a provision to provide problem-solving sessions. These videos will be available under the free source scheme which means it can be availed by any student. The state has adopted the NCERT curriculum but using some books which are exclusive to the state. “Soon we will re-apply for the time slot,” said Dotasra. On reopening of schools, the minister said they would follow the central government guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-launch-e-classroom-on-oct-6/articleshow/78415483.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||State okayes Rs163cr relief for 6 flood-hit dists in Nagpur division||Nagpur: The state government has sanctioned Rs162.81 crore relief amount for flood-affected persons in six districts of Nagpur division. Heavy rains in late August in Madhya Pradesh (MP) had forced Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) to open gates of Totladoh, Kamptee Khairi and Gosikhurd dams, which led to massive flooding. Gates of dams in MP had also been opened. Vijay Wadettiwar, relief and rehabilitation minister, said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had provided Rs16.50 crore for relief work on emergency basis about a month ago.

October 1, 2020||Kozhikode||Political parties decry special court verdict||THIRUVANATHAPURAM/ KOZHIKODE: CPM, Congress and leaders of Muslim organizations expressed shock over the acquittal of all the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. BJP state president K Surendran welcomed the verdict and said the ‘haunting of top BJP leaders’ would stop after three decades. IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal asked CBI to file an appeal against the court verdict. “It is unfortunate that those who demolished Babri Masjid illegally and violently aren’t punished. We hope the investigation agency will go for an appeal. I appeal to everyone to maintain peace and preserve communal harmony,” he said. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the real question the verdict raises is whether Constitution and judicial system still exist. "It is serious that CBI couldn’t prove the charges against BJP leaders. There were television footages showed BJP leaders celebrating demolition. Why those visuals weren’t listed as evidence?" he said, adding that CBI must file an appeal to uphold the trust of the common man in the judicial system. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also echoed similar views. "The trial court verdict is a rude shock to India’s secular foundation. The apex court had found that demolition of Babri Masjid was a criminal act. It is a serious lapse on part of prosecution that the crime couldn’t be proven in court," he said. The then Vice-President KR Narayanan opined that the demolition of Babri Masjid was a crime on par with the murder of Mahatma Gandhi. “As a member, I was present in Rajya Sabha when he made this remark. After 28 years when the accused were acquitted, the country’s judicial system is being questioned. Observers have said that the verdicts in cases, which BJP government has special interests, happen in a particular manner,” said CPM politburo member M A Baby. "The demolition was witnessed live by people across the globe. It is now said that there is no evidence for such an act that happened before the eyes of everyone. Our country is passing through a dark phase," said former CM Oommen Chandy said. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said such setbacks are the result of saffronising Constitutional bodies. "The court has approved BJP’s argument that the demolition was not purposeful. The masks of fake secularists who had launched a lie campaign against BJP leaders have fallen," said Surendran. The Sunni faction led by Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar said the verdict was completely disappointing. In a statement, Kanthapuram and E Sulaiman Musaliyar said, "Years of planning went into the demolition. Some of the accused had travelled all around the country with a communal campaign." Acquitting them and saying that they were trying to stop the miscreants is painful. The SC had stated that the demolition was a criminal act. What message would the verdict send across by letting off all the accused, they asked. Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen state president TP Abdulla Koya Madani said the SC had condemned the act of demolition. The verdict that came after 28 years is the result of the sabotage undertaken by vested interests. "The legal fight should continue, or else mobs will be encouraged to do similar things," he said. Madani cautioned the community against the forces which will try to cash in on the feeling of betrayal. Wisdom president P N Abdul Latheef Madani and general secretary T K Ashraf said the citizens’ faith in the legal system should be preserved by ensuring justice from the higher court. Students Islamic Organisation said that the special CBI court protected the interests of Hindutva forces through the verdict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/political-parties-decry-special-court-verdict/articleshow/78413999.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Pune||More Covid patients opt for home isolation than before in Pune||PUNE: An increasing number of people infected with Covid-19 is opting for home isolation, both in the city and the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits. Home isolation cases in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits have increased from 46% to 63% within a month. More Covid-19 patients in the PMC limits are now in home quarantine as against those admitted to hospitals and Covid care centres, data released by the district health office revealed. On August 28, around 46% patients of 15,158 active cases were in home isolation in the PMC limits. The percentage has since then increased to 63. Of the 17,228 patients in the PMC limits, 10,948 patients have opted for home isolation, as on Monday. Patients with very mild Covid-19 symptoms and who have separate attached toilets and a room or bed in their homes are opting for home isolation. PMC health officials stated that the rise in the number of patients opting for home isolation was “steady”. A health official said, “The city had almost an equal number of cases in hospitals and home isolation around September 7. Since then, the patients in home isolation have increased. On Monday, it reached to 63%.” The PMC, however, appears to be facing problems during daily monitoring of the patients, as around 20% of them “do not answer the monitoring calls”. PMC additional commissioner Shantanu Goel said they would strictly adhere to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines on home isolation.“If a patient does not answer the monitoring call for three or more days, we will send a ward-wise medical team to their homes. If a patient is found violating the home isolation guidelines, he or she will be admitted to the Covid care centre,” he said. In the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, around 31% of the patients have opted for home isolation. As on Monday, the PCMC limits had over 7,100 cases. PCMC officials stated that there was a greater acceptance of the concept among people infected with Covid-19, their families as well a lot of housing societies. “As 2,500 people are at home, there is enough bed capacity in the Covid care centres, dedicated Covid healthcare centres and hospitals,” PCMC additional commissioner Santosh Patil said. Explaining the reason behind emphasizing on 40% cases in home isolation, he said, “Separate accommodation and a caretaker is one of the guidelines issued by the ICMR for home isolation. If we look at the twin towns, not over 40% citizens have separate accommodation.” The rural areas have also reported a noticeable increase in home isolation cases in the past one month — from 11% to 23%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-covid-patients-opt-for-home-isolation-than-before/articleshow/78415529.cms||Sarang Dastane

October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC takes suo motu cognizance of SMS hospital not treating Covid cases||Jaipur: The Rajasthan high court on Wednesday took suo motu cognizance of the SMS hospital, the biggest hospital in the state, not attending to Covid-19 patients. The court of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta in its order said it is shocking and surprising that the SMS hospital in Jaipur in not attending to Covid patients. A few days ago a petition was filed in the high court seeking direction to the state government to take over major private hospitals and attend to Covid patients at other government hospitals, including SMS. The court had issued notice to the government on the petition. The court will now hear both the cases on October 12. The state government in a major shift in its approach had decided that Covid patients would be attended to at dedicated Covid hospitals as patients suffering from other serious illness were deprived of medical facilities if all hospitals start treating Covid cases. However, with the Covid cases showing no signs of abating, there is demand for converting more hospitals into Covid-dedicated ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-takes-suo-motu-cognizance-of-sms-hosp-not-treating-covid-cases/articleshow/78415523.cms||---

The Mandsaur-based girl fled home and reached Sitamau in the district from where she boarded a bus for Indore. Then she boarded another bus and came to Bhopal. She wanted to board a bus from Bhopal to Delhi when the auto-rickshaw driver met her at ISBT. He observed that the girl looked tensed and immediately understood the matter when he heard her misleading her family members over phone. He informed Govindpura police over phone and handed over the girl to police. When police checked, they found that a missing person’s complaint regarding the girl was lodged at Sitamou police station in Mandsaur and informed her family members. The unidentified accused had sent a video promising a job to the girl and asked her to come to Rewari in Haryana. CSP Ankit Jaiswal said that the auto driver Manoj Gaikwad, 25, a resident of Anna Nagar, informed constable Sunil Rathore deployed at ISBT, that a 14-year-old girl had come to Bhopal from Indore and seemed tensed.

October 1, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||CBI to take up Kerala police hold-ups with SC||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Police’s alleged attempt to stonewall the investigation into the Periya double murder case is likely to be part of CBI’s status report that it will file with the Supreme Court by October 23. State police chief Loknath Behera, on the basis of a letter by IG (crimes) S Sreejith, had replied to the CBI investigating officer that the state government has already moved the SC against the high court judgment ordering a CBI investigation in the case. IG (crimes) also said the high court had ordered further investigation under section 173 (8) of CrPC by a different agency, and the chargesheet filed by the crime branch has not been suspended while ordering the CBI probe. CB argues the court asked CBI only to file a supplementary chargesheet that will cover matters such as collection of evidence, tracing eyewitnesses if any, etc. Behera said that under these circumstances a clarification is required regarding the mode of transfer of the case diary, and the matter is pending before the director general of prosecutions. CB had filed a chargesheet on May 20, 2019, against 14 persons under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 326, 201, 212, 120B, 118 and 302 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code. However, the high court had pointed out several lapses on the part of CB while transferring the case to the CBI. After the case was handed over to CBI, the agency registered an FIR for re-investigating the case and submitted it in the chief judicial magistrate court in Ernakulam on October 23, 2019. The CBI had twice filed a remand extension of those in custody, recorded the statements of the victims’ parents, and also collected call detail records (CDRs) of the accused and suspects. Sources said the agency further requires the original case diary to investigate lapses. Intentional omissions would result in CBI naming the investigating officer in its list of accused. “Kerala Police have no locus standi in holding on to case documents and all future trials in the case can be attended only by CBI. For whatever the court has asked the agency to investigate, the original case diary is mandatory. Under these circumstances, all these difficulties caused by the crime branch are likely to be covered in the status report to be filed before the SC,” a top CBI official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cbi-to-take-up-police-hold-ups-with-sc/articleshow/78414287.cms||KP Saikiran

October 1, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Salary deferment ordinance extended in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the government remains undecided over the formula to be adopted to minimise the resistance towards second phase of salary deferment, the ordinance that armed the government with provisions to exercise the emergency fiscal management was promulgated by the governor on Monday. The ordinance ``The Kerala Disaster and Public Health Emergency (Special provisions) Ordinance, 2020 was re-promulgated as the validity of the ordinance originally promulgated in April 2020 is set to expire on October 5. Though the assembly was in session in August, the government could not bring in a bill to replace the ordinance and hence the re-promulgation of the ordinance. "..it shall be competent and lawful for the government to defer, by notification, the pay in part, to the extent not exceeding one-fourth of the total monthly pay, due to an employee in any institution, owned or controlled or aided by the government, including aided school and college teachers, local self-government institutions as well as statutory bodies, universities, corporations, aided education institutions and such other institutions, as many be notified, for such period for the management of the situation rising out of such disaster or public health emergency or otherwise. The amount deferred as per section 5 shall be remitted by the institution concerned to the government treasury, as directed by the government." Meanwhile, state employees and teachers organisations (SETO) leaders organised protests against the government decision. "A government that refuse to honour the court order regarding salary deferment should at least be ready to implement the suggestion by the party secretariat of the largest constituent in the ruling combine. The government should drop its plans for another round of salary deferment and the governor should axe the ordinance. The portion of the salary that has already been deferred over the past six months should be given back to employees and teachers in lump sum," said SETO chairman Chavara Jayakumar. If the government insists on compulsory salary deferment, SETO would go on strike, he said. Though there were rumours that finance minister T M Thomas Isaac would hold more talks with employee organizations, no such meeting has been scheduled after talks failed in the last week September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/salary-deferment-ordinance-extended/articleshow/78414066.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nashik||Prepare list of top 10 criminals: Nashik rural SP tells police stations||NASHIK: Nashik Rural SP Sachin Patil, who recently took charge, has instructed all the in-charge officials of police stations in rural district to prepare a list of top 10 criminals under their respective jurisdictions. The aim is to take necessary preventive action against the criminals so that they refrain from resorting to crime and create menace in the society. Patil said that criminals involved in body and property offences and those into illegal businesses often create menace in the society; hence, it was necessary to take preventive action against such elements to keep them under check. A similar list would be prepared at the district level too. Thefts, burglary, highway robberies, chain robberies, etc. are common in rural areas given the topography of the district and its huge spread. Types of crime differ in the tribal, industrial and agricultural belts as well as in the textile town of Malegaon which is also communally sensitive. Highway robberies are consistent all over the rural district while incidents of armed dacoities and murder shake the entire rural district in between. In August, four members of a family, including a woman and her two children, were hacked to death by an unidentified person. The incident took place in a village in Nandgaon taluka. The investigation of the case is still under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/prepare-list-of-top-10-criminals-nashik-rural-sp-tells-police-stations/articleshow/78415525.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Rapid Response Team (RRT) of NMC Lakadganj Zone contacted a relative of the deceased on Wednesday. The relative’s number was given when swab samples of the deceased were taken for testing on August 13. “My uncle had tested positive on August 14. He was admitted in a private hospital at Jagnade square and died on September 9. NMC person called and asked me about health of my uncle. I was shocked and replied he had passed away on September 9,” he said. TOI found the name of deceased in the list of deaths on September 9. Sources from NMC Control Room said, “Some more such cases came to fore when staffers at the control room called mobile number of patients. Names of deceased as well as persons who tested positive in August and first two weeks of September have appeared in daily list of new cases in last one week or so.” Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B blamed a private laboratory. It is mandatory for the laboratories to upload names of positive as well as negative persons on ICMR’s website the same day. “Our investigation revealed this laboratory did not do so. We levied a fine and also temporarily shut it down and directed it to upload all left over cases. The option of uploading old cases in that particular day’s record is probably not there on website. It has nothing to do with NMC,” he said. NMC additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said, “I will inquire who uploaded the old cases on recent days. We obtained a list of cases from laboratory and sent to ICMR for uploading on that particular day and not in fresh dates. ICMR said it can upload old cases in that particular date’s record.” The laboratory claimed it did not upload old case on ICMR’s website in recent dates. “We uploaded name of this person (deceased) on ICMR’s website on August 22. This name was not in list sent to NMC for uploading on ICMR’s website,” a staffer said. If this is the case, then the deceased has been counted twice in total number of cases of the city. This laboratory has reportedly submitted list of around 20,000 leftover cases to the NMC of which around 1,000 are positive cases. It means NMC could not trace high-risk contacts of these patients as they were not uploaded on time by the laboratory. One of the activists on condition of anonymity said, “NMC could have avoided this. NMC should have ensured uploading of left over cases in that particular date by ICMR. Or the NMC should have deleted the names of old cases from daily list as it is having the list submitted by the laboratory.” If all left over cases of August were uploaded in the last few days of September, it will also affect this month’s test positivity rate, case fatality rate and recovery rate. Also, the number of tests and positive cases of last few days will be more than actual if such a thing has happened. TOI on September 20 had highlighted name of an alive man registered as Covid-19 death in NMC’s record. One of the person who died of novel coronavirus was registered as non-Covid death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-who-died-3-weeks-ago-features-in-nmc-list-of-fresh-ve-cases/articleshow/78415540.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||280 liquor bottles found in temple board member’s car||Vijayawada: Police seized 280 bottles of liquor from a parked car at Sitharamapuram under Jaggaiahpet police station limits in Krishna district on Wednesday. The car belongs to a member of the Kanaka Durga temple trust board. Jaggaiahpet police inspector Chandrasekhar said a police team searched the car bearing registration number AP16 BV 5577 and found 280 liquor bottles worth Rs 40,000. Cops then contacted the owner of the vehicle, Ch Venkata Naga Lakshmi, and informed her about the seizure. Lakshmi told them she had no idea about the liquor stock inside her car. After the news went viral on social media, Lakshmi issued a statement, saying she had asked her driver to fill the fuel tank and park it in a neighbouring apartment’s parking space rented by her. The police are questioning the driver, Suri Babu, besides her husband. The liquor, cops said, was procured from Telangana and smuggled into the state. “We have arrested the driver and are investigating the role of the car’s owner as well,” Chandrasekhar told TOI. A case under relevant sections of AP Excise (Amendment) Act 2020 has been registered. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/280-liquor-bottles-found-in-temple-board-members-car/articleshow/78415570.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Sec 144 in Jaipur halts pace of recovery in tourism industry||JAIPUR: The extended weekend starting October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, should have further buoyed the tourism industry in Rajasthan, but the rising Covid-19 cases and imposition of Section 144 in Jaipur city is not helping its cause. Representatives of hospitality industry in Jaipur region said that in the past couple of months, the weekend visitors from Delhi and Gurgaon had rolled the wheels of the business after lockdown was lifted. In fact, they had become a much-sought after segment in the early stages of recovery and the hoteliers were banking on them for the weekend demand. But the momentum slackened weekend. “Growth in the early phase of recovery has lost the momentum now. The imposition of Section 144 has sent out a wrong perception of the Covid situation. People are thinking the pandemic is worsening in Rajasthan even though we are reporting very less number of cases compared to many states in India. Negative news spreads fast and now this has impacted the business,” said Pankaj Saboo, a promoter of a leading resort. Similar sentiments were echoed by other hoteliers and senior executives in the industry. They are looking to bumper weekends which will eventually spill over to weekdays. “For weekday demand to rise, we need the onset of corporate travel which is not happening now. Corporate travel and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) will be key to driving the weekday demand. I think we are still two-three months away to reach that situation,” said Rajiv Kapoor, general manager of a leading hotel in Kukas. But some hoteliers said that isolated destinations like Mount Abu and Kumbhalgarh are going full on weekends and Udaipur is also attracting a lot of traffic from Gujarat. Randhir Vikram Singh, co-chairman of FICCI, said, “It’s mixed. Isolated locations are getting demand. But in cities the problem persists. The fear of travel is there as cases are not coming down to boost the sentiment of people.” However, Saboo said that since many hotels are not getting customers, they should be allowed for recovery of Covid patients. “After treatment, patients stay in hospitals a few days for recovery. Hotels should be used for such purposes. Hotels are cheaper compared to charges hospitals ask. Secondly, once the duration of stay gets reduced, there will be more beds available,” added Saboo. With rising cases, there is a shortage of beds and Saboo said if hotels are allowed, they can certainly ease the pressure on hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sec-144-in-city-halts-pace-of-recovery-in-tourism-industry/articleshow/78415546.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
October 1, 2020||India||Sero prevalence in city dips to 25% in Survey-3||NEW DELHI: The third sero survey in Delhi has revealed an overall reduction in the prevalence of antibodies from 28.7% to 25.1%, the AAP government told the Delhi high court on Wednesday. The report shows a decline of seroprevalence in Northeast and Central districts but an increase in West, South, Northwest and East. In the first sero survey, seroprevalence of 22.83% had been observed. The report says that seroprevalence was found to be more in females than males during the three rounds and the least in the age-group of 18 to 49 years as compared below 18 and above 50. The report stresses that there is a need to enhance focus on sample representativeness of the survey in Central, Northeast and North districts. Interestingly, it was observed that seroprevalence was lower in the participants who had lived in containment zones while in the sero-surveys conducted in July and August, it had been found that those living in containment zones were significantly associated with being sero-positive. Over 17,000 samples were collected from 272 wards in the first week of September for the third sero-survey and the sample size of each ward was allocated in proportion to the population of that ward. Within each ward, settlements were selected through simple random sampling to ensure that the survey would be much more representative of antibody prevalence. Highest seroprevalence — 26.7% — was found in the below-18 population. In the 18-49 age-group, only 24.2% seroprevalence was observed while in the above-50 age-group, it was 26.3%. So far three sero-surveys have been conducted in the city. The overall seroprevalence had significantly increased during the survey conducted in August. The latest survey found an increase in seroprevalence in those belonging to the lower socio-economic strata and living in unplanned colonies. Significantly, the report mentioned that nearly one-third of the participants with a past history of Covid-19 did not have detectable IgG antibodies. It has been recommended in the report that considering the primary objective of serosurvey studies, there is a need to space out the serosurvey rounds with an eye on resource constraints and system feasibility. “Any future round of sero-survey should have an enhanced focus on ensuring representativeness of the sample in terms of settlement type and socioeconomic status,” said the report. Taking note of the report, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked the AAP government why the sero-survey results were shared with the media before being placed in front of the bench. It noted that even at an earlier hearing, the Delhi government had said the survey results were not ready but the very next day preliminary findings were available with the media. In response, the government claimed that news reports about preliminary results of the third sero-survey were “fake” and its officials have not disclosed any information to the media about it. The bench, however, wasn’t convinced and chided the government for such a stand. “Don’t show the press as unreliable. Don’t play games with the court like this,” it said, rejecting the government claim. Delhi government’s additional standing counsel, Satyakam, submitted that according to news reports, the preliminary finding of the survey was 33% seroprevalence while in reality it was 25.1% in the final report. The HC then pointed out that no denial was issued by the administration though it was now claiming that the news was fake. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain then assured the court that the state government would issue the necessary clarification in this regard. During the hearing, the high court once again flagged its concern over low testing by the more accurate RT-PCR method in the capital, observing that “much emphasis has constantly been laid by this court on ramping up of tests through RT-PCR in Delhi but it has not activated the respondent/Delhi government adequately.” The court noted that against a daily capacity of 15,000 RT-PCR tests available in Delhi, the actual number of tests being conducted through this mode was still floating around 11,000 on an average. “In other words, though Delhi has the capacity for conducting 15,000 tests per day through the RT-PCR mode, 4,000 RT-PCR tests per day are not being utilized, which does not make any sense when cases of Covid-19 infection during the period between September 14 and September 27 remain in the range of 3500-4000 cases per day with only one exception on September 20 when the positive cases were 2548,” it underlined. Data reveals that the number of Rapid Antigen Tests was the highest on September 14 at 52271 and lowest on September 20 at 24907 with the average being 45212. “As against the above, (figures for) testing through RT-PCR and other similar modes in the same period reveal that a maximum of 11799 tests were conducted on September 24 with a minimum of 7672 tests conducted on September 27. The average testing in the above said period comes to 10280,” the bench pointed out, saying it will wait for the final decision of the expert committee involved in reviewing the capital’s overall testing strategy. The HC is hearing a PIL seeking an increase in the Covid-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sero-prevalence-in-city-dips-to-25-in-survey-3/articleshow/78417576.cms||Abhinav Garg
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Govt puts price cap on chest CT scan for Covid diagnosis||JAIPUR: The health department has put a price cap on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), which is now commonly being used for assessing the health of lungs in Covid patients. Doctors are commonly finding ground glass opacity in lungs of such patients through HRCT. Doctors claimed if they find ground-glass opacity with peripheral distribution with predominant involvement of lower lobe through HRCT, it means the patient is Covid positive. It does not matter, if he has tested negative twice or thrice through other tests. Principal secretary (health) Akhil Arora issued a notification on Wednesday of putting a price cap on HRCT. According to the notification, non-NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) labs cannot take more than Rs 1,700 for HRCT, while the NABH labs will be allowed to charge Rs 1,955 for the same test (HRCT). Arora said violators will be dealt as per law under Section 5 of Rajasthan Epidemic Act, 2020. The doctors are also recommending recovered Covid patients to get HRCT done to assess how much damage the virus has done to their lungs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-puts-price-cap-on-chest-ct-scan-for-covid-diagnosis/articleshow/78415581.cms||---

Around 5,000 citizens will be tested during the survey for the presence of antibodies Principal investigator Atul Desale from D Y Patil Hospital said there were a few mismatches in the finalised cluster pockets that would be surveyed. “We have synchronised the areas with the municipal corporation map and teams for the respective areas have been formed accordingly. The work was delayed because we had to finish matching of the areas with the civic map,” he said. “The manpower training will be done on October 1 and most likely we will start the survey from October 2,” he said, adding that the sero survey would begin with 10 teams surveying the slums and elite areas across eight zones in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. The PCMC will spend Rs44 lakh on the survey. Desale added that the survey would cover citizens from all strata, be it corporate employees, housing society residents and people from the slum areas.

The forest department has decided to relocate it to Amangarh Tiger Reserve as it is an adult and can easily survive in the wild. Forest officials had earlier installed camera traps and placed a cage with a goat tied inside it as bait, near the spot where the leopard had killed the girl. The partially eaten decapitated body of 11-year-old Upasna was recovered on Tuesday morning, spreading panic in her village Bujhia, and other villages nearby. On hearing that the leopard had been trapped, hundreds of villagers gathered at the spot, but with extra police force deployed in the village, the operation was carried out peacefully. Divisional forest officer (DFO) Bharat Lal told TOI, “We had identified the spot where the leopard was frequenting, and placed camera traps and a cage there. The big cat returned to feed on its prey and was lured by the goat kept in the cage. We had deployed police force in the area to ensure villagers don’t attack the leopard. Fortunately, the operation was successfully completed without hiccups.” He added, “The leopard is a male and may have strayed from Uttarakhand forests. It’s quite healthy and can easily survive in the wild, so we’ll release it into forests of Amangarh, which is its natural habitat. The department has granted permission for the movement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/leopard-trapped-in-bareilly-shifted-to-amangarh-had-killed-11-year-old-girl/articleshow/78410645.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
October 1, 2020||Kochi||T'puram scandal: 'Willing to turn approver'||KOCHI: In an unexpected twist to the controversial Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling scandal, prime accused Sandeep Nair told the NIA court, here, on Wednesday he was willing to turn approver and requested it to record his confession under Section 164 of CrPC. Sandeep, in a petition filed with the court, said he was willing to reveal the entire facts voluntarily and that he was well aware that his statement would be treated as evidence against him as well. “I am arraigned as the accused No.4 in the NIA case under sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The allegation against me is that I along with other accused smuggled 30 kg of gold worth Rs 14.82 crore in diplomatic baggage to UAE consulate. I am willing to reveal the entire facts voluntarily under the provision of Section 164 CrPC and I am very well aware of the fact that the statement I am giving will be treated as evidence also against me,” the petition said. In a development that could have major ramifications for the case, the admission of guilt can open up the possibility of the accused divulging more details about the racket. The court however reminded Sandeep that there was no guarantee that the confession would lead to a pardon or him being made approver. The investigative agency did not object to the petition and told the court that it will approach the chief judicial magistrate’s court (CJM) to record his confession under 164 CrPC. Sandeep appeared before special judge P Krishna Kumar via video conference. Sandeep, who is lodged in Viyyur Central prison, was also told that notwithstanding the confession he may be found guilty in the case. Sandeep responded that he was fully aware of the same and was still ready to make a confession. The agency had arrested Sandeep from Bengaluru along with Swapna Suresh, another key accused. Sandeep and Ramees K T were at the centre of the racket and had connections with almost every link in the network. Sandeep is also an accused in cases registered by the Enforcement Directorate as well as the initial case registered by the commissionerate of customs (preventive).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/willing-to-turn-approver-key-accused/articleshow/78414145.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The facility will also have a swab collection centre so that persons with Covid-19 symptoms need not travel to Mahalunge village near Chakan for Covid-19 test, he said. Alandi rural hospital head Dr Ganpat Jadhav, said, “The work on setting up an oxygen pipeline at the hospital has been completed and the DCHC facility will become operational in a day or two.” As of now, Alandi has three private hospitals, which have been designated as DCHC, where critically ill patients are being referred to, while asymptomatic patients are being sent to Mahalunge-based Covid care centre. Ankush Jadhav, chief officer, Alandi Municipal Council, said, “We decided to have a DCHC with oxygen beds as the same is not available in adequate numbers as of now. We require at least 12-15 oxygen beds daily.” Alandi municipal council president Vaijayanta Umargekar said, “Considering the population of the town and rising number of cases across the district, many patients were finding it difficult to get oxygen beds. Hence, the DCHC was needed on an urgent basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/alandi-rural-hosp-to-turn-into-ncov-centre/articleshow/78415621.cms||Sandip Dighe
October 1, 2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan health dept assesses infra for future Covid vaccine rollout||JAIPUR: The entire world is awaiting vaccine against Covid-19 and Rajasthan is no exception. Before the launch of vaccine, the health department has started preparation for developing infrastructure along with assessing the storage capacity and transportation for the jab. While a broad range of vaccines are being investigated globally using various technologies and platforms, the health department has started preparation for storage, transportation to rural areas and to ensure its availability to each and every part of the state. The health department is assessing how much storage capacity they have in their existing warehouses as it is expected that the requirement of vaccines would be much higher in comparison to the vaccines required under national vaccine programmes for children and pregnant women. Covid-19 vaccine will not only be administered to children only, but it will cover all people of all ages and all walks of life. “We have received directions from the Centre to start assessing the storage capacity and also to ensure that the vaccines should be made available up to the primary health centres in rural areas,” said a senior health department official. However, the officials are yet to get more information about the size of the vial of the vaccine and all micro details of the vaccine, even they are yet to receive information whether the vaccine will be injectable or given orally. “In near future, whenever the vaccine against Covid-19 will be launched, we should get our network prepared for it, so that without any delay the vaccine will be made available to the people across the state, even in villages,” said the official. Moreover, for ensuring that the potency of vaccines will not be affected, the health department will make use of its existing ‘cold chain’ or a new cold chain will be rolled out for Covid-19 vaccine. Though ‘cold chain’, the health department will store and transport vaccines at recommended temperatures from one point to the other point, where it will be administered to people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-assesses-infra-for-future-vaccine-rollout/articleshow/78415591.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
October 1, 2020||Pune||PCMC mayor seeks more machines to collect plasma||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Usha Dhore, mayor, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, has asked civic chief Shravan Hardikar to procure additional machines for plasma collection at the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH). In a letter to Hardikar, Dhore raised concerns over the inconvenience caused to plasma donors due to availability of a single machine for twin towns. Notably, the YCMH leads the Pune division in plasma collection. Dhore said, “Plasma therapy has been used on many patients and has proved effective. However, due to unavailability of more machines, donors spend a lot of time waiting for their turn, which deter them from donating plasma. If we have additional machines, this problem can be addressed.” She added that she had written a letter to the commissioner so that timely action could be taken. The mayor also promised to follow up on the issue until the machines were procured. She added that the current manpower at the YCMH lab, too, needed to be enhanced to increase plasma collection. Till September 20, the YCMH lab had received plasma donation from 434 donors, from whom 930 units of blood plasma were collected. The demand for plasma could be ascertained from the fact that out of 930 units, 915 have already been used on critical patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-mayor-seeks-more-machines-to-collect-plasma/articleshow/78415642.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Pune||No ICU dialysis beds at Pimpri jumbo unit||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has decided to not set up 16 proposed dialysis beds at the Pimpri jumbo unit. Officials said that dialysis facility will be offered to Covid-19 patients at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital. PCMC’s additional commissioner Santosh Patil said the civic body does not feel the need to set up the dialysis facility at the jumbo unit, when there is one already available. He added that YCM hospital has 10 dialysis-supported beds. PCMC has also set up four ICU dialysis-supported beds at the new Autocluster facility. At the time of inauguration, the jumbo unit at Annasaheb Magar stadium was expected to be a 816-bed facility with 600 oxygen-supported beds, 200 ICU beds and 16 beds with dialysis facility. Patil added, “Every day, YCM hospital can cater to at least 10 patients in need of dialysis. So far, the situation is under control and the hospital can handle it. We will think about setting up the facility at the Pimpri jumbo unit, if there is a surge in the number of such patients.” Rajendra Wable, dean at YCM hospital, said that before it was turned into a dedicated Covid hospital, the number of regular patients needing dialysis would be around 400, per month, on an average. Even now the number of Covid-19 patients requiring dialysis is around 3-5 per day. Having an alternative unit for the dialysis facility will always come in handy in case of a surge in the number of patients. Health activist Abhijit More said, “Rather than putting the burden on YCM hospital, the administration should set up an alternate facility, which can prove helpful in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-icu-dialysis-beds-at-pimpri-jumbo-unit/articleshow/78415663.cms||Piyush Bhusari
October 1, 2020||Pune||Telemedicine expenses under insurance cover from today||PUNE: Telemedicine costs will be covered under medical insurance in accordance with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s (IRDAI) new guidelines with effect from Thursday. “This is very relevant during the time of Covid-19, when physical visits by the doctors to check patients have become difficult,” National Insurance Academy director G Srinivasan said. Telemedicine includes off-site medical consultations through telephone and video calls, online chats. Health experts were unanimous that inclusion of these aspects as part of the insurance coverage would make health plans “more inclusive”. “There is a possibility that the insurers may relook at the premium rates for individual and family floater policies. In case of group policies, the premium rates could be looked at the time of renewal based on the experience of claims,” Srinivasan said. National Insurance Academy chair professor Segar Sampathkumar said most changes made by the regulator were “a welcome move”. He said, “The added facility can apply to those policies providing outpatient treatment, wherever consultation with the medical practitioner is allowed in the terms and conditions of the policy contract as an overwhelming majority of health insurance products relate to hospitalization”. Retired general manager of New India Assurance Ashwathnarayana said, “It’s a well-known fact that individuals insured don’t have any bargaining power, unlike those with the group schemes. Telemedicine is a significant addition to the coverage under the policy, as it assumes importance in covid treatment and helps the insured for physical distancing during the pandemic .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/telemedicine-expenses-under-insurance-cover-from-today/articleshow/78415677.cms||Nisha Nambiar
October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: A peek into an agrarian Harappan village||AHMEDABAD: It was no less exciting than a ‘whodunit’ for a group of researchers who set out to find the ‘dairy residues’ at Kotda Bhadli, a Mature Harappan site in Kutch, which was occupied from 2300 to 1950 BCE (4,320 and 3,970 years before present). The clues were in form of pot shards and the methods were not very elementary – history met new-age science as the ceramics revealed the ancient secrets once subjected to acidified methanolic extraction.  The team – consisting of Kalyan Sekhar Chakraborty and Heather M L Miller from University of Toronto, Greg F Slater from University of Hamilton – both universities in Canada – along with Prabodh Shirvalkar from Pune-based DCPRI and Yadubir Singh Rawat, senior archaeologist – analyzed the remains of a small settlement that were found from excavations between 2010 and 2013. Findings of the analysis were published in ‘Scientific Reports,’ a publication of journal Nature. The team members said that Kutch is dotted with Harappan sites ranging from Dholavira to Kanmer and Khirsara to Desalpur, displaying different hues of the ancient civilization. “Kotda Bhadli gave a peek into an agrarian village 4,000 years ago,” said Chakraborty, a post-doctoral fellow at University of Toronto. “What excited us was to understand the functioning of a society. A site is not just about physical artefacts – it can also reveal a lot with new methods. For example, we can assume that the settlement was consuming milk regularly – its residues found from cooking vessels, bowls and so on. Sheep and goat were used for meat.” The researchers don’t rule out possibility of use of cattle/ buffalo, but it was limited. An interesting find from the analysis of the bone morphology and chemical analysis showed that the milch animals such as cattle and water buffalo had C4 diet – such as millet – indicating that it was proper rearing of animals for milk and farm work, as they were provided selective diet. “The research also opens doors for understanding the agrarian economy and dawn of animal and farm-centric village life where occupants were engaged in taking care of the animals, extracting animal produce such as milk, meat, fur and hide and using it as commodity for trade/ barter with major urban centres of that era,” said Dr Rawat, adding that the animals could also be used as commodities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-peek-into-an-agrarian-harappan-village/articleshow/78415692.cms||Parth Shastri
October 1, 2020||Mysuru||Mysuru City Corporation to set up plant to recycle construction waste||MYSURU: The city corporation has entered into an agreement with Susthira, a non- government organisation to recycle construction waste generated in the city. Sources in the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) told TOI that the city generates 100 -150 tonnes of construction waste every day. The civic body has been receiving complaints from public, elected representatives and green activists to regulate such activities, the source added. As the city is witnessing a spike in construction activities due to rapid urbanisation, growth, educational and employment opportunities, setting up such a plant is the need of the hour to deal with such wastes. Despite the civic body penalising violators for dumping construction waste on roads, parks and public places, people have been found dumping waste in the night to avoid public attention. Amid jurisdiction issues with the Mysuru Urban Development Authority and MCC properties, the corporation also faces tough challenges to end such activities. Speaking to TOI, MCC commissioner Dr Gurudatta Hegde said Susthira came forward to establish such a plant on public private partnership (PPP) basis. As per the agreement, the agency will build, own and operate the plant to certain period of time. MCC has reserved five acres of land near Koppaluru village on H D Kote Road to set up a plant. The plant will be given approval after discussing the issue at the council meeting. “If all goes as per plan, the company will begin its operations soon,” Hegde said. This NGO has put forward the proposal of converting the construction and demolition waste into ready-mix concrete, cement bricks, hollow bricks, pavement blocks, kerb stones and concrete bricks. The unit will not only help clear the garbage, but help scientifically recycle construction and demolition waste while providing materials at cheaper rates to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-city-corporation-to-set-up-plant-to-recycle-construction-waste/articleshow/78415117.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Hubballi||Hubballi: HDBRTS ridership is rising slowly and steadily||HUBBALLI: North India’s first Rapid Transit System, Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HDBRTS), is witnessing good ridership in Unlock4.0 phase. Daily ridership has increased to 30,000 from 5,000. After the ministry of home affairs ordered resumption of HDBRTS in June, the ridership was just around 5,000-10,000 per day, when only 20 buses were put under operation. As ridership increased, so did the number of buses. Now, 72 vehicles are plying between the twin cities. Vivekanand Vishwajnya, divisional controller, Hubballi-Dharwad city division of NWKRTC, told TOI that the figures are encouraging with ridership increasing each passing day. “The revenue is touching Rs 5 lakh everyday. It will only improve in the days to come, especially when schools and colleges reopen,” he said. In pre-Covid days, the daily ridership and revenue stood at 90,000 and Rs 10 lakh, respectively. The air-conditioned Volvo buses are being operated at temperature above 27 degrees Celsius. HDBRTS has introduced monthly concessional passes and e-purses for touch-free and seamless entry of the passengers into buses, said Vivekanand. Rajesh Singh, a software company employee who travels between Hubballi and Dharwad, said he was using his car to commute to office during the lockdown. “But it’s not at all cost effective. I used to commute in HDBRTS buses before the pandemic, and also now as bus travel is safe. There is less rush compared to other normal services,” he said. Many employees still working from home is said to be the reason for ridership not increasing to the expected levels. In the coming days software companies and other offices are likely to stop work from home, many commuters said, adding the ridership will increase thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdbrts-ridership-is-rising-slowly-and-steadily/articleshow/78415770.cms||Kishan Singh Bhorde
October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Seven years later, cops confirm Swaminarayan monk’s death||AHMEDABAD: Seven years after a monk of the Swaminarayan sect went missing and after multiple litigations by his father in the Gujarat high court, Gandhinagar police has confirmed that he died as soon as he had left the sect in 2013. Following a habeas corpus petition filed by Bhailal Patel over his missing son, police dug out its records to find an unclaimed body that was fished out of the Narmada canal near Adalaj. The deceased’s parents identified him as their son Dushyant, who had assumed the name Nilkanth Priyadas Swami when he embraced the Swaminarayan sect in 2004 at the age of 17. As police had not carried out HC instructions earlier on three petitions filed by Patel, the bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice N V Anjaria ordered Gandhinagar police to get a letter written by Dushyant analysed by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) and come up with report on October 29. The court also called for other reports on the unclaimed body, if there are any, particularly of DNA testing, to ascertain the primary cause of death. This happened after the police cited the postmortem report of the unclaimed dead body which showed that the cause of death was drowning and there was no ante-mortem injury. Dushyant’s parents had been demanding a probe into his mysterious disappearance a few hours after he decided to quit the sect following a spat with other monks. They also accused the other monks of murder, but police did not investigate the claims. In 2017, that they were informed by the monks that Dushyant may have committed suicide by jumping into the Narmada canal. Patel’s advocate Amit Chaudhary said Dushyant had called his parents and told them that he had decided to quit the sect and return to the family. While they were returning home on July 22, 2013, Dushyant received a call asking him to return his saffron clothes as he was leaving the sect. His whereabouts were not known after he left to return his clothes. After knowing that the unclaimed body was Dushyant’s, the HC questioned the efforts put in by the police on various HC orders. The judges even questioned why police had not investigated when they found the dead body from the canal in 2013. The family now demands a full investigation into the possible involvement of the other monks in Dushyant’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/7-years-later-cops-confirm-swaminarayan-monks-death/articleshow/78415712.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Bhopal||‘In last 6 months, nobody thought of freelance artistes’||BHOPAL: Carrying forward the legacy of her father, late Kumar Gandharva, a doyen of Hindustani gayiki, Kalapini Komkali has mastered the ragas and sagun-nirgun bhavas of bhajans written by erstwhile saints. Buy she is not ready to sugarcoat her words when it comes to issues close to her heart and calls a spade, a spade. Performing live for the first time after Lockdown at the inaugural day of ‘Gamak Festival’ that commenced in the state capital on Tuesday at Tribal Museum, with Covid-norms in place, Kalapini confessed, “It’s an overwhelming experience to perform on stage after a long gap; I have goosebumps. I did some online concerts during lockdown, but it just doesn’t measure up to this vibrant experience.” Getting emotional before going on stage, the vocalist said, “Covid-19 pandemic has wrecked havoc across the globe. But it is the freelance artistes - singers, writers, artisans, musicians, performers - who have suffered the most. The saddest part is that in the last six months, nobody thought of freelance artistes.” She said, it doesn’t bother her that right now only 100 people are allowed at the live performances and went on to add, “After no audience, it is still a positive move forward. I really missed the zest and energy that a live stage provides to an artiste. It’s not just our livelihood; it is also our passion and tapasya of a lifetime that has been at stake.” On stage, Kalapini was in a trance as she began the evening with ‘Shyam Kalyan’, a melodious evening raga. And the audience listened in rapt attention, as if in awe, while her powerful voice resonated in the aura. “I have heard Kalapini live thrice; her voice gets better with time. After being parched for months, it was really a treat for the soul to hear such a wonderful classical exponent,” said Nimish Sahu, who attended the concert. Homemaker Divya Sharma said, “I loved the bhajan and depiction of virah in her rendition, which touched my soul.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-last-6-mths-nobody-thought-of-freelance-artistes/articleshow/78415711.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
October 1, 2020||Mysuru||Panel asks Mangaluru DC to probe child trafficking case||MYSURU: Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) has written to the deputy commissioner of Mangaluru, asking to probe an alleged case of child trafficking, said KSCPCR member M L Parashuram. “It appears it is a clear case of child trafficking for the purpose of forced labour, but lackadaisical approach on the part of the authorities has led to undue delay, which could help the wrongdoers escape,” the member stated. Parashuram said the commission, after an inquiry, has passed an order asking to verify why the authorities have failed to protect the minor girl from the situation. The teenager had escaped from captivity in mid-August, but authorities allegedly failed to assess and understand the gravity of the situation and left the girl back where she escaped from, claiming that she was not a minor. At that time, the Childline representative too didn’t have any documents to prove her age. Later, the commission got a tip-off through Odanadi Seva Samsthe, but somehow businessmen managed to send the girl back to Mysuru. Odanadi director Stanley told TOI that there is undue delay in this case. The girl is basically from Mandya but was allegedly trafficked to Mangaluru via Mysuru. “She had stayed at her relatives’ house in HD Kote from where they took her to the businessman’s house. Sometime back a similar incident had been reported from HD Kote, but all those girls were rescued from ‘bonded labour,’ but repetition of the case has raised doubts about an organised trafficking network which needs to be investigated,” he said. According to Stanley, the girl is about 17, and her school records have been verified. Wrongdoers must be booked under provisions of laws governing children rights and protection, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/panel-asks-mluru-dc-to-probe-child-trafficking-case/articleshow/78412756.cms||Lawrence Milton
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||Restobars and nightclubs ready to begin live music, but clearance yet to be issued||Kolkata: Restobars and nightclubs that had been waiting to resume live music and throw open their dance floors, following chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s tweet announcing resumption of entertainment programmes from October 1, kept their arrangements ready and fingers crossed on Wednesday even as no official approval reached them till late evening. Most kept their musicians ready, dance floors spruced up and arranged to adhere to social distancing norms to begin at a day’s notice.Moreover, there was no directive on resumption of live performance in the MHA Unlock 5 order issued on Wednesday.“We shall resume our live music sessions as soon as we receive approval. Unfortunately, it’s yet to come through. If we get a clearance early on Thursday, we may resume crooning in the evening,” said Anand Puri of Trincas on Park Street. He added that music, which has been a hallmark of Trincas since the 1950s, will help push up footfall that has been low since the onset of pandemic.What’s Up Café on Southern Avenue has lined up its musicians hoping for a clearance, but has chosen to discontinue band performances. “We shall have solo and duet performances on stage to prevent crowding. Sitting capacity will be reduced in the performance area as well. We hope the clearance is issued soon,” said owner Anirban Sengupta. Trincas, too, has decided to reduce the number of band members.Barring Someplace Else at The Park — that resumed live music in a restricted way last week — city nightclubs are yet to receive an official intimation allowing live performances. “Without the approval, the old rules will prevail. This means dance floors will remain shut and our patrons must leave by 10.30pm. While we kept our DJs ready and had been looking forward to a resumption this week, there has been no clarity so far,” said Sudhir Ahuja, owner of Sector V nightclub Bakstage.Refinery 091, another Sector V nightclub, too, was disappointed. “We are still not sure about opening the dance floor. Live music would have begun on Friday had the permission come,” said Samim Sk, head of operations.Live music is key to the survival of at least half of Kolkata’s restobars, according to Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India president Sudesh Poddar. “They can’t run without music and sooner the clearance comes the better,” said Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restobars-and-nightclubs-ready-to-begin-live-music-but-clearance-yet-to-be-issued/articleshow/78415736.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

October 1, 2020||Ahmedabad||Wedding bookings cushion occupancy||AHMEDABAD/ VADODARA/ SURAT/ RAJKOT: Being among the most adversely affected sectors due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s finally some silver lining for the hospitality sector — weddings! As couples firm on tying the knot in 2020 are opting for weddings even with a limited guest list, the demand for bookings at city hotels has significantly improved, providing the much-needed cushion to the industry to help sustain revenues. With more inquiries pouring in by the day, many hotels are also looking at a few sold out days in November-January period.  Industry estimates suggest that hotel occupancies in Ahmedabad stood at an average of 20%, soon after hotels resumed operations after the lockdown. However, wedding bookings for post-Diwali period have kept hotels’ cash registers ringing. “Our hotel is looking at a good occupancy level after Diwali as there are significantly good bookings and inquiries for wedding occasions. The ones that are on the verge of getting finalized are by guests who are awaiting a revision in guidelines if any change gets announced for allowing more guests. Since the lockdown, hotel occupancy has taken a major hit with travel getting hampered amid the pandemic across the city. Therefore, the wedding season will certainly be the needed respite for the industry and to start looking at better months ahead,” said Sonika Chaturvedi, general manager, Courtyard by Marriott. Hoteliers claim that the sentiment has improved with an increase in the cap on the number of guests. “The outlook is positive after the government’s notification allowed 100 people for wedding occasions. We have good inquiries and bookings from November to January. This definitely helps in improving occupancy levels at the hotel and keeping revenue inflows intact,” said Vivek Sharma, general manager, Renaissance Ahmedabad Hotel. Sanat Relia, vice-president, Southern Gujarat Hotel and Restaurant Association (SHARA) said, “After lockdown, this is first time that the hospitality sector has started receiving bookings for the marriage ceremonies post-Diwali festival. Out of the total 3,500 rooms in the three and five-star hotel categories in Surat, about 45% rooms have already been booked for the marriage ceremonies.” Industry players claim that hotels are in fact preferred over party plots, given the hygiene and safety practices followed in hotels. “People do not want to let go of the auspicious dates. When clients see our preparedness for handling a wedding with social distancing norms, the way food stations are handled and highest level of safety and hygiene protocols are followed, it makes them confident of hosting weddings at the hotel. We are thus looking at the positive trend in the wedding market,” said Puneet Baijal, general manager, Hyatt Regency – Ahmedabad. In fact, those who had planned destination weddings are now limiting their events to the city but making it a grand affair, despite the limited guests. “Hotels in Udaipur and Goa are either getting full or costlier. Moreover, people are also apprehensive of travelling and therefore, many who had planned a destination wedding are now preferring hotels within the city and seek to make the occasion a grand affair,” said Jay Sudhakaran, general manager, Novotel Ahmedabad. –With inputs from Tushar Tere/ Vadodara; Melvyn Thomas/ Surat & Nimesh Khakhariya/ Rajkot||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wedding-bookings-cushion-occupancy/articleshow/78415741.cms||Niyati Parikh
October 1, 2020||Dehradun||Impact: After TOI report on tourists facing difficulties in Corbett bookings, online service resumes||Dehradun: After remaining dysfunctional for four days, the online facility to book night stay in the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) resumed on Wednesday morning. The development came within 24 hours of TOI highlighting that wildlife lovers were facing difficulty in getting bookings done at CTR since walk-in bookings were not being allowed due to the Covid-19 threat and online bookings were also not happening because of technical issues with the portal. Till the time of filing this report, more than 75 people had already booked night stay at CTR after the portal started accepting bookings at 10 am on Wednesday. “After the TOI report, the service provider swung into action and got the technical glitch fixed. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) as well as the Corbett administration were constantly working to get the facility fixed on priority from the service provider,” said RK Tiwari, park warden at CTR. Interestingly, the most sought-after range for night stay at CTR — Dhikala — which will be opening in November, received the highest number of bookings on the day. “Out of the 79 night stay bookings, the maximum were for Dhikala,” added Tiwari. Meanwhile on Thursday (October 1), chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat will inaugurate Corbett’s first ‘Interpretation Centre’ at Ramnagar. The inauguration is part of the Wildlife Week that the state is set to observe from October 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/impact-after-toi-report-on-tourists-facing-difficulties-in-corbett-bookings-online-service-resumes/articleshow/78411612.cms||Shivani Azad

October 1, 2020||Mysuru||Mysuru faces flak over conducting fewer Covid tests||MYSURU: In the handling of the country’s first ‘Cluster Case’ of Covid-19 infection, in tracing contacts of infected patients and in containing the spread of the novel coronavirus, Mysuru proved itself more than capable, even shrugging off the tag of a ‘hotspot’ district. The efforts of the district administration in checking the spread of the pandemic earned praise from the central government, no less. However, the district’s Covid-19 graph has been rising only upwards in the past two months. The district administration has been receiving brickbats for its abysmal record in testing, which is the poorest in Karnataka. Between September 22 and 28, the positivity rate of Mysuru – number of people being tested for Covid-19 who test positive for the infection – was second only to Bengaluru Rural. However, only around 241 people per every million people in the district are being tested per day in the district, which is hampering the fight against the infection. That the number of active cases in Mysuru, as on Tuesday, stands at 6,752, behind only Bengaluru Urban (46,610), puts the district’s record in perspective. Interestingly, the memory of Nanjangud taluk health officer Dr SR Nagendra’s suicide in August, allegedly owing to pressure to meet the target of Covid-19 tests, remains disturbingly fresh in the minds of the district administration. Senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil, who is heading Karnataka’s Covid-19 war room, was blunt in his assessment of Mysuru’s performance. “Mysuru has to improve drastically in managing the crisis. The district is faring worse than all others in terms of the number of tests being conducted. The delay in meeting the target is the reason why the fatality rate is high,” Moudgil said. Data from the war room indicates Shivamogga is the other district in South Karnataka that is faring poorly in the management of the crisis. The district’s fatality rate stood at 3.1% between September 21 and September 27, the highest in the state. Furthermore, the Malnad district has the largest quantum of symptomatic cases. Shivamogga has recorded 283 Covid-19 fatalities, while the overall tally of infections is close to 15,600.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-faces-flak-over-conducting-fewer-covid-tests/articleshow/78412799.cms||Shrinivasa M
October 1, 2020||Dehradun||Akhada Parishad welcomes acquittal of all 32 accused in Babri mosque demolition case; says they will be ‘honoured during Haridwar Maha Kumbh 2021’||Haridwar: The CBI special court’s judgement on Wednesday acquitting all 32 accused in the Babri mosque demolition case has been welcomed by members of the seer community in Haridwar. Narendra Giri, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), the apex body representing the 13 akhadas (sects of seers) in the country, termed the acquittal “historic”, and announced that all 32 people will be honoured at the Maha Kumbh Mela at Haridwar next year. Giri, who saw the verdict as “a vindication of the Hindus’ stand on the disputed structure,” said that “justice has been done to the RSS-VHP leaders and ascetics who spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi temple movement.” “It was Lord Ram’s work they were doing and hence, they have got justice,” Giri added. Another seer, Swami Harichetananand said the verdict has been hailed by the entire seer community. “Any other judgement in the case would not have been just,” he added. Manasa Devi temple trust president Swami Ravindra Puri described the “verdict as the victory of Ram bhakts,” while Awadhoot Mandal Ashram head Mahant Bhupendra Prakash said “it has enthused and elated the seers.” Mahamandaleshwar Santoshi Ma, who had been an active participant in the temple movement, said that the “demolition was not an act of conspiracy.” “Some people in the massive crowd, overwhelmed by emotion, indulged in the act without anybody instigating them and despite the leaders repeatedly asking for restraint. It is good that by God’s grace, all the accused have been acquitted,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/akhada-parishad-welcomes-acquittal-of-all-32-accused-in-babri-mosque-demolition-case-says-they-will-be-honoured-during-haridwar-maha-kumbh-2021/articleshow/78411637.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||‘Prepare plan to snap dead cables’||Kolkata: Defunct cable and broadband wires that have been creating a mess will not be pulled down till operators come up with a plan to snap them without disrupting services. This was decided at a meeting between state urban development minister Firhad Hakim and cable operators at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) headquarters on Wednesday.The operators have been asked to prepare a blueprint to get rid of the dead wires — tangled on lampposts across the city — by Puja.Early this year, KMC had started snapping dead cable and broadband wires in several areas including Bhowanipore, Alipore, Harish Mukherjee Road, Chetla and New Alipore. Last week, too, cables were snapped at Bhowanipore, leading to disruption of services. “Since we are already working to identify and pull down dead wires, we requested the minister to stop the snapping of cables. We shall try to submit the plan by the end of this week,” said All Bengal Cable TV and Broadband Operators’ United Forum joint convener Tapash Das.“As students are attending online classes and many are working from home, disruption has to be prevented,” Das added. Cable operators also said more than half the wires strapped to lampposts across Kolkata are dead and a substantial number of them are defunct cellphone tower cables that haven’t been removed. They pointed out that while cable and multi-system operators were allowed to use lampposts for their wires, telecom companies and internet service providers were illegally using the posts to mount their cables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prepare-plan-to-snap-dead-cables/articleshow/78415738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

October 1, 2020||Mangaluru||Online child sexual abuse on rise: Dakshina Kannada CWC||MANGALURU: Dakshina Kannada district Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has expressed concern over the rising sexual abuse cases among teenagers, especially during the pandemic. Renni D’Souza, chairman, CWC told TOI, “We have been noticing a sudden rise in sexual abuse incidents after classes for children have gone online. There are many cases that are going unreported. At least three cases a week, with victims mostly aged between 13-16, are being brought to our notice. Students now have easy access to mobile phones and the internet. We have observed that many of them are not hesitant about contacting strangers, especially on social networking apps,” he said. Quoting a case, he said, “A 14-year-old girl, a victim of sexual abuse, recently got in touch with an accused by using a smartphone. When her mother had gone to recharge her mobile number at a shop, the accused noted down the number and started chatting with the victim. Through him, she got in touch with others too, and one of them has allegedly sexually abused her.” “One day when the victim’s mother had gone to another shop to get her phone serviced, the storekeeper got access to some obscene pictures exchanged by the teen, and the accused, and circulated it. When local police found that the pictures had gone viral, they summoned the phone’s owner. The girl’s mother is hesitant to file a complaint, fearing social stigma. We have had discussions with top police officials and are following the case,” D’Souza said. “The biggest challenge is that not only the public, but the law enforcement agencies are also not aware of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2019. The act defines child pornography in detail, and has also increased the punishment for whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below 16, which shall not be less than 20 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life,” he added. He urged the education department to educate parents and students about mobile phones being misused, rather than restricting themselves to only conducting online classes. District child protection officer Gertrude Veigas also agreed on the increase in sexual abuse cases among teenagers during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/online-child-sexual-abuse-on-rise-panel/articleshow/78412821.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Sept rains less but overall monsoon normal over Vidarbha||Nagpur: As the monsoon season draws to a close, Nagpur division has got normal rainfall while three districts of Amravati division are showing deficiency in the latest data shared by met department. The map of cumulative rainfall over Vidarbha during southwest monsoon this year shows that barring three districts of Amravati division – Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal— all the other districts in the region received normal rains. It was the month of August that helped Nagpur division get normal rain cumulatively, reveals data shared by officials of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur. In the month, Nagpur, Bhandara and Gadchiroli recorded excess rainfall while Gondia received large excess rains. The month also saw flooding in vast parts of Nagpur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur districts as large dams like Totladoh and Gosikhurd discharged excess water. However in September, four districts of Nagpur division were either deficient (Nagpur, Chandrapur) or large deficient (Bhandara, Gondia). In Amravati division, Akola and Amravati also received deficient rains. Washim is the only district in the region that recorded surplus rainfall this month. This September, Vidarbha received 121.1 millimetres rain against the normal of 158.8 mm. Nagpur district received 122.8mm rain, which was 27% less than normal rainfall for the month. The total number of rainy days in the district was 23 in September. Comparison of last five years’ data for the September shows the month has witnessed huge ups and downs. Last September, Nagpur had recorded 388.4mm rain which made up for a largely deficient monsoon in previous months that had threatened city’s water security. The year before that, 2018, saw just district receiving just 111.3 mm rainfall in September. Such unsteady September rains were witnessed in other districts too. For instance, Gadchiroli recorded the highest rainfall in September last year at 562.3mm while the lowest was a year earlier at just 105.3mm. Figures of monsoon withdrawal show that in last ten years, southwest rainfall in the region has extended till mid-October. In 2010, the withdrawal date was October 28 while in 2018 it was October 5. Last year, the monsoon season ended on October 15. This is part of countrywide pattern that has led Indian Meteorological Department to push back the dates of both onset as well as withdrawal of monsoon all over the country by a few days. According to met officials, the monsoon season is expected to end by second week or mid October this year. “In the coming days, scattered rainfall is expected at isolated places in the region,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sept-rains-less-but-overall-monsoon-normal-over-vidarbha/articleshow/78415781.cms||Manka Behl

The bench, asked their counsel Ratnakar Yeluri not to deny access to online classes to any student till Oct 5. The parents’ counsel also brought to the notice of the bench about the insistence of schools to clear dues to enable the students to register for annual exams.

October 1, 2020||Kozhikode||Kozhikode: Police dithering following forensic report, alleges kin||KOZHIKODE: Contradictory positions on the ‘encounter’ at a resort in Vythiri in Wayanad in which a Maoist cadre was killed have landed the police in a fix. The police had maintained that they resorted to firing in self-defence as two Maoists opened fire at them at the Upavan resort on March 6, 2019. This was the version that the police circulated till the forensic report on the firing was made public two days ago. The report submitted in the Wayanad district and sessions court said that C P Jaleel, the Maoist cadre who was killed in the firing, did not fire from the gun found near him after the encounter. There were no traces of lead in the right of Jaleel, the report said. Soon after the report became public, the police said that it was another person who was with Jaleel at the resort who fired at the police. The police claimed that they did not say Jaleel had opened fire on them. C P Rasheed, Jaleel’s brother and secretary of Janakeeya Manushyavakasa Prasthanam, said that the first information statement in the case clearly says that the police said that both had fired at them. “The statement by the leader of the police team said that the Maoists approached them firing from the guns in their possession and they saw them clearly in the electric light,” he said. The statement added that there was firing from the top of the small hill behind the resort, which lasted for about an hour. “Now the police are retracting the statement which is submitted in the court,” Rasheed said. He said police selectively leaked the portions of the magisterial inquiry report to defend themselves. “We demand the police to make the entire report public that, we believe, has portions against the police,” Rasheed said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-dithering-following-forensic-report-alleges-kin/articleshow/78414315.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 1, 2020||Mysuru||‘B Sharat’s transfer reveals BJP’s attitude towards Dalits’||MYSURU: The decision of the Karnataka government to replace B Sharat as the Mysuru deputy commissioner had revealed the attitude of the BJP towards the Dalits, said Karnataka president of the Sarva Jananga Hitharakshanaa Vedike Venugopal here on Wednesday. Citing Sharat’s impressive record in containing the spread of Covid-19 during his stint as the Kalaburagi DC, Venugopal said, “He has been working round-the-clock to check the transmission of the novel coronavirus in Mysuru district too. His sudden transfer is an indication of what the BJP thinks of Dalits.” Former deputy mayor V Shailendra alleged that the BJP government had transferred Sharat in order to deprive a Dalit the chance to lead the Mysuru Dasara celebrations. The state government has appointed Rohini Sindhuri Dasari the new DC of Mysuru. Demanding Sharat’s reinstatement, Shailendra added, “The government has to explain its reasons for transferring the DC when the district is preparing for the Naada Habba. People must be told why a Kannadiga has been removed from the post to make way for a non-Kannadiga.” The state government had insulted a DALIT IAS officer, Shailendra said. “If the government does not reinstate him, we will launch a protest in front of the Town Hall from Thursday,” the former deputy mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/sharats-transfer-reveals-bjps-attitude-towards-dalits/articleshow/78415154.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Missing youth’s body found in well||NAGPUR: The body of a 21-year-old youth Rohit Raut who went missing two days ago was found in a well in Subhash Nagar on Tuesday. Raut was a resident of Joshi Layout near Birsa Munda Sabhagruha. His body was traced when the local people noticed foul smell emanating from it. Police said Raut used to work at a roadside tea stall of his elder brother Khemraj near Subhash Nagar T-point. The tea stall was closed since lockdown was imposed in March which rendered the brothers jobless. On September 27, Raut went missing and on September 29, Khemraj filed a missing person complaint with Pratap Nagar police. “At around 2.30pm on September 29, we got a tip off about a body floating in a well without retaining wall on a private property,” said PSI V Nandgaye. “We have registered a case of accidental death and are trying to ascertain how he fell into the well,” said Nandgaye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/missing-youths-body-found-in-well/articleshow/78415786.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||‘Was mosque demolished magically?’||HYDERABAD: Commenting on the Babri Masjid demolition case verdict, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday said that September 30 will be remembered as ‘black day’ in Indian judiciary. Owaisi said that the verdict only “satisfies conscience of Hindutva ideology”, while rolling out names of BJP veterans who were accused of being involved in the demolition. “Was it some sort of magic that on December 6 the masjid was demolished? Who called for the assembling of the people over there? Who made sure that they entered over there? Was the statue placed there magically?” asked Owaisi. He said that September 30 was a very sad day. “As an Indian Muslim, I feel the same sense of shame, helplessness and humiliation which I felt in 1992,” said the Hyderabad MLA. “I am waiting to see whether the CBI will appeal against the judgement or not. If CBI does not appeal, I will appeal to the members of AIMPLB to petition against the judgement,” Owaisi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/was-mosque-demolished-magically/articleshow/78415790.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Mysuru||Bandipur foresters build check dams using dead trees||MYSURU: Foresters at Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR) have initiated a unique concept to recharge groundwater, conserve moisture and drinking water for animals in the forest area. They are using dead and fallen trees and branches to make checks dams or gully checks. The foresters have constructed more than 500 vegetative gully plugs or check dams in Ainur Marigudi, Hegiyala, Gundre, N Begur and Moleyur forest ranges under Hediyala subdivision of BTR. The idea was initiated by Hediyala sub-division assistant conservator of forests (ACF) MS Ravikumar. From the past one month, the forest staff have constructed 100 check dams in each forest range using the available dead wood and fallen branches. The logs are placed across small streams or channels in the forest area. Each check dam is constructed by placing two rows of wooden poles and logs and branches packed between the poles to form a wall. Foresters said these check dams reduce the speed of water flow, thereby preventing soil erosion, keeping the soil moist and improving ground water. These check dams are inexpensive and easy to install, they add. Ravikumar told TOI that the vegetative gully checks are constructed in forest ranges coming under Hediyala subdivision. “These check dams check soil erosion and conserve moisture. They are made up of only dead and fallen trees. They also reduce the amount of combustible material during fire season,” he said. He added that more such check dams will be constructed wherever possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/bandipur-foresters-build-check-dams-using-dead-trees/articleshow/78413198.cms||Lakshmikantha BK
October 1, 2020||Mysuru||Mysuru tourism sees greenshoots||MYSURU: Stakeholders say that although Covid-19 cases are rapidly rising in Mysuru, tourist footfall is picking up, raising hopes of all concerned after the sector, a key component of the district’s economy, crashed following the pandemic-induced lockdown. Data shows that in July, a mere 725 tourists had visited the world-famous Mysuru palace, the city’s top attraction. On most days in July, the number of visitors did not go beyond double digits. In August, the palace reported a nearly tenfold increase with 10,537 tourists visiting. September has seen a further increase. On Sunday (September 27), as many as 2,586 tourists had visited – the highest on a single day since the pandemic struck. TS Subramanya, deputy director, Mysuru Palace Board, said: “Pre-Covid-19, about 2,000 to 2,500 tourists would visit. It fell to zero following the lockdown, but now it has risen to 600-700 per day. On weekends, we get more than 2,000 tourists.” More visitors are also thronging Mysuru’s zoo. Ajit M Kulkarni, executive director of the zoo, said the number has increased from 60-70 to nearly 1,000 on weekdays while more than 2,000 visit on weekends. Revival of tourism is also propelling the local economy. BS Prashanth, president, Mysuru Travels’ Association, said tourism business has recovered by about 35%. “Demand for vehicles on Bengaluru-Mysuru route has increased and enquiries are also increasing, which is a positive sign. However, there is a long way to go.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/with-visitors-returning-mysuru-sees-greenshoots-in-tourism-sector/articleshow/78413042.cms||Shrinivasa M
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Appeal against verdict: Cong to Centre, UP govt||Hyderabad: Terming the verdict of CBI special court in Babri Masjid demolition case as highly unfortunate, former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir of Congress demanded the Centre and Uttar Pradesh state government to file an appeal against the judgement which has acquitted all the accused for lack of evidence. Shabbir Ali pointed out that the Supreme Court, in its judgement on November 9, 2019, held that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was “clear illegality and egregious violation” of the rule of law. He said it was strange that the CBI court took only photographs and videos into consideration and later described them as not credible. “The courts give judgements based on circumstantial evidence, eye witnesses and other factors. However, those factors and evidence were not taken into consideration,” he said.

October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Freed from Covid duties, cops’ detection graph on the rise||NAGPUR: City police, mostly relieved from Covid-centric duties, seemed to have got back into action by pulling off some commendable detections and have busted interstate gangs in last one-and-a-half month. For the first time, back-to-back cases of ATM thefts were detected after different teams of city police busted gangs from Bihar and Haryana in separate actions. Despite most of its units affected by Covid infection to personnel, the crime branch rounded up seven-member ‘Irani gang’ from Maharashtra-Karnataka border for their allegedly duping citizens posing as cops or a Good Samaritan. Efforts of crime branch in nabbing four assailants of Balya Binekar murder also underlines their prompt response on September 26. Senior inspector Jayesh Bhandarkar of Tehsil police station said that at the onset of the pandemic, most personnel were engaged in Covid duties like guarding containment zones, checking public on the road, helping in contact tracing and bandobast at quarantine centres and isolation wards. “This consumed most of the man hours and energies. Now, our multiple teams are back to detection and prevention duties,” he said. Sakkardara police, under senior inspector Satyavan Mane, have cracked multiple cases of ATM thefts by a Bihar-based gang after following the accused to Chhattisgarh on the basis of cell phone locations. Mane’s team has now busted a Chandrapur-based gang which targeted medical shops during the pandemic. Bhandarkar and Dileep Sagar team of Tehsil police team busted several gangs, including the one which had robbed a loco-pilot after stabbing him this month. Senior inspector Sandipan Pawar’s team of Nandanvan police station too cracked several cases of ATM thefts after nabbing Haryana-based thieves. City police have managed to detect all 69 murders that have taken place this year, including the consecutive ones in the first week of June. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said detection and prevention are ‘bread and butter’ of the police department. “I will review all the detections and try to ensure qualitative improvements in investigations too,” he said. Kumar also said he would look into why some police stations are lagging behind in detection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/freed-from-covid-duties-cops-detection-graph-on-the-rise/articleshow/78415796.cms||Soumitra Bose
October 1, 2020||Coimbatore||1.2km stretch of DB Road to be ready by October-end||Coimbatore: The southern part of the DB Road will be completed by October-end, just in time for Diwali shopping a move that will come as a big relief for thousands of residents and shopkeepers on the stretch.City corporation officials said the 1.2km stretch between the Sukrawarpet Road junction and the TV Swamy Road junction will be the city’s first-of-a-kind model road, where the focus will be on pedestrian safety and comfort, rather than vehicles.The officials are racing against time to lay granite slabs on the pavement, which gives a glimpse of how the road will look like by next year, said corporation commissioner Kumaravel Pandian.The road is designed to be a walking street with 4m wide pavements on both sides. Parking spots have been designed and carved out to prevent haphazard car parking, said a senior corporation official. “After granite is laid and street lights are installed, we will add some design elements like signages. We will also build stages where people can perform, like those abroad,” he told TOI.Though the width of the road is narrowed down to 11-12m, the corporation is confident it can handle the traffic. “The road may seem narrow in the initial days, but motorists will get used to it. As haphazard parking will be eliminated, the width will be adequate,” the official said.DB Road is the main road used by motorists to cross over from the Thadagam Road, Selvapuram and Gandhi Park to Mettupalayam Road and flyover.The road does not have to be dug up for any work as it will have ducts for utility cables, underground sewerages and storm water drains, work for which has been completed. “Earlier, sewage lines from properties were connected directly to the main line, which passed under the road. We had to open it to clear blocks and for new connection. Now, we have constructed two ridge sewer lines on both side of the road under the pavement,” said the official. “The ridge line is now connected to houses and to the main line. We have also provided 130 sewage connections. Any issues can be sorted out in the ridge pipelines itself.”Residents and shopkeepers who have been complaining about the bad condition of the road and the resulting business loss for the last nine months heaved a sigh of relief. “We hope that business will return to normal with the road complete and people getting used to living with Covid-19,” said a manager of Aroma Bakery on the stretch“It all sounds nice. If it is really that nice, maybe we can go for morning walk on the road again,” said Paresh Gupta, a resident of Sambandam Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/1-2km-stretch-of-db-road-to-be-ready-by-october-end/articleshow/78415793.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Coimbatore||Repair alternative routes before closing Mettupalayam Road||Coimbatore: Road safety activists and residents of Mettupalayam Road, which would be closed from Kavundampalayam to GN Mills for flyover work, on Wednesday said most of the roads chosen for traffic diversion for the next three to six months were extremely narrow, congested and in bad condition. They have appealed the city corporation and the National Highways department to repair and relay the roads and remove encroachments from there.As per the traffic diversion plan, all the vehicles proceeding to Thudiyalur from the city have to take left next to Saibaba Temple, hit Venkitapuram, take a right to Anaikatti Road or Thadagam Road, then another right to Edayarpalayam and reach the destination via TVS Nagar and Kanuvai.Commuters said while the route was longer by at least 8km, the same could not take more traffic load in its present condition.M Devendran, a member of the Road Safety Association, said the entire route, except the stretch on Thadagam Road, had encroachments. “Officials have to use this time to widen roads on the route, remove all encroachments and relay them. Otherwise, the route can’t take even a small percentage of the traffic load that’s usually seen on Mettupalayam Road and would get completely congested during the peak hours.”He said the stretch between Saibaba Temple and Venkitapuram and the road through TVS Nagar were too narrow and required special attention.Activists said the 750-metre stretch from Cheran Nagar Pirivu to Sanganoor Pirivu was also in a bad state. The highways department is planning to divert all light motor vehicles coming from Mettupalayam side to the city on this route, which is behind the upcoming housing board apartments.Consumer activist K Kathirmathiyon said, “This stretch is crucial for daily commuters, as it is rather shorter. But encroachments need to be removed. It has patches that need repair, if traffic has to move fast and smoothly.”Regular commuters said they were hopeful of authorities paying heed to their requests. T Ramakrishnan, a resident of Periyanaickenpalayam, said, “Closure of an arterial road is unheard of. They can at least make the condition of roads chosen for traffic diversion better during the period.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/repair-alternative-routes-before-closing-mettupalayam-road/articleshow/78415799.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Change in BC quota unlikely for GHMC elections||HYDERABAD: State government, which has reportedly decided against increasing number of wards (150) in Greater Hyderabad, is likely to continue the existing BC reservations. Sources said since BC voters’ enumeration process will take at least 40 days, the government would go ahead with the 2016 reservations in the polls. Senior officials said as per the GHMC Act, BC voters’ enumeration should be done before every general elections as it stands as the basis for reserving wards for BCs. “Since there is no provision in the GHMC Act to avoid BC voters’ enumeration, the Act needs to be amended to continue with the existing BC reservations. CM will decide on this in a couple of days,” said a enior GHMC official.  “The GHMC staff undertook a door-to-door survey for identification of voters and mark them in the electoral rolls. The survey itself took 16 days. A draft notification has to be published and displayed in ward, circle, MRO and RDO offices for filing claims by giving seven days,” a former GHMC officer, who had worked in the elections, said. Sources in the municipal administration department said since the assembly is not in session, the government should come up with an ordinance amending the GHMC Act if it wants to go ahead with the existing BC reservations. “The other option is to reduce the timeline for completing the BC voters’ enumeration within 10 to 15 days, which is highly unlikely as it may lead to legal complications,” an official of MA&UD department said. State election commissioner C Partha Sarathi said reservations is under the purview of the state government and the commission has no role in this. GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar was not available for his comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/change-in-bc-quota-unlikely-for-elections/articleshow/78415801.cms||Koride Mahesh
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Sanitation staff paid well, can’t regularise service: GHMC||HYDERABAD: GHMC has informed the high court that 28,000 workers with its sanitation and other wings were on outsourcing and temporary basis and they were getting more than minimum time scale pay. If GHMC has to comply with an order of a single judge to first implement minimum time scale pay to all of them, these workers would stand to lose because that gives them only Rs 13,000 per month, whereas the civic body was paying them, together with PF and ESI, nearly Rs 17,000 per month, the civic body informed the court. GHMC, in its appeal before the high court against the single judge order, urged a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy to nullify the second portion of the single judge order that directed it to regularise the services of the 28,000 outsource workers. “This will be a huge burden on us,” GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar said in his appeal. “For implementing this order, we have to create 28,000 sanctioned posts and fill them. This will place an additional burden of Rs 625 crore annually on the GHMC exchequer,” he said. “As of now, the percentage of salaries in the budget is 16.3 and any increase in this would make things unsustainable for us,” he said.  SC order, delivered in the Uma Devi case, cannot be implemented in respect of these sanitation workers as that would mean regularisation of all temporary workers and would be a huge burden on corporation, he said. “State is also controlled by economic considerations and financial implications of any public employment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sanitation-staff-paid-well-cant-regularise-service-ghmc/articleshow/78415833.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||No VVPATs? SEC likely to use paper ballots for GHMC polls||HYDERABAD: Polling to the 150 wards of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Coroporation (GHMC), in all likelihood, will be held with paper ballot and not EVMs. Telangana state election commissioner C Partha Sarathi told TOI that a final decision on holding polls with EVMs or paper ballots would be taken soon. Sources said non-availability of VVPAT machines was another reason for the state election commission (SEC) to consider ballot papers. It was for this reason that elections to 120 municipalities, 10 municipal corporations and over 12,000 gram panchayats were conducted with paper ballots in January this year. The last time ballot papers were used in Hyderabad was in 2002 when its nomenclature was Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) and had 100 wards. After the formation of Greater Hyderabad in 2007, polls were held with EVMs to 150 wards in 2009 and 2016. BJP is the only major party which has been pitching for EVMs during polling. Ruling TRS has already said it prefers ballot paper. AIMIM, the second largest party after TRS in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation council, has not announced its stand. State election commission officials said the AIMIM may have submitted its opinion through post which would be opened on Thursday. Congress also has not submitted its opinion. In a letter to the SEC, PCC election committee chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy said: “We are unable to give our opinion as the SEC has failed to give details or study reports on whether ballot or EVM polling is safe in view of Covid-19. On what basis is the SEC going to hold polls either on EVMs or ballot papers.” As many as 29 other registered political parties did not submit their opinions by 5pm on Wednesday, as sought by the state election commission. “It would be construed that the parties did not have a stand on ballot paper or EVM if they have failed to submit their opinions,” said an official. Hyderabad: The state election commission (SEC) does not have VVPAT machines. It has about 17,000 EVMs. Officials had approached the Electronics Corporation of India Limited seeking VVPATs but was told that it needed permission from the Election Commission of India to make new VVPATs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-vvpats-sec-likely-to-use-paper-ballots-for-ghmc-polls/articleshow/78415821.cms||Roushan Ali

Officials will use the software to endorse the licence, print it and even let the applicants know of the status of their application online. Each of the trade licences will be geo-tagged to prevent its misuse or duplication, Sridhar said. State owned Keonics Ltd, that has developed the software for MCC, will provide the mobile app for licence applicants, officials or health inspectors of the MCC, portal monitoring management system along with hardware application. The roll out of this software with a little tweaking will enable the MCC to provide people with more online payment options, including their water bills, which they did manually in banks or at Mangalore One, Sridhar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/trade-licence-software-trial-from-tomorrow/articleshow/78412853.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Chennai||Bio-med waste dumped in waterways threatens aquatic life, say researchers||Chennai: Waterways in the city, which were cleaner when a total complete lockdown was in place, are being polluted again, say researchers. With Covid-19 cases rising and more businesses opening, medical waste such as gloves, masks, hand sanitizer and all other forms of personal protective equipment (PPE) are dumped into city lakes and reservoirs. Most of this hazardous waste drains into the sea causing a huge threat to marine life. Alarm bells went off when a National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) team led by director R Ramesh found heaps of new ocean waste — polymer-based single-use safety gear used in Covid-19 prevention — in city waterways. Scientists said they could not quantify the litter and its composition in water bodies as it varied with land use, socio-economic activities and littering behaviour of people. But an analysis of samples collected from coastal areas showed nearly a quarter of it contained polypropylene — one of the most dominant polymers in the environment. The trash in the city’s water bodies can harm aquatic species and become a public health menace, said Ramesh. “Plastic in a mask disintegrates easily in water. When this water drains into the sea, more micro-plastics enter coastal ecosystems. They are ingested by fish and other organisms, affecting the food chain. This would mean humans are at risk from consuming toxic-laden plastic debris ingested by fish sold at market,” he said. PPEs, on the other hand, break down into micro-plastics less than 5mm thick. PPEs are manufactured using polymers such as polypropylene, polyurethane, polyacrylonitrile, polystyrene, polycarbonate and polyethylene (polyester) that are raw material for different plastic products, he said. The bigger concern is that TN doesn’t have a facility to safely dispose medical waste. Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board says around 47 tonnes of medical waste is generated every day. Senior NCSCM scientist R S Robin said the pandemic led to several more tonnes of waste being generated. “But, the existing facility in Chennai can only dispose up to 25% of the generated waste. This is not properly disposed and enters landfills or coastal waters via drainage systems,” he said. A World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report said incorrect disposal of even 1% of single-use masks poses a huge threat. “This means at least 10 million masks are disposed of every month. Each mask, weighing 3g-4g, can lead to dispersion of 30,000kg-40,000kg of plastic in water bodies,” he said. Policy reforms and new guidelines are required for Covid waste management (energy, recovery and disposal) and environmental safeguards. “Behaviour change and raising awareness among public on safe PPE disposal is necessary,” Robin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bio-med-waste-dumped-in-waterways-threatens-aquatic-life-say-researchers/articleshow/78414347.cms||P Oppili

October 1, 2020||Pune||One-day auto strike today, PMPML to ply extra buses||PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) will run an additional 64 buses across various routes on Thursday to prevent inconvenience to citizens due to the one-day strike called by the autorickshaw unions. Nitin Pawar, the convener of Rickshaw Panchayat, told TOI that the strike had been called due to the lack of support to autorickshaw drivers from the authorities. “We have been urging the state government to stop issuing fresh permits for autorickshaws. More than one lakh autorickshaws are registered in Pune and additional 25,000 in the Pimpri Chinchwad area. But less than 20% of them are operational as there are not many customers,” Pawar said. He said autorickshaw drivers at more than 850 stands across the city were consulted and a majority of them have extended their support to the one-day strike. “On Thursday, there will an agitation in front of the Pune collector’s office at 11am,” Pawar added.

Avanthi and Hemanth’s parents during their meeting with the commissioner sought strict action against all the accused, including her parents and uncle Yugender. Reacting to Cyberabad police’s claim that Hemanth and Avanthi had not approached the police after they moved to TNGO Colony, Avanthi told the media that they did not feel the need to do so at the time as they did not anticipate that her parents would kill Hemanth. On Wednesday, Gachibowli police took both Laxma Reddy and Yugender into police custody since the court had granted five days of their custody to police for further interrogation. Yugender will be taken to the scene of offence at Sanga Reddy on Thursday. Cyberabad police said that they will seek fast track court trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/avanthi-in-laws-seek-protection-from-kin/articleshow/78415849.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Pune||Pune: After 6 months, international travel bookings, enquiries start picking up||PUNE: International leisure travel enquiries and bookings from the city have picked up for the first time in six months, though India continues its embargo on flights beyond borders. Enquiries for vacationing abroad have surged by 40% to 50% (rough estimates from online travel portals and travel companies) through the government's “air bubbles”, the only way citizens can travel to specific international destinations freely and even for leisure. Nikhil Thakurdas, CEO, Odyssey Tours and Travels, said, “India has established travel bubbles with various countries, out of which Dubai and the Maldives are currently witnessing the highest traction due to fewer preconditions before travel, the most important being no quarantine requirements for the traveler after reaching the destination.” Thakurdas said, “In addition, the ease of travel with direct flights between India to Dubai and the Maldives is adding to the demand for the two destinations.” Thakurdas said that from zero leisure travel queries for the past six months till as late as earlier this month, his firm has been receiving 10-15 queries during each of the past couple of weeks for Dubai and the Maldives. “Of these, we have already made a couple of bookings for Dubai for the upcoming long weekend, and another for the Maldives in November 2020. Many of the enquires are expected to translate into actual bookings. The Maldives has no requirement for a RT-PCR test and has a visa-on -arrival facility for Indians, which explains the number of queries for the destination for the coming season,” he said. For Dubai, the only requirement for Indians is a negative RT-PCR test and, of course, a tourist visa. Rajnish Kumar, co-founder of online travel portal ixigo, told TOI that it has seen a month on month spike of 57% in search enquiries in September for international travel, the top destinations being Dubai, London, Bangkok, the Maldives and Kuala Lumpur among others. “Most of the places people are searching for fall under the international travel bubble arrangements that India has with other countries. Also, most searches are for travel in the next three months,” Kumar said. Santosh Gupta, owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays, said, “We have now started taking bookings for destinations like Dubai and the Maldives. We have seen a 40% increase in enquiries for international destinations this week in comparison to last week. Enquiries are for leisure travel during November, December this year, and January to March 2021. We have made a leisure travel booking for Dubai for December as well. Flyers need a negative RT-PCR test for both, going to Dubai and again, for coming back to India.” Gupta said that before Covid-19, people would make bookings almost 5-6 months in advance. “This has changed now, with bookings made a month or so in advance,” he said. A city-based event management firm is taking around 50 of its clients to the Maldives in December this year. “We have booked half of a resort and are in the process of booking a chartered plane for the same. This is a leisure trip for the clients , a much needed break from the months of being at home,” the firm’s director said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-6-months-international-travel-bookings-enquiries-start-picking-up/articleshow/78415853.cms||Neha Madaan

October 1, 2020||Chennai||Northeast monsoon: Outlook for city good, bleak for southern Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: The city and its surrounding districts in north Tamil Nadu may receive normal rainfall during the northeast monsoon season, said a report by South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF), a consortium of meteorologists and hydrological experts from South Asian countries. The northeast monsoon usually sets in by mid-October. However, southern coastal districts may not be as fortunate. “Below-normal rain is likely during the 2020 October-December season over the southern parts of South Asia including some parts of extreme southeastern India and most of Sri Lanka and Maldives, which climatologically receive good amount of rain during the season,” said the consensus climate outlook by the forum, coordinated by IMD. Tamil Nadu receives an average 447mm and Chennai gets 867mm, 62% of 1,383mm annual rain, in October-December. N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD, said the prevailing weak La Nina conditions, the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, is climatologically not favourable for northeast monsoon unlike El Nino, which refers to warming of sea surface temperatures that influences the monsoon.  Another phenomenon, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) the difference in sea surface temperatures between western and eastern Indian Ocean is also in neutral phase, which means it may not have any influence on the monsoon. The northeast winds will be weak. So, there could be below normal rainfall in southern Tamil Nadu from Karaikal, Nagapattinam to KanyaKumari while normal rainfall is likely over northern Tamil Nadu and the western ghats,” he said. The climate outlook for October-December 2020 season over South Asia has been developed through an expert assessment of the prevailing global climate conditions influencing the south Asian climate and seasonal forecasts from different global climate models. Weather blogger Pradeep John said, northeast monsoon rainfall was below normal in the previous La Nina years like 2016 and 2018 though Chennai and Tamil Nadu saw weather systems hitting the coast. “We may have cyclonic storms over Bay of Bengal, but we don’t know where it could make a landfall. Also, there will be a lot of dry days between two weather systems. So, if we miss a cyclonic storm and see a dry spell that may follow after the system, we may miss crucial rain days in the season. Previous La Nina years have been bad for us, but we may get better clarity once the southwest monsoon withdraws completely,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ne-monsoon-outlook-for-city-good-bleak-for-southern-tn/articleshow/78414392.cms||U Tejonmayam
October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Healthcare workers’ strike hits pandemic fight in Haveri||HAVERI: The Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Contractual Employees Association’s indefinite strike has badly affected Haveri’s fight against the pandemic. The district already suffers from an acute shortage of health workers, but now with 518 employees boycotting work, testing has fallen and even the semblance of control the authorities had over the spread of the virus is unravelling. However, Dr Rajendra Doddamani, district health officer, insisted the strike has not affected treatment of patients in the district. “Our regular employees are working round-the-clock to ensure timely treatment to all Covid patients,” Doddamani said. The boycotting employees, who include Ayush doctors, nurses, data entry operators, lab technicians, ambulance drivers, counsellors, supervisors, ANMs, and health programme supervisors, used to shoulder about 50% of the Covid-19 burden. Now, regular staffs are feeling the heat. The district has not been able to meet testing targets. “Our members have been boycotting work for the past week,” said Vasantkumar Goudra, president of the district unit of the contractual employees association. “Many Covid wards are without doctors, nurses, and Group D. Regular staffs are facing a heavy workload and they are unable to provide proper treatment to patients.” Goudra said the department doesn’t even have an ambulance driver to ferry Covid patients to hospitals and many people are yet to get their Covid test reports. “Despite several appeals to the government, our demands are not being considered. We will not withdraw the strike until the government considers our demands,” Goudra said. They are demanding pay and benefits on par with regular staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/healthcare-workers-strike-hits-pandemic-fight-in-haveri/articleshow/78413102.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli
October 1, 2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 75,000 repeaters bid to clear final university exams||MUMBAI: The dream of a university degree has resurfaced in the lives of thousands of candidates who had given up hope due to unsuccessful attempts and the pressures of earning a living. About 75,000 candidates sitting for final university exams starting Thursday are those who have returned to finish the last lap in their academic career. These are not all students with backlogs from the previous year; many are repeaters back to clear the graduate exam after a gap of over a year. Thousands of such aspirants filled the forms when the state announced it would pass all students based on their past performances. Of Mumbai Univ’s 2.5 lakh final exam candidates, 13,000 are old-timersFor the around 75,000 repeaters, it was an opportunity to acquire a degree without going back to the books! “At Pune University, we have so many students who last took their graduating exam in 2012 or 2010. Many had attempted the final exam twice, but failed both times. Now close to 18,000 of them have filled the exam form this year,” said a senior official at Savitribai Phule Pune University. “ Jab Ganga beh rahi hai, to sab haath dhone aa gaye (When the river is flowing freely, everyone is here to wash their hands),” he added. However, the Supreme Court order mandating that the state hold an exam and not hand out free degrees has resulted in universities adopting the appear-online-fromhome model beginning October 1. At Mumbai University, the exam department said of the 2.5 lakh candidates, 13,000 are old-timers who will repeat the final exam; at Nagpur University, the count stands at approximately 8,000. “Most students have been at home since the past few months, even those who have dropped out and are already employed. We realised that many could use this chance to complete their degree. So we even placed an advertisement in newspapers encouraging people to complete their graduation,” said Pradeep Khedkar, senate member of Amravati University. Close to 19,000 such candidates from Amravati have filled the form for the final exam. Rajesh Parikshit is one such candidate who went back to his books after a hiatus and will appear for the finals from Mumbai University. Parikshit, 22, is now a security staffer at a mall, but has learnt accounting. “I am once again appearing for my graduation after a gap of four years. If I pass, I can look at joining one of the restaurants in the mall as an accountant,” said the hopeful. Many universities across the state have similar numbers of contenders who have signed up to take the exam once again. “We even have students who had completed the MCom part 1 and then got busy at work and failed to take the second year. This break gave them a good chance to complete the second part. Such students too have signed up to take the final postgraduate exam,” said a senate member of Marathwada University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-75000-repeaters-bid-to-clear-final-university-exams/articleshow/78417620.cms||Hemali Chhapia
October 1, 2020||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Hindu Munnani leader succumbs to Covid||COIMBATORE: Founder of Hindu Munnani and pioneer of Ganesha Chathurthi processions in Tamil Nadu, Ramagopalan, 93, died at a private hospital in Chennai due to Covid-19 on Wednesday. Ramagopalan tested positive four days ago after he complained of breathlessness and was admitted in Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre at Chintadripet on September 28. Hospital authorities said his condition got worsened on Wednesday and he died late afternoon. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam, governor Banwarilal Purohit, DMK president M K Stalin, PMK leader S Ramadoss, RSS chief Mohan Bhagawat and other leaders cutting across the political spectrum offered their condolences. Born in Sirkazhi near Nagapattinam in 1927, Ramagopalan wanted to dedicate his life for the cause of Hinduism and chose not to marry. “Until 1980 he would stay in the RSS office. After he founded Hindu Munnani, until the day he was hospitalized, he stayed at the Munnani office in Chindathiripet in Chennai,’’ said Hindu Munnani state president Kadeswara C Subramaniam. Ramagopalan was inclined towards Hindutva ideals and joined RSS in 1945. In 1947, when he saw the travails of Hindu refugees from Pakistan, he resigned his job in the state electricity department and began working as full time pracharak. In the wake of mass conversions by dalits to Islam, he founded the Hindu Munnani in 1980 and started aggressively campaigning against the conversions. Four years after he founded HM, Ramagopalan had landed in Madurai railway station after a meeting in Coimbatore when a gang of religious fundamentalists made a murderous attack. Gopalan survived, but with deep scars on his head. Since then he started wearing the saffron cap to cover the scars. “Since then there was always a threat perception for him and he had move around only with armed guards,” Subramanian said. Gopalan, who was miffed by the campaigns of rationalist outfits, took out a procession on Ganesha Chathurthi in Triplicane for the first time in 1986 with just one idol. But he visited every nook and cranny of the state since then to promote the Chathurthi processions and popularised them. Called `Veera thuravi’ (Heroic Saint) by his followers, Gopalan was vehemently criticised not only by religious fundamentalists but also by members of rationalist outfits for promoting hindutva in TN. He played a role in mobilising support for Ayodhya temple and held a signature campaign for protection of Ram Setu. Gopalan preferred not to participate in public events for the past few years, though he would attend the Hindu Munnani’s organisational events. Hindu Munnani functionaries say he was active till Covid lockdown in March and was meeting them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hindu-munnani-leader-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/78415862.cms||Mayilvaganan

October 1, 2020||Pune||Pune stands third across India for crimes against the elderly||PUNE: Crime against senior citizens is on rise in the city. Among cities across the country, Pune stands third in crime against vulnerable senior citizens as per statistics released by the National Crime Record Bureau report Crime in India, 2019, on Wednesday. According to the NCRB report, Mumbai was ranked first with 1,231 cases, Delhi ranked second with 1,076 cases and Pune ranked third with 232 cases. Pune has registered 178 and 169 crimes against senior citizens in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The report states that senior citizens often fall victims to crimes like cheating, forgery, theft, grievous hurt, harassment and other offences. Senior citizens who live alone, abandoned by their children and are dependent on domestic helps and care takers are most vulnerable to crime.

October 1, 2020||Pune||3 held for ruckus over free medicines in Pune||PUNE: The Sinhgad road police arrested three men after an official from the Pune Municipal Corporation’s Murlidhar Laygude hospital in Dhayari lodged an FIR accusing them of abusing the hospital staff and creating a ruckus on Tuesday over free medicines, including immunity boosting tablets. The hospital’s pharmacist Kalpesh Gholap (39) lodged the complaint after which the Sinhagad Road police arrested Nilesh Dashrath Girme (35), Lokesh Ravi Rathod (21) and Hemant Kaluram Bhagat (48), of Dhayari. The police said Kalpesh and the other staff told the three men to fill up the case paper for the medicines, but they refused. The trio pushed Gholap and threatened him. An offence of obstructing a public servant from performing duties and disobedience has been registered against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-held-for-ruckus-over-free-medicines/articleshow/78415858.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Baby girl abandoned in Telangana's Kondareddypally village||HYDERABAD: Ten days after Nagarkurnool district collector L Sharman had urged people not to abandon unwanted babies on the road and bushes, a newborn baby girl was found abandoned in Kondareddypally village in Vangoor mandal on Wednesday. Police who were informed about the infant took the baby girl to the Sishu Centre at Mahbubnagar where medical attention was provided to her. An FIR was loded by Vangoor police against the unidentified person who abandoned the baby. Gangapuram Satyamma (47), an anganwadi teacher at Kondareddypally, told the police that she had been informed about the abandoned baby by a villager Kadari Chinna Lakshmamma. Sub-inspector Ch Balakrishna, who is investigating the case, said a case was filed under section 317 of IPC. As there have been frequent instances of unwanted babies being abandoned, the Nagarkurnool district administration has planned to provide cradles at some government hospitals so that parents leave their unwanted babies there instead of abandoning them at public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/baby-girl-abandoned-in-village/articleshow/78415861.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
October 1, 2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA government stays use of Centre’s farm ordinances||MUMBAI: The MVA government stayed two orders issued in August on implementation of central ordinances on farm reforms—they were passed by Parliament, approved by the President and also notified as laws recently —after Congress ministers led by Balasaheb Thorat threatened to boycott Wednesday’s Maharashtra cabinet meeting. The stay granted by cooperation and marketing minister Balasaheb Patil was later discussed in the cabinet meeting presided over by CM Uddhav Thackeray. While a cabinet sub-committee has been set up to study the ordinances and make recommendations to the Centre, a section of cabinet members questioned Patil’s powers to stay implementation of a central ordinance. “The two orders issued by the state government pertained to implementation of Central ordinances. In our opinion, the state minister has no powers to stay Central ordinances,” a senior minister said. The MVA regime has said it is opposed to the agri reform laws passed by the Centre. While Congress opposed the farm bills in both houses of Parliament in September, NCP and Shiv Sena chose to stage a walkout in the Rajya Sabha in September rather than record their opposition. The twin orders in Maharashtra had been issued by deputy secretary K G Valvi and director (marketing) Satish Soni on August 10. They provided for stringent implementation of the farm ordinances promulgated by the NDA government in June. According to reports, after the two orders were issued by the cooperation department, Patil realized that they were against the policies of the MVA government because not only the Congress but even his own party, NCP, had lodged a strong protest against the reforms. Sensing possible embarrassment for the MVA, Patil on September 16 wrote a letter to principal secretary (marketing) Anup Kumar, saying immediate steps should be taken for staying the two orders. However, no action was taken on the minister’s letter. On September 27, Congress’s Thorat too wrote a letter to Patil, saying since the Congress has described the legislation as a black law, it would be appropriate if the decision is stayed with immediate effect. As there was no response, Thorat on Tuesday night informed leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi that if the orders were not withdrawn, the Congress would boycott Wednesday’s cabinet meeting. Meanwhile, NCP legislator Shashikant Shinde also filed an appeal before Patil against the two orders. Shinde submitted that since the farmers and Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees were not heard by the government, the orders were passed unilaterally and against the principles of natural justice. Patil on Wednesday heard Shinde and passed a two-page stay order, saying the orders were issued without hearing the aggrieved parties and that they violated the principles of natural justice. The orders have been stayed till October 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-govt-stays-use-of-centres-farm-ordinances/articleshow/78416406.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Chikhaldara spider museum plan now caught in Covid web||AMRAVATI: Even as the state prepares for celebrating wildlife week from October 1, the national spider museum, inaugurated with great fanfare on October 3, 2018, at the hands of then state finance and forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar at Forest Training Institute, Chikhaldara, hasn’t made any progress to date. The museum was supposed to give boost to tourism and research on spiders as they form an important link in eco system and conservation of tigers besides helping farmers a lot in pest control. Though opened in one of the halls of FTI building, no progress has yet been achieved in the matter of having a separate building for the museum, allegedly due to ban put by the state government on undertaking new plans and projects due to Covid scenario. As a result, funds, which were already announced first by Mungantiwar and assured later by the present forest minister Sanjay Rathod last June, are yet to be allocated. CCF Ravindra Wankhade, who visited FTI on Monday, told TOI, “A proposal for the building for spider museum had been received from FTI and was processed after satisfying B&C department queries. It will now be sent to the Mantralaya for funds, but chances of getting them are very remote as there is no budget provision and also the government has banned undertaking new projects in the state.” Suggesting to run the museum in the existing set up, Wankhade said, “We cannot wait for the building to begin our work. We will publish stickers, pamphlets, hold meetings with farmers for training them.” Though APCCF and field director SN Reddy took initiative in including a chapter on spiders in a book on Melghat wildlife, he said Melghat Tiger Reserve can do little in the matter of spider museum as it is attached to the FTI. Arachnologist Dr Atul Bodakhe, who evinced keen interest in developing the museum to its national standards, said the state government should make arrangements for funds as it will serve dual purpose of promoting tourism and research. When the chief minister is fond of forests and wildlife and his minister son is in-charge of tourism portfolio, arachnologists here expect a better deal to the museum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chikhaldara-spider-museum-plan-now-caught-in-covid-web/articleshow/78415903.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Salem||Fire engulfs starch mill in Salem city||Salem: A major fire broke out in a tapioca starch mill near Nethimedu in the city on Wednesday, destroying materials worth Rs 6 lakh. Fire and rescue services personnel brought the flames under control after nearly three hours of struggle. The Annadhanapatty police said the fire was caused by short circuit. “Tapioca starch, starch glue and machineries were gutted.” According to a police officer, the mill on Puthur Itteri Road was run by K Anbalagan, 47, of Kandhappa Colony in Annadhanapatty area. It was the unit manager P Sakthivel, 34, who first saw thick smoke emanating from the unit. “He had locked the unit on Tuesday night before leaving for home. When he returned around 8am on Wednesday, he saw smoke and entered inside only to see tapioca starch bags and glue tins in flames. Machineries were also completely gutted,” the officer said. Sakthivel immediately alerted the fire station at Shevapet. Fire and rescue services personnel, along with the Annadhanapatty police, reached the spot and put out the fire. The officer said there was a godown of Sago-Serve, a state government enterprise for sago, adjacent to the tapioca starch unit. “A side wall of the godown was damaged in the incident. We are trying to find out if sago bags were damaged.” The Annadhanapatty police have registered a case and initiated inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/fire-engulfs-starch-mill-in-salem-city/articleshow/78415870.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri demolition case: How Delhi cycle shop owner turned clogged legal wheels||LUCKNOW: The acquittal of all 32 accused in Babri demolition case notwithstanding, if the case could remain on track for 28 years, a lot of credit should go to Mohammad Aslam Bhure. He played a crucial role in seeking the Supreme Court intervention both in the title suit and the demolition case time and again whenever he found any kind of ‘derailment’ in the process in the lower courts. This bicycle shop owner from Daryaganj, was not a party in any of the cases and had gone literally bankrupt filing a series of petitions over 20 years, but he was undeterred. “Aslam Bhure was a crusader, who without any personal or ideological differences was just committed for the protection of a religious shrine,” observed legal expert, Zafaryab Jilani, who himself has been contesting the Babri masjid cases in courts. In the demolition case, Bhure filed PILs questioning the logic of the UP government in issuing two notifications for cases to continue at two places -- Rae Bareli and Lucknow. The CBI also supported Bhure on his request for having the cases tried in Lucknow. Then, when the Rae Bareli court discharged Advani and others, it was Bhure who sought the Supreme Court’s intervention. The apex court served notices on all the accused who had been discharged. Later, the high court revoked the discharge order and the cases against Advani and others continued without ‘conspiracy’ charges. Earlier, it was his petition in 1991 on which the Supreme Court had ordered to maintain status quo at the disputed site, though the order came five days after the demolition of Babri Masjid. However, this order worked as a guiding principle for maintaining rule of law in the temple town. When his petition was taken note of by the media, litigants and the political circles, Bhure’s remarks in an interview were “Allah had directed me to do this otherwise how could I afford to challenge the powerful politicians. I just craved to protect Babri Masjid.” In 2002, when the VHP had announced ‘shila pujan’ around the disputed site, it was on Bhure’s petition that the Supreme Court intervened and forced the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee to submit an affidavit before the court affirming that the Centre was duty-bound not to allow any religious activity around the disputed site and thus the VHP programme was fizzled out. He passed away just a couple of days after the Allahabad high court pronounced the verdict in the Ayodhya title suit on September 30, 2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-delhi-cycle-shop-owner-turned-clogged-legal-wheels/articleshow/78416407.cms||Subhash Mishra

October 1, 2020||Chennai||Velachery Lake contains high-level of bacteria and chlorides: NGT panel||Chennai: Water at Velachery lake and connecting storm water inlets contains high levels of bacteria, chlorides and total dissolved solids (TDS), according to an inspection report submitted to National Green Tribunal (NGT) by state agencies. As per government standards, no fecal coliform bacteria are permitted in public water supplies. But samples collected at five different testing points in and around Velachery had bacteria and this shows that water is contaminated with sewage, said the report by the corporation, Contamination was extremely high at some places like Kakkan Bridge in Adambakkam (2,400 MPN per 100 Mg/L). Similarly, chloride and TDS values were way above par at Manudhapandiyar Road near Shri Gupta Bhavan hotel. “Since water from the lake is not directly used for consumption there was no need to panic,” said public health expert K Kolandaisamy. “Unless tankers illegally extract water from the lake in the night, the contamination is not going to have a direct impact on health of residents but the presence of faecal matter reiterates the fact that our sanitation system needs to improve,” he added. Admitting this, a Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) official from Velachery area said that they have a proposal to intercept sewage flow at all storm water drains by constructing ‘weeping weirs’. “By this, we will be able to pump sewage to existing sewage treatment facilities located in the foreshore area of the tank,” he added. He was optimistic that this will reduce pollution load in near future. With respect to Kakkan Bridge, a Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) official told NGT that they will soon be installing trash tracks or brooms to avoid entry of floating debris into the main Velachery tank and channel. As long-term measures, the water resources department (WRD) assured to clear all 1,100 identified encroachments after Covid-19 lockdown was lifted. Desilting and strengthening of tank bund will follow this, the department said. NGT Southern Zone, however, expressed dissatisfaction over the delay. Monsoon is fast approaching and unless something is done to prevent such illegal activities, they are likely to face some disastrous consequences, they observed. The next hearing over the issue is on November 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/velachery-lake-contains-high-level-of-bacteria-and-chlorides-ngt-panel/articleshow/78414433.cms||Ram Sundaram
October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Data error shows Kalaburagi man recovered after 93 days in hospital||BENGALURU: A 45-year-old Kalaburagi man found positive for Covid-19 on June 27 was discharged on September 28 — after an eyebrow-raising 93-day hospital stay — according to the state government’s daily pandemic bulletin. His ‘patient ID’ figured among those discharged in Tuesday’s bulletin. However, inquiries with Kalaburagi health officials revealed that the man was discharged 11 days after he was admitted. “The patient is absolutely fine,” said Dr Vivekananda Reddy, the officer in charge of district surveillance in Kalaburagi, told TOI. “It is not an error, but a delayed update. Data entry operators had not probably added his recovery at the time of discharge.” However, if the state’s daily Covid-19 bulletins are to be believed, the Kalaburagi man is not the only patient who has had a prolonged stay in hospital. A patient from Belagavi who was admitted on August 12 was shown as discharged on September 25 — after a 43-day stay in hospital. When TOI asked Dr Arundhati Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka about the delayed discharges, she said she would look into the matter. Part of Arundhati’s tasks is to prepare the state’s Covid-19 daily bulletin. Following TOI’s inquiries, Dr Reddy later on Wednesday said his staff got a call from the Bengaluru office. “We rang up the patient again and checked on his health. He is fine,” he said. The September 12 bulletin has 10 patients who tested positive in late June but were discharged after more than 75 days in hospital or Covid Care Centres. This includes a nine-year-old boy who, according to the bulletins, spent 78 days in a designated hospital in Bengaluru. “It cannot be true. If a patient had spent such a long time in hospital, we would have known,” officials from Bengaluru’s district surveillance team said when asked about the boy’s case. “It must be a case of delayed reporting of recovery. We will check.” These data aberrations have resulted in a distortion of the state’s recovery rate, say doctors working on the ground. “We are in an unexpected situation. There is too much work to be done by a department which is plagued by an acute shortage of staff. Ideally all hospitals have to update patients’ recovery and discharge on the government’s ‘Facility’ app. Some hospitals are not doing it on a real time basis due to workload,” officials said. Senior health department officials said, “These errors might only increase in days to come as data entry operators hired on contract basis have gone on strike. The quality of data depends on the efficiency of data entry operators and the information provided to them. With cases rapidly increasing, there is fatigue setting in, especially in the health department as employees have been slogging since March.” “Due to strike by doctors and National Health Mission workers, we had a problem for a few days. This data issue may be result of that,” health commissioner Pankaj Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/data-error-shows-kalaburagi-man-recovered-after-93-days-in-hosp/articleshow/78412962.cms||Sunitha Rao R
October 1, 2020||Pune||Sanjeev Dhurandhar elected fellow of APS for contribution to physics||PUNE: Sanjeev Dhurandhar, emeritus professor, Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), has been elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) for his contributions to physics by the APS Council at its September 2020 meeting upon the recommendation of the APS division of Gravitational Physics (DGRAV). It is a recognition of his achievements in physics and in general in science and a rare international honour, especially for scientists working in India, an official release from IUCAA said. The citation on the APS certificate reads, “For foundational contributions to the theoretical underpinnings of gravitational wave detection, especially in data analysis techniques and for developing a gravitational wave community in India which has led to LIGO-India (a laser interferometric gravitational wave detector on Indian soil).” Somak Raychaudhury, director of IUCAA, in his statement to the media, said, “When Sanjiv Dhurandhar started working on gravitational waves in IUCAA in the late 1980s-early 1990s, it was not a fashionable field. Very few people thought that GW would be realistically ever detected. Dhurandhar built the first group in India with Sathyaprakash (who is now in Penn State and a leader in LIGO) and a very smart bunch of postdocs and students. The mathematical method he developed (matched filtering) was used by the LIGO collaboration for the first detection in 2015 and is still used. Almost all of the activity in GW in India can be traced back to Dhurandhar and Bala Iyer in Bengaluru who became a APS fellow a few years ago." Dhurandhar has been honoured with national as well as international awards such as Meghnad Saha Memorial Gold Medal (individual), Firodia Vijnan Bhushan (individual) and Milner’s Special Breakthrough Prize (shared with the LIGO Science Collaboration). His ongoing work involves improving search methods in gravitational wave data analysis, said a note from IUCAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sanjeev-dhurandhar-elected-fellow-of-aps-for-contribution-to-physics/articleshow/78415874.cms||---

October 1, 2020||Mangaluru||Mangaluru: Waste segregation at source in all MCC wards from tomorrow||MANGALURU: Waste segregation at source will be uniformly implemented in all 60 wards of the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) from Friday. Run as a pilot project to ascertain the pitfalls in five wards, the civic body collected wet waste from residential and commercial complexes on a daily basis and dry waste every Friday. Authorities will give a maximum grace period of 10 days after which fines as approved in the civic body’s bylaws will be levied. Sending this warning at the direction of mayor Diwakar, MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar told reporters on Wednesday that the trial along with a ban on single use plastic was going on well in the pre-Covid days. The fine ranges from Rs 1,500 for not segregating household waste to Rs 25,000 for dumping construction debris in open spaces. MCC is also considering setting up CCTV cameras in open spaces, that have become dumping grounds for debris, he said. MCC has sensitised Antony Waste Handling Cell Ltd that handles the city’s waste of around 350 tonnes per day, to suitably ramp up their infrastructure. Health inspectors and environmental engineers will keep tabs on waste segregation. MCC demonstrated the process to stakeholders on July 3, 2019. Agencies involved in waste management too gave a demonstration of technology available for the purpose on September 27, 2019. These stringent steps are very much necessary with the National Green Tribunal too monitoring the situation. The NGT has also directed the chief secretary to explain in person steps the state has taken to comply with the Solid Waste Management Act, 2016, an act that even the Union government is serious about. MCC has already directed all bulk generators of waste to set up their own processing plants or make arrangements for its scientific disposal. Households, hotels, hostels, educational institutions, bars and restaurants, marriage halls, catering firms and businesses who convert wet waste into compost will get a rebate of 50% in solid waste management cess they pay as part of property tax. MCC will provide forms for this purpose from October 2, Sridhar said. Health inspectors will verify compost arrangements in households and institutions to facilitate them in claiming the rebate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/waste-segregation-at-source-in-all-mcc-wards-from-tomorrow/articleshow/78412936.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Kolkata||East-West tunnel to make history with Sealdah breakthrough||KOLKATA: Tunnel borer Urvi’s breakthrough at Sealdah station next week will be a beginning of the completion of city’s most ambitious infrastructure project. History will be made as the 16km east-bound tunnel of the East-West Metro will finally connect Howrah Maidan with Salt Lake Sector V — four and a half years after the Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) started building it. It will also connect the two mammoth railway terminals of Howrah and Sealdah. This, said an engineer triumphantly, “would bring the first major sense of completion for all of us.” The project that saw disruptions and disasters — the most crucial one being the tunneling fiasco on August 31, last year, that saw houses in Bowbazar falling like a pack of cards — achieved one milestone after another. “The disaster proves how challenging it was building underground tunnels in this particular geology, comprising alluvial and sandy soil, with a network of aquifers. But we have risen like a phoenix,” said an official with ITD ITD-Cementation, which is building the last leg of the underground tunnel between Esplanade and Sealdah. Headlines were made when Afcons, the other contractor, built India’s first transportation tunnels below the Hooghly river in June, 2017. In August, 2019, they built India’s deepest Metro station, below Howrah station — the country’s busiest railway station. A year later, in August 2020, the country’s deepest Metro ventilation shaft was completed. But officials said when the tunnel boring machine (TBM) — nicknamed Urvi — punches the diaphragm wall in Sealdah station, in a few days from now, it will be a tale of resilience. “When houses fell one after the other as Urvi’s twin, Chundi, hit the aquifer, we thought the project was going to abort and we would never make it to Sealdah,” a KMRC official rued. The project has been split into phases and the continuous east-bound tunnel would now open more fronts of construction and other contractors could take over, veering the project towards completion. “The east-bound tunnel will comprise of the 3.8km Howrah Maidan-Esplanade section, the 2.45km Esplanade-Sealdah sections, the 3.5km till Subhas Sarobar, and then the 6km elevated Salt Lake section. However, the 800m gap in the west-bound tunnel will remain for some time. TBM Chundi, which was building the west-bound tunnel, couldn’t finish its job after hitting the aquifer and is now lying defunct below Durga Pituri Lane. Urvi will turn once it reaches Sealdah and complete the rest of west-bound tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-w-tunnel-to-make-history-with-sealdah-breakthrough/articleshow/78416436.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
October 1, 2020||Lucknow||Babri mosque demolished by Congress, no other mosque will be touched now: Vinay Katiyar||AYODHYA: A day before the Babri mosque demolition, the 10pm dinner attended by former deputy prime minister L K Advani and other Sangh leaders at the Ayodhya residence of Bajrang Dal leader and then MP, Vinay Katiyar, was cited as evidence of conspiracy by the CBI counsel in court. However, with evidence falling flat in court, a vindicated Katiyar told TOI that “no plot was hatched to demolish the mosque at my house on December 5, 1992, only a symbolic kar seva was planned”. “Advani ji reached Ayodhya that night and was staying at Janki Mahal. As he was my leader, I invited him to dinner at my house and we discussed ‘saanketik kar seva' (symbolic karsewa) the next day. We also decided that no ‘kar sevak’ will be allowed near the Babri mosque,” he said. He said, the structure was demolished by Congress to topple the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. “No other mosque would be touched in future. Let peace prevail,” he told TOI. “Babri Masjid was demolished by Congress and we became accused, it was the conspiracy of Congress to topple our governments in the states through the demolition. We never wanted the structure to be demolished. It was the Congress that demolished the structure,” said Katiyar. “Our kar sevaks were disciplined and there was a big conspiracy to infiltrate their ranks with unknown criminal elements, who provoked and launched the demolition. We had asked ‘kar sevaks’ to bring sand from Saryu banks for a symbolic kar seva and we were unable to understand how they suddenly veered out of control,” he said. Katiyar demand an inquiry into the role of Congress and its leaders in the demolition of Babri Masjid that led to toppling of the Kalyan Singh government in Uttar Pradesh. Speaking about the dispute at Kashi and Mathura, Katiyar said, “We have not planned any movement for Kashi and Mathura shrines. We will discuss with seers, but we will not talk of dismantling any more mosques in the country.

The Central Railway (CR) will not close down the Manish Nagar railway crossing after MahaMetro’s railway overbridge (ROB) and railway underbridge (RUB) are opened for traffic. CR plans to construct another RUB near the crossing. The crossing will be closed after this underpass is ready. However, the second RUB is in limbo as CR and state government are yet to decide who will fund the project. MahaMetro had designed this RUB about three years ago but no progress has been made since then. CR officials say the project is very much on. The second RUB would be a two lane structure with a height of only three metres. This means it can only be used by two-wheelers and cars and not by buses and trucks. Its length will be about 300 metres. MahaMetro had not calculated the cost of the structure while designing it. Had the CR closed the level crossing after opening of MahaMetro’s structures, it would have caused a lot of problems for people living near the railway line in Manish Nagar. MahaMetro’s ROB and RUB are one-way. If you want to go from Wardha Road to Manish Nagar then you have to use the RUB. If you want to go from Manish Nagar to Wardha Road you have to use the ROB. Even though the Wardha Road flyover is four lane, no right turn will be permitted on it while coming from Manish Nagar ROB. Consequently, if a resident of Manish Nagar wants to go to Sitabuldi, he or she will have to take the ROB, take a left turn on the flyover, travel up to Hotel Pride and take a U-turn. This may encourage people to go wrong side in the RUB. A MahaMetro official said that Metro would urge Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to install close circuit television (CCTV) cameras inside the RUB to prevent people from travelling in the wrong direction. “We will also ask traffic police to post their personnel near the RUB and nab the violators,” he added. Only time will tell whether these measures are effective. The official further said separators would be installed on the flyover for preventing accidents. “The flyover is four lane but it has six lanes for 0.5 kilometre to handle Manish Nagar traffic. Traffic coming from Ajni will not be able to mix with that coming from Manish Nagar due to the separators,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rub-planned-at-manish-nagar-crossing-but-funding-not-decided-yet/articleshow/78415928.cms||Ashish Roy
October 1, 2020||Goa||3 borewells to deal with Cotigao water shortage||POINGUINIM: During the summer months, for years now, villagers of remote Cotigao in Canacona suffer acute water shortages. On Wednesday, at a joint meeting of officials, a solution was finally drawn to resolve this issue by the summer of 2021. It was decided that three borewells would be dug and the water supply provided to households through distribution pipelines. Cotigao sarpanch Daya Gaonkar said that out of seven wards in his panchayat, at least three face water scarcity during the summer months. Deputy speaker of Goa legislative assembly and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes, following a meeting with officials of different departments, said the three wards of Avli (part), Avem and Ponsulemol will see their water issues resolved during the upcoming summer months. The three borewells would be dug under a central government scheme, Gaonkar told TOI. During summer, locals from different parts of Cotigao and Gaondongrim have to travel for several kilometers to fetch drinking water from rivers and rivulets. The Gaunem Irrigation Project, which was initiated in 2011, holds the potential to meet the dire water needs of Gaondongrem and Cotigao. While the project is nearly complete, a water treatment plant is needed to solve the water woes of residents of the two interior villages inhabited by the scheduled tribes. During Wednesday’s meeting, Fernandes also took up for discussion other long-pending demands of Cotigao locals. Power woes and lack of mobile network connectivity for students currently attending online classes were also among the issues raised with officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3-borewells-to-deal-with-cotigao-water-shortage/articleshow/78415930.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Goa||CM meets Modi, says PM to hold 2 meets on Goa mining by October 15||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that PM Narendra Modi would have a meeting with bureaucrats and another political one to discuss and resolve the state’s mining issue. The meets will happen before October 15, Sawant said after meeting Modi, adding that he’s “hopeful of a positive outcome in the coming days”. Sawant told TOI that he explained in detail the mining issue to Modi, that if the industry doesn’t start, the state’s economy would be in the doldrums. He appealed to Modi to bring in a legislative cure to restart the industry. “The PM is positive about restarting mining activities in the state,” he said. Sawant appeared to not have raised the Mhadei issue, pointing out that had he done so, the mining issue would have got diluted. After the meeting with Modi, Sawant discussed the issue with Union mines minister Pralhad Joshi, who the CM said assured him of a solution. He urged the ministry to permit a deemed second renewal, so that mining can start and continue till 2027. “I had a fruitful discussion on various matters including mining,” the CM said, adding that he also explained the Covid-19 situation in the state. Sawant said that he has told Modi what steps have been taken by the state to make Goa atmanirbhar (self-reliant). The CM said that while he briefed Modi about the state economy, he didn’t ask for any financial package, and added that there’s a 40% shortfall in revenue in the state. The state had earlier urged the Centre to amend the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act, 1987, to restart mining activities. Sawant said that if the erstwhile Congress government completed the second renewal process in 2007, the industry wouldn’t have had to grind to a halt. There has been no mining activity in Goa since March 15, 2018, after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The state government had filed a review petition on February 7, 2018, in the apex court against the same order. When Sawant met Modi in March, he had urged the PM to file an affidavit before the Supreme Court in support of resumption of mining in the state. The state has been holding meetings with Union ministers to resolve the issue. Two mining companies had approached the SC for extension of mining leases till 2037. The state government had subsequently maintained that the mining leases could be extended up to 2037, as per the contention of the companies, but that it would abide by the decision of the court. It also said that the mining companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8(A) of the Mines and Minerals Development Act, they were entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-meets-modi-says-pm-to-hold-2-meets-on-goa-mining-by-oct-15/articleshow/78415909.cms||Murari Shetye

October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Pragati Nagar residents protest over bone-jarring rides||HYDERABAD: Frustrated with the poor condition of roads, residents of Pragati Nagar, a residential colony in Nizampet, planted a sapling with a placard that read ‘RIP Pragathi Nagar Roads’ in a pothole on the road to highlight the official apathy on Wednesday. Several IT employees who reside in Pragathi Nagar say that the road is especially dangerous for motorists who commute at night. “The officials keep changing from time to time but the condition of the roads remains the same. Several IT employees travel late at night and these bad roads are very dangerous at night,” said Sai Teja, vice-president of NGO Forum Against Corruption, who frequently uses the stretch. Moreover, gravel-ridden roads with potholes filled with stagnant rainwater and eroded bitumen layer were a common sight at several places. Srinivas Bellam, a resident of Pragathi Nagar, said that the road was leading to accidents. “I saw three accidents occurring in Pragathi Nagar, with motorists sustaining injuries,” he said. Meanwhile, officials of Nizampet Municipal Corporation said that the road restoration work was delayed due to incessant rains. “The road repair works were delayed due to rains. Temporary measures like filling of potholes with gravel have already been taken up. The complete road will be restored. We are only waiting for the rains to stop,” said B Gopi, municipal commissioner, Nizampet Municipal Corporation. Many roads in GHMC limits are also in bad shape. Asked about the poor condition of the road adjacent to Sri Peddamma Temple Arch at Road No. 36 and Road No.10 of Jubilee Hills, GHMC officials said that the road at Road No. 36 was damaged due to sewage overflow while at Road No.10, there was civic work being carried out by a telecom operator. “Both roads will be restored once the rains stop,” said B Vijay, GHMC executive engineer, Jubilee Hills circle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residents-protest-over-bone-jarring-rides/articleshow/78414457.cms||Nabinder Bommala
October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Telangana yet again faces gunny bag shortage||HYDERABAD: Civil supplies officials have failed to get back over Rs 100 crore worth gunny bags from fair price (FP) shop dealers and rice millers in the last five years. As a result, the state government is now faced with a shortage of eight crore gunny bags to store paddy as it is expecting a bumper crop this season. The government is now forced to buy gunny bags from private merchants at a minimum of Rs 24 per bag compared to Rs 18 per bag they had to pay to dealers. Every year, the state requires eight crore to 15 crore gunny bags to store paddy depending upon the production and then supply custom-milled rice to Food Corporation of India and also the FP shops. The government pays Rs 18 per bag to the dealer if it is returned in good condition i.e., can be used for second and third time. Civil supplies minister G Kamalakar said they were looking into the issue. Every official, miller and ration dealer would be held accountable for each gunny bag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-yet-again-faces-gunny-bag-shortage/articleshow/78415904.cms||Roushan Ali

October 1, 2020||Pune||Masks & distance at Maharashtra Common Entrance Test||PUNE: For 20 days starting from Thursday, as many as 4.51 lakh students will appear for Maharashtra Common Entrance Test (MHCET), the eligibility test for admission to B.E/ B.Tech/ B.Pharmacy/ Pharm.D. undergraduate courses. From ensuring that you reach the exam centre well in time to making sure that social distancing and general safety precautions are taken at all times, students have a lot more to look out for, before appearing for the exam this time. Vaibhav Bakliwal of Bakliwal Tutorials said that proper sleep a night before the exam is one of the most crucial things that students need to keep in mind. “If you walk in the evening or play a light sport that you enjoy, it is quite likely that you will have sound sleep. It is okay to feel worried at any time. Don’t fuel it by focusing on it. Performers focus on what they have to do and not on how they are feeling,” he added.  Durgesh Mangeshkar of the IITians Prashikshan Kendra, revision of key formulae is key in an examination like CET. “The MHT-CET exam is a speed test based on information and formulae based questions and does not have negative marking. Hence, revise the key formulae well and attempt all questions. Intelligent guessing should be used wherever possible to save time,” said Mangeshkar. Sometimes, the questions in entrance exams can be tricky. Arun Jain of the Allen Career Institute advises students to read them carefully before answering and not to make mistakes in a hurry. “In the exam, avoid using any shortcut that you are not completely sure about. If you find any particular question difficult, make sure that you don’t waste your time trying to solve it. Instead, you should move to the next question and if time permits come back to this question later,” he said. Lalit Kumar of Prime Academy has advised students to appear for mock tests by replicating the exam conditions, by putting the mask on, during the examination slot to acclimatise oneself with it. “If you are unable to solve a few problems, go with a smart guesswork as there is no negative marking. In exams, for any reason if you get stressed and suffer a blackout, leave the paper for a minute and take a deep breath; it can be an investment not a waste of time. Remember that amid this pandemic, many toppers who have done reasonably well in JEE will be skipping CET. This will probably reduce your exam pressure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/masks-distance-at-cet-for-over-4l-aspirants-from-today/articleshow/78415900.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Pune||Six booked on charge of duping investors of Rs 72 lakh||PUNE: The Swargate police are investigating a complaint lodged by some small-time business persons from Satara Road and Sinhagad Road stating that they were duped of Rs72.18 lakh collectively, by six persons on the promise of attractive returns on investment in 2018-19. The six suspects, including two women, hail from Mumbai, Aurangabad among other places. They hired an office premises in a commercial complex near Mitra Mandal Chowk to operate their finance and investment business. Swargate police said a shopowner (36) of Panmala on Sinhagad Road lodged a complaint with the police. The suspects lured the victims in the name of high returns on deposits ranging from Rs10 lakh to Rs15 lakh for a specific term and accepted the same. However, the suspects folded up their activity and never returned the principle and interest on the money accepted. So far, six victims approached the police and the overall fraud amount was likely to go up. The FIR stated one of the two women posed as a widow of a businessman and claimed her husband had funds with several financial institutions. She said that if the people would invest in her scheme, she would also share the amount received from these funds with them. Police said suspects spread word among the locals urging them to invest. People visited the office and gave cheques and cash to the suspects. The investors were supposed to get their money and interest sum in December 2019 and early 2020. They visited the office and found it was locked. One of the victims, who operates a shop on Satara Road, said, “The woman promised me an interest of 12% on my investment. So, I invested money after they won my confidence. The suspects had given me a postdated cheque, but it did not materialize. It is a huge loss for me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-booked-on-charge-of-duping-investors-of-rs-72l/articleshow/78415907.cms||---

As part of unlock 5.0 it’s given the go ahead for all tourist attractions — including historic sites, forts, museums and stadiums under the department of tourism and archaeology — to be thrown open to the public. Even a boat ride on the iconic Hussainsagar Lake is now off the barred list. “All historical sites under the state government and buses to these sites will be opened to the public. We will ensure all Covid-related measures are in place,” said B Manohar, managing director, Telangana State Tourism Development CorporationThe Golconda Fort, which falls under the Archaeological Survey of India, was opened earlier this month.

October 1, 2020||Hyderabad||Farmers protest against land acquisition for pharma city in Rangareddy district||HYDERABAD: Pandemonium prevailed at a meeting organised by officials on Wednesday in connection with the proposed pharma city in Rangareddy district as enraged villagers threw chairs and raised slogans against the project. As the chairs were flung at the podium and the situation was getting out of control, the police intervened and removed all the agitating farmers. They were detained at the Yacharam police station. Ibrahimpatnam revenue divisional officer (RDO) Venkatachary started the meeting at Nandavanaparthy village and said that a notice for the meeting was given two months back and a survey would be taken up as part of the plan to develop the pharma city. The latest survey is for acquiring land for laying a new road. Even as the official was speaking, scores of villagers shouted that they are against the project. “When we are against the project itself, what is the need for laying a road?” a villager questioned. Local MPP Sukanya snatched the microphone and questioned how the officials could go ahead with the project when the villagers are yet to give consent. “The gram sabha was organised for acquiring 40 acres of land for the approach road to pharma city. This was objected to by those who are not connected with the matter at all. Land holders are willing to give their land for acquisition and we hope to complete the process in a couple of days,” Venkatachary said. He said that 99% land acquisition for the project was completed. Those who gathered at Nandavanaparthy village also demanded to know why the meet was held only at Nandavanaparthy village when four other villages will be affected due to land acquisition. They said that this was being done only to rush through a process without seeking the opinion of all the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-protest-against-land-acquisition-for-pharma-city/articleshow/78414505.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
October 1, 2020||Pune||Cash-strapped PMPML wants increase in fares to stay afloat||Pune: The PMPML wants a hike in its electric bus and also late-night bus services to revive its financial health and will table the proposal at its board of directors’ meeting on Thursday.A Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) official on Wednesday said a hike of Rs5 per km for travel in its electric buses and a similar increase for the late-night services (Raat Rani) have been proposed. “We plan to roll out the e-buses for the airport services as well on other routes from mid-October. The buses will run without air conditioning considering the commuters’ safety in the time of Covid-19. A rise in the bus fares is essential for the cash-strapped utility to stay afloat,” the official told TOI. “The PMPML, as part of its night services, operates buses between 10pm and 5am along six routes. The transport body will lobby for the fare hike during the board meeting,” the official added. The airport bus services are set to start from the middle of October. “The earlier airport bus fares were Rs120 (Kothrud) and Rs180 ( Hinjewadi). The fares were reduced to Rs60 and Rs100, respectively. The services were closed last year. Now that the services are being revived, three base fares (Rs50, Rs100 and Rs150) will be charged based on the distance ,” another official said. PMP Pravasi Manch member Sanjay Shitole, “The PMPML’s fare hike plan will not solve its problem. Rather, it will be more damaging for the PMPML considering the few passengers it is now catering to,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cash-strapped-pmpml-wants-increase-in-fares-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/78415914.cms||Joy Sengupta

At least five such cases have come to the TOI’s attention.S Gunasekaran, 39, of Mullamparappu village in Modakkurichi taluk, was one among them. He was tested positive for the virus on September 25. “Health department officials came to my house the same morning and took me to a marriage hall opposite the Erode bus stand, where the municipal corporation is running a screening centre, in an ambulance for further tests,” he told TOI.The officials took x-ray, ECG, blood test and CT scan. He was taken to the centre around 10.15am and made to wait there till 3pm for an ambulance to take him back home, where he wished to remain in quarantine. “They later asked me to take a bus or taxi to my house. They also didn’t offer me lunch.”Another four Covid-19 had a similar experience when they opted for home quarantine and treatment. A 58-year-old woman from Bhavani taluk was also forced to take a bus or other transport mode to reach her house.When contacted, Dr S Soundammal, deputy director of health services, said she would look into the issue very seriously. “I was not aware about this. Strict action will be taken against the errant officials. They can’t allow a Covid-19 patient to travel in a public transport.

October 1, 2020||Lucknow||How apex court put the Babri case on fast track||LUCKNOW: Special judge SK Yadav on Wednesday took just five minutes for acquittal of 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case which had seen 28 years of legal journey. And, had the Supreme Court not played an active role, it could have continued for several more years. The apex court had on April 19, 2017, and fast-tracked the case that was dragging on for a quarter of a century in the labyrinth of legalities. Apart from setting a deadline for completion of the trial, the apex court not only clubbed the two cases related to the same act by using extraordinary powers but also revived conspiracy charge against LK Advani and restored trial of 13 others saffron stalwarts against whom CBI had dropped charges a decade ago. Seeds of delay were sowed by the Congress government led by PV Narasimha Rao that indirectly ruled UP after imposition of President’s rule. About 49 cases were lodged by police on December 6, 1992. However, instead of allotting all the cases to one investigating agency, the state government gave the kar sewak (197) case to central agency CBI and the state’s CB-CID was asked to probe the speech case (198). A special court in Lalitpur was created for trial which was shifted to Rae Bareli on July 8, 1993. Eight months after the incident, UP government realised that all the cases should be probed by one agency and entrusted CBI with the job on August 26, 1993. However, within 15 days, another complication was introduced when the government created a special court in Lucknow for trial of kar sewak case, while speech case remained in Rae Bareli. Adding another twist, the CBI requested the government to transfer the speech case to Lucknow as well, but without waiting for the shifting, it clubbed the cases and filed a composite chargesheet in Lucknow court on October 5, 1993, adding 32 more names including Kalyan Singh’s. Three days later, the government transferred the speech case from Rae Bareli to Lucknow, but without consulting high court, which was mandatory and became the main cause of delay and dropping of conspiracy charges. On October 11, 1993, the Lucknow court took cognizance of the consolidated chargesheet and on January 11, 1996, CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet naming nine more for conspiracy. Twenty months later, the court framed charges saying all the offences were committed in the same transaction which warranted a joint trial. However, proceedings were stalled as the order was challenged by the accused in the HC, which on February 12, 2001, ruled that the shifting of speech case from Rae Bareli to Lucknow was invalid as it was done without HC’s consultation, but added that the ‘technical defect’ can be cured by the state government by a notification. The court also upheld consolidated chargesheet and conspiracy charges. However, the government did not amend the defect. As a result, on May 4, 2001, the Lucknow court dropped proceedings against 21 accused including Advani in speech case saying that there are two cases—one of kar sewak and other of instigators. It continued with the kar sewak case, while the speech case was shifted back to Rae Bareli. On June 16, 2001, CBI requested UP government headed by Rajnath Singh to rectify the technical defect but it rejected the request. It was also not cured by the BJP-supported Mayawati government later. The CBI, instead of challenging the rejection, filed a supplementary chargesheet at Rae Bareli court against the eight accused without conspiracy charge and dropped proceedings against the other 13 altogether. Another blow came when on September 19, 2003, the Rae Bareli court discharged Advani in demolition case. The case remained derailed for two years when the HC court on July 5, 2005, put it back on track by setting aside Advani’s discharge. The speech case was revived but without the conspiracy charge. Nevertheless, the trial began 13 years after the incident. Meanwhile, in Lucknow, it took nine more years to complete formalities and start the trial of the kar sewak case. In the meantime, CBI filed a revision petition in the HC against Lucknow court’s May 4, 2001, order, but it was dismissed in 2010. The CBI challenged the dismissal in SC after nine months instead of 90 days as per rule. The court pulled up CBI for delay, but admitted the appeal and after six years of hearing delivered the verdict on April 19, 2017. Using its power to cure the technical defect, the SC shifted the speech case from Rae Bareli to Lucknow and clubbed all cases for a joint trial. It upheld conspiracy charges against eight accused, besides directing to revive cases against 13 others who were let off. It also ruled that the trial will be held on a daily basis and concluded in two years with no adjournments or transfer of judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-apex-court-put-the-babri-case-on-fast-track/articleshow/78416457.cms||Ashish Tripathi
October 1, 2020||Pune||35 major dams in Pune division 97% full so far||PUNE: The collective storage in 35 major dams in Pune division stood at 97% at the end of September on Wednesday as compared to 98% the previous year. Barring a few, most reservoirs in the division are full, thanks to the heavy spells of rain received in September in the catchments. In all, there are 726 major, medium and minor dams in the division, which had a collective storage of 88.7% on Wednesday as against last year’s stock of 87.4%. A data released by the water resources department stated while the major dams in Pune division had 1% less stock than last year, the collective storage of medium-sized projects was at 77.5% — 20% more than the last year’s stock of 57%. The storage of minor water project was at 28% — 4% more than the last year’s storage. Officials from the department said the catchments of the most dams recorded fairly good rainfall in July, August and September, though the rainfall activity stayed subdued in June. More showers are likely in the catchments as the process of withdrawal of the southwest monsoon was yet to get over. Of the 35 major dams, water was released from about 30 after their were filled to capacity, the officials said. There are 26 bigger dams in the Bhima basin. Out of these, the water stock in only two dams — Pimpalgaon Joge and Manikdoh — were below 50% of their storage capacities. Otherwise, the storage in all the remaining 24 dams was around 100%. In fact, the irrigation department continued with water discharge into the river from Ujani dam at the rate of 5,000 cusec because the dam had no space to store inflow of water. The officials said water storage in the Krishna basin was also good, with all 13 major dams including Koyna, Radhanagari, Dhom and Warnavati filled to their capacities. A senior official said the rainfall had continued till October last year, which had helped maintain the water levels in the reservoirs near to their full capacities. “We will have to observe the rainfall activity post-September. We are maintaining water storages at maximum levels and water is being released only as per the requirement,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/35-major-dams-in-pune-division-97-full-so-far/articleshow/78415932.cms||Sarang Dastane
October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Excise department panel to vet liquor ban||CHANDRAPUR: State’s excise minister Dilip Walse-Patil on Wednesday decided to appoint a department-level committee to evaluate effect of prohibition in two districts — Chandrapur and Gadchiroli. The committee will submit its report within a month of its institution and final decision will be taken in two months. Earlier, Walse-Patil held a meeting with home minister Anil Deshmukh and minister for relief and rehabilitation and Chandrapur guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar over surge in illegal liquor smuggling and sale in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. The meeting was scheduled on September 2. However, it was postponed due to flash floods in eastern districts of Vidarbha. The meeting finally took place on Wednesday at secretariat in Mumbai and impact of liquor ban on all related aspects like domestic violence, crime, health, revenue, industries, business, tourism etc was discussed. Wadettiwar had appointed a district-level committee under collector Kunal Khemnar for evaluation of outcome of the liquor ban in Chandrapur. Backed by statistical data, the committee in its report had painted a grim picture of the situation in Chandrapur due to prohibition. The report comprised 2.82 lakh opinions from people, institutions and organizations. While 2.61 lakh opinions were in favour of revoking the ban, only 20,585 supported its continuation. Wadettiwar, who strongly favours the revocation of liquor ban, claimed the new committee will be chosen as per the directives of excise minister and it will submit its report to excise department within a month. This report will be presented before a high-powered committee and final decision regarding continuation or revocation of prohibition will be taken based on the report. The entire process is likely to take two months, he told TOI. Principal secretary of excise department and top officials of home department were also present during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/excise-dept-panel-to-vet-liquor-ban/articleshow/78415954.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Restaurants, bars and food courts can open on October 5 at 50% capacity||MUMBAI: Restaurants, bars and food courts in the state can reopen from October 5 and operate at 50% capacity, the state government said in its fresh 'Mission Begin Again' guidelines issued on Wednesday even as it extended the existing lockdown till October 31. The MVA government had indicated earlier that restaurants would be allowed to reopen soon. While the city's suburban railway network remains shut to all except those already allowed, the state government has asked railways to increase frequency of trains within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to meet increased demand, and all trains originating and ending within Maharashtra can run again. Dabbawallas would be allowed to travel in trains after procuring QR codes from the police commissioner's office, the notification issued by acting chief secretary Sitaram Kunte stated. To provide a boost to industries in MMR, industrial and manufacturing units of non-essential items can restart operations. The state had allowed all industries and manufacturing units across the state to start operations in a phase-wise manner in May and June, but non-essential industries in MMR were prohibited. "This means more people will travel to work in this region. So we are asking public transport operators to increase frequency," an official said. With intra-state trains allowed, services like the Mumbai-Pune Deccan Queen, Vidarbha Express, Pragati Express, Godavari Express, Mahalaxmi Express, Koyna Express, Sahyadri Express, Koyna Express, Sinhagad Express and Tapovan Express etc are likely to be introduced gradually. Till now, only two inter-district trains, Dadar-Sawantwadi special and CSMT-Manmad special, were allowed. So far, only bus services had been permitted and limited trains to Konkan were allowed during Ganpati festival. A CR spokesperson said, "We will soon take a call on running inter-district trains." Also, local train services in Pune region can restart. The state has, in addition, allowed free movement of vehicles carrying oxygen. The government has also extended waiver of licence renewal fees for restaurants to December 31 instead of September 30. AHAR welcomed the move and requested the government to waive all licence fees for a year. "As we expect 35-40% restaurants to close down permanently, this waiver will prevent at least 10% from shutting and prevent job losses," said Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR.  On allowing dabbawallas in trains, union leader Sambhaji Medge said, "3/4ths of our workforce has gone home to villages because of the lockdown. We are happy the government has given us permission as that means we can come to Mumbai and restart our livelihoods.."

October 1, 2020||Nagpur||Panel set up to study Kanhargaon sanctuary proposal||Nagpur: The state’s chief wildlife warden NH Kakodkar has set up a six-member committee to explore Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary proposal in Central Chanda forest division in Chandrapur district. The committee set up on September 21 is headed by APCCF (wildlife) while deputy conservator of Central Chanda is member-secretary. Other members include CCF (Chandrapur), FDCM regional manager, and state wildlife board members Kishor Rithe and Bandu Dhotre. The declaration of sanctuary, which doesn’t have any village in its area, seems to be delayed inordinately. In February this year, FDCM and territorial forest officials were asked to hold joint meetings with locals to seek their views (janmat). Now a committee has been formed and told to submit a report by October-end. Many see this as another delaying tactic. On December 5, 2018, SBWL under the chairmanship of then CM Devendra Fadnavis granted in-principle approval to Kanhargaon, but then forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar put spokes in the proposal by directing to seek public opinion. Kanhargaon issue was again raised in 15th SBWL meeting by members Rithe and Dhotre to which chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was positive and asked forest officials to work with a positive mind. Rithe said, “SBWL never said anything about setting up a committee. Under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, there is no provision to seek public opinion before declaring any area sanctuary. Most importantly, there is no village in this proposal. Sanctuary is declared purely on basis of scientific and objective criteria like adequate ecological, flora, fauna and habitat significance for the protection of wildlife.” A section of forest officers are trying to declare Kanhargaon as a conservation reserve rather than a sanctuary to satisfy the politicians. The committee has been asked to gauge public opinion on the proposal. Dhotre said, “During public opinion taken early this year, people opposed sanctuary because they were misguided. If we tell them the benefits of tourism industry like Tadoba, I don’t think they will oppose. Ecotourism is the only industry that can run without damaging the environment. As it is, no units will come in Kanhargaon area as it is forest and tiger corridor.” Sources said a Chandrapur-based top politician, who wants greenfield airport at Rajura, sees the sanctuary as a hurdle as the airport site will come in the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Kanhargaon sanctuary. The proposal is hanging fire owing also to opposition from Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), which has large-scale logging operations. The corporation generates a revenue of at least Rs 22 crore annually from commercial extraction of timber from Kanhargaon. It is in possession of 28,000 (280sqkm) hectare area. Kanhargaon proposal includes 24,862-hectare (248.62sqkm) area of FDCM and 1,638 (16.38sqkm) hectare area of territorial forest under Central Chanda division. Both combine makes it a 265sqkm sanctuary with no village inside. WHY KANHARGAON? * Tigers need space as number in Maharashtra up from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018 * It is a link between Tadoba and Kawal in Telangana and needs to be made inviolate * It can accommodate spill over population of tigers reducing man-animal conflict * It will boost employment generation for locals from tourism. Telangana tourists will also visit as it is bordering the state||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/panel-set-up-to-study-kanhargaon-sanctuary-proposal/articleshow/78415951.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

October 1, 2020||Bengaluru||Reduced cap on price of Covid tests leaves private hospitals fuming||BENGALURU: Private hospitals are up in arms over the state government’s recent decision to reduce the price of a Covid-19 test and are demanding relief. They say the price set does not even cover their costs of conducting a test. The cost of a Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test in a private lab in Karnataka has now been capped at Rs 1,600. On September 24, the government issued an order, reducing the price cap from Rs 2,500, citing the fall in the cost of reagents used for testing. Private labs were also told that the cost of testing samples sent by government will be Rs 1,200, instead of Rs 1,500 previously. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) has now written to the health and family welfare department asking it to consider increasing the cost of tests. “Some private hospitals have CB-NAAT and TRue NAT testing for Covid and the cartridges used are expensive. The Rs 1,600 cap per test is unviable,” PHANA president Dr R Ravindra stated in the letter written on Wednesday. Speaking to TOI, Dr Ravindra said it is hard to get patients to understand that prices vary with different types of testing. The association said the government has only considered the reduction in cost of the reagent, but has not taken into account the cost of human resources. “We are paying double salaries to microbiologists and technicians. Taking into account air conditioning, electricity and infrastructure costs, the rate prescribed by the government is not feasible,” the association said in its letter. Most hospitals that have fever clinics collect throat and nasal swabs from suspected patients and send it to labs. “The swab collection and safe transportation of the sample add to the labs’ costs. The labs do not bear the cost. In states like Maharashtra, the state government has specified charges for collection of the swab also,” Dr Ravindra told TOI. The association has requested the state government to revise the ceiling and include these factors as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-cap-on-price-of-covid-19-tests-in-ktaka-angers-private-hospitals/articleshow/78413001.cms||---

Janu Gaonkar, known locally as ‘voktoli’ for his ‘guaranteed’ cures, is recognised in his tribal neighbourhood for having especially assisted women when they experience difficulty during childbirth in this remote and inaccessible area. But what Gaonkar is known for even more is his selfless service, as he never charges a fee. “He has vast experience and offers his service even to those from adjoining villages. But he is a simple down-to-earth person, who does not charge a fee. In fact, he subsists on whatever fees are voluntarily paid to him and by working as a farm labourer and by doing other menial work,” Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam said. Gaonkar’s help is sought by villagers to treat their animals as well. He will now be awarded a cash prize of Rs 25,000 by the board ‘in appreciation of exemplary contribution in the field of conservation of biodiversity, ecology and environment’.

In turn, the python was also rescued and returned to its habitat. Ravi had just returned from Bengaluru and at 8 am, when he heard his dog crying in pain. He rushed out to see a huge python coiled around the dog, which was trying to swallow it. Without wasting time, he rushed to save the dog. Shetty told TOI, “My immediate concern was to save the dog which we are all attached to. It was definitely not an easy job as the snake was at least 20 feet in length and weighed about 50kg,” he said. It took about 80 minutes to save the dog and to also rescue the snake, as the area is frequented by children and villagers. “I reached out to my friend Rajeeva S Gowda from the forest department for help. Locals were hesitant in intervening, after seeing the size of the snake,” he said. The snake was rescued and released near a nearby reserve forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/activist-saves-his-dog-from-20ft-python/articleshow/78412999.cms||---
October 1, 2020||Ranchi||Government declares Ranchi district smoking-free||RANCHI: The Ranchi district on Wednesday was declared smoking-free following a survey conducted by the government on the compliance of Section 4 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA) which prohibits smoking in public places. According to the survey, Ranchi has scored more than 82% on all five parameters, making it eligible to qualify for a smoking-free district.

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan said, “This is an important day for Ranchi as we have done well on all the five parameters to qualify as a smoking-free district. However, we need to continue our efforts in order to make Ranchi a tobacco-free district. Our district as well as block-level task force will continue with their inspection to ensure that other sections of COTPA are complied with.” The survey was conducted across five blocks, which constitute 30% area of entire district. A total of 235 public places, 74 educational institutions and 207 point of sales were covered as part of the survey and the compliance level was found to be around 90.5%.

October 1, 2020||Ranchi||Soren OKs Rs 2,000 crore for first phase of farm loan waivers||RANCHI: Keeping up to its poll promise, the state government is finalising modalities to initiate farm loan waivers in Jharkhand after chief minister Hemant Soren approved Rs 2,000 crore for the first phase of the scheme. The approval came two days ago, informed state agriculture minister Badal Patralekh on Wednesday. “We are setting up a high-powered committee to chalk out the modalities for the formal rollout. Despite facing economic crisis during the pandemic, we had made up our mind to ease farmers. The disbursement will begin soon,” Patralekh told TOI over phone. The plan to rollout farm loan waivers comes in the backdrop of high-pitched protests in the state against the farm law passed by the Union government. Patralekh said, “While the Centre is strategically working to privatise farming to push farmers to the edge, states like Jharkhand where Congress is in power, are committed to safeguard farmers.” Giving out details, the minister said during the erstwhile BJP regime between 2014 and 2019, around 8 lakh farmers had taken a total of Rs 7,061 crore loan. “In the first phase, around 7 lakh farmers will benefit from the Rs 2,000 crore waiver. The committee, headed by me, will decide on the amount of waiver per farmer,” Patralekh said. He said the entire budgetary allocation has been done out of state resources. “Despite numerous pleas to the Centre to clear our pending dues ranging from GST to mines and others, we are being ignored by NDA government. But we were committed to fulfil our promises and thus arranged the initial respite from the state’s exchequer,” Patralekh said. The minister is also set off for his two-day tour to Palamu from October 1 against the Centre’s farm law as a part of Congress’s statewide campaign. Congress spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo said, “On the first day of the tour, Patralekh will interact with party workers and farmers of Garhwa and Latehar to sensitise them against the provisions of the law and on the second day, he will hold meetings in Daltonganj.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/soren-oks-rs-2k-cr-for-first-phase-of-farm-loan-waivers/articleshow/78414529.cms||---

It also agreed to simplify the process by allowing online applications without additional documents, which can be submitted separately later. The demand was raised by the Right to Food Campaign in Jharkhand which brought to the notice of the department that due to complexities in the online filing of applications, poor people in rural Jharkhand have not been able to apply within the stipulated time, which was fixed at September 30 earlier.

The activists pointed out that not a single application was received from 16 of the 24 districts and even from the remaining districts only a few applications were filed.” “The delegation pointed out that the online applications require submission of scanned copies of documents that many poor people do not have, such as caste certificates (for ST/ST) and death certificates of husband (for widows),” Herenj said. The green ration card is meant for food security under Jharkhand state food security scheme (JSFSS) announced to be launched on occasion of state foundation day on November 15. Under the scheme, 15 lakh people are supposed to be given 5kg foodgrain monthly at a nominal rate of Re 1 per kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/last-date-to-apply-for-green-ration-cards-online-extended/articleshow/78414369.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
