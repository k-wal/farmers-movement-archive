October 8, 2020||Goa||Not worried about added pressure and scrutiny: Ishan Pandita||PANAJI: Ishan Pandita has more than just a point to prove this season. For every report that claims he is a successor to Sunil Chhetri and questions why national coach Igor Stimac hasn’t yet had a look at him, there are others who wonder why he is getting so much attention when not many have even seen him play. For six years, the 22-year-old has been plying his trade in the lower-tiers of Spanish football, first in the youth leagues and then in Tercera, the fourth-tier of Spanish football. Not much is known of the Bengaluru-based striker, but his move to FC Goa means he will be under the microscope, more than ever. “I have seen the stuff that that people are writing. I do feel there will be added pressure, but I am not worried about that. I am just coming here to do my best and hopefully perform to my top level. “For sure, there will be scrutiny 24X7 and I know that everything that has been written about me will make it even harder this year. I am ready for that. I am here to perform,” Ishan told TOI during an online interaction on Wednesday. The striker appeared confident about making a mark this season and silencing critics, but his place in the starting 11 is far from assured. He first has to compete with the likes of Igor Angulo and Jorge Ortiz for the striking spot, and if he chooses to play on the wings, there are established players like Brandon Fernandes, Redeem Tlang, Seiminlen Doungel and Makan Chothe. Ishan, though, is up for the challenge. “I can play on the wings as well, if the coach wants. Depends on the formation the coach is planning. I am an attacking player and I know I have big competition out there. I am here to compete. I have always been competing,” said Ishan, the first Indian player to sign a professional contract with a Spanish first division side. Such an approach will be welcome news for FC Goa, who decided to bet on the unknown youngster after speaking with their contacts in Spain. Most said it’s worth giving him a try, while the player himself had no hesitation in signing on the dotted line, despite interest from elsewhere. “Goa is the best place to play football in India. The coach had a word with me too, besides FC Goa will be playing in the AFC Champions League. This seemed like the perfect place on my return (to India),” said Ishan. It’s also true that nobody chased Ishan as hard as FC Goa. Coach Juan Ferrando spoke to him personally, then joined a conference call alongside director of football Ravi Puskur. When everything was on track, the coach took time out to have breakfast with the youngster in Barcelona. Then there was the ‘Spanish’ connection. With FC Goa signing five Spaniards, Ishan believes it will be easy to put in practice what he has learnt in the land of tiki taka “I’ve learnt everything the hard way. I had a very tough period between my season in Leganese to when I went to Nastic (Terragona). That was a period when I was injured, finding it very hard to get back to full fitness. Mentally, I was frustrated. “When I went to Leganes (then playing in Segunda, the second-tier) expectations had skyrocketed. I got hurt and then just disappeared for a while. It was tough. I couldn’t get myself together,” said Ishan. At Nastic Terragona, he just didn’t get along with the coach. Being a foreign player, things were even harder. Then last season, Lorca FC happened. It was here that a turnaround was sparked, thanks to coach Walter Pandiani. “I thank him so much. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be sitting here. He changed me as a player and person. He treated me like his son. He’s a striker, legend in Spain. We would go after training; just him, me and the goalkeeper, practicing finishing on our own. He taught me a few things,” said Ishan. Now is the best time to show what he has learnt all these years in Spain, and more particularly under the tutelage of Pandiani, a legend at Espanyol and Deportivo La Coruna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-worried-about-added-pressure-and-scrutiny-ishan-pandita/articleshow/78541431.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Modi, who turned 70 last month, started as a volunteer of the RSS and then served in the BJP's organisation for many years before the party leadership sent him to Gujarat, his home state, as its chief minister in 2001. Since then, he has never tasted electoral defeat and led the BJP to power in the state three straight times before steering the party to its biggest, until then, Lok Sabha poll win in 2014 and then scripting an even bigger win in the 2019 general elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/welfare-of-nation-poor-is-paramount-for-me-and-will-always-be-so-modi/articleshow/78541815.cms||---

Trump has attacked the former vice president for his prior support of liberalizing trade deals that facilitated the offshoring of jobs. Biden has chosen the state where he was born to deliver some of his most forceful speeches of the campaign, including a late August address in which he condemned Trump for fomenting violence at nationwide protests over racial equality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-presidential-elections/battleground-states/pennsylvania/articleshow/78542863.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Mumbai||Destigmatising dining-out and restoring customer confidence will take time say restaurant owners||When Uddhav Thackeray, the chief minister of Maharashtra, announced the reopening of over four lakh restaurants, bars and hotels in the state, the hospitality industry that had been reeling under the impact of the global pandemic finally heaved a sigh of relief. This sector was hit the hardest in the last six months. Maharashtra is the last state to allow restaurantsRiyaz Amlani who has multiple millennial-friendly F&B restaurants and bars across the city including Social, antiSOCIAL, Smoke House Deli, Flea Bazaar Café, Ishara, Salt Water Café and others welcomes the move, saying, “Maharashtra is the last state to allow restaurants to resume their services.” The restaurant and bar owners are a little apprehensive with Maharshtra’s Principal Secretary of State Excise, Valsa Nair-Singh, announcing on Monday evening that the operating hours for restaurants and bars in the city would be from 8am to 10pm. Riyaz says, “With 33 per cent occupancy and the 10 pm shut down timings of restaurants that open up, will go from the frying pan into the fire, financially speaking. It will take a month or so to destigmatise dining-out and restore customer confidence.” Restaurants reopen with restricted capacityThe city bars and eateries’ dine-in functioning have been allowed at 33 per cent of their seating capacity while other districts in Maharashtra have been allowed 50 per cent. Adding to this, is the acute shortage of workforce (most went back to hometowns during the lockdown), the first few months are expected to be a little slow. According to officials, that’s why not more than 4,000 restaurants actually reopened out of the 15,000 dine-in places in the city. Anjan Chatterjee who has around 48 outlets (including standalones and mall outlets) of Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta, Episode, Sweet Bengal and others across the city, says, “The beginning was slow and we had around eight to 12 covers. We have seen a trickling down of people at our outlets across the city in the last few days. Only restaurant standalones have been given the go-ahead till 10 pm, but the malls are still only open till 7 pm. We haven’t opened the mall outlets.” However, Dietmar Kielnhofer, General Manager, JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar, says, "In terms of the number of pax a restaurant can take as per govt guidelines and after social distancing norms the hotel has seen a healthy pickup of restaurant reservations." Big brands have more hope of seeing footfallsOwners of small eateries say that the government rules now are too stringent and the distance between tables is not possible for small places so they are going to remain shut but will keep deliveries on. Anjan says, “I believe that the larger restaurants will have a better footfall. Safety protocols will be maintained easily, because all our restaurants are over 150 covers so the social distancing will be followed strictly. I feel that people’s confidence in dining-out during this time, is also directly proportional to the brands. They look up to the restaurants which are safe and have been following all hygienic conditions even earlier on, during the pre-COVID times.” Home deliveries remain popularA section of the food industry had been fully- functional under the phased unlock through home deliveries. But the announcement to reopen restaurants meant much to people who have been home, and working from home for a long time. “In the last one-two months, we did order food at home, via food delivery apps, but restaurants and actual dine-in opening once more, is an experience, and something we have been looking forward to. My friends and I had wanted to meet for dinner and we finally did,” says Siddharth Singh, a final year media student. Vandana Joshi, an IT professional adds, “I went out with my partner on Monday evening and we strictly followed all safety rules. The restaurant had marked seating places in adherence to social distancing norms. We wore our masks, except when at the table, and used sanitisers too.” Sumit Gambhir from the Woodside Inn (Colaba, Andheri and Bandra) and The Pantry (Colaba) says, “All our four outlets have been delivering all this time and the demand is still on. We have been maintaining all government guidelines and protocols. These new norms of reopening have been shared with the restaurant industry after long thinking and when we open up, we will follow the one-third rule and we will have around 20 cover at all times and we will be blocking tables in between to stick to social distancing.” Anjan adds, “Home deliveries of all our restaurants have been the maximum during this period of last few months. I feel that is because people have trust and faith in brands.” Restaurateurs ready to wait and watch as they hope for the bestRestauranter Irfan Pabaney, country head of the chain SodaBottleOpenerWala, the BKC outlet of which opened yesterday on Wednesday, Oct 7, says, “We’re super excited to be reopening. The challenges we’re facing this time are ones we’ve never seen before. We are excited but a little apprehensive at the same time.” Anjan adds, “It is too early to gauge how it will be in future. Even in other cities it took around 10 -15 days for people to know that that we have opened and they start coming in, and confidence building happens when they see that the kind of measures that are being followed by us and what we are doing. It is too early to say much. Patience is the game and you need to wait and watch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/destigmatising-dining-out-and-restoring-customer-confidence-will-take-time-say-restaurant-owners/articleshow/78543029.cms||Debarati S Sen
October 8, 2020||India||ED turns up heat on Kerala CM with chargesheet in gold case||KOCHI: The primary chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday on the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case said prime accused Swapna Suresh met M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, several times in the presence of the chief minister and that the CM was in the know that she had been hired by Space Park, a state government agency. The chargesheet was submitted at the special court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cases in Ernakulam. In her statement recorded on August 8, 2020, Swapna said she met Sivasankar eight times officially and many times unofficially. "She met Sivasankar five to six times in the presence of the chief minister of Kerala. The CM knew her as secretary to the consul general. She joined Space Park in November 2019," the chargesheet said. Swapna reportedly told ED that she was selected at Space Park as "she was close to Sivasankar and trustworthy and reliable and her appointment was in the knowledge of the CM of Kerala." The 303-page chargesheet, accessed by TOI, includes 23 pages of the agency's findings besides 19 sets of documents as evidence. Sivasankar had asked her to meet KSITTL MD Dr Jayasankar and special officer Santosh in person to discuss her role and responsibilities in Space Park. "Sivasankar told her that he will discuss the matter with the CM and do the needful. Thereafter, she got a call from Santosh asking her to join," the chargesheet said. The chargesheet also shed light on dealings behind the Life Mission project. "She (Swapna) told Santosh Eappen of Unitac Builders to meet Sivasankar, IAS, through whom he can get connected to the CEO, Life Mission and get the necessary approval...accordingly, they met Sivasankar and got the approval," it said. As per Swapna's statement, she was given Rs 1.08 crore to facilitate the award of contract. "It was decided that three million UAE dirhams would go to the Consul General, Khalid (head of finance at UAE Consulate) and herself and from the rest of the amount, 6% would be shared among Sandeep, Sarith (two others accused in the case) and herself," the chargesheet said. The chargesheet sought permission to continue investigation and file supplementary chargesheet. The primary chargesheet has been filed after the requisite period of 60 days but the ED on Wednesday opposed Swapna's bail plea. The court will hear both the sides on Friday and decide on the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-turns-up-heat-on-kerala-cm-with-chargesheet-in-gold-case/articleshow/78544317.cms||---
October 8, 2020||India||I-T dept ‘attaches benami assets’ of Sasikala & her kin||CHENNAI: The Income Tax Department has provisionally attached about 11 acres of land owned by VN Sudhakaran, the nephew of late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's close aide VK Sasikala, in Siruthavoor village near Chennai under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act. The department also reportedly attached the properties of Sasikala and her relatives in Kodanad near Ooty. I-T officials declined to comment when contacted for confirming the development. In the order provisionally attaching the 11 acre 53 cents land owned by Sudhakaran, the I-T department has said the action is being taken to prevent him from transferring the property to another person. As per the provisional attachment order, Sudhakaran is restrained from transferring or charging the properties until further orders. Sasikala, Sudhakaran and another of her relatives Illavarasi are in jail after being convicted in a corruption case. A copy of the provisional order attaching Sudhakaran's property in Siruthavoor has been sent to Jayalalihtaa's nephew and niece. In August, the I-T Department is said to have attached 65 properties of Sasikala and her associates. In 2017, the I-T Department had raided 187 properties said to be linked to Sasikala and her relatives and unearthed alleged tax evasion of about Rs 1,430 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/i-t-dept-attaches-benami-assets-of-sasikala-her-kin/articleshow/78544348.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Pandemic inspires Kolkata's magicians, jugglers to reinvent their acts||Sandip Chatterjee is no less than a superhero to his little fans these days. As the magician tries to capture the novel coronavirus with his magic wand, children look at him in awe. Sandip has done about eight shows since April and all of them turned out to be hits, courtesy his new coronavirus trick. When quizzed about this special act, he revealed, “Once on stage, I try to capture six viruses with my wand and magnify them with my spells. Kids enjoy this part the most. At this point, the viruses look like golf balls. I put them in a bag, labelled ‘immunity boosters’. At the end of the act, the viruses vanish. This trick signifies that the coronavirus cannot live in a body with strong immunity.” Sandip is not alone. Other city-based jugglers and clowns are also coming up with interesting acts inspired by the pandemic to woo their audience. A grand comeback, good reviews Like many other artistes, the lockdown has not been kind to these performers either. While senior artistes had the option to earn money via online classes, juniors kept struggling for their bread and butter. Talking about his experience, magician Soumya Basu said, “From June onwards, people started enquiring about us, but there were hardly any events. So, performers like us are now planning a grand comeback with something special. People usually watch our shows to forget about their daily worries, but for some reason the COVID-themed acts are doing pretty well. I’ve performed these acts on my online shows and received good feedback.” At a time when special effects and visual effects are ruling the roost, magic and juggling acts are struggling to hold the interest of children. “Therefore, it becomes all the more important to introduce new acts. People love having current topics in magic shows,” said Shyamal Kumar, a senior magician. Covid acts a hit at Birthday parties too Kids are happy that magic shows and similar interesting programmes are back at birthday parties. But there too, the acts revolve around masks and sanitisers. Shyamal has come up with a gala corona-themed entry where he and his assistant appear on stage with two pieces of paper, without wearing masks. The assistant sets the paper on fire, as Shyamal holds them. Next, you can see two masks emerging from the ashes. “I start the show only after wearing the mask,” said Shyamal, who has been working on more such tricks. Santu Jana, a professional juggler and clown, didn’t get much work during the lockdown. “But now, I’ve started showcasing my new juggling trick using sanitiser bottles. If I can juggle with pins, I can do that with bottles too,” he said. Sanjit Sarkar, who performs as a clown at parties and social events, has also appeared as the coronavirus at shows organised by corporates and NGOs since June. “Everyone seems to enjoy acts based on what’s happening around us. It’s more fun when it’s realistic,” he said. Creating social awareness Performing coronavirus-based acts at shows has another advantage. As these artistes mostly perform for children, creating awareness on social issues is a big part of their job, the reason why various schools hire them. Now, these artistes are planning their shows on themes like hygiene and social distancing as well. Sandip’s talking doll, Sharma Ji, garnered appreciation at two shows by talking about his hospital experience after he got infected by COVID-19. “More than children, their parents love these acts. The fact that their children are learning something worthwhile appeals to them,” Soumya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pandemic-inspires-kolkatas-magicians-jugglers-to-reinvent-their-acts/articleshow/78542097.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra
October 8, 2020||India||China’s ‘gross aggression’ led to LAC clash: US||WASHINGTON: Referring to the Galwan valley clash between Indian and Chinese troops, US State Department on Tuesday (local time) said the recent incident where troops of both sides “beat each other to death” is a result of China’s sudden turn towards “gross aggression” in its entire periphery. Addressing a press meet on Mike Pompeo’s Tokyo visit, a State Department official compared the past conflicts between India and China with the current stand-off. A State Department official said the conflicts “in the Himalayas between China and India” has been “something that has been in the past handled according to unspoken or unwritten rules in the past to prevent these things from getting out of control”. However, the official said, the driving force behind the current Ladakh conflict is the sudden turn toward gross aggression by the Chinese government in its entire periphery. Speaking about Pompeo’s opening remarks at the Quad foreign ministers meeting, another State Department official said that the state secretary has framed his discussion during the meeting with foreign ministers of India, Japan and Australia around the free world versus Chinese authoritarianism and there was a lot of agreement “around that table”. Pompeo has denounced China’s “exploitation, corruption, and coercion” as he participated in a meeting in Tokyo of the Quad grouping of nations — the United States, Japan, India, and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chinas-gross-aggression-led-to-lac-clash-us/articleshow/78544379.cms||---
October 8, 2020||India||Kerala 4th state to record over 10,000 Covid cases in a day||Kerala became the fourth state in the country after Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to record over 10,000 Covid-19 cases in a day even as the countrywide daily tally, in keeping with the trend of the infection slowing down, remained below the 80,000-mark for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday. Kerala as well as Karnataka recorded their highest peak in daily cases even as the number of infections in all other states, barring Bengal, was lower than their respective peaks. Kerala recorded 10,606 fresh cases, a huge jump of over 1,300 cases from the previous peak on October 2 when 9,258 patients had tested positive. Kerala ranks third in the country in active cases — 92,246 — after Maharashtra and Karnataka. Karnataka was close to the 11,000 mark with 10,947 infections on Wednesday, a jump by nearly 500 cases from the previous peak of 10,453 on September 29. This is for the fourth time in the last nine days that Karnataka has crossed 10,000 infections. However, even as the two southern states see a surge, the trend of the infection slowing down in the country, at least for the time being, continues with active cases nationally dropping for the sixth consecutive day. The active cases on Wednesday stood at 9,10,851, a drop of nearly 45,000 infections from the previous peak of 9,55,400 on October 1. As per the data collated from states, 78,912 patients tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, higher than the previous day’s figure of 72,552, but much lower than the country’s peak in daily cases since the onset of the pandemic, which was recorded on September 17 at 98,795. For the fifth straight day, India recorded less than 1,000 fatalities as 974 deaths on Wednesday took the cumulative toll to 1,05,490. The total caseload of the country stands at 68,32,963 while 58,16,622 people have recovered from the virus. Apart from Kerala and Karnataka, Bengal recorded its highest daily peak with 3,455 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-4th-state-to-record-over-10000-covid-cases-in-a-day/articleshow/78544467.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Business||Sensex hits 7-mth high on stimulus, loan ruling hopes||TNN Mumbai: With a 304-point gain, sensex closed at 39,879 points on Wednesday — an over seven-month high — as Reliance Industries, IT and financial stocks gained despite a last-minute sell-off in the US on Tuesday night. The sensex has gained over 3,300 points or 9% since its recent closing low of 36,554 on September 24. These gains have come on the back of stimulus hopes in India and expectations of a favourable Supreme Court order on how bank customers will pay interest on loans for the six-month moratorium period. In the last few weeks, software stocks have rallied on hopes that the worst phase for these companies in terms of business downturn due to the pandemic is over. The upturn was led by the industry leaders like TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Financial and banking stocks have rallied on expectations of a positive judgment from the apex court. Reliance has been notching up gains on the back of it offloading stakes in its retail arm, market players said. On Wednesday, RIL, HDFC Bank, Infosys and HDFC contributed over 80% of the sensex’s gains. BSE data showed that on Wednesday, foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 1,094 crore while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,129 crore. For Thursday, the buyback-related announcements by TCS and Wipro are expected to keep the sentiment positive. On the back of these announcements, Market players are expecting a similar decision by Infosys, which led to a 4% jump in its ADRs (American depositary receipts) on Nasdaq on Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-hits-7-mth-high-on-stimulus-loan-ruling-hopes/articleshow/78543464.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Rajkot||Youth commits suicide, three booked||Rajkot: Three persons were booked on Tuesday night for the abetment to suicide of a 22-year-old youth in Ashirvad Square Apartment at Satellite Chowk on Morbi Road in Rajkot on Monday evening. The accused were allegedly forcing the victim to divorce his wife whom he had married after eloping with her. Police said the victim, Harsh Karelia, hanged himself from the ceiling fan of the room of his flat. The police booked Parth Ramani, his uncles — Shailesh Ramani and Munna Patel — on the complaint of Harsh’s father Rajesh Karelia (50). In his complaint, Karelia said that Harsh was in love with Manasi Ramani. However, Manasi’s family members were opposed to her relationship with Harsh, as he belonged to a different caste. According to the police, Harsh and Manasi had eloped on March 6 and had got married. After returning home, Manasi informed her family members about the marriage. However, as Manasi's family members were still against the relationship, the couple again eloped on September 22. The couple went to Junagadh. Manasi's family members also went after them. After convincing the couple that they would be married off in two months, they brought Manasi home. “However, the accused reneged on their promise and started harassing Harsh, asking him to divorce Manasi. They would waylay him on his way to his shop. Harsh used to run a furniture shop. The accused would threaten Harsh with dire consequences and even threaten to kill him, if he did not divorce Manasi. Tired of this, Harsh decided to end his life,” said H M Jadeja, sub-inspector with the Rajkot B Division Police Station. Meanwhile, the police have launched a manhunt for the accused who went absconding after the complaint was lodged against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/youth-commits-suicide-three-booked/articleshow/78541342.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Patna||Bihar: BJP under ‘pressure’ to clear ‘confusion’ over LJP||PATNA: BJP may be under pressure to ward off the negative impact that the LJP led by Chirag Paswan seemingly poses to the prospects of NDA partners in the assembly election by fielding its candidates in 143 seats. The BJP leadership is looking for ways to dispel the confusion in the party’s rank and file and among its supporters at the grassroots level that the party is not in cahoots with LJP, observers felt. No wonder for the second day in a row, the BJP brass reiterated on Wednesday that the NDA will fight the assembly election under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar. The BJP’s concern is also to send out a concrete signal that it is not playing softly on the “designs” of LJP to smaller NDA “associates” the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by Mukesh Sahani. In tune with the same, the party’s state president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal even threatened to lodge FIR against any party outside the NDA that uses the photographs of PM Narendra Modi as publicity material in their campaign. The intriguing part is that they are not naming LJP, and nor have they indicated that the BJP central leadership might drop Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan from the Union cabinet. “The problem for BJP is if they do that it might boomerang. The move might make a hero out of Chirag who is managing the party’s affairs for the first time in the absence of Paswan senior,” a source said. Even the state JD(U) appeared to be aware of the reigning confusion down to a grassroots level as a fallout of the destructive design of Chirag against Nitish. “What Fadnavis and other senior BJP leaders said on Wednesday gives the confidence that they are trying to dispel all the confusions that have been created,” state JD (U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said. “Unlike the NDA, they (GA) have more order and less of confusions on their side,” a JD(U) source said. However, the state BJP’s problem has been compounded by the fact that its present and past office-bearers have begun to quit the party, and are joining the LJP to contest the polls on its ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-under-pressure-to-clear-confusion-over-ljp/articleshow/78545891.cms||Abhay Singh

October 8, 2020||Patna||Tejashwi Prasad Yadav demands CBI probe into Purnia murder case||PATNA: The killing of Mahadalit leader Shakti Kumar Mallik in Purnia town took a new turn on Wednesday when leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav urged chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar to recommend a CBI probe into the incident. Mallik, the expelled state general secretary of the RJD’s SC cell, was shot dead by three armed criminals inside his residence in Purnia’s posh locality on Sunday. His second wife, Khushbu Devi, lodged an FIR with K-Haat police station against six people, including Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and his brother Tej Pratap. Tejashwi wrote a letter to the CM on Wednesday, urging him to recommend the case for CBI investigation. “I am ready to face investigation by any national or international investigating agency so that justice is delivered to the family of the deceased,” his letter read. The RJD’s CM candidate said he was in favour of a speedy investigation into the case in which he along with Tej Pratap have been named as accused. “I hope the law will take its own course. The investigating agency may quiz me before filing my nomination papers for the election,” the letter stated. Tejashwi also slammed the leaders of the ruling JD (U) for making unsavoury remarks against him and his elder brother, despite having no substantial evidence against them. He said he could not react to the incident immediately due to his hectic schedule in the wake of the upcoming assembly polls. A senior police officer associated with the investigation told this newspaper, “Khushbu, a native of Naugachhia in Bhagalpur district, had married Mallik in 2016 against the wishes of her family. The couple has two kids. Mallik’s first wife had left home a few years ago and her whereabouts are not known.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-demands-cbi-probe-into-murder-case/articleshow/78545786.cms||Ramashankar
October 8, 2020||Patna||Gaya: Jitan Ram Manjhi files nomination||GAYA: Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi filed his nomination from Imamganj assembly segment on Wednesday. The segment is likely to witness a close contest between Manjhi and former assembly speaker Uday Narayan Chaudhary, who is the RJD candidate from Imamganj. In 2015, Chaudhary had contested as JD(U) candidate and lost by 29,408 votes from Manjhi, who had then polled 79,389 votes. Chaudhary had represented Imamganj seat on five occasions in 1990, 2000, February 2005, October 2005 and in 2010 but he is contesting for the first time as RJD candidate. He had filed his nomination on Tuesday. After filing his nomination on Wednesday Manjhi said, “HAM (S) will win all the seven seats to be contested by our candidates. After the election, NDA will form government in the state. Before 2015, Imamganj was known only crime like murder and caste violence. Innocent people were implicated in false cases. After I won the seat in 2015, I managed to check the menace. Hence people are keen to give me another chance for peace and development in the area.” Chaudhary on the other hand said, “I am committed towards development of the people. Earlier also I have done a lot for them. I will make every effort to ensure justice, education and health for all.” Although Imamganj is in Gaya district, it falls in Aurangabad parliamentary constituency which has 2,66,879 voters. This includes 1,40,572 male and 1,26,298 female electorates. It is a Maoist-hit area where the Reds have made their presence felt on many occasions and had given poll boycott calls. A social activist Upendra Prasad Verma from Raniganj said, “Lack of irrigation facility remains the biggest problem in the area. This problem needs attention of the local public representatives and the government for proper development of the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-files-nomination/articleshow/78541236.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Patna||Gaya deputy mayor to face old BJP warhorse Prem||GAYA: It is going to be a direct fight between Prem Kumar of BJP and Congress candidate Akhauri Onkarnath alias Mohan Shrivastava in the Gaya Town assembly constituency, which will go to the polls on October 28. Also in the fray are Randheer Kesri of Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) and Anuj Kumar Sinha as independent candidate. Mohan had earlier contested against Prem from Gaya Town on two occasions and lost. In 2010, he finished third with 7,664 votes polled in his favour as a Congress candidate against 55,618 bagged by Prem. In February 2005, Mohan contested as an independent candidate and finished fifth with 5456 votes against 42,967 in favour of Prem. Mohan has been deputy mayor of Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) since 2007. On the other hand, Prem has won the Gaya Town seat for seven consecutive terms since 1990. The state agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries minister, had also been the minister of urban development, public works department (PWD) and the public health and engineering department (PHED) in the Nitish Kumar government in the past. Congress has won this seat in 1951, 1957, 1972, 1980 and 1984. Only in 1977, Sushila Sahay won the seat on the Janata Party ticket. In 1967 and 1969, the erstwhile Jansangh had represented the constituency in the state legislative assembly. Gaya is the city of religious and historical importance due to the Vishnupad temple where pilgrims from across the country and abroad visit throughout the year. During Pitrapaksha, thousands of people visit the town to perform pind-daan rituals for their ancestors. The electorates demand that the amenities for the pilgrims need to be upgraded in a systematic manner. During every election, the spotlight turns towards amenities in Gaya town compared to other pilgrim city. The long pending demand of Gayapal pandas to accord state fair status to the annual Pitrapaksha Mela was fulfilled in 2000 when Jitan Ram Manjhi became the state chief minister. A senior member of Gayapal panda Samaj, Mahesh Guput, said, “Permanent arrangement should be made for the pilgrims arriving here. Every year during Pitrapaksha, extra effort is made to ensure cleanliness, power and water supply and traffic arrangements. Why not there should be a systematic arrangement throughout the year. It will present a good picture of the town among the pilgrims, who will return with a positive image of the city.” Kiran Agarwal, who resides near Kotwali police station, said: “Since long, encroachment and traffic congestion have been big problems for the people here. The roads in main market area are wide but very narrow space is left for the commuters due to footpath vendors. A comprehensive plan is needed to rehabilitate the footpath vendors in a respectable manner to free the roads from encroachment,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-deputy-mayor-to-face-old-bjp-warhorse-prem/articleshow/78541260.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Patna||SC grants bail to IAS officer in BSSC job scam case||PATNA: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted regular bail to senior IAS officer Sudhir Kumar, who had been languishing in jail for almost three years and seven months in the Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) job scam case. Kumar is one of the prime accused in the case which had rocked the state in February 2017. He was posted as the commission’s chairman when the scam surfaced. An FIR was later lodged with Agamkuan police station in Patna after police allegedly recovered admit cards and other documents from the residence of the then BSSC secretary, Parmeshwar Ram. The full bench of Justices NV Ramana, Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, while granting regular bail to Kumar, put conditions that he would not interfere in the trial process or try to influence witnesses. The apex court also took into consideration the petitioner’s plea that he had been in judicial custody for the last three years and seven months and the state government’s submission that investigation was over, the chargesheet had been filed and there was no possibility of completing the trial in near future. The apex court also observed that the state government would be at liberty to approach it for the cancellation of Kumar’s bail if he failed to comply with the conditions. Kumar had moved the high court at least twice and even the Supreme Court once in the past for regular bail. The Patna high court had rejected his last bail plea on June 22 this year, following which he moved the apex court again and finally got bail on Tuesday. Kumar is a 1987 batch Bihar cadre IAS officer and of principal secretary rank. His retirement is due on February 22, 2022.

The entire examination process was scrapped on the direction of CM Nitish Kumar after the scam surfaced. Kumar is also accused of getting question papers published from a Gujarat based printer Vinit Kumar without entering into any agreement with the firm. Altogether 41 persons are accused in the scam of which 17 have been released on bail till now. Five separate chargesheets have been submitted by the police in the case and the process of framing charges is on for initiate trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sc-grants-bail-to-ias-officer-in-bssc-job-scam-case/articleshow/78540796.cms||Debashish Karmakar
October 8, 2020||Business||Central Bank to consider follow-on public offer||MUMBAI: Central Bank of India is looking at ways to improve the liquidity of the bank’s stock, which has fallen below 10%. The bank’s qualified institutional placement (QIP) raised half of what it sought as stock liquidity and was seen as one of the issues for large investors. The bank had floated a QIP last week under which it managed to raise only Rs 255 crore. In August, the bank obtained approval from shareholders to raise up to Rs 5,000 crore by way of the public offer, rights issue, and QIP. “The QIP was open for private placement for two days, but it was subscribed only 50%. We did not seek investment from foreign investment process as a separate approval process was required for FIIs and we decided to test the waters,” said Central Bank of India MD & CEO Pallav Mohapatra. He said that one feedback that the bank had received was that a public issue would have a better response. He added that one of the reasons for the lack of interest among institutions was that the float available in the bank’s stock is very small, given that the government and LIC holding is over 90%. “Unless the trading volume increases, the price discovery does not take place,” said Mohapatra. “We needed Rs 200-250 crore as growth capital because we do not expect a significant capital requirement. We have enough headroom to lend to MSMEs under the government guarantee scheme, which does not require any capital. In addition, we are growing our gold loan portfolio where there is zero risk weightage,” said Mohapatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/central-bank-to-consider-follow-on-public-offer/articleshow/78543437.cms||Mayur Shetty

October 8, 2020||Allahabad||Migrants, SHGs join hands to set up readymade garment unit in Prayagraj village||PRAYAGRAJ: Around two dozen women associated with 10 self help groups (SHGs) and migrant workers from Mumbai who had to return home due to the lockdown have set up a readymade garment production unit after investing Rs 10 lakh in Parsara village, under Jasra block, in Prayagraj district under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM). The women associated with the SHGs have also installed sewing machines imported from Taiwan, that cost around Rs 7 lakh. The migrants who had earlier worked as tailors and supervisors in Maharashtra’s cloth mills and garment factories have joined hands with SHGs. The migrants said that they won’t be returning to Mumbai even when the situation gets back to normal. District mission manager (NRLM) Sharad Kumar Singh said, “The readymade garment production unit is being run by around 20 women and a group of migrants from Mumbai. This is the first time when women associated with SHGs have taken loans from the community investment fund (CIF) for a readymade garment production unit in a rural area.” “The SHG members are using these migrants’ experience about tailoring and technical knowledge about production units to understand the tricks of the trade,” said one of the women volunteering at the unit. Block mission manager (NRLM) Vedprakash Dwivedi said that the group initially started with sewing readymade clothes for youngsters and adults. “The unit has received orders for readymade garments from different parts of Prayagraj and other districts.” “We feel happy to have found work at a readymade garment working unit in our own village. As the unit scales up production, we would be getting more work and earning more,” said Rakesh, one of the migrants working at the unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/migrants-shgs-join-hands-to-set-up-readymade-garment-unit-in-prayagraj-village/articleshow/78541983.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Patna||It’s a family fight in Sandesh and Shahpur||PATNA: The state assembly election has turned into a virtual battleground for some members of the same families in Bhojpur district. While RJD’s Kiran Devi is pitted against her own ‘jeth’ (husband’s elder brother) and JD(U) candidate Vijendra Kumar Yadav in Sandesh, BJP’s official nominee Munni Devi is facing her ‘jethani’ (husband’s elder brother’s wife) Shobha Devi as an independent candidate in Shahpur. Kiran filed her papers on Tuesday and Vijendra on Wednesday. “Munni Devi will file her nomination papers on Thursday,” BJP’s Bhojpur district president Prem Ranjan Chaturvedi told TOI on Wednesday. Shobha has already filed her papers. Vijendra had represented Sandesh on RJD ticket in the 2000 and November 2005 assembly polls, but lost to BJP’s Sanjay Singh Tiger in 2010. In 2015, Vijendra’s younger brother Arun Kumar won the seat on RJD symbol against BJP’s Tiger. But Arun was made an accused in a rape case in 2019. As per the police investigation, the minor girl was allegedly raped by the RJD MLA in Patna. He is still evading arrest while police have already filed chargesheet against him in the court. In such a situation, RJD fielded Arun’s wife. Vijendra, the RJD state vice-president, switched over to JD(U) after getting hints that his party would field Arun’s wife in the coming assembly. The JD(U) leadership fulfilled the promise and fielded him from Sandesh against his own younger brother’s wife. “I am sure of my victory. JD(U) is far ahead of RJD in Sandesh,” Vijendra told TOI over the phone on Wednesday. Similarly, in Shahpur, former MLA Munni Devi would seek votes against her ‘jethani’ Shobha, who is the widow of BJP’s former state vice-president Visheshwar Ojha. Visheshwar was shot dead in a gang war on February 12, 2016 at Sonbarsa Bazar in the Shahpur constituency. Munni is wife of Visheshwar’s younger brother Bhuwar Ojha. In the February 2005 election, Shobha was a JD(U) candidate, but had lost to RJD senior leader Shivanand Tiwari. However, in the November 2005 election, Shahpur seat went to BJP as both Ojha brothers had been evading arrest and the saffron party fielded Munni. She won the 2010 election again. But in the 2015 election, BJP fielded Munni’s ‘jeth’ Visheshwar, leading to a chasm between the two brothers and their families. Though Visheshwar bagged around 54,000 votes for BJP, he lost to RJD’s Rahul Tiwari. The son of Shivanand Tiwari had bagged around 69,000 votes. In the meantime, Visheshwar was gunned down and his widow Shobha staked claim on the BJP ticket, but could not succeed. When BJP on Tuesday declared Munni as its official candidate, Shobha became a rebel and filed her papers as an independent candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/its-a-family-fight-in-sandesh-and-shahpur/articleshow/78551076.cms||Madan Kumar
October 8, 2020||Patna||Bihar: Still part of NDA as ally, says LJP||PATNA: A day after being snubbed by BJP for not accepting the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar, LJP functionaries maintained on Wednesday that they have a principled fight with JD (U) in the Bihar assembly polls and not the saffron party. They also claimed that they are still a part of the NDA at Centre as LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan continues to be the minister in Narendra Modi- government at the Centre. With BJP and JD (U) turncoats joining LJP, the party's national secretary-general Abdul Khalik told TOI on Wednesday that LJP is firm on its stand that the next government in the state will be formed by the BJP-LJP combine under the leadership of BJP. A formal statement declaring the party's stand was issued by LJP president Chirag Paswan on Monday. However, BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday made it clear that those who do not accept the leadership of Nitish are not part of the NDA. But LJP continued to side with BJP along with being critical of Nitish. “Indeed, we are not part of the NDA in Bihar but we are an ally of BJP at the Centre. We also believe that there should be a BJP-led government in Bihar and for that the saffron party should have contested on a higher number of seats,” LJP’s secretary-general Khalik said. He added, “Nevertheless, we are quite sure that we will win enough seats in the elections and form the next government in Bihar under the leadership of BJP.” Asked about the rumours of BJP giving backroom support to LJP for opening a front against JD (U), Khalik said, “It is a completely wrong perception. We are not here to cut anyone to size. BJP is correct in saying that they are nowhere involved in what LJP is doing. We want to expand the party by contesting on more number of seats and formed the next government.” JD (U), on the other hand, maintained that it was never in alliance with LJP. “In 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 Bihar elections, LJP has been fighting against us. We still made senior LJP functionary Pashupati Kumar Paras Ji MLC as well as state minister in 2017. Now they wanted to fight on 143 seats, which would have required a house of over 600 seats (for seat-sharing arrangements),” JD (U) national secretary general KC Tyagi said in New Delhi. In a dig at LJP, Tyagi said, “People have the right to make ambitious comments, we don’t want to respond to it. There are mainly two big players in electoral politics in Bihar from the last 15 years- JD (U) and BJP and, RJD and its allies. Independent candidates and small vote-cutter parties have tried their luck on several occasions but they have mostly remained confined to one or two seats. Nevertheless, BJP has categorically said that those who do not accept the leadership of Nitish Ji, are not part of the NDA and should not use name or photograph of PM Modi.” Asked for a reaction on BJP’s remark on the usage of PM Modi’s photograph or name, LJP’s Khailk said, “We never had any discussion within the party to use the photographs of PM Modi, nor have we done it.” JD(U)’s Tyagi also said the party has not made any demand to BJP for removing Ram Vilas from Modi-government. “Ram Vilas Ji is unwell and we wish for his early recovery. We have not made any negative demand to the BJP for his removal from the Union cabinet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/still-part-of-nda-as-ally-ljp/articleshow/78551086.cms||Piyush Tripathi
October 8, 2020||Patna||Bihar: RJD alleges unfair treatment||PATNA: RJD national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha on Wednesday met state chief electoral officer H R Srinivasa and alleged that the district administrations were not treating his party fairly in terms of putting up hoardings and billboards. “We had taken permission from the Election Commission for putting up hoardings and billboards. But the district administration in Patna and across the state are not allowing us to do so. The opposition was not prepared for the election and now the administration is trying to block our hoardings and campaigns. They are conspiring at various levels,” Jha told the electronic media. When contacted, Jha told TOI that the CEO cited the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1987, as the reason behind not getting permission for putting up hoardings and billboards. This Act may also be called Bihar Prevention of Defacement of Property Act and extends across Bihar and it does not allow writing, marking with ink or paint or any other material on the property, except for indicating the name and address of the owner of property or its occupier. As per this Act, property means building, structure, wall, tree, fence, post, or any other structure. Jha said he had asked the CEO to discuss this matter at Delhi and get it resolved. “In this Covid-19 pandemic, when public gatherings and meetings are not so easy, visual medium will play an important role,” said Jha, adding that the forced administration was challenging the idea of democracy. RJD state general secretary Chitranjan Gagan also hit out at the ruling party for creating troubles in their campaign. He alleged that the district administration was working under the guidance of ruling party leaders and was biased in their favour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-alleges-unfair-treatment/articleshow/78551138.cms||Sheezan Nezami
October 8, 2020||Vadodara||10 booked for A’bad man’s suicide||Vadodara: Ten persons were booked on Wednesday for driving an Ahmedabad-based moneylender to suicide over monetary issues. The man identified as Alpesh Patel (49) was found hanging by the ceiling fan at a hotel in Sayajigunj on Tuesday late evening. The accused were booked for abatement to suicide, extortion and criminal intimidation. Police said that Patel had named — Nagarjun Modhwadia, Bharat Bhutiya, Narendrasinh Vaghela, Meghraj Gohil, Anirudhsinh Vaghela, Mukesh Vaghela, Lalo Vaghela, Lucky Vaghela, Bharatsinh Jodha and Amit Khunt in his suicide note. The deceased had blamed the 10 accused for his death in the suicide note found from the room of Amity Hotel in Sayajigunj. Patel ran a money lending and borrowing firm in partnership with one of the accused Narendrasinh. Patel’s wife Jaya told police that her husband had been quite tensed for over a month as the money lending business was badly hit due to lockdown. When Jaya had prodded her husband to share his worries, Patel had told her that on Narendrasinh’s insistence he had invested some money and that did not yield returns. He had also taken Rs 2.4 crore from those named in the suicide note to lend it further and they had been pressurizing Patel to return the money anyhow. It was also alleged that they threatened Patel of abducting his family members if their money was not returned. To collect money from borrowers, Patel had left for Vapi on September 29. He was in regular touch with his wife through phone calls until Monday. On Tuesday, when Jaya called Patel, he did not answer her calls. Late in the evening, when his son Kush called, cops answered the phone and informed him that Patel was dead. The suicide came to light when the hotel staff knocked on the door and did not get any response. Patel was supposed to check out on Tuesday. The staff later informed police and with the help of firemen, the room was opened. Patel’s family members rushed to Vadodara on Tuesday night. In her statement, Jaya also told cops that on Tuesday afternoon Modhwadia and his men had come to their home to meet Patel, but as he was not present, they threatened to abduct her and their daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/10-booked-for-abad-mans-suicide/articleshow/78541115.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||KMDA earmarks 44 water bodies for Chhath puja||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) identified 44 water bodies where Chhath puja rituals can be performed this year. KMDA announced it after meeting KMC ward coordinators and representatives of Bihari Samaj, a platform for Chhath observers, on Wednesday. “The infrastructure will be spruced up so that devotees can go to these places instead of Lake. The idea is to involve local communities and stakeholders to spread the word about the alternative arrangements. Details will be publicised soon,” said a KMDA official. Last year, KMDA had identified 10 water bodies in the city, mainly in Nonadanga and Baisnabghata Patuli. NGT had earlier dismissed KMDA’s appeal to allow Chhath rituals at Rabindra Sarobar. About the alternative arrangements, Mani Prasad Singh, a spokesperson for Bihari Samaj, said they would cooperate with KMDA. “We will help KMDA make Chhath a success. We may engage our volunteers to ensure the celebrations are held in accordance with the green norms set by the NGT. KMC ward coordinators will need to cooperate with the state,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-earmarks-44-water-bodies-for-chhath-puja/articleshow/78541976.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Business||Google faces new antitrust plaint over smart TVs||Digbijay.Mishra@timesgroup.com Bengaluru: Google is facing another antitrust challenge. A fresh complaint has been filed with the Competition Commission of India (CCI), accusing the US-based tech major of abusing its Android operating system’s influence in the smart television market, which has been growing at a fast pace. A person aware of the matter confirmed that the competition watchdog has admitted the complaint, which was filed by two antitrust lawyers, and Google has been asked to respond. “The complaint is about Google’s antitrust practices where, for example, if you are a TV maker and you want to use Google’s operating system on your TV, before giving the licence to you, they sign an agreement with you which essentially restricts you from getting into an agreement with any forked or modified Android developer, irrespective of the device being manufactured,” a person aware of the matter said. Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand have filed the complaint against Google. Both of them declined to comment on the matter, while Google India and CCI did not respond to an emailed query from TOI. The development came on Wednesday when a US Congress report on Big Tech said Google’s Play Store functions as a gatekeeper which the search engine giant is using to hike fees and favour its applications. The report also stated that Google tracks the real-time performance of third parties, including its competitors. The US subcommittee report investigating competition in digital markets said Google has used Android to entrench and extend its dominance in a host of ways that undermine competition. Google is already facing heat from a group of local entrepreneurs who have been protesting against its move to implement 30% fees on digital transactions in India, which after the backlash has been pushed by six months to April 2022. In the US, Apple is also facing a similar pushback from platforms like Epic Games and Spotify. But in India, the focus remains on Google Play Store as Apple has a very small market share. The report noted that according to documents obtained by the subcommittee, from 2011 to 2015, revenue from the Play Store accounted for 85% of Google’s total revenue from the Android operating system, hardware sales, and the Play Store. “This includes using contractual restrictions and exclusivity provisions to extend Google’s search monopoly from desktop to mobile and to favour its own applications, and devising Android Lockbox, a covert effort to track real-time data on the usage and engagement of third-party apps, some of which were Google’s competitors,” it said. It added, “Overall, Android’s business practices reveal how Google has maintained its search dominance through relying on various contractual restrictions that blocked competition and through exploiting information asymmetries, rather than by competing on the merits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/google-faces-new-antitrust-plaint-over-smart-tvs/articleshow/78543574.cms||Digbijay Mishra
October 8, 2020||Patna||LJP’s exit likely to benefit BJP in Bihar polls||PATNA: LJP chief Chirag Paswan’s exit from NDA may help BJP and its arch-rival RJD to improve their prospects in the assembly polls. At loggerheads with the JD (U) president and chief minister Nitish Kumar for a while now, Chirag will contest 143 seats where JD(U) is going to field candidates as part of the NDA. LJP fielding candidates against JD(U) is likely to eat into the latter’s vote share, which will help BJP strengthen its position within the alliance. The saffron party would want to become the single largest party in the alliance, and hence maintains a cordial relation with Chirag even as it came out in support of Nitish. If Chirag’s ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ campaign against Nitish’s ‘Saat Nischay’ can fetch him double-digit seats (LJP got just two in 2015), it will then be in a more advantageous position to bargain in the event of Nitish, riding a huge anti-incumbency wave, cuts a sorry figure in the election. Dalits account for 16% of Bihar’s population and half of them are from Paswan’s ‘Dusad community’. BJP, on the other hand, will keep in mind Nitish’s exit from NDA in 2013 and will prefer a ‘weak’ JD(U). Therefore, the saffron party will welcome LJP’s move to erode JD(U)’s vote share. Though Nitish has Mahadalit leader Jitan Ram Manjhi’s support to counter LJP’s inroads. The LJP’s move to contest against JD(U) will help RJD sharpen attack on its bête-noir JD(U) more scathingly during the campaigns. Tejashwi Yadav, who is going to the polls without his father’s support for the first time as the ‘future chief minister’ of the state, will leave no stone unturned to highlight how LJP, a party of Dalits, was ‘forced’ to leave the alliance. RJD will be more than happy to dent JD(U)’s image. Observers say Chirag is playing a long-term game as LJP’s exit from NDA and fighting the polls alone is a part of it. Paswan Jr is gradually positioning himself as a future leader of the state eyeing the 2025 state polls. Five years from now, when many top leaders in the state and the country will be out of the poll scenario, Chirag, now 37, is likely to play a larger role. BJP, too, will be happy to strike deals with him then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljps-exit-likely-to-benefit-bjp/articleshow/78551107.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||25% reduction in school fees notified by Gujarat govt||AHMEDABAD: The state education department finally issued the notification for the 25% reduction in school tuition fees for the academic year 2020-21. The government has in the notification made it clear that the 25% fee reduction will be applicable for all self-financed schools under the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, CBSE and other boards in the state. The notification also states that schools will not be permitted to collect any other fees such as activity fees and transport fees for the current academic year. The notification advises parents to pay their fees for the last academic year and 50% of the fees for the first two quarters by the end of October. The government has asked the managements of self-financed school to give relief to parents who are not in position to pay the fees. They have been advised to evaluate such cases on a case-to-case basis and take a humanitarian approach. The government has stated that school managements cannot pressure parents to pay the fees together and will have to make arrangements to facilitate monthly payments. The government also made it clear that the management cannot impose any fines or penalties for late payment of fees. If the parent has paid the fees for the entire year, the 25% rebate will have to be adjusted in the next academic session. Moreover, the government also made it clear that school managements will not be allowed to increase the fees for the current academic session and will have to follow the fee structure of 2019-20. In mid-September the Gujarat high court had refused to intervene in this matter and told the state government to decide on revision of school fees. While disposing of an application seeking the court’s intervention on the fee issue, the HC had said the government can take an “independent decision” under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, which are in force due to the COVID-19 outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/25-reduction-in-school-fees-notified-by-govt/articleshow/78542134.cms||---

October 8, 2020||---||It’s a family fight in Sandesh and Shahpur||PATNA: The state assembly election has turned into a virtual battleground for some members of the same families in Bhojpur district. While RJD’s Kiran Devi is pitted against her own ‘jeth’ (husband’s elder brother) and JD(U) candidate Vijendra Kumar Yadav in Sandesh, BJP’s official nominee Munni Devi is facing her ‘jethani’ (husband’s elder brother’s wife) Shobha Devi as an independent candidate in Shahpur. Kiran filed her papers on Tuesday and Vijendra on Wednesday. “Munni Devi will file her nomination papers on Thursday,” BJP’s Bhojpur district president Prem Ranjan Chaturvedi told TOI on Wednesday. Shobha has already filed her papers. Vijendra had represented Sandesh on RJD ticket in the 2000 and November 2005 assembly polls, but lost to BJP’s Sanjay Singh Tiger in 2010. In 2015, Vijendra’s younger brother Arun Kumar won the seat on RJD symbol against BJP’s Tiger. But Arun was made an accused in a rape case in 2019. As per the police investigation, the minor girl was allegedly raped by the RJD MLA in Patna. He is still evading arrest while police have already filed chargesheet against him in the court. In such a situation, RJD fielded Arun’s wife. Vijendra, the RJD state vice-president, switched over to JD(U) after getting hints that his party would field Arun’s wife in the coming assembly. The JD(U) leadership fulfilled the promise and fielded him from Sandesh against his own younger brother’s wife. “I am sure of my victory. JD(U) is far ahead of RJD in Sandesh,” Vijendra told TOI over the phone on Wednesday. Similarly, in Shahpur, former MLA Munni Devi would seek votes against her ‘jethani’ Shobha, who is the widow of BJP’s former state vice-president Visheshwar Ojha. Visheshwar was shot dead in a gang war on February 12, 2016 at Sonbarsa Bazar in the Shahpur constituency. Munni is wife of Visheshwar’s younger brother Bhuwar Ojha. In the February 2005 election, Shobha was a JD(U) candidate, but had lost to RJD senior leader Shivanand Tiwari. However, in the November 2005 election, Shahpur seat went to BJP as both Ojha brothers had been evading arrest and the saffron party fielded Munni. She won the 2010 election again. But in the 2015 election, BJP fielded Munni’s ‘jeth’ Visheshwar, leading to a chasm between the two brothers and their families. Though Visheshwar bagged around 54,000 votes for BJP, he lost to RJD’s Rahul Tiwari. The son of Shivanand Tiwari had bagged around 69,000 votes. In the meantime, Visheshwar was gunned down and his widow Shobha staked claim on the BJP ticket, but could not succeed. When BJP on Tuesday declared Munni as its official candidate, Shobha became a rebel and filed her papers as an independent candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/its-a-family-fight-in-sandesh-and-shahpur/articleshow/78540988.cms||Madan Kumar

October 8, 2020||Rajkot||Ghogha-Hazira Ro-Ro ferry to set sail from October end||RAJKOT: The ambitious Ro-Ro ferry project is expected to get the much-needed lifeline with the entire infrastructure to restart the operations completed in Hazira within the stipulated time frame. The Ghogha-Dahej ferry service had run into troubled waters due to a plethora of issues, mainly heavy siltation at Dahej, since it was flagged off in 2017. It was ultimately suspended in September 2019 by the ferry operator Indigo Seaways, which found it unviable and safety concerns due to lack of adequate depth at Dahej. In July, Adani Group’s Adani Hazira Ports Pvt Ltd (AHPPL) was awarded the contract to build the temporary infrastructure at Hazira port for re-starting the beleaguered Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro ferry service. AHPPL quoted the lowest - Re one in the bid. Central government-run Deendayal Port Trust (DPT) was tasked with reviving the project and it had issued tenders calling for developers. It is likely that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate this new route during his Gujarat visit on October 31 for Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary celebration. DPT chairman SK Mehta said, “We expect to commence operation of the Ro-Ro ferry service by October end and are awaiting a formal announcement in this regard. While the union ministry of shipping will finalize the date, work on creating a temporary infrastructure at the port will complete as per deadline.” Meanwhile, renovation and maintenance work is also completed at the Ghogha port from where services had been suspended. While officials of the shipping ministry confirmed commencing the services by the end of this month, they refused to divulge more information. Source said Ro-Ro service will operate two services daily from both ends and also carry cargo along with passengers.

October 8, 2020||Patna||Bihar assembly election: BJP gives 11 seats to Mukesh Sahani, sends warning signal to LJP||PATNA: The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by Mukesh Sahani on Wednesday got 11 seats from the BJP quota of 121 to contest the three-phase state assembly election from October 28 to November 7. BJP has also promised one legislative council seat to the VIP. Sahani’s high profile induction into the NDA was announced on Tuesday in the presence of former Maharashtra CM and the BJP’s Bihar election incharge Devendra Fadnavis, deputy CM in the Nitish Kumar government Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) and BJP’s state president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal. Now, VIP will contest from Brahmpur, Bochaha, Gaura Bauram, Simri Bakhtiarpur, Sugauli, Madhubani, Keoti, Sahebganj, Balrampur, Alinagar and Baniapur seats. That leaves the BJP with 110 seats to contest. Speaking on the occasion, Fadnavis made it clear to LJP chief Chirag Paswan that his decision to quit the NDA was unilateral and also that his party’s entry into the alliance was impossible. It amounted to saying that LJP’s exit from NDA was permanent. “Those who are not with the NDA will not be a part of it in the future,” Fadnavis said, adding: “If anyone disagrees with this position is free to quit NDA.” By insinuation, it was an indication that the continuance of LJP was untenable in the situation and, therefore, by implication, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s continuance in the NDA government led by PM Narendra Modi at the Centre was also short-lived. “Attempts were made to persuade those who were going against NDA so as to make them see the sense in their remaining with us and that they should also not commit the mistake of walking out of the NDA, but they did not read the sense and chose to go other way,” Fadnavis said. On the occasion, SuMo reiterated, “NDA will contest the assembly election in the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar. There is no confusion about it, nor any doubt.” SuMo also issued a warning to the state BJP leaders who were joining LJP to contest the assembly election by violating the party’s diktat. “If anyone quits the party and joins any other outfit to contest the election will be deemed as automatically expelled from the party,” SuMo said. He reiterated his warning to LJP on using the photograph of PM Modi in its posters or in any other form for the sake of publicity. “No one can use the photograph of PM Modi other than the BJP,” SuMo said, adding that BJP has made an extremely backward caste (EBC) the country’s PM, because it respects the people of this section, unlike the grand alliance which “insults them”. Referring to the use of the PM’s photographs for the sake of publicity by any other party, state BJP president Dr Jaiswal said FIRs would be lodged in such a situation against the party concerned. “PM Modi is first the member of BJP. He is the top star campaigner of the party,” Dr Jaiswal said. While SuMo recalled that Sahani had contributed to the campaign for making Narendra Modi the country’s PM, Sahani said he, indeed, was with the BJP, but had strayed from it under certain political circumstances. Sahani pledged that he would make all efforts towards making Nitish the state’s CM again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-gives-11-seats-to-sahani-sends-warning-signal-to-ljp/articleshow/78545852.cms||Abhay Singh

October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Ensure all encroachments on Waqf land are removed: Association||HYDERABAD: The Association of Save Waqf Properties (ASWP) has urged the Telangana government to ensure strict implementation of government orders to safeguard Waqf properties. The issue of conferring judicial status to the Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) has also been raised by the association. Touching upon GO15, ASWP demanded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao instruct police and revenue officials to assist TSWB for protecting and reclaiming Waqf properties. “The GO does not seem to be effective on its own to protect the Waqf properties. If Waqf gazette is attached to the revenue department, the registration of properties can automatically be stopped. In the absence of online revenue record, the process of registration of Waqf properties is still going on,” said Syed Ifteqar Hussaini, the general secretary of ASWP. Hussaini alleged that TSWB officials were not being supported by police and revenue departments. “The government order should be implemented with police and revenue officials’ help. The lack of coordination between Waqf and other department officials has led to land grabbers continuing the encroachments,” he said. Meanwhile, Waqf board chairman Mohammed Saleem claimed that they had received support from government officials in weeding out illegal encroachments from Waqf properties “The board is being helped by police and revenue officials to throw out illegal occupants from Waqf properties. So far, we have managed to revoke more than 100 registrations,” Mohammed Saleem, chairman of TSWB told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ensure-all-encroachments-on-waqf-land-are-removed-assn/articleshow/78543451.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Patna||Cinema theatres, multiplexes gear up to abide by Bihar government SOPs from Oct 15||PATNA: After information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar announced the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for cinema theatres and multiplexes, their owners are gearing up to make arrangements for ensuring the safety of the visitors. They are, however, also waiting for the state government’s nod for resuming their operations. Theatres have remained shut ever since the one-day ‘Janata Curfew’ was imposed on March 22 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre’s announcement of reopening of theatres from October 15 under Unlock 5.0 comes as a boon for exhibitors, who are eager to get back to business. According to the guidelines, occupancy of a hall shall not be more than 50%. Other important measures that theatres will have to follow include staggered entry and exit of audience, adequate physical distancing, thermal screening, regular cleaning and disinfection, proper ventilation, and multiple food stalls. The manager of a movie theatre chain in Patliputra, Dipak Singh, told this newspaper on Wednesday, “We will follow the Centre’s guidelines for the safety of people and take all precautions. We are waiting for the state government’s directive on reopening of theatres.” The manager of another chain near Gandhi Maidan, Sharad Gupta, has also started making arrangements for reopening the theatre. “We have already taken care of important safety measures like proper ventilation, installation of sanitizers at entry and exit points and staggered seating arrangements. All the employees have been told to wear face shields,” he said, expressing concern over low footfalls once theatres reopened. He added, “We will have to win people’s trust as far as safety is concerned.” The employee of a cinema hall near Khagaul said, “We know we will witness poor footfalls in the beginning and it will take a couple of months for things to settle down. Another challenge is the shortage of content as most of the new films have been screened on OTT platforms.” Rajendra Kumar, the employee of a Danapur-based movie theatre, pointed out that it would be a Herculean task to ensure the safety of people and the staff once the hall reopens. He said, “Making arrangements like proper ventilation, adequate ticketing counters and food points will take at least a month’s time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cinema-theatres-multiplexes-gear-up-to-abide-by-govt-sops-from-oct-15/articleshow/78540784.cms||Faryal Rumi

October 8, 2020||Patna||ED takes Muzaffarpur jeweller on remand in laundering case||PATNA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday got four days’ remand of Muzaffarpur-based jeweller Rajkumar Goenka and film producer Pankaj Agarwal from Kolkata for further probe into their alleged involvement in money laundering to the tune of around Rs225 crore through hawala. A part of the money was routed through bank accounts from Bihar as well. Both were arrested by the ED sleuths in Patna on September 22. Sources said Rajkumar owned a jewellery shop at Mithanpura in Muzaffarpur as a cover of his money laundering activities. “At least Rs12 crore was transacted to Hong Kong by Rajkumar. He had also laundered money to the United States of America (USA) from Muzaffarpur,” an ED source said, preferring anonymity. Sources said it was not clear whose money they were actually laundering. “Both had blamed each other, making it necessary to take them on remand for thorough interrogation,” an ED source said. They said Rajkumar had opened at least 20 bank accounts in the name of his employees and used for money laundering. “Surprisingly, the money laundered to Hong Kong and the USA from Muzaffarpur were deposited in banks at small cities of Bihar. The money laundering took place between 2014 and 2016,” the source said, adding that money were transferred into the bank accounts managed by Rajkumar from different parts of the country. The source also said Pankaj was running more than 150 shell companies in Kolkata and Rajkumar transacted money through them. “Pankaj himself was the director of some of these shell companies. These firms were being used to launder money from Delhi and other places in the country,” he said. The officer said with further investigation, names of some more people in different parts of the country are expected to surface in the case. The source said they have already provisionally attached movable and immovable properties of Goenka worth Rs4.61 crore in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ed-takes-muz-jeweller-on-remand-in-laundering-case/articleshow/78540866.cms||Debashish Karmakar

October 8, 2020||Business||Amazon sends legal notice to Future on Reliance deal||BENGALURU: US-based online retail giant Amazon has sent a legal notice to Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Kishore Biyani’s Future Group, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries, said two sources briefed on the matter. Amazon has also sent a copy of the notice to relevant authorities, including markets regulator Sebi and the stock exchanges, as the battle between the world’s richest man, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, and Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani takes a new turn. The dispute comes from Amazon’s Rs 1,431-crore investment in Future Coupons, which held about 10% stake in the flagship Future Retail, in August last year. As part of the deal, Biyani had also entered into a restriction on transfer of shares to specified persons and right of first offer of shares (ROFO) to Amazon as well, according to filings made by Future Retail at the time. This list of specified persons included Reliance Industries, said one of the sources mentioned earlier. The deal also gives a right to Amazon to acquire the entire or part of the shares of promoters of Future Retail after three years of the deal and before 10 years, in “certain circumstances” and subject to the law. But after the deal, the performance of Future Retail languished and Biyani’s personal debts put pressure on its share price as he was not able to meet repayment obligations. In August, Reliance Retail announced the deal to acquire Kishore Biyani’s retail assets as going concern on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,713 crore, including debt obligations. The sale would include brands like Big Bazaar, Foodhall, fbb, Nilgiris, Easyday, Central and Brand Factory. Sources briefed on the matter said that Amazon learned about the deal “publicly” once the terms with Reliance were finalised. Even before when Biyani was facing issues with lenders, there was “no constructive engagement” despite clauses that were entered into, putting into question rights of foreign investors, said a source. “The deal is about saving the promoters and to hell with the shareholders. The company could have been saved by other investors with or without Amazon,” said one of the sources. The matter may go for arbitration between the parties according to the contract, said this source, though the future course is yet to be determined. The share price of Future Retail has fallen from over Rs 400 when Amazon signed the deal last year to Rs 88 at close of trade on Wednesday. “Yes, we have initiated proceedings to enforce our contractual rights. It will be inappropriate for us to provide any more details relating to the matter as it is sub judice,” a spokesperson of Amazon said. Emailed queries to Future Group and Reliance Retail did not elicit a response till the time of going to the press. Amazon’s move comes at a time when Reliance has been busy racking up funding for its retail unit since September, after announcing the Future Group deal. Reliance Retail has raised a total of Rs 37,710 crore from private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds like Silver Lake, TPG, KKR, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and GIC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-sends-legal-notice-to-future-on-reliance-deal/articleshow/78543652.cms||Digbijay Mishra
October 8, 2020||Business||TCS unveils another buyback worth Rs 16k cr, Tata Sons to gain most||MUMBAI: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s second most-valued company, will spend Rs 16,000 crore to repurchase its stock “to return capital to shareholders”. Largest stakeholder Tata Sons will be the biggest beneficiary of this programme, which has been announced two weeks after it told the Supreme Court that it was willing to buy the 18.4% stock held in the company by the Mistry family-owned Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group. With a 72% stake in TCS, Tata Sons will receive about Rs 11,500 crore from the buyback if it tenders all the shares it is eligible to offer under the programme. Historically, TCS has been the biggest contributor to the Tata Sons kitty as the parent earns huge dividends from the world’s third-largest software services provider’s shares and makes gains through its buyback programmes. The cash transfers from TCS help Tata Sons in its various activities like financing acquisitions (it is currently in the midst of restructuring AirAsia India, working out funding plans to buy SP’s stake following a legal dispute that will be heard on October 28 by the SC and weighing bidding options for Air India, the deadline for which is October 30 but is expected to be extended owing to the pandemic). On Wednesday, the TCS board voted to buy back 5.3 crore shares (1.4% of its capital) at Rs 3,000 each. This is at a 10% premium to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 2,737 on the BSE. The buyback, its third since its listing in 2004, comes as cash and investments swelled to Rs 58,594 crore at the end of September. The TCS board also declared an interim dividend of Rs 12 per share — Tata Sons will earn Rs 324 crore from this. “TCS has been a robust cash generator for Tata Group and has consistently delivered cash flows that provide Tata Sons with significant strategic capital. This capital has been historically deployed across various strategic initiatives including consolidation of its holding in group companies, pursuing inorganic opportunities and undertaking new ventures. While the buyback by TCS is in normal course, markets may be attributing a greater significance in the current context when Tata Group could be looking to consolidate its holding in Tata Sons,” said RippleWave Equity Advisors’ partner Mehul Savla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tcs-unveils-another-buyback-worth-rs-16k-cr-tata-sons-to-gain-most/articleshow/78543551.cms||Reeba Zachariah
October 8, 2020||---||NDA may be hit in JD(U)-LJP war of attrition||PATNA: LJP’s relentless attack on chief minister Nitish Kumar has not only sparked speculation about its possible impact on NDA’s poll performance but also put BJP in a spot, which forced the saffron party to call out ‘rebel’ LJP and strongly back the leadership of JD(U) president and CM Nitish Kumar. BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi along with Nitish clarified their stand vis a vis LJP in a joint press conference on Tuesday to announce their seat-sharing formula. “We have no confusion in our minds,” Nitish said. But LJP chief Chirag Paswan’s sustained attack on the programmes and performance of CM Nitish Kumar for the last over three months and the stoic silence maintained by BJP brass so far had created a perception in the political circles that the son of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan was playing to a game plan chalked out somewhere else with a “hidden agenda”. The BJP leaders on Tuesday did not deny that LJP was a part of the NDA at the Centre where Ram Vilas is a minister. Dr Jaiswal, in a damage control exercise, said only those who have faith in the leadership of Nitish will remain in the “NDA in Bihar”. At the same time, it asked LJP not to use the photographs of PM Modi for its electioneering or else they may have to move the Election Commission. The LJP’s decision to field candidates against JD(U) in the three-phase Bihar election from October 28 to November 7 and Chirag’s statement on Monday that his party will form the government with BJP in the state left JD(U) seething with anger against the young Paswan, who is projecting himself as a chief ministerial candidate through his ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ slogan. Both LJP and JD(U) have made it clear on several occasions that they have never been allies in Bihar, but Nitish, without taking Chirag’s name’, on Tuesday asked did Ram Vilas get elected to the Rajya Sabha without the JD(U) support? In a restrained statement to the media, JD(U) spokesman Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said Chirag is still to test political waters outside the shadow of his father and the mandate will make him feel his grassroots strength. “The people of Bihar are not swayed by big talks. Chirag has neither any standing of his own nor of the issues on the ground. In dynasty politics, people harbour ambitions without making many contributions,” he said. BJP’s general secretary Devesh Kumar, however, downplayed the fear of any damage to the NDA prospects due to Chirag and reiterated the party stand that “it remains steadfast” in adhering to the coalition dharma. “BJP and JD(U) have been very old and dependable allies and people appreciate it. People will vote on our governance track record and PM Modi’s image,” he told TOI on Tuesday. Opposition RJD is enjoying the developments in the NDA and sees it as advantageous for the Mahagathbandhan, which has, at least, clarity on alliance and electoral issues. “Now, NDA means ‘negative and defective alliance’. Their cadres are confused. BJP and JD(U) will have to suffer irreparable damage in the election, which the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan is going to win hands down,” RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/nda-may-be-hit-in-jdu-ljp-war-of-attrition/articleshow/78522174.cms||Jai Narain Pandey
October 8, 2020||Surat||Diamond units to observe shortest ever Diwali break over high demand||Surat: In wake of the renewed demand for polished diamonds ahead of the Christmas from US, UK, Australia and other West Asian countries, the diamond units in Surat have decided to observe the shortest Diwali vacation ever — five days. Diamond unit owners said that this was mainly to fulfil the orders as most of the factories were working at 60% capacity under the Covid-19 guidelines and needed more working hours to cater to the demand. Also, they want to make up for the losses incurred due to lockdown since March and the slowdown in the international market that followed. According to the Surat Diamond Association (SDA), 80% of the units have become operational after remaining shut since March. There are small diamond units, employing less than 20 workers, that are yet to reopen due to the financial crisis and the sky-rocketing price of rough diamonds triggered by the ban on international flights in the country. At present, out of the estimated 7,000 diamond units, nearly 6,000 are functioning at less than 60% capacity as per the Covid-19 guidelines. According to the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the international markets including US, UK, Australia, UAE, Hong Kong, China are performing well as far as the diamond jewellery segment was concerned. The export of polished diamonds has shown a steady increase since May this year. Nanu Vekariya, president of SDA told TOI, “Diamantaires in Surat strictly followed the appeal of GJEPC and stayed away from importing rough diamonds in June and July months. The old inventory of polished diamonds has dried up and the diamantaires are facing a situation where they are not getting enough rough diamonds to polish due to ban on international flights.” Vekariya added, “In such a situation, diamantaires can’t afford to keep their units shut for 20 days during Diwali festival. However, the units will be shut for five days and the work will start to cater the international demand ahead of Christmas.” Managing director of Dharmanandan Diamonds, Hitesh Patel told TOI, “The international diamond market looks promising ahead of Christmas. The export of polished diamonds is nearing the pre-Covid levels. We are pretty sure that the diamantaires will have to run their factories for 10 to 15 hours a day to meet the ever-growing demand for diamonds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/diamond-units-to-observe-shortest-ever-diwali-break-over-high-demand/articleshow/78541048.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Surat||No reduction in syllabus of UG, PG courses at VNSGU||Surat: There will be no reduction in syllabus of undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU). The university had informed the state education department about its decision recently stating that it had started online classes from July. The education department had reduced the syllabus in schools considering the loss of time due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, VNSGU officials informed that they were not in favour of reducing the course since the online teaching was on. “The university’s department and affiliated colleges had started online education in July. Our course is as per schedule. We will conduct the semester exams as well and there will be no reduction in course for UG and PG courses,” said Hemali Desai, in-charge vice-chancellor, VNSGU. “Reduction in syllabus in courses like medical, nursing, architecture and others will be finalised by the respective council,” Desai added.The university is to announce dates for exam and vacation in some time after the educational calendar is declared by the education department. “Considering the global pandemic it was feared that the normal educational activities will remain suspended for a few months.

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Cops nab Park Street molester||Kolkata: A 40-year-old man was arrested for allegedly passing lewd remarks and misbehaving with a student when she was waiting for a cab with two friends around 10.30pm on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, close to the Park Street crossing, on Tuesday. Police said the student said she had come to Park Street for some Puja shopping. The accused, Dibyendu Biswas, is a resident of a complex on Yeni Sarani and was allegedly inebriated. “The three women were waiting near Metro Bhawan when this man began to behave indecently in front of the victim. When she asked him to behave, he reportedly did not budge, forcing her to seek help. Sergeant Sandip Roy and other traffic cops at the spot immediately intervened. The accused was arrested and a case of molestation was lodged against him,” an officer said. The victim — a resident of east Kolkata — was dropped home by cops. The police will pray to the court to record her statement before a magistrate. Cops said they were trying to ascertain why Biswas behaved that way. “We have increased our presence there. To send out a signal, we will file a charge sheet as soon as possible,” said an officer. The charge, if proved before the court, could lead to a maximum punishment of five years in jail. Officers lauded the woman’s courage to raise her voice because “in the majority of such incidents, the victims either ignored the act thinking of legal complications or avoided lodging a case fearing social stigma”. Commissioner Anuj Sharma had encouraged women to dial 100 to report any crime against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-nab-park-street-molester/articleshow/78542116.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The Indo-China pair eventually prevailed 2-6, 6-4, 10-8. With the match starting slightly late because of rain and the pair playing for the first time together, the two lacked coordination in the beginning and there were also some errors of judgement on Li’s part as they lost the first set 2-6. However, the duo regrouped well in the second set, especially the 18-year-old Ahmedabad lad who came out all guns blazing. Li started imparting more power on the serve and they won the second set 6-4 and eventually the match. Dev’s coach Shrimal Bhatt, who is accompanying him in Paris, was ecstatic after the duo’s victory.“A win at a Grand Slam is always very exciting. The weather was cold and damp and thus the courts were slow. The temperature was around 12 to 14 C. It rained a lot on Monday evening and also in the morning today,’’ said a beaming Shrimal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/javia-wins-first-round-french-open-boys-doubles-match/articleshow/78541909.cms||Sanjay Chakhaiyar

Mallik, the expelled state general secretary of the RJD’s SC cell, was shot dead by three armed criminals inside his residence in Purnia’s posh locality on Sunday. His second wife, Khushbu Devi, lodged an FIR with K-Haat police station against six people, including Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and his brother Tej Pratap. Tejashwi wrote a letter to the CM on Wednesday, urging him to recommend the case for CBI investigation. “I am ready to face investigation by any national or international investigating agency so that justice is delivered to the family of the deceased,” his letter read. The RJD’s CM candidate said he was in favour of a speedy investigation into the case in which he along with Tej Pratap have been named as accused. “I hope the law will take its own course. The investigating agency may quiz me before filing my nomination papers for the election,” the letter stated. Tejashwi also slammed the leaders of the ruling JD (U) for making unsavoury remarks against him and his elder brother, despite having no substantial evidence against them. He said he could not react to the incident immediately due to his hectic schedule in the wake of the upcoming assembly polls. A senior police officer associated with the investigation told this newspaper, “Khushbu, a native of Naugachhia in Bhagalpur district, had married Mallik in 2016 against the wishes of her family. The couple has two kids. Mallik’s first wife had left home a few years ago and her whereabouts are not known.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-demands-cbi-probe-into-murder-case/articleshow/78541344.cms||Ramashankar
October 8, 2020||Lucknow||Soon, Saryu cruise on Ramayana theme||LUCKNOW: A visit to Ayodhya might soon include measuring the expanse and vastness of the divine river Saryu in the comforts of a cruise boat. The Uttar Pradesh government is planning to start a cruise service in the Saryu. A proposal for it was presented by a private player to senior officials in the tourism department in the presence of minister Neelkanth Tewari on Wednesday. “A cruise ride on Saryu can help in generating more jobs,” said the minister who told officials to study the feasibility of the proposal. In the presentation, the company suggested that the tour be called the Ramayana cruise tour and begin from and end at Nayaghat. The farthest point to be covered in it would be Guptar Ghat. In between, several activity sites like selfie points can be developed to engage visitors. The minister said that the interiors of the boat may be designed on the theme of Ramayana. While on the boat, the visitors could be entertained with films and animation on the story of Ramayana. Options for vegetarian food and snacks should also be made available. The pilgrims might also get the opportunity to participate in the evening Saryu Aarti. The minister told officials to engage with irrigation department to undertake regular dredging of the Saryu river to ensure that ample flow of the water is maintained. In addition, the department is exploring the opportunity to start a boat ride in Varanasi too. Pilgrims may embark on a journey to Markandey Mahadev via Chunar with the option of a camp at the famous fort of Chunar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/soon-saryu-cruise-on-ramayana-theme/articleshow/78543831.cms||Shailvee Sharda
October 8, 2020||Kochi||Kochi: KMRL aims at 60% energy neutrality||KOCHI: Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) would be achieving 60% energy neutrality shortly by utilising solar energy. The metro agency will be commissioning an additional 5.4MWP capacity system on its buildings and tracks in 2020 to increase the output to 1.57 crore units/year and maintain 60% energy neutrality. The installation of rooftop solar panels will be completed by mid November and rest of the work by December 2020. According to KMRL, this initiative has brought down carbon emissions by 13,302 tonnes a year, which is equal to planting 5,33,033 trees. “We are pushing for maximising the solar energy generation. We are installing solar plants in all our areas, as far as possible, to gain green and clean power. The same will be replicated in the water metro project too,” said KMRL managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma. KMRL has already completed the installation of solar panels at Thykoodam metro station. Work is progressing at Vyttila, Petta, South, Kadavanthra and Elamkulam. There are also plans to install solar panels at JLN metro station’s corporate office and track and ramp area at Muttom Depot. The metro agency commissioned three large-scale solar power generation systems in past two years. The first phase of the project, which is 2.670MWP in capacity and capable of generating 36.5 lakh unit/year was implemented through Rsco (Renewable Energy Service Company) in 2018. This contributed to 60% of the total energy consumed at that point of time. However, the neutrality was reduced by half with the opening of stations in the Maharaja’s-Thykoodam stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kmrl-aims-at-60-energy-neutrality/articleshow/78540983.cms||---
October 8, 2020||---||Bihar: Still part of NDA as ally, says LJP||PATNA: A day after being snubbed by BJP for not accepting the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar, LJP functionaries maintained on Wednesday that they have a principled fight with JD (U) in the Bihar assembly polls and not the saffron party. They also claimed that they are still a part of the NDA at Centre as LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan continues to be the minister in Narendra Modi- government at the Centre. With BJP and JD (U) turncoats joining LJP, the party's national secretary-general Abdul Khalik told TOI on Wednesday that LJP is firm on its stand that the next government in the state will be formed by the BJP-LJP combine under the leadership of BJP. A formal statement declaring the party's stand was issued by LJP president Chirag Paswan on Monday. However, BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday made it clear that those who do not accept the leadership of Nitish are not part of the NDA. But LJP continued to side with BJP along with being critical of Nitish. “Indeed, we are not part of the NDA in Bihar but we are an ally of BJP at the Centre. We also believe that there should be a BJP-led government in Bihar and for that the saffron party should have contested on a higher number of seats,” LJP’s secretary-general Khalik said. He added, “Nevertheless, we are quite sure that we will win enough seats in the elections and form the next government in Bihar under the leadership of BJP.” Asked about the rumours of BJP giving backroom support to LJP for opening a front against JD (U), Khalik said, “It is a completely wrong perception. We are not here to cut anyone to size. BJP is correct in saying that they are nowhere involved in what LJP is doing. We want to expand the party by contesting on more number of seats and formed the next government.” JD (U), on the other hand, maintained that it was never in alliance with LJP. “In 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 Bihar elections, LJP has been fighting against us. We still made senior LJP functionary Pashupati Kumar Paras Ji MLC as well as state minister in 2017. Now they wanted to fight on 143 seats, which would have required a house of over 600 seats (for seat-sharing arrangements),” JD (U) national secretary general KC Tyagi said in New Delhi. In a dig at LJP, Tyagi said, “People have the right to make ambitious comments, we don’t want to respond to it. There are mainly two big players in electoral politics in Bihar from the last 15 years- JD (U) and BJP and, RJD and its allies. Independent candidates and small vote-cutter parties have tried their luck on several occasions but they have mostly remained confined to one or two seats. Nevertheless, BJP has categorically said that those who do not accept the leadership of Nitish Ji, are not part of the NDA and should not use name or photograph of PM Modi.” Asked for a reaction on BJP’s remark on the usage of PM Modi’s photograph or name, LJP’s Khailk said, “We never had any discussion within the party to use the photographs of PM Modi, nor have we done it.” JD(U)’s Tyagi also said the party has not made any demand to BJP for removing Ram Vilas from Modi-government. “Ram Vilas Ji is unwell and we wish for his early recovery. We have not made any negative demand to the BJP for his removal from the Union cabinet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/still-part-of-nda-as-ally-ljp/articleshow/78541031.cms||Piyush Tripathi
October 8, 2020||Business||Covid stress manageable, legacy bad loans taken care of: SBI chief Khara||MUMBAI: Newly appointed chairman of State Bank of India, Dinesh Khara, has said that the Covid-related stress on the borrowers of the country’s largest bank is manageable and there is not much visibility on clients seeking restructuring. He, however, said that SBI would continue with its tradition of making upfront provisions for stressed loan accounts. Addressing the media for the first time after taking charge, Khara said he was proud to be part of the bank and humbled with the appointment. He listed his priorities to include health of employees & customers, maintaining asset quality and generating value for all stakeholders. “The bank has embarked on a journey of digital distribution and is increasingly leveraging digital and analytical capabilities and will continue this journey,” said Khara. Speaking on the likelihood of bad loans rising in the wake of the Covid pandemic, Khara said the bank has fully provided for all its legacy loans. “Right now, we do not have a visibility on the cases that will need to undergo restructuring because of Covid. Overall, we are not envisaging this as a concern,” said Khara. He added that one of the indicators of stress was the change in cash flows into large corporate accounts and the bank has been monitoring these during the lockdown. “While I would not say everything is hunky dory, what is seen is manageable,” he said. Khara said the bank had raised subordinated debt and was not planning to immediately raise equity capital. “Our capital adequacy is sufficient. We will reach out for equity capital-raising as and when we see building up of assets,” said Khara. At the same time, he pointed out that while there was good growth in retail, corporates were moving away from credit market to the bond markets to raise funds. Responding to a query on business recovery, Khara said that while there was an improvement, the business was still 70-80% of pre-Covid levels. On growth, Khara said SBI had a market share of 23%, which was significant given the economy’s size. He said that while the bank would grow, the focus would be on asset quality and net interest margins. Pointing out that SBI’s price-to-book value was only 0.3 times, he said that any CEO would like to see an improved valuation. He, however, ruled out any immediate value-unlocking by listing any of the subsidiaries — SBI General Insurance or SBI Mutual Fund. From all indications, the new leadership is unlikely to result in a change in the overall strategy and digitisation for the bank. “The bank has embarked on a journey of digital distribution and is increasingly leveraging digital and analytical capabilities and will continue this journey,” said Khara. He also reaffirmed the bank’s intention of pursuing a licence for setting up a new umbrella entity (NUE) in the payment space where the RBI had called for applications. “We are leaders in the payment system and we are seriously considering setting up an NUE,” he said. On the need for a bad bank to take over legacy bad loans and clean up books of banks, Khara said that various options were being looked at by lenders including a bad bank and asset reconstruction company. “The central concept behind al these options is an aggregation of stressed loans, which are currently distributed (among various banks) and we have to see which is the best way,” said Khara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-stress-manageable-legacy-bad-loans-taken-care-of-sbi-chief-khara/articleshow/78543352.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: December ’21 date for East-West||KOLKATA: The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the completion of the East-West Metro corridor project at a cost of Rs 8,576 crore by December 2021. The initial project cost calculated 12 years ago was Rs 4,874 crore. The cabinet nod will now allow Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) to finally start disbursing the rest of the loan amount. Jica is the principal funding agency for the project and is lending 48% of the total cost. The rest is being borne by the Centre. Jica had held back the third tranche of loan since the revised cost estimation had not been approved by the Union cabinet after it rose nearly 76%. The project is being implemented by a special purpose vehicle, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), under the ministry of railways. A senior KMRC official said, “Funds were being disbursed from the Union government in anticipation that the cabinet sanction would eventually come. But the Jica loan had been blocked. Now it should be released according to the revised cost.” Jica’s contribution to the East-West Metro project, which was around Rs 2,000 crore of the Rs 4,874 crore estimated in 2008, will be revised to Rs 4,158.4. The ministry of railways’ share will be Rs 3,268.3 crore and the ministry of housing and urban affairs’ share will be Rs 1,148.3 crore. The cost was revised to Rs 8,575 crore in December 2015, because of escalations caused by several hurdles, including a route realignment. Officials also cited increase in wages and prices of steel and iron as other factors. After the proposed station at Bowbazar was dropped from the plan, the alignment had to be shifted to Esplanade to allow a changeover with the north-south Metro that was earlier planned at Central station. KMRC had sent the revised cost for Railway Board’s approval in 2015 and the latter gave its approval last year, two months after the Bowbazar tunnelling disaster on August 31. However, the tunnelling fiasco, which led to several buildings collapsing, is not related to the revised cost, officials said. East-West Metro’s first phase, covering the 5km elevated stretch between Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium was unveiled in February. Last Sunday, railway minister Piyush Goyal virtually flagged off the 2km Phoolbagan extension as well. In 2008, KMRC estimated that Rs 4,785 crore would be required to build the Metro system between Howrah Maidan and Sector V, including an underwater section, as part of ‘Kolkata East-West Metro Project (III)’. In December 2015, KMRC sent a revised estimate of Rs 8,996 crore to the Union cabinet. The cabinet set up a committee to review the cost, which recommended deductions and returned the file in 2017. KMRC officials went back to the drawing board and reached a figure of Rs 8,575 crore with a June 2021 deadline. “But ever since, the file has been passed from section to section. The cabinet nod will put an end to the red tape,” a state official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dec-21-date-for-e-w-completion/articleshow/78541945.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
October 8, 2020||---||LJP’s exit likely to benefit BJP in Bihar polls||PATNA: LJP chief Chirag Paswan’s exit from NDA may help BJP and its arch-rival RJD to improve their prospects in the assembly polls. At loggerheads with the JD (U) president and chief minister Nitish Kumar for a while now, Chirag will contest 143 seats where JD(U) is going to field candidates as part of the NDA. LJP fielding candidates against JD(U) is likely to eat into the latter’s vote share, which will help BJP strengthen its position within the alliance. The saffron party would want to become the single largest party in the alliance, and hence maintains a cordial relation with Chirag even as it came out in support of Nitish. If Chirag’s ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ campaign against Nitish’s ‘Saat Nischay’ can fetch him double-digit seats (LJP got just two in 2015), it will then be in a more advantageous position to bargain in the event of Nitish, riding a huge anti-incumbency wave, cuts a sorry figure in the election. Dalits account for 16% of Bihar’s population and half of them are from Paswan’s ‘Dusad community’. BJP, on the other hand, will keep in mind Nitish’s exit from NDA in 2013 and will prefer a ‘weak’ JD(U). Therefore, the saffron party will welcome LJP’s move to erode JD(U)’s vote share. Though Nitish has Mahadalit leader Jitan Ram Manjhi’s support to counter LJP’s inroads. The LJP’s move to contest against JD(U) will help RJD sharpen attack on its bête-noir JD(U) more scathingly during the campaigns. Tejashwi Yadav, who is going to the polls without his father’s support for the first time as the ‘future chief minister’ of the state, will leave no stone unturned to highlight how LJP, a party of Dalits, was ‘forced’ to leave the alliance. RJD will be more than happy to dent JD(U)’s image. Observers say Chirag is playing a long-term game as LJP’s exit from NDA and fighting the polls alone is a part of it. Paswan Jr is gradually positioning himself as a future leader of the state eyeing the 2025 state polls. Five years from now, when many top leaders in the state and the country will be out of the poll scenario, Chirag, now 37, is likely to play a larger role. BJP, too, will be happy to strike deals with him then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/ljps-exit-likely-to-benefit-bjp/articleshow/78541152.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Madurai||Enforce stringent rules to prevent Covid-19 spread: HC||Madurai: Madras high court on Wednesday observed that stringent rules should be put in place to enforce social distancing norms and wearing of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the state. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K K Ramesh, a litigant appearing as party-in-person from Madurai. The petitioner sought a direction to continue the lockdown and impose heavy fines on people who fail to wear masks and follow social distancing norms. A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that effective steps are taken by the state government to prevent the spread of the pandemic in the state. Tamil Nadu is the only state in the country where more number of people are subjected to testing and the government had also considerably controlled the death rate due to Covid-19. The judges observed that while such steps are taken to prevent the spread of the disease in the state, the common public are not following social distancing norms and not wearing masks. During weekends, huge crowds are seen at meat shops where people gather without following social distancing norms. The judges observed that when doctors, nurses and police personnel are working in the frontline to prevent the spread of Covid-19, people should follow the rules and regulations. Masks should be worn like wearing a dress while stepping out of the house.Taking into account that a fine of Rs 500 is imposed on those who don’t wear masks or follow social distancing norms and lakhs of rupees had been collected as fine, the judges affirmed that such stringent rules should be in place to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The judges also sought response from the state government on other measures which could be taken to strictly enforce the norms. The case was adjourned to November 6 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/enforce-stringent-rules-to-prevent-covid-19-spread-hc/articleshow/78544114.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Goa||Goa: EDC plans new commercial city near Merces||PANAJI: The Economic Development Corporation (EDC) has unveiled an ambitious plan to set up a new commercial city on around 2 lakh sqm near Merces, on the outskirts of Panaji, that will comprise commercial buildings, shopping malls, hotels, utility services and open spaces. Besides the commercial city, there is also a plan for a Goa-themed market in 8,150 sqm of vacant land at the existing EDC Patto complex. The corporation has already identified suitable land of comunidade property at Renovadi and Morombi-o-Grande along the Kadamba plateau bypass highway. “It will be like a parallel city, an attraction for the state and for Panaji. It will be a tourist attraction, but even Goans will be interested in seeing it,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant after he viewed the project presentation. EDC chairman Sadanand Shet Tanavade said the proposed commercial city will create a new revenue source by way of house tax, infrastructure tax, stamp duty, registration charges and other taxes for the state. “If we prepare for this phase, it will give a good look to the city and will also create employment,” he said. Referring to the Market of Goa plan, Sawant said similar concepts exist in foreign countries. The Market of Goa will come up abutting the Rua de Ourem creek, which is presently being used by the Corporation of the City of Panaji to dump municipal waste. Goa Waste Management Corporation has been asked to clear the space by December. The market will be built as a temporary structure and will be developed under a public-private partnership model. EDC officials said the North Goa collector in September approved the constitution of a committee to acquire the comunidade land, and a committee headed by a special land acquisition officer has been set up. The town & country planning department and Goa coastal zone management authority have already conducted a site survey for the proposed commercial city, and the no-objection certificate (NOC) and zoning certificate from TCP was obtained in June. The finance department has also granted administrative approval for the project. Sawant also asked the EDC to consider setting up commercial complexes in Mopa, where the new international airport is set to come up. The chief minister was present at the EDC head office for a meeting of the CM’s rozgar yojana (CMRY) task force committee. Sawant distributed sanction letters to several CMRY beneficiaries, and also handed over the final settlement compensation to seven employees of the disbanded Goa Auto Accessories Limited (GAAL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edc-plans-new-commercial-city-near-merces/articleshow/78544142.cms||Newton Sequeira
October 8, 2020||Kochi||Kochi: Court asks NIA about evidence in gold smuggling case||KOCHI: Once again the NIA special court asked the agency if there was evidence to say that the gold smuggled through diplomatic baggage was meant for financing terrorism while hearing the prosecution arguments in the petition filed by eight of the accused, seeking bail. Judge P Krishnakumar noted on Wednesday that the case, compared to other smuggling cases, becomes extraordinary due to three reasons: A) transnational ramifications due to the use of diplomatic channel B) high quantity involved and C) suspicion of terror financing. It asked NIA if all the accused seeking bail satisfies all three reasons, as most of them were seemingly financiers. The court said the case was serious and asked NIA if it was able to find evidence to substantiate its terror financing claim after 85 days of investigation. NIA said that in Oct 2019, central economic intelligence bureau (CEIB) sent a report that there were suspicion that gold smuggled through Karipur airport was used for terror funding. NIA’s special prosecutor submitted a copy of the report in court and argued that as per the report six categories of persons involved in gold smuggling, including financiers, must be probed. The court said that most of the persons who filed bail applications were financiers. It asked if NIA had evidence to continue their detention. Assistant Solicitor General P Vijayakumar argued for NIA that the accused are part of a single network that had the common intention to smuggle gold in large quantities. The court posted the case for Monday so as to go through the confession statement given by accused Sandeep Nair before passing an order on the bail petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/court-asks-nia-about-evidence/articleshow/78542139.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||Civic body to start garbage segregation by month-end||CHANDIGARH: The civic body authority has planned to kick-start source segregation by the end of this month. However, purchasing 390 twin-bin vehicles will play a crucial role in starting the exercise on the ground level. Since the tender has already been received for the purchase of the vehicles, the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) is doing the technical exercise and negotiating with the companies to purchase these vehicles at reasonable rates. “The vehicles are the most crucial in starting the source segregation. The tender process is going on and vehicles will be put in place soon,” said Sorabh Arora, joint municipal commissioner. The NGT has been monitoring the whole exercise. It has not set any new deadline so far and had asked to kick-start the work as soon as possible. The MC had told during a review meeting, a couple of weeks’ back that they will try to start the source segregation in the city from October 31. An official of the MC revealed that since the sources segregation is already going on in the villages of the city, the authority could not start the same in the city due to rift with the door-to-door garbage collectors. The matter was later settled, however, the project could not pick up pace due to Covid-19 pandemic. Things are under process now. According to information, the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) has received a total of eight bids to purchase 390 twin-bin BS-6 vehicles for the city to lift dry and wet garbage separately. Of these eight bidders, key companies like Tata Motors, Mahindra and Isuzu have also applied for the bid. The estimated cost of these vehicles is Rs 35 crore, but the authority is optimistic to get vehicles at lesser amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/civic-body-to-start-garbage-segregation-by-month-end/articleshow/78543478.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chennai||Farm Laws: Creation of agriculture India private ltd?||By: P Wilson Parliament recently enacted three new laws relating to agriculture with a stated purpose to empower farmers and to engage with agri-business firms on the basis of a mutually agreed remunerative price framework. However, the manner of legislating these acts and the acts themselves have left a bitter taste in the mouths of the people of the country, particularly farmers and agriculturists. Farmers across the country are protesting against the laws, and so are a majority of political parties. The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 are being viewed as "corporatisation of agriculture". In keeping with the recent trend of the Union government to "disinvest" and sell national assets like public sector undertakings and "privatise" successful government corporations, it seems the government has now set its eyes on cashing in on the agricultural sector. The three laws pave the way for giant corporations to swallow up the agricultural sector, and run it like a factory, with a purely profit motive. The ruling party has projected them as being aimed at "freeing" farmers from Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), when only 6% of farmers in the country are selling to APMCs, as per news reports. In fact, the other 94% already have the freedom to contract with whoever they choose. By introducing private players into the market, the government is essentially permitting large corporations to coerce farmers into contracting with them. Though, on paper, farmers have the right to negotiate the contract, in reality, they do not have legal assistance or negotiating know-how. There is no authority that regulates these agreements. Further, the government has not specified in the legislation that the minimum support price fixed by the APMC will be maintained by the private players as well. Hence, the way is being paved for a few favoured corporations to form a cartel and take over the agricultural sector. Section 2(e) of the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, which defines ‘farmer’, shockingly includes within its ambit corporates and middlemen as well. Thus, the intention of these three laws is to hand over the agricultural sector to crony capitalists on a platter, and leave the farmers defenceless. Breach in Parliamentary procedureThe manner of the passage of the laws through the Rajya Sabha is mired in controversy. On the day they were taken up, the Rajya Sabha was functioning with its members seated in both the Lok Sabha chamber and the Rajya Sabha chamber due to the pandemic. The two chambers were connected with a live feed through which the members present in either chamber could view proceedings in the other House through large digital boards. However, when the proceedings were on, the Lok Sabha chamber was completely disconnected and the Hon’ble deputy chairman did not notice the disappearance of the Lok Sabha chamber from the screens. Thus, when the bill was passed by voice vote, voices of the members in the Lok Sabha chamber were not heard, and as a result it cannot be said to have been legally passed. Therefore, for the first time in Independent India, a bill sailed through a House of Parliament by voice vote when a majority of the voices of the members were not heard by the Chair. Intruding into the state’s domainThese legislations are also ex-facie unconstitutional. Under our Constitution, the domain of Parliament and state legislatures are demarcated under three lists of Schedule VII. According to Article 246 of the Constitution, Parliament can exclusively enact laws on List I, state legislatures exclusively on List II and both of them can pass laws on List III subjects. Agriculture is found at entry 14 of List II, markets at entry 28 and other agriculture related subjects at entries 46,47 and 48. The states are in the best position to take up laws on agriculture since they require local knowledge. With our varied agro-climatic zones and cropping patterns, every region has geography-specific agricultural issues, which need to be dealt specifically by the state. Land is also found at entry 18 of List II. The pith and substance of the farm laws relate to agriculture and rights over farmland and its produce. Thus, as per Article 246(3), it is a subject over which the state legislatures alone can enact laws. The new farm laws are therefore a direct affront to, and a perverse intrusion into, the exclusive domain of the state. Such an incursion upsets the well-established federal structure of the country. Objecting to this, DMK president M K Stalin has directed the filing of a writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the three laws. He has also called upon the chief minister of Tamil Nadu to challenge them as they eviscerate the state legislature of its Constitutional authority. One can only hope that sustained pressure on all fronts causes the Centre to repeal the three enactments and save farmers.

October 8, 2020||Jaipur||Civic polls: BJP MLAs pull strings in key affairs||JAIPUR: Though Supreme Court is yet to deliver its verdict on date of holding municipal elections, aspirants for ticket in BJP have started thronging the party headquarters. According to sources, ticket seekers allege that this year interference by the MLAs has increased significantly. With the increase in number of wards from 91 to 250, geographical boundary of wards has decreased and importance of councillors seems to have gone down. Sources in the party said, “Earlier, in one legislative assembly area, there used to have around 10 councillors and if six councillors opposed an MLA, he used to be worried. Now, in one legislative assembly ward, there are 40 councillors. So, the MLA has become decision maker this time.” This has created problems in the party. A district head of BJP recently resigned from his post because he was supporting to appoint party workers who have worked on ground in the formation of working committee. “There are 21 members in the working committee and there are 10 legislative assembly seats. Sitting MLA and former MLA, wanted to appoint two members of each of their choice. However, former district head objected to it, but due to pressure from the MLA, he has to ultimately resign from his post. He wanted party workers who have better field experience to come forward,” said a source. Party is specifically concerned about its position in the Walled City area as all the current MLAs are from the Congress. Sources in the party said that the BJP also wants elections to be postponed as due to pandemic the urban voters are not expected to come out of their houses to vote. “Victory in the six newly created municipal corporations will be statement by both the parties and none of them wants to lose. With low turnout, situation will become problematic. So, the BJP wants elections to be postponed, but till the final decision, party has started churning out plans for it,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civic-polls-bjp-mlas-pull-strings-in-key-affairs/articleshow/78542138.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Jaipur||Compost machines in Jaipur parks defunct||JAIPUR: More than six months have passed and the 70 compost machines installed in various parks of Jaipur are yet to start functioning. These machines were put up in the parks by Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) to create organic manure from green waste from the gardens. However, the tender to the firm for operation and maintenance of the machines has expired and fresh ones are yet to be invited. A senior JMC officer anonymously said, “These compost machines were installed in 2018 but for the last six months, they are not in use because the tender has expired. We are soon going to issue fresh tenders for it.” There have been reports that in more than 40% parks, the machines were not functioning even when the tender was enforced. Imran Ali, caretaker of a park in Tilak Nagar said that the machine was never used since its installation in the park. “Initially, some people started using it but after some time, it was lying in the park as it is. No manure was made from this machine. To save it from dust, I have put a plastic sheet over it, but it’s not of much use,” said Ali. JMC officials do not have any data on how much manure the previous firm has created or in how many parks they have made manure. Still no action has been taken against the firm for not maintaining the machines. “We got the information that the firm is not making the manure and how it is neglecting its responsibility. Hence, this time we will be including a clause while inviting tenders that they will have to give a report on the daily manure production or else they will not be paid for the maintenance of the machines,” said an official anonymously. One machine costs around Rs 80,000, which makes the entire project for compost machines to be worth more than Rs 55 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/compost-machines-in-city-parks-defunct/articleshow/78542143.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Varanasi||Vulture conservation centre will promote ecotourism: CM||GORAKHPUR: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath laid the foundation of ‘Jatayu Conservation Centre’ — India’s first vulture breeding and conservation centre — in Maharajganj on Wednesday and said the facility will promote ecotourism in the area and increase livelihood opportunities. After laying the foundation of the first king vulture breeding and conservation centre coming up in five hectares at Bhari Baisi village in Farenda range of Gorakhpur forest division virtually from Lucknow, the CM said, “Conservation of environment and ecosystem is necessary and possible only by maintaining cleanliness. “Vultures are natural cleansers of land as Dolphins are natural cleaners of water. Vulture is a symbol of cleanliness and purification.” “The environment is not just confined to man but all living beings are a part of it and play a role in strengthening the ecosystem. We need to protect the environment and nature through conservation,” he added. Referring to Ramayana, the CM said, “As per Ramayana, during Ram Rajya, communication and coordination was established between man and animals like monkey, bear, and the descendants of vultures.” The conservation of wildlife is needed at a time when the population of mankind is increasing. We already have a crocodile conservation centre at Kukrail in UP and a vulture conservation centre at Maharajganj is an excellent initiative in this direction, the CM said at the concluding function of Wildlife Week 2020. Wildlife Week is celebrated every year in India from October 1 to 8. The annual theme of the campaign is to promote the preservation of fauna i.e. animal life. The regional forest officer, Gorakhpur range, Avinash Kumar said, “Before the online foundation laying of the vulture conservation centre, Bhoomi Poojan was performed at the spot. Local MLA Bajrang Bahadur Singh and district magistrate Maharajganj Dr Ujjwal Kumar were present on the occasion. The government has sanctioned the first installment of Rs 82 lakh for the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vulture-conservation-centre-will-promote-ecotourism-cm/articleshow/78541192.cms||Arjumand Bano
October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||AMC’s green project bonds oversubscribed by 5.42 times||Ahmedabad: In January 2019, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) raised Rs 200 crore for ‘green projects’ by issuing municipal bonds. The funds were to be used for waste management, water supply and other infrastructure projects, including cleaning of the Sabarmati river. A fresh report from the finance department of the civic body claims that the AMC’s bond issue was oversubscribed by 5.42 times, with the AMC receiving Rs 1,085 crore worth of subscriptions from 19 institutions. This was the fifth time the AMC has successfully raised funds by issuing municipal bonds.A senior AMC official told TOI that in 2017 the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had eased rules governing the issuing of municipal bonds. The civic body had listed its bonds on the National Stock Exchange for projects that were to be implemented under the central government’s AMRUT scheme. “Municipal bonds are debt securities mainly with the purpose of raising funds from the public and in return, investors are paid back their principal amount with interest,” says the AMC official. Merchant bankers Tipsons and State Bank of India Capital Markets had given technical assistance for listing of the bonds. “With a maturity period of five years, the bonds will pay interest of 8.7 per cent,” adds the official. The bonds received an AA+ rating from a global (CRISIL) and an Indian (India Ratings) credit ratings agency in 2018-2019. “But because of the Covid pandemic we may have some problems as many projects have suffered,” said the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amcs-green-project-bonds-oversubscribed-by-5-42-times/articleshow/78542150.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||Dumping ground fire leaves residents gasping for breath in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: After a major fire broke out the Dadu Majra dumping ground on Tuesday afternoon, residents living in the nearby areas claimed that they faced a lot of difficulty due to the foul smell as well the smoke. Om Pal, a resident of Dadu Majra, said “Even after a day, the situation is worse here. We have been facing breathing issues due to the fire as well as the smoke.” The fire erupted on Tuesday afternoon and according to the officials, around 20 fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames. President of the Sector 38 (west) resident welfare association Pankaj Gupta said, “The whole sector was covered in smoke since the fire took place, but with time its effect reduced. Each resident made sure to keep the windows of their houses shut. We could see the carbon particles in the air in the morning.” After talking to the locals of Dadu Majra, it came to light that the smoke reached the Dadu Majra colony and not the village area due to the wind movement. 21-year-old Shubham, a resident of Dadu Majra, said, “This incident repeats after every six months. Residents living in front of the dumping ground are the worst affected as even while sitting inside their homes, they face difficulty in breathing.” Due to the close proximity, the worst affected area was the Dadu Majra colony followed by other nearby sectors such as sectors 38 (west), 39, 37 and 15. Most of the sectors of the west division were covered in smoke. It is a long battle between the residents of the area as well as the government officials as the residents have been demading that the dumping ground should be shifted elsewhere as it forces them to live under unhygienic conditions. They have been facing the issue of foul smell from a long time now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dumping-ground-fire-leaves-residents-gasping-for-breath/articleshow/78543487.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Madurai||PM kisan scam: Madras HC seeks details of cases registered, arrests made||MADURAI: Taking a serious view of the malpractices taking place in schemes implemented for the farmers, the Madras high court on Wednesday observed that farmers have become orphans since nobody is bothered about their welfare. The court also sought details with regard to the numbers of cases registered and the number of people arrested in connection with Prime Minister Kisan scheme scam in the state. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by A Sivaperumal, an agriculturalist and resident of Nallamannarkottai village in Dindigul district. The petitioner stated that there are several irregularities in the allotment of subsidy in the farmers’ schemes. He stated that an assistant agricultural officer had provided subsidy and loans to several ineligible farmers at Nallamannarkottai and E Cithur villages. The official had also left out the names of eligible farmers and had enrolled the names of several ineligible farmers under the PM Kisan scheme. Since no steps were taken on the representation submitted to the authorities, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking action against the assistant agricultural officer. A division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that though several schemes have been implemented by the central and state governments, the status of farmers remains the same as the schemes are not reaching them. The judges observed while the schemes are implemented for the welfare of the farmers, many officials have unjustly enriched themselves by making use of these schemes. Observing that agriculture is the only sector where farmers are not able to fix prices for their produce despite the hardwork put in by them, the judges said that the petition has been filed at the right time about such irregularities where the PM Kisan scheme is reaching ineligible people. Stating that the tears of farmers should be wiped out, the judges put forth several queries: schemes implemented by the central and state governments for the benefit of the farmers during the past 10 years; name of the schemes and amount spent by the governments as subsidy, number of farmers who have benefited. The judges also asked about the number of cases registered and number of people arrested in connection with the scam; number of agriculture department officials who were involved in malpractices and if any officials were arrested in the past 10 years; and monitoring mechanism put in place to verify if the schemes are reaching the deserving farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-calls-for-details-of-cases-filed-arrests-in-pm-kisan-scheme-scam/articleshow/78544113.cms||Kaushik Kannan
October 8, 2020||Mangaluru||Fishermen urge PM’s intervention for infusion of technology||UDUPI: Leading fishermen’s associations in Karnataka, under the aegis of Indian Fishermen for Technology Adoption (IFTA), have sought the direct intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the urgent need to adopt new technology in the state’s fishing sector. Taking a cue from similar requests made by boat owners and fishing community leaders from Gujarat to PM Narendra Modi, the state’s fishermen leaders, through IFTA, have made a similar plea. Referring to accidents involving fishing boat Suvarna Tribhuja last year, and Malpe recently, Yashpal Suvarna, president, South Kanara and Udupi district Co-operative Fish Marketing Federation Ltd said it has made fishermen realise that their usual methods of communication and warnings are not adequate to respond to tragedies like these. It is time that India adopts highly-advanced communications and connectivity technologies, he said. The Centre must implement technology adoption via standardising the quality of technology available. “We have tested BSNL’s transponder, which has two-way data communication directly over satellite and works in the deep sea. We urge the PM’s direct intervention and request the government to deploy the latest technology immediately. We need a solution today, as any delay will continue to endanger safety and security of fishermen,” he said. Adoption of next-generation digital and satellite communications technology will raise productivity of fishing harvest and create world-class competitiveness, apart from addressing the immediate and urgent challenge to ensure the safety of the state’s fishermen on the high seas. With the availability of new satellite technology, India today has access to services that can ensure the safety of fishermen through ubiquitous coverage in most adverse conditions. Ganapati Mangre, president The North Kanara District Co-Operative Fish Marketing Federation Ltd, said, “Lives of hundreds and thousands of fishermen are lost at sea every year due to unavailability of modern connectivity technologies such as satellite-based navigation systems. This can connect Indian fishermen with mobile devices offering timely SoS alerts and harvesting predictions to ensure better catch and safety while at sea,” he said. “Along with enhancing safety, technology can also help fishermen raise their productivity and enable e-commerce transactions at sea. Through 2–way data systems, it is becoming easier to send fish location data to fishermen at sea, to ensure better supply and demand match, while allowing fishermen to access markets and transact at sea, to maximize the value of their catch,” he said. More fisheries sector stakeholders are backing IFTA in this regard, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/fishermen-urge-pms-intervention-for-infusion-of-technology/articleshow/78540999.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||DEO asks schools to manage work on their own or hire computer operators||CHANDIGARH: District education officer Ravinder Kaur on Wednesday sent out a message to principals and heads of government schools to manage the work of the CBSE registration on their own or hire a computer operator on an hourly basis. The education department also given an option to computer instructors to pay Rs 3,000 to the contractor and continue with their job. In response, the computer instructors have approached the labour commission, the UT administrator and BJP state president Arun Sood to seek justice. The message circulated to school heads, principals and teachers of government schools read, “According to the instructions of Ravinder Kaur, no school will delay or stop the work of the CBSE due to non-availability of computer faculty. It is up to schools to manage and do the work timely. Schools can hire computer operators on an hourly basis.” Besides this, the UT education department held a meeting with the computer instructors on Monday, who were relieved of their services on October 1, to reach a settlement for recruiting them back by paying Rs 3,000 to the contractor. Computer instructors, who have also been teaching for a decade in government schools and giving 100 % results, turned down the offer stating that the contractor keeps on changing and if the practice of paying the contractor begins, then they will have to undergo harassment every time. They even showed resentment over the education department trying to settle the matter on behalf of the contractor. They further said that all the instructors were highly qualified, while the contractor was allegedly recruiting graduates for the post. They have now complained about the issue to UT administrator V P Singh Badnore and BJP state president Arun Sood, seeking their intervention. They stated that they have been facing continuous humiliation in the name of salary delay, no job security and threat of job loss. They further shared that even though they were highly qualified and have been teaching and bringing out 100 % results, they were not being treated on a par with the faculty of the education department. “This is due to the designation that we have been given i.e. computer instructors instead of teacher or faculty. We never got any benefits on a par with the other teaching staff,” they stated in their complaint. They requested for a permanent solution to their problem by merging them in department or by taking them under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/deo-asks-schools-to-manage-work-on-their-own-or-hire-computer-operators/articleshow/78543499.cms||Kamini Mehta

October 8, 2020||Dehradun||Annual Urs at Piran Kaliyar shrine to be held with Covid restrictions||Roorkee: The famous Urs at the Piran Kaliyar shrine near Roorkee, which draws pilgrims from all over the country and even from across borders, is likely to be a low-key event this year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. To attend the event, zaireens (pilgrims) will have to register themselves on the state government's web portal and produce their Covid-19 report not earlier than 72 hours from time of arrival. The 15-day-long annual event at Sabir Baba shrine in Piran Kaliyar is scheduled to start from October 18. A meeting of officials was also held in this regard on Tuesday. “In view of the circumstances prevailing due to Covid-19, we organised religious events like Kanwar Mela and Mauni Amavasya in a symbolic way in Haridwar. Now the country is in the Unlock phase and it will be a new experience for us to organise Piran Kaliyar Urs in a smooth and safe manner,” said Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar. The district administration is set to hold the Urs under the provisions of SOP meant for curtailing the possible spread of pandemic.

October 8, 2020||Goa||Goa coastal body a violator, helping illegalities, says NGT||PANAJI: For the second time within a week, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday slammed the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) for being unresponsive to its directives seeking replies in matters relating to Goa’s coast. The tribunal, in its order, said that the GCZMA’s negligent attitude was indirectly helping illegalities to continue. The NGT also asked for one such violation matter to be transferred to the principal bench of the tribunal in New Delhi, adding that officials such as those in GCZMA should be made liable to pay compensation for harassment to the common man. “When the law protector becomes the law violator, how can law be protected? The basic principle of rule of law is to follow rules/laws and not to break or violate them,” the NGT has said. It also came down heavily on the GCZMA for not taking action in cases of violation of the CRZ notification for decades now. “The notification issued in 1991 has not been complied with till date, and with the conspiracy aid and assistance of GCZMA, the polluters and violators of law are still continuing their activities,” the NGT order reads. “A public functionary, if he acts maliciously or oppressively, and the exercise of power results in harassment and agony — it is not an exercise of power, but its abuse.” “No law provides protection against it. He who is responsible for it must suffer,” the NGT bench said. The order condemns GCZMA officials for ‘harassment of the common man’. Public authorities or officers may be liable in damages for malicious, deliberate or injurious wrong-doing, the NGT has said. The NGT has said that in a suo moto petition, the Goa bench of the Bombay high court in 2006 said the records should be verified to identify structures which existed as of February 19, 1991, and the illegal structures should be demolished as per the CRZ notification. However, the NGT noted that past the timeframe set of 90 days to identify the structures and 60 days to demolish them, the GCZMA has still not acted on this. “There was a condition that if there is an appeal pending, the decision should be awaited,” the NGT said. “In the guise of this pending appeal, the GCZMA promotes only appeal, fails to submit the reply and continuously delays in filing it, thus indirectly helping illegal construction. This has become the business of GCZMA.” It also said that in many old cases, no action is being taken by the GCZMA, and replies are not being filed, and this is highly objectionable and in violation of CRZ Rules. It may be recalled that earlier this week, the NGT had asked GCZMA to pay a nominal fine of Rs 500 for not filing a reply repeatedly in a matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-coastal-body-a-violator-helping-illegalities-says-ngt/articleshow/78544148.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

October 8, 2020||Jaipur||FIR against journalist and Pilot’s media advisor||Jaipur: The state government has registered a case against a journalist and Sachin Pilot’s media advisor for spreading fake news and criminal conspiracy. The matter is regarding the alleged tapping of Congress MLAs’ phones when they were in Jaisalmer during the recent political crisis. The opposition also attacked the government on social media regarding it. The persons named in the FIR are Aaj Tak’s Jaipur-based editor Sharad Kumar and Pilot’s media advisor Lokendra Singh, though they are yet to be questioned.Om Prakash Matwa, SHO, Vidhayakpuri police station where the FIR was lodged told TOI, “We received a complaint that the duo had ran a piece of news claiming that the phones of few of the MLAs were tapped when they were in Jaisalmer. We have started an investigation and will question the accused as well.” The case has been registered under IPC Section 505 (1) (B) which is for spreading false and mischievous content that results in ‘fear or alarm to the public, 505 (2) for statement creating enmity between classes, 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy and IT Act, 2008. The complaint was initially lodged at the cyber crime police station.

During investigation, we found that there was certain truth to the claims after which the FIR was lodged at Vidhayakpuri police station.” Meanwhile, the persons named in the FIR appeared to be baffled about the matter. Kumar, while speaking to TOI said, “All media houses ran the story and I was the last one to carry it so I fail to understand as to why am I being targeted? Moreover, after two months the case has been lodged which in itself is surprising. In fact, I had gone to Jaisalmer myself and demonstrated that mobile jammers were in place near the hotel where the MLAs were residing.” Kumar also claimed that no police officer had contacted him regarding the matter and when he tried to get in touch with them, they all seemed to by passing the buck. According to sources, the DGP and Jaipur police commissioner were asked by the government to inquire and act against people spreading baseless allegations.

October 8, 2020||Chennai||Back-to-back systems over the Bay could delay northeast monsoon||CHENNAI: Back-to-back low pressure systems expected over the Bay of Bengal could delay withdrawal of the southwest monsoon and push northeast monsoon onset to October-end early November. The southwest monsoon normally withdraws by October 15 and northeast monsoon sets in around October 20 with a deviation of seven days. Prof Sridhar Balasubramanian, climate expert, IIT Bombay, said the monsoon trough is still active over central India as a low pressure area expected to form on October 9 is likely to enter central India and then west coast. Another low pressure area, from South China Sea, is likely to move into Bay of Bengal on October 15 and could enter central India. These systems are likely to reduce the number of active NE monsoon days for Tamil Nadu and south India. A regional meteorological centre forecast said a fresh low pressure area is likely over north Andaman Sea and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal on October 9. It is very likely to strengthen into a depression over central Bay of Bengal before it is likely to move west-northwest-wards and cross north Andhra Pradesh and adjoining south Odisha in the afternoon or evening on October 11. Prof Balasubramanian added that the delay in monsoon withdrawal was due to the prevailing La Nina conditions in the Pacific and the strong equatorial dynamics persisting in India which is not allowing the southwest monsoon current or axis to move down south. The South Asian Climate Outlook Forum, a consortium of meteorologists from south Asian countries, earlier said north Tamil Nadu including Chennai may receive normal rain while Tamil Nadu’s southern coastal districts may receive below normal rainfall this season. N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD, said an indication of northeast monsoon onset is a persistent flow of northeast winds but now there is a strong flow of northwesterly or westerly winds. “Northeast monsoon will definitely commence after October 25. In 2018 too, we had a delayed monsoon when it commenced in November.” Y E A Raj, former deputy director general of IMD, said forecast charts show the reversal of winds from westerlies to easterlies may not happen till October 17. “There could be some delay in the onset of NE monsoon. But sometimes easterlies may come on October 17 or 18 and within two days NE monsoon could come with a bang. We will know the condition only after a week…,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/back-to-back-systems-over-the-bay-could-delay-ne-monsoon/articleshow/78542176.cms||U Tejonmayam
October 8, 2020||Dehradun||Doon schools oppose proposal to continue online classes after reopening||Dehradun: The management of several private schools in Dehradun have opposed the proposal to continue with the online classes once they are reopened. The schools claim that it is not possible for teachers to spend six hours in the school and then again spend another few hours teaching students through online mode. Recently, the education department had issued orders to reopen schools after discussing with all the stakeholders. The department had stated that the option for online education should be available irrespective of whether the schools are being reopened or not as every student won’t be comfortable in coming to the school in such times. Regarding this matter, the members of the Principal Progressive Schools Association (PPSA) had met the education secretary in which they raised other issues pertaining to the private schools of Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, the parent bodies have made it clear that they won’t send their children until a vaccine for Covid-19 isn’t available. They have clarified that they will only send their children if the schools take the responsibility in case a student catches the Covid-19 infection. However, the private schools have stated that they are not willing to take the blame for any such case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-schools-oppose-proposal-to-continue-online-classes-after-reopening/articleshow/78541046.cms||Mohammad Anab

October 8, 2020||Goa||Opposition misleading people on Mollem: Goa CM||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday blamed the opposition for trying to mislead locals regarding the three major projects at Mollem in the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary. Sawant, who two months earlier said that people living abroad were behind the protests, appeared to mock the ongoing Mollem Bachao campaign. “Has someone come to eat Mollem?” said Sawant at a function organised by EDC. “This (Mollem Bachao campaign) is to create confusion in the minds of people. Some people have an agenda to mislead people. The way people are talking it looks like there is a fire at Mollem and we have to send a fire brigade,” the chief minister said. Subtly pointing fingers at the opposition, Sawant said that clear attempts were being made to mislead and confuse people regarding the Mollem projects and diversion of water from the Mhadei basin. On Tuesday, GFP president and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said that the state government is sleeping and had presented photographic evidence to suggest that Karnataka has diverted water. “There are some who want to fool the people. See in the case of Mhadei also. Nobody is speaking about the facts and they don’t want the facts. On all issues people want to play politics and oppose,” Sawant said. Sawant refused to make any additional comment on the Mhadei water dispute and declined to react to Karnataka’s stand that despite Goa’s contempt petition before the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government will continue with the Rs 500 crore Mhadei project. “I have cleared the state government’s stand. There will be no compromise. We are strong,” he said. Sawant said that the government is sensitive to people’s concerns, including environmental ones. “There are some people who simply say that the government does not listen. We listen to everyone and we address all the concerns, whether it is about EDC, IIT or the environment,” the chief minister said. Earlier, EDC chairman and state BJP president Sadanand Tanavade blamed NGOs for opposing every development project in the state. “In Goa there is a trend that when anything new is announced, quite a few new NGOs also pop up. Goa has plenty of NGOs which choose not to support projects for Goa’s development and progress, but are ready to object to them,” Tanavade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-misleading-people-on-mollem-cm/articleshow/78544149.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Pune||Crime rise due to post-lockdown job loss, prisoners’ release: Pune top cop||PUNE: Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Wednesday said there was a “slight” spurt in crime in the city for reasons ranging from post-lockdown unemployment to the release of undertrials and convicted prisoners on temporary bail or emergency parole as part of an exercise to decongest jails to check the spread of Covid-19. Over the past three months, 260 undertrials and convicted prisoners from Pune have come to the city after being released on temporary bail or emergency parole from different jails across the state. Some of them have been rearrested and sent back to jail for their involvement in fresh crimes, including murders, attempted murder and robberies. After opening up of the lockdown, the city has witnessed a spate of street crimes such as chain and cellphone snatching, carjacking and armed robberies. A builder and a politician were among five persons murdered over the last 10 days. Speaking in this context, Gupta told TOI he had no immediate data to back his observation about unemployment and release from jails, but there were indications to these matters which the police were closely examining. A senior police officer requesting anonymity said, “Our statistics show that out of the 260 criminals and convicts released from jails, action has been taken against four for their involvement in new crimes. They have been sent back to jail.” The officer said, “Incidents relating to snatching of cellphones and (gold) chains, burglaries and vehicle thefts have slightly increased partly due to the financial distress caused by the lockdown and its effect on the financially weaker sections of society who are grappling with issues of unemployment and loss of income.” The officer added, “In many cases, young people have started committing petty crimes out of frustration and the need to support their families, medical and other problems. The Covid-related duties and a large number of police personnel testing positive has led to a spike in crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crime-rise-due-to-post-lockdown-job-loss-prisoners-release-pune-top-cop/articleshow/78543552.cms||Asseem Shaikh

October 8, 2020||Dehradun||World Eyesight Day: Work from home, online classes taking toll on eyes||Dehradun: As the outbreak of coronavirus is limiting people to remain within the confines of homes, their daily on-screen time has increased dramatically, putting great stress on eyes. Ophthalmologists, who are witnessing a surge in the number of patients with eye-related ailments, say that long hours of screen time, often without break, due to ‘work from home’ and ‘online classes’ is badly affecting the eyesight of people, especially of students and teachers. Talking to TOI on the occasion of World Eyesight day, observed on the second Thursday in the month of October, Dr Gaurav Luthra from Drishti Eye Institute says that people are facing issues with eyes but are scared to come to hospitals because of the fear of contracting Covid-19. “A lot of people who have serious eye ailments like cataract, glaucoma, among others, need regular care and yet they are postponing treatment due to the pandemic. This lets the situation become grave. Consequently, a lot of emergency cases are coming now as long delays in check-ups are creating complications in already existing diseases. Sometimes, patients come with irreversible damages. For instance, we are seeing patients with cataracts which are ready to burst. Thus, I urge people to go for regular eye check-ups,” he added. Dr Vinod Arora from Navjyoti Eye Hospital claimed that among the average 40 patients who he sees in the OPD daily, 50% are students, who are taking online classes, and the rest are mostly professional working from home due to the pandemic. “The profile of people who used to come to my clinics has changed in the past few months as most of those coming in the OPDs are youngsters who are working from home, students who are attending online class, and teachers who are conducting online sessions. Most cases these days are related to computer vision syndrome,” he said. Eye doctors say that the emergency cases related to eye ailments have also increased during the pandemic. They add that such issues have especially increased among the elderlies as they have been avoiding eye check-ups due to the pandemic and only go to doctors when the situation becomes grave. Talking about the ways to reduce the adverse effects on the eyes due to excess screen time, Dr Chirag Bahuguna, eye surgeon at Gandhi Shatabdi Hospital, said that people should follow the 20-20 rule and intentional blinking. “The 20-20 rule means while working on screen for long hours, one should take a break after every 20 minutes and look at any object 20 feet away for 20 seconds. People should also keep blinking as it helps eyes a lot. So, we should intentionally blink in order to relax the eyes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/world-eyesight-day-work-from-home-online-classes-taking-toll-on-eyes/articleshow/78541069.cms||Ishita Mishra
October 8, 2020||Kanpur||Court admits Sunni Waqf Board’s petition with fine||Times News Network Slug: KVT-Gyanvapi Mosque Case Varanasi: The court of the district judge accepted the delayed petition of UP Sunni Central Waqf Board in Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi mosque dispute with a fine on Tuesday and fixed the next hearing on October 13. The Sunni Waqf Board had filed a revision petition in the court on September 18. Accepting the petition, the district judge Umesh Chandra Sharma had directed the Board to deposit fine for the delay within a week. The petitioner had pleaded that as the case is related to waqf tribunal, it should be heard in Lucknow Waqf court. In December, 2019, Advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi had filed an application on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar in the court of civil judge, requesting for a survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). He had filed the petition as the next friend of the deity Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar. In January, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had filed an objection in the court against the petition seeking survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound (premises) by ASI. The first petition on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar was filed in the local court in 1991 seeking permission for worship in Gyanvapi. The petitioner had contended that the Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2,050 years ago, but was razed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 and the temple remains were used to construct Gyanvapi masjid on the land. The petitioner had requested the court to issue directives for the removal of the mosque from temple land and give back its possession to the temple trust. The petition contended that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on the suit as the mosque was constructed over a partly demolished temple and many parts of the temple exist even today. In 1998, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee moved the high court saying the mandir-masjid dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by the law. The high court stayed the proceedings in lower court which continued for the past 22 years. In February this year, the petitioners approached the lower court again with a plea to resume the hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/court-admits-sunni-waqf-boards-petition-with-fine/articleshow/78541279.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Vadodara||Vadodara: Overawed by web series, girls flee for acting career||VADODARA: Watching web series on over-the-top (OTT) platforms got so entrenched in their minds that two cousin sisters resorted to an escapade to fulfil their burning desire to make a career in acting. Both aged 14, the girls living in Manjalpur, embarked on their journey to Bollywood hub Mumbai, all by themselves on Tuesday afternoon. But this few hours of adventure turned out to be short-lived as they were traced and reunited with their parents late in the night. The girls were traced in Jhagadiya near Bharuch where they had returned from Vapi after getting a whiff of police being hot on their trail. But the drama did not end at Jhagadiya as they called up their parents and informed them that they have been kidnapped. “The girls told their parents over the phone that they were very frightened and asked them to pick them up,” a police official said. The kidnapping story was concocted as they feared getting a dressing down on returning home. With the help of Bharuch police, both girls were found and brought back to Vadodara. “The girls told us that their only intention was to go to Mumbai and become actresses and that they were overawed by several web series,” the official added. The cousins had gone to school to submit answer sheets but did not return home. When the worried parents checked at the school, they found their scooter parked outside, but the girls were not there. The parents then approached police to help trace them. When cops tracked their mobile phones’ locations, they were found to be in Vapi. “We immediately sent a team from Vadodara and alerted Vapi police too. But they got suspicious and decided to return,” said a police official. When police questioned them, they said that they took a GSRTC bus to reach Surat and from there they went to Vapi. As they suspected that the parents had started searching them along with cops, they took a bus back to Jhagadia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/wannabe-actors-flee-home-traced/articleshow/78541138.cms||---

Saurabh Bhardwaj, a rescuer at the Wildlife Care Centre in Bodakdev recalls the rescue of three baby monkeys stranded on a 150-foot high water tank. Bhardwaj said, “The operation in the first week of July was difficult as the monkeys were not falling for any ruse of ours. We had put fruits on each rung of the ladder hoping they would then climb down the ladder, but they didn’t. I then decided to climb down on to the parapet where they were. As I got close to catch one monkey, it jumped, but thankfully it landed on the net.” Another rescuer, Rakesh Bharwad, had to get into a fire to save a python. “We received a call from Dhadhukha village in Sanand taluka in the last week of April. The farmer had burnt his agricultural waste and then realised that a python was caught in the fire. We managed to find the python in the field and it is now ready to be released back,” said Bharwad. The rescuers said that during the monsoon they get a lot of calls to rescue blackbuck that get stuck in fields and get mauled by dogs. “During the monsoon, the fields in Dholka are full of water and blackbuck get stuck in the fields and get bitten by dogs. The Bodakdev centre also gets calls after accidents to save animals such as neelgai and their young,” said Bharwad. The number of rescue operations increased during the lockdown. In the six month since April, 658 animals have been rescued. Sakkira Begum, deputy conservator of forests, social forestry division, Ahmedabad, said that the seven rescuers on average rescued some 115 animals in seven months. She said that in all 35 different species of wildlife including neelgai, blackbuck, porcupine, monkeys, peacock were saved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wildlife-rescue-centre-saves-798-animals-in-7-months/articleshow/78542201.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||Amdavadis caught red light handed||AHMEDABAD: Amdavadis usually brag that their signal-jumping exploits are never spotted by cops. But traffic police claim that every minute an Amdavadi is caught jumping a traffic signal, according to the database of violations. The figures obtained from the city traffic police indicate that from January 1 to September 16 this year, at least 8,643 cases of jumping red lights were registered. Cops collected Rs 43.23 lakh in fines from the offenders. The offences continued even during the Covid lockdown’s strictest period of about two months. Apart from that, police registered 6,758 cases of stop-line violations and fines to the tune of Rs 33.84 lakh were recovered. Recently, a study analyzed 38.66 lakh e-challans issued between April 2018 and July 2020. The findings suggested that Amdavadis beat Delhiites in jumping red lights. The study was carried out by International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad; and Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi. It revealed that in Delhi, 5.32 lakh vehicle owners jumped traffic lights; in Ahmedabad, the figure was 25.35 lakh. Ahmedabad traffic police officers said that though people believe that they evaded cops, their violations are often caught by the city’s vast network of about 6,000 CCTV cameras. Deputy commissioner of police, traffic (admin), Tejas Patel said that people in Ahmedabad have a tendency to jump signals and cross stop lines because of their impatience. “Jumping red lights increases the chance of an accident to the extent of 70%,” said Patel. “A fatal accident involving a BRTS bus and two motorcycle-borne men occurred on November 21, 2019. The two men on the bike died. It was a clear case of jumping the signal leading to deaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadis-caught-red-light-handed/articleshow/78542131.cms||Ashish Chauhan

October 8, 2020||Chennai||Patients have it hardas road near cancerinstitute is dug up||Chennai: Patients and visitors have been having a hard time getting to the Cancer Institute WIA on West Canal Bank Road in Adyar since a part of the road is dug up and battered for the past two weeks. This has been hindering traffic flow and emergency services as ambulances often get caught in the traffic. “We hear complaints either from visitors of patients every day, especially from those who come to the daycare centers. There is no place for them to walk either since the pavements are dug up,” said an official from the cancer institute. The road was dug up about two weeks ago by local authorities to repair sewer lines. However, officials from the institute and residents of the area said though most of the work has been completed, the pit remains open. “Since the work started, we have been requesting and reminding authorities to relay the roads and not leave it open since this area sees a lot of pedestrian and traffic movement. Though they assured to fix it once the work is complete, nothing has been done so far,” said T Priyadarshini, a resident of the 3rd Canal Cross Road. A few days ago, an ambulance going out to rescue a patient almost toppled due to the ditch outside the hospital. “Luckily, there was no patient was inside. It was difficult to even step out because the road at the entrance gate was dug open,” the official from the institute said. Fed up, workers at the institute themselves filled the pit outside their gate after informing the local civic authorities. “I hope they are not expecting us to fill the rest of the road as well,” he said. Apart from the hindrance, residents also complained of the dust pollution it has lead to, and added that it gives them a headache sometimes. A local official from zone 13 said there are some more repairs left to do after which they will relay the road in a few days’ time. “The parts that are deterring movement outside the hospital will be filled immediately,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/patients-have-it-hardas-road-near-cancerinstitute-is-dug-up/articleshow/78542217.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 8, 2020||Goa||Govt delay in auctioning SEZ land costs GIDC Rs 3.5cr/mnth||Panaji: Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) is paying Rs 3.5 crore per month as interest on a short-term loan due to the delay in auctioning the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) land, RTI documents have revealed. The industries department’s delay in finalising the property consultant and auctioning off a portion of the 38.4 lakh sqm is bleeding GIDC of precious funds. In May 2019, GIDC took a short-term loan of Rs 200 crore from the Oriental Bank of Commerce to repay the seven SEZ promoters and was paying Rs 1.2 crore per month till December 2019. “GIDC had a one-year moratorium on the repayment of the principal amount which ended in May 2020, post which GIDC will have to make monthly payments of approximately Rs 3.5 crore,” said a document obtained through RTI from GIDC’s accounts division. GIDC chairman Glen Ticlo told TOI that the corporation has commenced paying a higher instalment. “I will be meeting chief minister Pramod Sawant regarding auctioning of the SEZ land because we have to repay the loan,” Ticlo said. On December 30, 2019, the industries department asked GIDC to auction the SEZ land in order to repay the loan. “The government has decided that the auctioning of the SEZ land be done immediately within a time frame before the moratorium starts, which Goa-IDC will not be in a position to clear,” industries under-secretary A S Mahatme said in a subsequent letter in January. The government then constituted a selection committee headed by the industries secretary and a monitoring committee headed by the industries minister to appoint a property consultant to auction the SEZ land. GIDC officials say the search for a reputed property consultant is yet to begin because the industries department is yet to approve the tender document. Last fortnight, Ticlo had said that the government’s constant interference in the functioning of GIDC is affecting the corporation’s efficiency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-delay-in-auctioning-sez-land-costs-gidc-rs-3-5cr/mnth/articleshow/78544151.cms||Newton Sequeira

October 8, 2020||Goa||Margao Residency to shut as care centre||MARGAO: With the state government having taken over 200 rooms in a number of hotels to serve as isolation facilities for health workers since the last four months, the Margao Residency at Margao, which was designated as a Covid care centre exclusively for health workers and government employees has been lying underutilized. Consequently, South Goa district collector Ajit Roy has now issued directions for closure of the isolation facility at Margao Residency once the patients currently admitted there are discharged upon completion of their isolation period. District administration officials said that no health worker was quarantined at the Margao Residency ever since it was set up as a Covid care centre. The state tourism department-run hotel has now stopped accepting new admissions. With several Covid care centres functioning below capacity, the move to close down Margao Residency was aimed at utilising resources efficiently, Roy told TOI. Margao Residency presently has 32 patients admitted. “Now that we have a policy of home isolation, hardly anybody is opting for Covid care centres. Hence, we don’t feel the need for this centre,” Roy told TOI. South Goa will now have just three Covid care centres — the primary health centre at Shiroda, MPT hospital at Mormugao and IIT hostel at Farmagudi. These three facilities have a combined capacity of 640, beds of which only 340 are currently occupied. “We have excess capacity. We must use our resources efficiently. We can’t have wastage in our system. As this is a public resource, we need to economise,” Roy reasoned. Following the closure of the Margao facility, those needing institutional isolation, including government servants and health workers, will be admitted in other Covid care centres. The South Goa district administration has already closed down two other Covid care centres — the one operating out of the sports complex at Fatorda was shut on August 31, while the one functioning at Colva Residency was closed on September 11. In North Goa, Panjim Residency has been designated as the Covid care centre for government officials and health care workers testing positive while discharging their duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-residency-to-shut-as-care-centre/articleshow/78544154.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The decision was taken at a meeting of UP Parents Association and Unaided Private Schools’ Association (UPSA) convened by district magistrate Abhishek Prakash on Wednesday. As per the decision, students who wish to attend classes will be allowed to do so only after furnishing a written approval from their parents. Online classes will continue simultaneously for students opting to study from home. “It has been decided that initially classes 10 and 12 standards will resume amid strict Covid-19 safety protocol. On the basis of the feedback and experience, classes 9 and 11 will resume in the second phase. Classes of junior students will start at a later stage,” the DM said. He said there would be no morning assembly and classes would be held in two shifts of three hours each for six days a week. “It will be mandatory for schools to have hand sanitizers and a medical room with two beds. Schools will have to be equipped with medical kits having pulse oximeters, thermal scanners and the staff should have the knowledge to use them. Temperature and pulse of students will be checked at the time of entry and exit,” the DM added. Sanitization of campus, classes, washrooms and playgrounds will have to be done daily.

October 8, 2020||Chennai||Tangedco does a U-turn on its 2019 GO||CHENNAI: Giving a quiet burial to its new rule that mandated officials to give electricity connections to buildings only if they have building completion certificate, Tangedco has issued a circular to its field officials to revert to the earlier system. This U-turn within three months of the passage of the new rule has riled up consumer activists, who said it is contempt of court and will make it easy for illegal constructions to flourish. “The more worrying thing is that Tangedco has not provided any reason for reverting back to the old system in its recent circular,” said K Kathirmathiyon, a consumer activist from Coimbatore. Though a government order (GO) was passed in February 2019, the rules came into effect from July 2020. The GO mandated that for all buildings except residential and industrial buildings, the applicant should submit a completion report to obtain completion certificate, certifying that the building has been completed as per the approved plan. The GO was passed in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, after the Madras high court pulled up the state government for flourishing illegal constructions in the state and directed the state government to take a tough stand on the matter. Kathirmathiyon said it was hard to fight all illegal constructions in court and that the GO would have helped avoid illegal commercial constructions in the future. “Now, with this circular, the Tangedco is going soft on such violators,” said the activist. When questioned about the reason behind the detour, a senior official with the distribution wing of Tangedco said, “We have been given instructions to follow the old procedure instead of insisting on completion certificate till further instructions.” The official, however, maintained that in areas under CMDA (Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority), they are insisting on completion certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tangedco-does-a-u-turn-on-its-2019-go/articleshow/78542192.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

October 8, 2020||Nagpur||NMC allows BJP banner on ambulance at Covid special camp||Nagpur: Displaying BJP banner on a civic body’s ambulance during a special camp organized for collection of swab samples of high-risk contacts of Covid patients and comorbids in ward no. 34 has raised a political storm in the city. Opposition parties have accused Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials and employees of allowing the BJP workers to use the ambulance for displaying the party’s banner having its leaders photos. TOI has picture in which the banner on the ambulance claims BJP unit of ward no-34 has organized the RT-PCR camp. The banner also highlighted pictures of BJP leaders and corporator Nagesh Mankar. The camp was inaugurated by Mankar, co-opted corporator Kishor Wankhede, who is also president of BJP unit of South-West Nagpur and others from the party. With the decline in testing, the civic body has started to hold special camps in residential areas. The NMC is taking the help of corporators, NGOs and community leaders to encourage high-risk contacts and persons with comorbid conditions to get the tests done. When his attention was drawn to the BJP banner on ambulance, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “It is not acceptable. I have already sent strong directions to all field officials not to indulge or permit such things in future.” In a few camps, BJP’s banners were placed near the sample collection centres. NCP state vice-president Vedprakash Arya condemned NMC officials for allowing BJP banner on ambulance and permitting the party to engage in publicity at Covid-19 testing camps. “Special camps used to be organized when Tukaram Mundhe was municipal commissioner. Special camps were not held when they were required most in the last two weeks of August and first three weeks of September. How can NMC administration allow BJP leaders to do party’s publicity,” he questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-allows-bjp-banner-on-ambulance-at-covid-special-camp/articleshow/78548881.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
October 8, 2020||Allahabad||HC: Officers not complying with orders at 1st instance||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has expressed concern that officers of the state are not complying with the orders passed by this court at the first instance. As a result, the aggrieved parties are forced to file contempt petition to get the orders complied with. Coming down heavily on the officers of the state for wilful disobedience of court’s order, the court observed, “Apparently, the officers are becoming habitual and not complying with the orders of this court at the first instance. This is a sorry state of affairs.” Hearing a contempt petition filed by Smt Usha Singh, Justice Vivek Kumar Birla observed, “This court is noticing everyday that apparently the officers concerned, who were directed to act as per the order of the court, are not complying with the orders at the first instance and the aggrieved party is forced to file contempt application and even after granting further time to comply with the order of the writ court passed in contempt application, the orders not being complied with.” The present contempt application was filed for punishing the opposite parties – Satrughan Singh, director, Bal Vikas Sewa and another — for wilful disobedience of the judgment and order of this court dated November 1, 2019, and the order dated March 2, 2020, passed in contempt application. It has been stated by the counsel for the applicant that a copy of the order of the court dated November 1, 2019, was served to the opposite party. When nothing was done, the applicant filed the above noted contempt application. The contempt court, vide order dated March 2, 2020, had granted time for compliance of the order of this court. It was alleged that even after the service of the order of contempt court and after expiry of time, no decision has yet been taken by the opposite parties. Taking a serious note of it, the court observed, “Prima facie, a case for punishing the opposite party for willful disobedience of the orders as noted above is made out. It is expected that the opposite parties shall make every effort to comply with the order at the first instance and shall also issue necessary orders in this regard to the subordinate authorities to strictly comply with the orders at the first instance itself, otherwise the court will take serious view of the matter.” The order was passed on September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-officers-not-complying-with-orders-at-1st-instance/articleshow/78542089.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Agarwal who is a 2010-batch officer hails from Uttar Pradesh and had previously been the SP in Barmer as well. He has also had subsequent posting in Jaipur. According to sources, the SP had allegedly called an accused in a rape case and asked him to shell out money to take care of the matter. “The SP had apparently asked the accused for Rs 25 lakh but the latter did not pay up and instead went to the authorities following which the probe started. The officer had supposedly threatened to arrest the accused if he did not pay up though the veracity of the allegations is being looked into,” said a senior police officer.Senior police officers working with Agarwal also claimed that they had received a forwarded complaint regarding him. An officer said, “The vigilance department is handling the investigation and we are not in the know-how of what details they found in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vigilance-dept-probing-allegations-against-sp-dausa/articleshow/78542207.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Jaipur||Two more accused arrested in Sawai Madhopur’s sex racket||JAIPUR: Two more persons was arrested in the alleged sex racket in Sawai Madhopur where a minor girl was forced to have physical relations with people in exchange for money. Cops had previously arrested five people, including a former BJP office-bearer and have now arrested the hotel owner where the girl was raped. The Special Operations Group (SOG) is also monitoring the investigation as there is a possibility that it could be an organised crime. Sawai Madhopur SP Sudheer Choudhary told TOI, “The hotel owner was arrested after it was found that the girl was raped at his establishment. Her name is in the hotel register as well and he must have known that she was a minor. The other person arrested is the one who allegedly raped her.” This person had apparently contested the panchayat elections as an independent candidate. The accused as well as the complainant are all locals of Sawai Madhopur. The case had also gained political momentum as the accused involved persons from Congress and BJP. Meanwhile, SOG is also keeping a vigil in the matter though the investigation is still with the district police. Ashok Rathore, ADG, SOG and ATS, added, “We are monitoring the investigation essentially to find if this is a case of organised crime. On Wednesday, we sent an additional SP rank woman officer to Sawai Madhopur to be a part of the investigating team.” The accused had been arrested after a minor girl lodged a case on September 22 alleging that the accused, including former BJP office-bearer Sunita Verma, forced her to have physical relationship with people in exchange for money. Till now seven people have been arrested in the matter, though cops are yet to arrest Poonam Choudhary, who is also allegedly involved in the sex racket and is apparently part of the local Congress unit though none of the party leaders seem to have any knowledge of her. Poonam was the one who befriended the girl and apparently told her that she would help her. On August 4, Verma had attempted to send the girl to Jaipur. The girl alleged that after the first sexual assault, the accused made a video and continued to blackmail her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-more-accused-arrested-in-sawai-madhopurs-sex-racket/articleshow/78542196.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
October 8, 2020||Meerut||Qualification no bar: UP jails have highest number of engineers, postgraduates||MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of prisoners who can boast of an engineering or a postgraduate degree, the NCRB 'Crime in India' 2019 report has revealed. Of 3,740 prisoners holding a technical degree or diploma in engineering, 727 — or 20% — are lodged in UP jails followed by 495 in Maharashtra and 362 in Karnataka. The state also tops the chart for housing the maximum number of postgraduates — 2,010 out of 5,282 nationwide — in its jails. According to UP’s director general (DG) prisons, Anand Kumar, a large chunk of technical graduates have either been convicted or are facing charges of dowry deaths and rapes. “A few have also been accused of economic offences,” Kumar told TOI. Overall, of the 3,30,487 inmates in Indian jails, postgraduates comprise 1.67% while 1.2% are engineers. Their skills, however, are put to good use within the jail premises. “Prisoners with engineering or technical background are helpful in upgrading technology in jails. For instance, many talented engineers have developed e-prison modules in the jail, others have helped in computerisation of the prison inventory system. They have also played an important role in the installation of jail radios within the premises. So many have turned teachers and are involved in e-literacy programmes,” the DG said.

This has never happened before. Opposition has always had space. Something is wrong in the system, the government is behaving brutally.”On October 4, Chaudhary had tweeted, “If you have the right to conduct lathi charge, I have the right to stand with my people, I will be in Muzaffarnagar on October 8”.

October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||City zoo to get CNG crematorium||Ahmedabad: For the first time a special CNG cremation incinerator is being set up for animals and birds at the Kamla Nehru Zoo at Kankaria by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The proposal was prepared one and a half years ago and sent to the central zoo authority for which the grants were also received almost a year ago. The new crematorium will be constructed at a cost of Rs 52.17 lakh. “This will be an exclusive crematorium for resident animals and birds at the zoo,” said a senior AMC official in the streetlights department. Earlier, the animals were being buried in deep pits which was a problem when it came to large animals. The official admitted that there was delay in executing the civil and electrical works and also installation of the CNG crematorium chamber. Unlike Delhi, AMC will not burn carcasses of stray animals here. “Once the crematorium comes up, there is a possibility that registered pets may be cremated here for a small fee that takes care of expenses towards gas and small service charge. We are yet to formulate any plans in this direction as we are yet to know how many registered pets are in the city,” said the AMC official. The official also added that mobile cremation units for pets were also designed by private individuals in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-zoo-to-get-cng-crematorium/articleshow/78542215.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||Banks, ATMs remain unguarded, police advice falls on deaf ears||LUDHIANA: Despite robbers targeting various banks and ATMs of the city in the recent past, many of these remain unguarded. According to the city police, time and again they ask banks to hire guards, but to no avail. At present, PCR cops of Ludhiana Police visit ATMs and banks daily, click their selfies to share with senior officials, and make a note in their diaries at the unguarded banks. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “Some time ago, the Ludhiana Police had started a drive under which all banks and ATM kiosks were divided into beats and assigned to the PCR cops. We have prepared a checklist, that includes availability of CCTVs, functional hooters, connection of hotline, display of numbers of police stations concerned and availability of guards. The cops who visit banks and ATM kiosks make note of these factors in their report.” He said, “Some banks and many ATM kiosks don’t have guards. We have been organising several meetings and have also written to them to appoint security guards, but they haven’t paid any heed. Most of the times banks tell us that they don’t have funds to hire full-time security guards. In the recent past, some private banks opened small branches in different localities and majority of them don’t have guards. We have started patrolling and more meetings will be held with the bank authorities.” In the past two weeks, two attempts of tampering with ATMs were reported in the city. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Ashwani Kapur said, “Banks have outsourced the ATM kiosks and also got the cash insured. So, they don’t bother to hire a guard. But when someone attempts to tamper with an ATM, the police have to rush there.” Naresh Gaur, secretary, Punjab Bank Employees’ Federation, said, “According to the RBI guidelines, a security guard at a bank is a must. But several banks, both private and government, and ATMs are unguarded. The reason is most of the banks have got the cash insured.” Anil Kumar, lead bank manager of Ludhiana, said, “We have not received any directions that say that having a guard is mandatory, but we keep asking all the banks to have guards and proper security systems.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/banks-atms-remain-unguarded-police-advice-falls-on-deaf-ears/articleshow/78541086.cms||Payal Dhawan

October 8, 2020||Jaipur||State govt set to ink tripartite MoU with Central PSU for potash mining||Jaipur: Despite Rajasthan sitting over 2,400 million tonnes of potash reserves, around four times of the global deposits, and the country importing almost all of it, mining of the mineral used for fertiliser has taken a back seat. But that is going to change soon if the new roadmap laid out by the state government is executed in earnest.According to a senior official in mines and petroleum department, the state government is set to sign a tripartite MoU involving mines department, state PSU RSMML and Central PSU MECL (Mining Exploration Corporation Ltd) to carry out economic feasibility for mining of potash blocks and it can happen this month.After preliminary exploration (G3 level), Geological Survey of India (GSI) has found potash reserves of 133 million tonnes in Satipura block of Hanumangarh. While the state government is looking to auction the mines and can do so for a composite licence at this stage of exploration, it does not want to burden the investor with uncertainties. "We want to do an economic feasibility study. For this we have to sign an agreement with MECL. The draft of the tripartite agreement between directorate of mines and geology, RSMML and MECL has been approved after certain modifications at various levels of the government. After this, MECL will undertake the study and give a better picture of the features of the mine. This is expected to not only attract attention of large number of bidders, but also help us in value discovery," said Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, department of mines and petroleum.Sources said the deposits in the block lay between 450-700 metres below the surface. Additionally, the potash content is estimated to be around 4-5% against a global average of 17-18%. But the studies of the block show, the mine is rich in industrial salt, polyvinyl chloride and other minerals, which can enhance the attractiveness of the block.A senior official of the mines department said that after the economic feasibility study, a comprehensive techno-commercial exploration would be undertaken which will give insights into other minerals embedded in the block. It can help us in harvesting the various chemical compounds, salts through evaporation, and other minerals through differential crystallisation processes.Potash is mainly used for making fertiliser and has other uses in the manufacturing of glass, explosives and chemicals, petrochemicals. India imports most of the potash for its use, at over 4 million tonnes annualy, whereas Rajasthan has 90% of the mineral’s reserves in the country.Most of the potash deposits in Rajasthan are identified in Nagore-Ganganagar basin of the state covering parts of Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner districts. GFXPotash PowerRajasthan has around 90% of potash reserves in countryAs per GSI, state has 2,400 million tonnes of low-grade potashIndia relies completely on imports of the mineralIn 2017-18, India spent Rs 7,700 crore on imports of potashAnnual imports estimated at over 4 million tonnesMost deposits identified in Nagaur-Ganganagar basin The region is also rich in minerals, chemicals like high-grade salt deposits, chlorideAnnual subsidy for phosphate-, potash-made fertilisers is over Rs 22,000 cr||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-govt-set-to-ink-tripartite-mou-with-central-psu-for-potash-mining/articleshow/78542213.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Chehellum will be observed on Thursday. According to the mutawwali of waqf Karbala Talkatora Syed Faizi, the doors to the religious monument will be under lock and key. “Senior police officials came to the Karbala on Wednesday and have directed me verbally that no one should be allowed to enter the premises on Chehellum. They did not give any written order for it,” he claimed. “In fact, a police bandobast has been stationed outside the Karbala gates. Not even 100 people, which is the government norm, can enter the Karbala,” he added. Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad in a video message informed mourners that even though Chehellum majlis (sermon) will be held at Imambara Nazim Sahab on Victoria Street, people should stay in their homes. “Majlis will be held at 1.30pm. The local population will itself make up for 100 people, so no one should come to the Imambara,” said Jawad. A juloos (procession) which followed the majlis with Alam (standards synonymous with Hazrat Abbas—Imam Husain’s brother) will also not be held on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/karbala-talkatora-to-be-off-limits-on-chehellum/articleshow/78543953.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Lucknow||Opposition using dead bodies to gain political mileage, says Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: A day after the UP government sought a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe into Hathras case, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday stepped up his attack on the opposition parties accusing them of using dead bodies for political gains. “Gareeb ki laash par rajneeti karne wale chehron ko pechaniye… (identify those doing politics on dead bodies),” Yogi said, launching a stinging attack on the opposition. “They are working with nefarious designs to adversely affect the country’s progress,” he said. The CM said that while the Centre and the state government was waging a pitched battle against Corona pandemic, the opposition was busy conspiring to destabilize the state. “None of them were seen during the peak phase of Corona pandemic as they were hiding in their homes to save their lives during lockdown. But they started hatching conspiracies to destabilize the state by creating rift between people in terms of caste and religion, the moment the government announced the unlock phase,” he said. “But we would not let them achieve success,” he said, adding that his government would take strict action against the anti-social elements who want to stop development of the state. Yogi was speaking to BJP functionaries in the bypoll-bound Bangarmau assembly seat, which fell vacant following disqualification of BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger in connection with rape of a minor. In an apparent reference to Congress, Yogi said that the party which ruled the country after Independence was still actively pursuing its agenda of creating divide among people. “They are not liking the development of the state and were, therefore, hatching conspiracies one after another,” he said. Yogi said that just before 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the opposition tried to misguide people in the name of Rafale deal. “But today the ace fighter jet is part of the air defence contingent and is threatening the enemy,” he said. He also accused the opposition of misguiding the farmers on three farm bills which, he said, guarantee security to the farmers and allow them to sell their produce anywhere in the country. He said that the Digital India concept mooted by PM Narendra Modi started showing its effect in the times of Corona pandemic. The CM added that the government would not have been able to provide allowances to Jan Dhan accounts of the daily wage earners, labourers and street vendors during the peak of the pandemic times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/opposition-using-dead-bodies-to-gain-political-mileage-says-yogi/articleshow/78543990.cms||Pankaj Shah

October 8, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Komba: Wild jumbos kill teen, injure 3||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a tragic incident, a 14-year-old boy was trampled to death by elephants in the forest at Komba under Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary on Wednesday. Shiju Kani, son of Gopan and Bindu of Thenmala tribal settlement in Komba forest is the deceased. His brother and two cousins survived the attack with injuries. According to Neyyar Dam police, the incident took place sometime between 10am and 1pm. Shiju along with brother Alan, 16, and cousins Shiju, 19, and Sreejith, 18, had gone into the forest to collect reeds to make baskets and fishing poles. The attack happened among the dense growth of reeds on the banks of Neyyar river. Speaking to TOI, cousin Shiju, who survived the attack with minimal injuries, said that the teens were unaware of the presence of elephants nearby until they were too close. The younger Shiju was the closest to the elephants. “We realised that elephants were nearby only when they trumpeted,” Shiju said, recollecting the horrific incident. The teens ran helter-skelter. Shiju thought that the others were trailing behind him. “But after sometime, I heard Alan and Sreejith screaming and went back to check on them. I saw Shiju surrounded by four elephants — one tusker and three females — while Alan and Sreejith were desperately trying to divert their attention,” he said. The boys had to run for their lives again after the elephants chased them. Shiju kept running while Alan and Sreejith quickly climbed on trees a little away from the elephants. The teens kept screaming for help until some men fishing in Neyyar river in boats heard them and came there. But, by that time the elephants had killed the young boy and left. The local police came to know of the incident only after 3:30 pm when the three teens came out of the forest. Alan and Sreejith are undergoing treatment at Thiruvananthapuram government medical college hospital. Neyyar forest range officer G Sandeep said that the teens might have encountered the elephants while they were feeding on the reeds. “Reeds grow in large numbers along the banks of Neyyar river during the rains. Elephants come here to feed on them,” said the forest officer, adding that it is difficult to notice elephants among the reeds as they would stand still sensing presence of humans in the proximity. The forest guards often sense their presence as wind carries their smell, he said. Shiju was a class VII student at Amboori. His mother Bindu had died a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/wild-jumbos-kill-teen-injure-3/articleshow/78541150.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kochi||If tests increase, positive cases could reach up to 80,000 by November 1||KOCHI: Going by the current situation, the number of Covid-19 cases in Ernakulam is expected to touch 50,000 to 80,000 by November 1, a Covid analysis report prepared by district health au)thorities has revealed. According to authorities, tests have to be ramped up to understand the prevalence of the disease in the society. Currently, 4,000 to 5,000 tests are held in both government and private sectors per day. The test positivity rate crossed 20 on two occasions and touched 30 on September 28. The report further said if asymptomatic people are not tested, the projected number may reduce by up to 70% and test positivity too would drastically increase. However, the overall disease burden will not be affected, it added. Instead, it will augment the spread and increase fatality rate in Ernakulam. “After restrictions were relaxed, interaction among people increased resulting in spurt in cases. Though Section 144 of CrPC has been enforced, infection spread could be brought down only when it is implemented strictly. Going by the current trend, Ernakulam would witness 2,000 to 3,000 cases per day by the first week of November, if tests increase. Test positivity rate (TPR) has been rising by day and has touched 20. Since our thrust is on testing symptomatic people and quarantining their contacts, we cannot pick all cases though infection is still in the society. If we test 1,000 symptomatic, there are chances that there might be 4,000 asymptomatic people who are not tested,” said a district health official. Meanwhile, the district is also likely to witness 100 more Covid deaths by the first week of November. The report also recommended that authorities should keep in mind patients from other districts, suffering from prolonged illness, too seek treatment in hospitals in Ernakulam. This factor should be considered while planning for hospital beds and ICUs. Most of these patients fall in category B and C requiring prolonged hospitalization. It further noted that clusters that were identified the previous month were mostly associated with super markets, factories, institutions and industries where employees work in close contacts. The report also warned that further relaxations in quarantine and testing protocols could cripple the health care system much earlier than expected. “At present, the mortality rate in Ernakulam is 0.4%. As per a latest report, only 1.2% of cases are in ICU and only a few patients are in ventilator support. Protecting the vulnerable and imparting treatment at an early stage are vital to bring down mortality rate further,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/if-tests-increase-ve-casescould-reach-up-to-80k-by-nov-1/articleshow/78541155.cms||T C Sreemol

October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||‘25% of Amdavadis to shop online this festive season’||Ahmedabad: In the run-up to the festive season, retailers are expecting some revival in demand after the pandemic. However, it is expected that online players will level their competition and eat into the offline retailers’ share, as customers in the city are more likely to shop online this festive season. According to an online survey conducted by Local Circles, at least 25% people in the city will be shopping online this festive season, whereas 37% people will prefer local stores and malls for festive shopping. The pan-India survey was conducted across 50 top cities in the country including Ahmedabad. Some 5,271 people responded to the survey from Ahmedabad, which also stated that 13% of the respondents prefer things getting delivered from local stores. “Most people would prefer online shopping for the sake of safety, convenience and getting a better price according to the survey. In Ahmedabad, one-third of people would shop online because of safety whereas 10% each would prefer it for better prices and ease of refunds,” stated the survey. Interestingly, at least 58% people said that they would prefer buying items from small businesses or artisans and weavers if made available online. Grocery and food supplies were the most preferred items to be purchased by people in the city, according to the survey, whereas 29% would purchase electrical and home appliances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/25-of-amdavadis-to-shop-online-this-festive-season/articleshow/78542244.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Mumbai||Decision on reopening schools in Maharashtra only after Diwali, if Covid-19 cases dip||MUMBAI: Days after the Centre issued Unlock 5 guidelines allowing states to restart educational institutions in a graded manner from October 15, the Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday decided that in light of the Covid-19 situation, it would take a call on reopening schools only after Diwali, around mid-November. Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant had already told mediapersons that schools and colleges will not start on October 15 and a decision would be taken only after the situation improves. “There was a discussion on this in the cabinet. And with the festive season around the corner, it is expected that cases will go up. So, starting schools now will not be ideal. A review will be taken post Diwali and if cases continue to dip, we can take a decision. Also, stress on online education for smaller classes will continue,” said a minister who attended the cabinet. The school education department will draft a plan to restart schools. CM Uddhav Thackeray also asked the school education department to review the online mode of learning used for the past several months. Schools principals said they hope parents would be willing to send students to school post the Diwali break. “Not all students have access to e-learning and hence it will be essential to resume physical school, but it must be done only when it is safe for all the stakeholders involved. When we recently spoke to our teachers and parents, none of them were yet ready to come back to campus,” said Prashant Redij, member of the Mumbai Principals Association. Parents, though, said they would be willing to wait until there is a cure or vaccine. “We are happy with whatever learning is happening online and glad that the government isn’t insisting that schools reopen. It would be very difficult to control the children in a school and it could put all involved at risk of contracting the virus. The government should focus on strengthening the online learning reach for students in the remote parts of the state to ensure continuity,” said Anubha Sahai of the India Wide Parents Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/decision-on-reopening-schools-in-state-only-after-diwali-if-cases-dip/articleshow/78544191.cms||Bhavika Jain
October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||Hike in maroon yarn rate fails to dampen hosiery industry’s spirits||LUDHIANA: In a jolt to the woollens’ manufacturers, who were pinning hopes on the Uttar Pradesh government’s tenders for 1.5 crore maroon sweaters for schoolchildren, the rate of yarn has shot up by Rs 30 per kilogram. Manufacturers’ prospects of making a decent profit from this tender have been hit, but they are not willing to step back. Businessmen said due to a very high demand, the rate of yarn has gone up to Rs 240 per kilogram from the last month’s Rs 210 per kilogram. Vinod Thapar, chairman of the Knitwear Club, said, “Since the last month, there has been an increase of almost Rs 30 in the rate of yarn used for the manufacturing of maroon sweaters. There is a shortage of yarn due to the sudden high demand as manufacturers — who are certain that they will bag the tender due to their eligibility and competitive rates, and those who have already got orders — have started manufacturing sweaters. In addition to this, there is a large number of traders who have given advance orders for the yarn. These traders have tied up with the manufacturers for purchase of sweaters and instead of giving advance payment, they have decided to supply them the yarn.” Thapar added, “The hike in rates will certainly bring down the profit margins, but despite that we are willing to execute the orders, as we have got work after a gap of six months.” Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, called the hike a phenomenon that happens every year. “The situation is likely to continue for another one-and-a-half month till the 1.5-crore piece tender is executed. The sweater manufacturing industry is very upbeat about the UP tender and even the increased rates have failed to make any impact on the demand of the yarn. Some manufacturers and traders, who have quoted low rates, will have to suffer losses.” A manufacturer said, “The rates of yarn of colours other than maroon have not increased. The maroon shade’s demand is high because of the UP government’s tender. The hike in the cost will lead to a huge increase in our cost of production and we will have to bear losses, as already the rate quoted by us is very low.” Massive competition for first time This is for the first time that such a high number of firms responded to the tender for the supply of school sweaters. Sources in the industry said till last year, there were about seven manufacturers from Ludhiana who would participate, but this year for every tender, there were over 50 bidders, of which 90% were from Ludhiana. The latest trend is the outcome of the online tender system, which has come into place for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hike-in-maroon-yarn-rate-fails-to-dampen-hosiery-industrys-spirits/articleshow/78541133.cms||Mohit Behl

And of this, Rs 50 crore was transferred from Mauritius, say ED sources. The quartet was booked for sedition and under Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act on Wednesdsay. ED officials are tracking down the conduits and scanning the website, Justice for Hathras, to check whether it was the gateway to source money from abroad. The clinical listing of protest schedules in Delhi, Surat, Chennai and Kolkata on the website is impossible in such a short time, particularly in time of pandemic without funds backup, said an official. Accounts in which money was transferred are being scanned by the agency. The FIR lodged at Manth police station in Mathura against four persons affiliated to PFI followed the ED revelations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hathras-unrest-puts-ed-on-rs-100-crore-hawala-trail/articleshow/78543999.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Allahabad||Administration has confined us illegally: Girl’s kin to Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Family members of the Hathras rape victim have filed a petition before the Allahabad high court alleging that the district administration has illegally confined them in their house. The court has been requested to direct the district administration that the “family members be released from illegal confinement and allowed to move out of their house and meet people”. This habeas corpus writ petition, filed by the family members of the victim, is listed on October 8 for hearing. Om Prakash, who is the father of the victim, along with her mother, two brothers and two more family members have filed the petition. In the petition, it has been alleged that on September 29 the petitioners were illegally confined in their house by the district administration and since then they are not being allowed to meet anyone. It has been further alleged that “though at a later stage a few people were allowed to meet the petitioners, the district administration is still not allowing them (the petitioners) to move out of their house at free will”. In this petition, the petitioners have alleged that they were being prevented from meeting or communicating freely, thereby their right to freedom of speech and expression as well as the right to receive information is being violated. In the petition, one Surender Kumar, claiming himself to be the national general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Valmiki Mahapanchayat, has stated that he was approached by the petitioners (family members of the victim) over telephone and on behalf of them he has filed the petition. The habeas corpus writ petition is filed before the high court when a person is illegally detained. During the court proceedings, if the court finds that the person is illegally detained, then it can order for the release of that person.

Though sweets were distributed in Madurai and some other places, the celebrations were low-key. It may be recalled that a 100-foot banner proclaiming O Panneerselvam will be the next chief minister had emerged in Theni on Monday. ``What we wanted was CM, as Theni has been the constituency of chief ministers MGR and Jayalaalithaa. We are not much aware of what happened, but then we are also happy that matters have been settled,’’ said a party member. ``As a party we have to celebrate, but then as OPS’s hometown we did not know whether to celebrate or not,’’ said S Palaniappan, another party worker. He too added that they were happy that matters seemed to be settled as opposition parties had started making fun of them. In Madurai, party cadres and functionaries said they were awaiting instructions from ministers as to how to go about it. ``If all of us are united under the same leadership, and the leaders really reach out to us, nothing can hold back AIADMK’s victory in the next elections,’’ said A Jayakumar, a former councillor. In Tuticorin, AIADMK cadres burst fireworks and distributed sweets as soon as the deputy chief minister made the announcement on Wednesday. Party south district deputy secretary Sandhanam, Central Co-operative Bank chairman R Sudhakar, district panchayat vice-chairman Selvakumar, MGR mandram president Esadurai among others participated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-celebrations-in-theni-low-key-in-madurai/articleshow/78544194.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||Ajit Mill junction flyover delayed by design woes||Ahmedabad: The Ajit Mill junction which is one of the main arterial junctions in the city was to get a flyover this year. It is today one of the most dangerous accident spots. But the flyover has been delayed since December 2017. The Rs 61 crore project was approved while Anandiben Patel was the chief minister and has been delayed ever since owing to oversight of officials and consultants for ignoring the basics before project execution, according to senior officials at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). To cut the long story short, after the flyover design was approved by the standing committee in October 2017 and when the contractor began piling work in December for construction of piers, officials realized that there was an 1,800 mm drainage line and a 1,200 mm water line underneath. This called for a major design change. The project cost was largely funded by the state government following approval from the state’s roads and buildings department under the Mukhya Mantri Shehri Vikas Yojana. “It was then realized by the roads and buildings department that an additional special vehicle loading span was not added to the 14 spans. This caused another round of delay till April 24 last year,” says a senior AMC officials. Thanks to the delay caused, the project will now see a major cost escalation. Around 17 major consultants had applied for preparing project management plans including HCP design, planning and management pvt ltd, TUV-SUD South Asia, Abacus and CC Patel. “The new deadline for the project is being set for June 30, 2021,” adds the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ajit-mill-junction-flyover-delayed-by-design-woes/articleshow/78542168.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Dehradun||Of the 11k recovered Covid patients in Doon, not even 11 volunteered to donate plasma||Dehradun: Five days ago, Sagar Taneja, whose grandfather is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the city’s Himalayan Jolly Grant Hospital, put up pleas on Twitter for two units of O positive plasma. He has received one donor so far, after hospital authorities stepped in to help him. “We need one more by Friday,” said Taneja. On Wednesday, 630 fresh cases of Covid-19 reported, taking the state’s tally to 52,959. Till now, 43,631 people have recovered, 11,400 of them in Doon. Even as families scramble to get the plasma that could save a Covid patient's life, frantically looking for donors by posting pleas on social media platforms, only five people have voluntarily donated plasma so far in the state. Apart from them, three recovered persons approached the Indian Medical Association (IMA) blood bank in Dehradun. The family of another Covid patient, currently admitted at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) is experiencing a similar trail. They circulated messages on Facebook and Twitter for a plasma donor of B positive blood group on Wednesday but are yet to receive any help. “We just hope that we get a donor at the earliest, as doctors have said that his condition is critical,” said a kin of the patient, who did not wish to be named. “We got around 21 plasma donations so far, among which only five were voluntary. The rest 16 donors were family members of the patient, requested to donate plasma by a kin,” said Sandeep Rana, public relations officer at GDMC. What is the reason behind such a low number of plasma donors? “It’s lack of awareness and spread of misinformation that is holding back recovered persons from donating plasma. It’s important to create the awareness that donating plasma is a simple procedure and has no side effects,” explained Dr Ashutosh Sayana, principal, GDMC. “Anyone who has recovered from Covid-19 and has developed antibodies (which happens in 90% of cases) is eligible,” Syana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/of-the-11k-recovered-covid-patients-in-doon-not-even-11-volunteered-to-donate-plasma/articleshow/78541170.cms||Ishita Mishra

The sudden spike from 100 to 200 cases can be attributed to the increased testing in the town and rural parts of the district, especially among the workers of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREG) scheme. Tiruvarur recorded 104 cases pushing the tally of cases to 8,049. In the south, Kanyakumari (97) continues to record the highest number of fresh cases in the region, followed by Madurai (90), Tirunelveli (66), Tuticorin (65) and Theni (60). Five districts recorded less than 50 cases each with Tenkasi (10) recording the lowest. It is followed by Ramanathapuram (15), Sivagangai (30), Virudhunagar (37) and Dindigul (49).

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Kochi: Sero surveillance at CSEZ from Wednesday||KOCHI: HLL Lifecare Limited, the agency entrusted by the Centre to distribute antibody test kits, will do sero surveillance at Cochin special economic zone (CSEZ). Most areas in the CSEZ have been declared micro containment zones after Covid-19 cases were reported from some industrial units. The programme, which would begin on Wednesday, will go on for 45 days. It involves testing people using antibody kits, which has three indicators — Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and control. If IgM is tested positive, the person will be subjected to an antigen test for confirmation. If a person is tested positive for IgG, it means he was infected earlier, recovered and developed antibodies. He is not a carrier of the infection. If IgM is positive, it means the individual is currently infected and can be the carrier of the infection. The indicator ‘control’ means the person has not been infected so far. Sero surveillance is done to understand the prevalence of cases in the area and the result of which enables the concerned to take more stringent preventive measures. “HLL plans to subject 7,000 to 8,000 employees in CSEZ to antibody tests randomly as part of sero surveillance. We are planning to do antibody testing among 1,000 to 1,500 shopkeepers in Thrikkakara municipality, where the number of registered shopkeepers would be around 5,000. We also approached some of the local bodies like Maradu, Kalamassery and Kochi corporation expressing willingness to do sero surveillance in their limit. The mobile units of HLL will do the testing and the local bodies need not to spare their manpower in this regard. But we have not received a positive response from their part so far,” said Dr Rejikrishna U, nodal officer, Covid cell, HLL. HLL itself functions inside CSEZ, where around 100 units, including 28 IT/ITES, operate “Around 14,000 employees used to work in 100 units before the lockdown. Now, only 72 units are operational as employees in 28 IT/ITES companies work from their homes. HLL approached us to do antigen testing on employees and we have informed it to the companies in CSEZ,” said Saju Surendran, deputy development commissioner in CSEZ. Anil Kumar P C, general secretary of industrial association in CSEZ said association and CSEZ agreed to share the expense to do antibody testing on employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sero-surveillance-at-csez-from-wed/articleshow/78541172.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kochi||FloatingSolar panels will be set up at the Idukki reservoir to produce 125 mw||IDUKKI: The Idukki district could soon become a power hub in the state. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is setting up solar floating panels at the Idukki reservoir to produce 125MW of power. The 125MW panels will be placed in Anchuruli and Cheruthoni areas of the dam where direct sunlight is available, said officials. A large surface area of water at the Idukki reservoir where direct sunlight is available is conducive for floating solar panels, according to a feasibility study by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at Idukki reservoir. The report has been submitted to KSEB. “The NTPC report found Idukki reservoir apt to install floating solar panels. As per the report, the first phase will generate 125MW and after two years, another 200MW project would be installed. In the first phase, the 100MW solar panels will be installed at Anchuruli area and 25MW will implemented at Cheruthoni area of the reservoir,” Rajan P, KSEB director (transmission, system operation and REES), told TOI. “We need a forest clearance to the project and KSEB will move the state forest minister-level to get the clearance. We plan to begin the project in December,” Rajan said. “As per the agreement, NTPC will implement the solar power project at Idukki reservoir and KSEB will purchase power from NTPC. The board will sign an agreement with NTPC to purchase the power. KSEB will set up a 220KV substation at Nirmalacity near Kattappana to transfer the solar power. KSEB is ready to fix underlying cables to transfer the power,” said the official. "This is an initiative that the Union government stressed on generation of green and renewable energy from non-conventional sources. KSEB has no other way to generate green energy," he said. According to KSEB officials, after implementing the floating solar project the district will be turn into a power hub of the state. The Idukki reservoir was selected for a second power house taking into consideration the high storage capacity. The power house has an installed capacity of 780MW. KSEB will set up another power house with the same capacity to generate 780MW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/floatingsolar-panels-will-be-set-up-at-the-idukki-reservoir-to-produce-125-mw/articleshow/78542301.cms||Sandeep Thomas

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Maradu residents still gape at cracked walls||KOCHI: Ever since Rema and Ajith K M shifted back to their damaged house next to the demolished Alfa Serene apartment, cloudy skies tense them. All the three bedrooms in their house, which was hardly 12m away from Alfa Serene, start leaking when it rains and they have to move around with a mop from one room to another. Ajith, a daily wager, moved into the house, registered in the name of his wife, despite being unable to do the maintenance work because he had no other choice. “I was jobless because of the pandemic and had been paying the rent for more than five months from my pocket,” said Ajit, whose house suffered damage from earthmover and later from the impact of controlled explosion. He has not yet received the compensation fixed by the technical committee. Ajit is not alone. Maradu municipality has failed to settle the claims of at least three people whose houses suffered damage in the demolition. “The technical committee has fixed the compensation at Rs 4.5lakh but the insurance company has cleared only Rs.15,000. The municipality had promised to take a decision but I don’t see any action,” said Ajith, who feels even the money fixed by the technical committee would be not enough. “I have to reconstruct at least one bedroom and a bathroom. I am clueless on what to do,” says Ajith. Sugunananthan, whose house also suffered damages due to careless demolition using an earthmover, was eligible for a compensation of Rs 2.8 lakh. “The insurance company says I am eligible only for Rs.51,000,” he said. Sugunananthan's house too leaks when it rains. “The money would not be enough even to pay the labourers,” he said. Rajeevan Nair, another resident in the vicinity of Alfa Serene said though there was no visible damage to their property, the kitchen started leaking after the rains. “I gave a coat of white paint in the hope that the leak would stop but wet patches keep developing whenever it rains. I don't even know who to approach,” he said. As per an agreement all damages above Rs 2.5 lakh was to be met by agencies involved in demolition. For lesser claims the municipality had insured houses in the vicinity for Rs.68 lakh. “Most complaints have been solved by agencies involved in demolition. There is a delay in finalising the insurance claim,” said an official with the Maradu municipality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maradu-residents-still-gape-at-cracked-walls/articleshow/78541198.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Coimbatore||Dist stops 42 child marriages in 3 months||Coimbatore: The district administration has managed to stop 42 child marriages in the past three months alone, compared to 11 in the first six months of this year. During the complete lockdown, there were hardly any incidences of child marriage. Now that the government has relaxed the lockdown norms, such cases are on the rise. A social welfare department official said, “The number of child marriages that we stopped in the past three months is really high. It is to be noted that only 53 child marriages were stopped in the entire 2019. Most of the cases were reported from areas such as Madukkarai, Sulur and Karamadai.” The official said they had stopped 19 child marriages in August alone. In most of the cases, it was the victims’ decision to get married to take their love affair to the next level. In some cases, the official said, the victims were forced into the marriage by their parents. “Child marriages are taking place both in rural and urban areas. A lot depends on their family background and economic status.” The social welfare department is, meanwhile, taking several steps to stop child marriages in the district. One measure is formation of a committee at the village level to create awareness among the public, and report and stop child marriages at the planning stages itself. The committee would have panchayat president, councillors, teachers, anganwadi workers and self-help group members as members. “We have shot off letters to all block development officers in the district, asking them to form the committees at the village level. Several villages have already formed the committees and stopped child marriages,” the official said. The official said they were also educating the public about the consequences of child marriage and the punishment the offence would attract under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, by distributing pamphlets and sticking posters at primary health centres and ration shops. Officials said they were hopeful of bringing the number of child marriages down by creating awareness among the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-stops-42-child-marriages-in-3-months/articleshow/78523978.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The Indo-Chinese pair started with a bang and were 4-1 up in the first set but lost their rhythm and allowed their opponents to regroup. The British pair took full advantage of the shift in the momentum and took the first set 7-5. Dev, the Ahmedabad lad, and Hanwen were fast losing their grip on the match. The second set started with some unforced errors from the Indo-Chinese pair and the British pair stepped up their game, especially their first serve. They won the second set 6-2. Dev’s coach Shrimal Bhatt, who is accompanying him in Paris, sounded dejected after the loss. “Dev and his partner had their chances in the beginning of the first set but they became casual and once the British pair had gained the upper hand after trailing 1-4 in the first set, they became very aggressive and were able to dominate the match,’’ said Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dev-li-pair-crashes-out/articleshow/78544006.cms||Sanjay Chakhaiyar

Instead, they asked petitioners and the opposite party to come to police stations for inquiry.“We observed quite a few such issues that were brought to our notice in recent days. Visiting the spot gives a host of advantages for active policing. It will help the officer analyse the situation, assess the merits and give a solution at the spot instead of dragging the issue. It gives public more confidence in the police and police presence at the spots for petty issues will help reduce crimes and build a rapport with the people of the locality,” the SP told TOI.The instruction has been given to all the 56 police stations in the seven sub-divisions in the district – comprising 49 law and order police stations and seven all women police stations. Stating that it does not apply for all types of petitions, the SP said police stations received 80 petitions everyday of which at least 50% (40 petitions) could be inquired at the spot and resolved instead of summoning both parties to stations for an inquiry that would not be fruitful.“Petitions pertaining to a dispute between neighbours over a common wall or a drainage or path issue can be resolved by conducting an inquiry at the spot. It also prevents the issue from escalation,” he said and added that there were petitions about dispute between couples or over missing certificates that have to be redressed at the police station level. In case of police officers not visiting the spot, such instances can be brought to the notice of the SP in the ‘Hello Police’ helpline number 9514144100 or control room number 100. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tuticorin-sp-warns-against-armchair-probe-by-police/articleshow/78544207.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||Modi followed ‘Raj Dharma’ during 2002 riots: Rupani||Gandhinagar: Chief minister Vijay Rupani said on Wednesday that as the chief minister of Gujarat during the ill-famed post-Godhra communal riots of 2002, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had followed ‘Raj Dharma’ or ruler’s duty. He said that after the 2002 riots, Gujarat became ‘riots free’. He was speaking at a virtual rally to mark PM Narendra Modi’s 20th year without a break in public office.Referring to 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, Rupani said that Modi had followed ‘Raj Dharma’ (ruler’s duty). “After the post-Godhra riots, Gujarat became riot-free. Riots were rampant under the Congress’ rule. But Modi stopped riots completely,” Rupani claimed. “After the Godhra incident, opponents used all kinds of derogatory words for Modi. But he remained unfazed. Instead, he used the stones thrown at him to build a staircase to climb up,” the CM added. “Gujarat is PM Modi’s soul. Even today, while sitting in Delhi, he remains concerned about Gujarat to ensure that the state does not lag behind,” said Rupani. Modi took oath as the Gujarat chief minister on this day (October 7) in 2001 and continued in that office till he became the Prime Minister in 2014. Rupani termed Modi as a “PM with a 56-inch chest.”“Terrorist attacks have become a thing of the past under Modi’s rule. Earlier, bomb blasts used to happen frequently. But PM Modi took firm actions against terrorists. For the first time, India has seen a PM with a 56-inch chest,” he added. Rupani also listed several big-ticket projects completed during Modi’s tenure as the chief minister and later as the Prime Minister, such as the Sabarmati Riverfront, 24-hour electricity supply in Gujarat’s villages, Ro-Ro ferry service and the Statue of Unity. “It was Modi who finished the Narmada project by giving permission to install gates at Sardar Sarovar Dam on the 17th day of assuming the PM office,” the CM said. State BJP chief Paatil said that PM Modi’s decision to impose a nationwide lockdown to fight coronavirus had significantly reduced the death toll. Referring to the ongoing tension at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, Paatil said, “India under Modi sent a strong message to China... The world has now realized that India has the ability to tackle China single-handedly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/modi-followed-raj-dharma-during-2002-riots-rupani/articleshow/78542402.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In compliance with the state government orders, schools are distributing raw foodgrains as per the set weight formula. Currently, MDM ration for June-August months is being handed out. Gautam Gedam, MDM in-charge for Nagpur district, said students had also been handed over foodgrains for the last academic session which had been cut short due to the Covid pandemic. “Schools operate for an average 220 days in an academic year. For each of these days, MDM has to be provided to the child. With the pandemic cutting short last academic session, and the current one not yet being started, the government directed us to distribute raw foodgrains to all eligible children,” said Gedam. Since schools are the ‘last mile’ connection for MDM delivery, authorities asked principals to ensure that all of their students get the MDM packets. “For the months of June-August, actual school days come to around 60. The weight is calculated as per the daily quantity fixed for them. So for students of Std I-V, we are giving 100 gms rice per day. For Std VI-VIII, 150 gms rice per day is being distributed. Then chana and moong daal is also handed out at 20 gms per day for Std I-V and 30 gms a day for Std VI-VIII,” said Gedam. MDM is applicable only till Std VIII. Going by the above formula, each students is being given 6kg/9kg, depending on the class the student is, rice for June-August quota. Schools have been calling parents and students in a phased manner to avoid crowding. Once the food packets are delivered, an acknowledgement is also taken. Some schools are also clicking photos as part of an added documentation process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-closed-but-midday-meals-being-distributed/articleshow/78542409.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The firm has been taking up maintenance work and fixed over 10,000 leakages in the drinking water pipelines in 60 wards of the corporation limit which, according to the company, has saved 90 lakh liters of water per day.Now, Suez is all set to commence the construction work of overhead tanks (OHTs) at three places within a week. A customer service centre – to address water related grievances of the public - would be opened within a month, according to the company representatives.“The corporation already has 32 OHTs. For improving the quality of water supply, 36 new OHTs would be constructed. Of which, the corporation has approved to construct three such tanks immediately. Most likely, the work to construct tanks – one each at AKS Nagar, Kurinji Nagar and near the housing unit of Tamil Nadu slum clearance board in Ukkadam – would be started within a week,” the representative said. Pointing out that they had already completed the assessments of the existing tanks and repair works need to be carried out in most of the tanks, the source said that they are yet to finalize when and how to carry out the repair works.Due to lockdown many of the workers had gone to their native places, affecting the progress of the project. Even though the workers have started to return in a phased manner, the project is functioning only with 60% of workers and is well-beyond the schedule, according to sources. However, they are hopeful of speeding up the works.As per the contract that is signed for 26 years – a one-year study period, four years of implementation period and 21 years of maintenance period -, the firm will have to develop and maintain infrastructures to supply water round-the-clock to old corporation areas. It includes laying pipelines for 1,850km, giving service connections to 1.50 lakhs houses and constructing 36 new OHTs.Meanwhile, DMK MLA N Karthik on Wednesday issued a statement demanding the corporation to cancel the agreement that was signed with the firm immediately. He questioned the need to hand over the project to a private company and criteria for selecting the company.In a statement, he said, even though it has been three years since the project was commenced, not much work has been carried out and roads were filled with potholes and causing inconveniences to the public as the pipe laying work is going on at slow-pace. At several areas, existing pipelines were damaged while digging roads and water supply was interrupted, he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/overhead-tanks-to-be-built-for-24x7-water-supply-scheme/articleshow/78542383.cms||Nivedha Selvam

October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||HC stays coercive action by CBI against Bhatnagar family||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday stayed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) from taking coercive action against Vadodara-based Mayfiar Leisures Ltd’s directors, who include members of the Bhatnagar family. The CBI move was in connection with an FIR lodged for allegedly cheating the Bank of India to the tune of Rs 54.19 crore.The firm was floated in 2011 by the Bhatnagar family, which controls Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd (DPIL) and which is accused of Rs 2,600-crore bank fraud. Last month, CBI lodged an FIR on BOI’s complaint of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and forgery against Madhurilata Suresh Bhatnagar, Mona Amit Bhatnagar, Richa Sumit Bhatnagar, Namo Narain Bhatnagar and others. They have been accused of diverting funds instead of using them for construction of a five-star hotel in Vadodara. On part of the accused, advocate Amit Nair submitted that out of total cost incurred on the project – Rs 135.58 crore, Rs 54.19 crore was disbursed by BOI, Rs 32.29 crore was paid back to BOI towards interest; remaining amount is borne by the promoters. Some of the accused including senior citizens and women directors have already resigned and they were not full-time directors or key management personnel, and hence they cannot be made accused in a casual manner.Justice A P Thaker issued notice to the CBI asking the probe agency not to take any coercive action against the accused persons till November 3, when further hearing has been posted. The HC, however, has permitted CBI to continue with the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stays-coercive-action-by-cbi-against-bhatnagar-family/articleshow/78542412.cms||---

The action comes after the city police had on Saturday seized 10 tonnes of banned tobacco products. A team led by designated officer for food safety, Madurai district, Dr M Somasundaram sealed the godowns and booking offices of two companies located in North Masi Street and three companies located in Nelpettai. They were closed down amid agitation by the parcel service companies’ association, whose members demanded not to shut them down.Somasundaram said that police detected the role of two parcel service companies in North Masi Street and further inquiries revealed that role of three more companies. Before closing them down, samples of tobacco products were lifted and sent for testing. Somasundaram said that banned tobacco products are brought from Bengaluru and New Delhi through various modes of transport including train and parcel service provided by private buses. The truck parcel service companies help them in local distribution. They suspect that other people from other states, who are settled in Madurai, could be the brain behind the distribution. Similar action will continue against erring people in future, he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/5-truck-parcel-companies-in-madurai-sealed-for-distributing-banned-tobacco/articleshow/78544214.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Varanasi||Feasting, sight-seeing & puja on double-decker luxury cruise in Kashi||VARANASI: Planning to party, feast on a floating banquet or even perform yajna with Ganga ghats in silhouette? Now, this would soon be possible on Ropax, a ferry introduced by tourism department and gifted to Varanasi by Inland Waterway Authority of India (IWAI). After the roll on-roll ferry service was launched between Mumbai and Mandwa near Alibaug, a similar initiative is set to pick steam on the Ganga in Kashi. The tourism department is completing formalities to take over the Rs 11-crore ferry. Designed to provide maximum efficiency and seamless transfer of vehicles, cargo and passengers, Ropax, however, won’t be used to carry vehicles in Kashi. The lower deck will be utilised as a banquet while rituals can be performed on the upper platform. The 200-seater ferry will mostly be used for sightseeing and even long-distance tourism till Chunar. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, Ropax has reached Varanasi and the tourism department is finalising the draft to operate it on public-private partnership (PPP) model. Then, a memorandum of understanding would be signed before the takeover. The entire cost of crew staff, operations and maintenance of Ropax will be borne by tourism department, he added. As the ferry’s lower deck is meant for boarding vehicles, it would be utilised to organise feasts, parties or a gathering of up to 200 people. The top deck can also be given for religious discourses, yajna or other activities, said Agrawal. Unlike the fare of luxury cruise Alaknand being operated by a private company, the fare RoPax will be kept low to make it affordable for middle and low-income tourists. He added that price for party booking and sight-seeing will be finalised before completing the tourism department draft. IWAI deputy director (Varanasi) Rakesh Kumar said, the Rs 11-crore Ropax is currently anchored at the multi-model terminal at Ramnagar and will be handed over to the state government. Officials said, as three bridges already exist in Varanasi to connect the sis and trans Ganga areas, there is no need to ferry vehicles. Box: Another luxe cruise in queue Another luxury cruise will be arriving in Kashi by November-end. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, the cruise has already been bought and it has left Goa for Varanasi. It will reach Varanasi via Kanyakumari, Kolkata and Haldia and is due to anchor in Kashi after November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/feasting-sight-seeing-puja-on-double-decker-luxury-cruise-in-kashi/articleshow/78541254.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Allow only 15-25 people in pandal during rituals: Kolkata cops||KOLKATA: Lalbazar has advised the Puja organizers not to allow more than 15 to 25 people at a time during specific rituals inside the pandal like ‘anjali’, ‘sandhi puja’ and ‘sindur khela’. This decision was taken following the state advisory of not allowing crowding at Puja pandals and ensuring rituals take place in batches. At all other times, a maximum of 30 to 50 persons will be allowed inside the pandals at a time. No one will be allowed to wait in front of the pandal. “While we have left it to the organizers to decide the final numbers during the peak hours, we have issued an advisory after several organizers asked for more clarity on the issue. The numbers will definitely depend on the size of the pandal and the local police will take the final call. But given the situation, the organizers need to be strict. We will be using the three days — Dwitiya to Chaturthi — to make minor changes to each of our micro plans depending on the responses we receive on the ground,” said an officer. The announcement comes a day before police commissioner Anuj Sharma, is slated for Puja pandal inspection in at least half-a-dozen places. Pintu Sengupta of the 66 Pally Puja in Rashbehari Avenue said they have decided to hold ‘anjali’ in six to seven batches, each comprising 20-25 locals. “We will stop the entry of outsiders during ‘anjali’ and ‘sindoor khwela’ if the numbers present inside the pandal go up,” he said. Tala Barowary, too, hinted it has planned at least 10 rounds of ‘anjali’. In addition, the headquarters have asked all local police stations to keep guardrails ready at major pujas in the city. “In case of excessive crowding, we will stop the pandal hoppers from entering temporarily. This will be done in coordination with divisional DCs and the Kolkata Police control room,” said an officer. Cops will also ensure that they spread out the revellers onto the adjoining roads in batches before they can crowd near the pandal. “In simple words, if we used a 300m stretch earlier — complete with barricades — to manage the crowd, we will now double that area. That might lead to the crowd spilling over to the main roads,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/allow-only-15-25-people-in-pandal-during-rituals-cops/articleshow/78669188.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
October 8, 2020||Madurai||Juliflora cleared from 5 tanks in dist||Madurai: Thick growth of prosopis juliflora has been cleared from five waterbodies in and around Madurai in the last few weeks, while one more waterbody will be cleared soon. HCL Foundation has taken up the cleaning work on Vandiyur tank, Anandaneri tank near Kadachanendal, Thirupalai Tank, Paraiyathikulam and Mangalakudi (in Kodikulam-Narasingam Road), at a cost of Rs 23 lakh with the help of Dhan Foundation, after getting required approval from the public works department (PWD). Only a few patches, where earthmovers could not reach, are pending. Meanwhile, work is underway in Maruthankulam tank near Parasurampatti on the city outskirts. While 10 water bodies are being cleaned and desilted jointly by Madurai Corporation, Dhan Foundation and Hi-tech Arai, HCL has come forward to clear juliflora growth in tanks owned by the PWD. “Earthmovers were used to clear the unnecessary vegetation wherever possible. Labourers were used in places where earthmovers could not be deployed,” S Elamuhil, a water source engineer from Dhan Foundation said. People from the residential areas near these waterbodies said that clearing of juliflora will not only help save them from encroachments, but also prevent the movement of anti-social elements, who use the overgrown shrubs as a hiding place.

At present, all libraries are functioning with restricted timing and Covid-19 safety measures, which include hand sanitisers, temperature screening for visitors etc., At Madurai district central library in Simmakkal, few visitors are seen except for students who are preparing for competitive exams. Officials said that as dailies, weeklies and magazines are not allowed for public, number of visitors is below normal. Further, reading at the library is prohibited and members can only borrow books, read and returned. “From coming here as a school student to bringing my child now, for over 20 years, this library has always been a part of my life. It was sad that we couldn’t come here during the lockdown and we had to pick e-books instead. But, we enjoy paperback books. We are happy to see the library reopen though we are not able to go through racks of books and spend time reading here,” said G Sinduja, who is a member at the library. Visitors, however, were unhappy that the library was open only from 10 am to 2 pm. Meanwhile, students preparing for competitive exams said that they are happy to be able to have their most comfortable space back for preparations. At both the district central library and the Madurai corporation office campus, more than 500 students come regularly to prepare for competitive exams. Students had to wear masks and maintain social distancing. “It’s been more than a week since we were allowed back here. It was a routine for us to come to the corporation campus to prepare, discuss with friends. We definitely missed it during lockdown. Unlike other exams, we need such a place to be mentally and physically comfortable for civil services exam preparation,” said S Kumar, a civil services exam aspirant. At Deepam Library, a lending library that is more than 18 years old, owners said that though there has been a general decline in the number of visitors over the years, Covid-19 safety concerns have not affected them in particular. The library is popular for its Tamil romance books. “The drastic shift to e-books was making us lose visitors over the past few years. However, surprisingly, we found that many people chose to come to the library instead post lockdown,” said Ushadevi Shenbagaraj, who runs the library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fewer-people-visit-reopened-libraries-students-happy-to-reclaim-comfort-zone/articleshow/78544221.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

A Gir Forest employee finds a lion on road. He tries to explain in Gujarati, the lion that he has been working whol… https://t.co/QzIqXfVUx0— Prakash Javadekar (@PrakashJavdekar) 1602056596000A lone Asiatic lion was lounging on a deserted road in Nihodi area of Gir in Junagadh on a moonless Monday night. Its languorous body was blocking the path of the forester who was driving home after his duty ended. He stopped his motorcycle, its headlight piercing the beast in the surrounding impenetrable darkness, adding a sense of foreboding to what appeared to be a developing human-animal face-off.Mahesh Sondarwa, the forester, works as a beat guard in the Kothari area. He waited for the lion to move, keeping the headlight on. The jungle’s royalty was unfazed by the spotlight and stayed entrenched. But Sondarwa soon recognized the lion as the one he tracked regularly and opened negotiations with it in pleas-laced Gujarati. Sondarwa requested the lion to clear the path for him, even clucking in sympathy and reasonableness. The lion seemed to find the dialect both respectful and persuasive and shuffled away from the unkempt road, sliding like a ghost into the darkness. The video of the encounter has drawn thousands of views in less than 24 hours. Prakash Javadekar, the Union minister for environment & forest, tweeted it on Wednesday, attracting more than 18,000 views in a brisk viral spread. Sondarwa told TOI that he had been tracking the beast for the past 1.5 years. “I began filming the interaction using my phone because our deputy conservator of forests (DCF), Gir East, Anshuman Sharma, had instructed us to record anything unusual,” said Sondarwa. The video is a beautiful example of the harmonious co-existence between humans and the pride of Gir, Javadekar has said.“My lion-hearted staff member pleads with the lion in Gujarati to give way, telling the beast that he has been serving it the whole day,” said DCF Sharma. “The king graciously relents.” Sharma first posted the video on Twitter late on Monday, collecting more than 12,000 views. Sharma said foresters’ ability to communicate effectively with lions is uncommon. For his part, Sondarwa said that apart from the exhortations in Gujarati, his choice of sounds might have helped to end the 10-minute stalemate. “The sound is usually made to check if lions are responsive,” he said.

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Youth from Raj undergoes surgery in Kochi||KOCHI: A 20-year-old man travelled more than 2,000km from Rajasthan to Kochi with a ruptured lung for a surgery here. But on reaching here, he tested Covid positive and this further worsened his condition. However, once tested negative, an emergency surgery was performed on the patient and now he is better. Arjun P, who is from Kerala and a resident of Jalore in Rajasthan, developed sudden chest pain and severe breathlessness on August 24 and doctors there said that his left lung had ruptured. Though tube was inserted in the lung, doctors said that there was a large hole in the lung which needed to be repaired by surgery. At this point, his family decided to get him to Kochi as cardiothoracic surgeon Dr Nasser Yusuf had successfully operated on Arjun three years ago when he had a similar problem in the right lung. With a tube in his chest, Arjun and family travelled by road for seven hours from Jalore to Ahmedabad to catch a flight to Kochi. “However, on reaching Ahmedabad airport, he was refused entry into the flight because of the tube in his chest. Almost 24 hours later, with a medical certificate stating that he was fit to travel, Arjun was permitted to board a flight to Kochi,” said Arjun’s father Rajan P, who runs a school at Jalore. On arrival, he was admitted at Sunrise Hospital. During a routine check-up at the hospital, he was found to be Covid positive. He was weak and malnourished and infection had set in with pus draining out through the tube, with surgery being the only hope to save his life. But there were concerns as operating on a Covid patient is a huge challenge, as the infection further damages the lung. However, the doctors at Sunrise Hospital decided to do the keyhole surgery of chest (minimally invasive thoracic surgery) instead of the open surgery on him. “Taking into account the deteriorating condition of the patient, we performed an emergency surgery on September 18. There was pus in the chest cavity, the lung was densely stuck to the heart with multiple Bullae (balloon like formations) on the lung surface, of which one had ruptured. This resulted in air leak and bubbling,” said Dr Yusuf. The pus was completely drained, the lung freed, multiple bullae removed and hole in the lung repaired. The patient was discharged after a week and is now doing fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/youth-from-raj-undergoes-surgery-in-city/articleshow/78541267.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Coimbatore||Lecturers seek equal pay for equal work||Coimbatore: Guest lecturers in government arts and science colleges across the state have reiterated their demand for equal pay or permanent posting.A government order (GO) issued on Tuesday allocated 4,084 guest lecturers across the state pay for six months from April to October. They will be paid Rs 15,000 per month. The lecturers said while the state has ensured an immediate relief for them, it should consider their demands for their welfare. In July, they raised concerns that, after the lockdown, they were not paid since April.V Thangaraj, state president of Tamil Nadu All Government College UGC Qualified Guest Lecturers Association, said they were handling online classes and the pay for six months was an immediate relief. “But our demand for equal pay for equal work still stands. Under equal pay, we have to be paid Rs 57,700 per month. The state should either pay us arrears or make us permanent,” he said.Officials of the directorate of collegiate education said the 4,084 guest lecturers are supporting government colleges in online classes. “They will continue to teach this academic year when colleges reopen. To pay them for the upcoming period, the state will allocate grants later,” an official said. Thangaraj said the state was not following guidelines which say only those guest lecturers qualified as per UGC norms must be roped in. “There were instances when a post got filled with a permanent lecturer who was transferred. In such cases, the state favours unqualified guest lecturers with more experience, rather than qualified ones with lesser experience,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lecturers-seek-equal-pay-for-equal-work/articleshow/78542420.cms||---

The public works department, which maintains the dam, will release 2,548 mcft of water from the dam over the next 80 days, which will help irrigate 22,116 acres of fertile farmlands in the block.

Flowers were dropped into the gushing waters to celebrate the opening of the gate. It was attended by PWD chief engineer Muthusamy and senior engineers Rajendran and Leela. Anamalai panchayat president Shanthi Karthik also attended the event.While opening the dam gates, the collector appealed to farmers to save water as much as possible.Though water is released every year, farmers’ association in the region often complain that it is never released for the full 80 days. Many canals are blocked, leading to some lands not receiving water properly and the authorities often not release the promised quantity, they say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aliyar-dam-opened-for-irrigation/articleshow/78542451.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chennai||What will the AIADMK committee steer?||CHENNAI: The ten-hour discussion that ended in the wee hours on Wednesday fructified the three-year-old demand of deputy chief minister and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam to constitute the steering committee. The party, however, is still to work on the role of the 11-member committee in the party that was a sticking point in discussion for announcing the CM candidate. The general council of the AIADMK, after the merger in 2017, in one of the resolutions stated that a steering committee would be set up, in addition to the creation of posts of coordinator, joint coordinator and two deputy coordinators, doing away the post of general secretary, held by Jayalalithaa for three decades. In another resolution, it amended a bylaw -- inserting rule 20-C – and the general council stated, “The members of the advisory committee shall be selected/nominated by the coordinator and joint coordinator. They shall provide advice for the growth and success of the Kazhagam.” The amendments were acknowledged by the election commission in 2018. So, what are the powers and functions of the committee? “It will be included in the bylaws,” Panneerselvam told reporters. The members of the OPS camp said the leader wanted a more powerful committee in place to steer the party and repeatedly demanded the same from the other side. Incidentally, the party revamped its apex body, Parliamentary board, only in November 2017, after the death of two members, J Jayalalithaa and Visalakshi Nedunchezian, and included Edappadi K Palaniswami, two deputy coordinators and former minister B Valarmathi. Its mandate is to identify the candidates for elections. Panneerselvam and presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan also are members of the board. The party leaders say that ‘terms of reference’ for the steering committee will have to be worked out by the leadership and the general council will have to ratify it. The committee may be asked to assist the coordinator and joint coordinator in identifying office-bearers, shortlisting candidates, formation of alliances and initiating disciplinary action against erring cadres and functionaries. “The committee will perform the duties allocated and assigned by the coordinator and joint coordinator in the interest of the party,” said P H Manoj Pandian, one of the members of the steering committee. Insiders say that when deputy coordinators, K P Munusamy and R Vaithilingam visited chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s residence on Sunday and persuaded him to set up the committee to resolve the deadlock, the latter is believed to have said that he had more than 100 aspirants for the committee. Palaniswami decided to convene a meeting of ministers the next day and conceded to OPS’s demand. “While the leadership took pains in providing representation to various castes, religions and regions, lack of representation to women and Muslims is glaring, which would not have happened if Amma was alive,” said a senior leader, seeking anonymity. There are more committees in the pipeline for propaganda, elections, and campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/what-will-the-aiadmk-committee-steer/articleshow/78542429.cms||Julie Mariappan

As they failed to produce them, we seized the vehicles. We have asked them to bring the papers. Based on it, and on consultation with senior officials, we will take action against the owners of the vehicles,” he said. “Only three trucks were carrying red earth, but we seized four of them based on suspicion.”Thadagam-based activists, meanwhile, cited RTI replies and a report by the Tamil Nadu pollution control board’s (TNPCB) special team, and said none of the kilns had permits from departments such as mines and minerals, pollution control board, and environment impact assessment clearance, to mine red earth.S Ganesh, who has been fighting against the illegal red earth mining in the area, said the kilns did not have any mandatory permits from the relevant departments. “We have been fighting for the issue for long, and only now officials have seized vehicles used for illegal earth mining,” he said.Ganesh also pointed to government order 170 issued by the industries department on August 5, which says vehicles used for mining and transporting minerals without permit must be seized and produced before court, and the perpetrators fined. A team of TNPCB officials from across the state had visited the units in Thadagam valley and in January, submitted a report saying that ‘183 illegally-operating brick kilns shall be closed’, in view of not obtaining mandatory permissions, and also for polluting the region.Following the report in January, TNPCB officials from the district inspected the kilns. As they had not obtained consent of the board and hadn’t taken measures to control air pollution, they had recommended the revenue department to close the kilns, seal machinery and disconnect power to the units. But the kilns continue to operate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/5-vehicles-used-to-mine-red-earth-seized-in-thadagam/articleshow/78542427.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Kerala HC dismisses plea on nepotism||KOCHI: The high court has dismissed a petition alleging nepotism in the selection of films for Kerala State Film Awards. Justice N Nagaresh dismissed the petition by filmmakers Satish Babusenan, Shinos Rahman, and composer K Santhosh. The court said when the panel of jury is constituted by the government, it cannot be said that jury will be biased and will favour the chairman or executive board of Kerala State Chalachitra Academy, which institutes the awards. The academy has no power to reject any application and the petitioners have failed to establish any bias by members of the jury, the court held. It was alleged by the petitioners that nepotism is rampant in selecting the films for the state film awards. Films by relatives of the academy’s chairman and vice chairperson were selected for last year’s awards, the petition had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-dismisses-plea-on-nepotism/articleshow/78541278.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Trichy||Trichy cops fast-track action on complaints, go to doorstep||TRICHY: The Trichy city police have carried out inquiries and disposed of 164 petitions in the last three days under the new scheme introduced on October 3, wherein police officials will visit the residences of the complainants for inquiry. An initiative of the state police, the spot enquiry scheme was aimed at reaching out to the complainants at their doorstep during the Covid-19 pandemic. A police official said that the scheme will favour the public and will prevent the spread of Covid-19 as the complainant need not visit the police station. Under the scheme, email and WhatsApp complaints/ petitions filed in police stations will be inquired by police officers without any partiality, police said. In the three days till October 6, 180 petitions were taken up for inquiry and inquired directly by inspectors and sub-inspectors. Of these, 164 petitions were disposed of. Police also came up with solutions for a few petitions. In one of the complaints, Saradha of Melur in Srirangam submitted a petition against her neighbour Rajaram and stated that the latter had installed a CCTV camera facing their house. She complained that it was an infringement of her family’s privacy. The petition was disposed of after inspector of police Sirangam visited the spot, conducted an inquiry and altered the direction of the CCTV camera. Vijayalakshmi of Pandiyan Street, K. K. Nagar area submitted a petition over a property dispute with her relatives. The inspector visited the spot and during inquiry, both parties were advised to seek remedy through the court as it was a civil dispute. They were also advised to maintain status quo. In another petition, Sorna of Geethapuram in Srirangam sought the intervention of the police to get back her jewellery from her husband. Inspector of all women police station (AWPS) Srirangam visited the house, conducted an inquiry and ensured that the jewellery was returned to Sorna. Commissioner of police, Trichy, J Loganathan said that residents have welcomed the scheme and it will be followed regularly and all necessary steps will be taken for the better service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-cops-fast-track-action-on-plaints-go-to-doorstep/articleshow/78544252.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Timely hospitalization will help curb Covid deaths, say doctors||COIMBATORE: An analysis of Covid-19 fatalities in the district has revealed that one third or 35% of patients who succumbed to the virus were aged below 60 years. Of the 469 Covid-19 deaths that occurred in the district until Tuesday, 161 victims were aged below 60 and the remaining 308 were above 60. While only 13 people in their 20s and 30s succumbed to the virus in the district so far, 148 victims were aged between 40 and 60. Doctors said these fatalities could have been avoided if they had sought right medical attention early. “Most of them approached hospitals only after 50% to 60% of their lungs were affected and immune system started overreacting. Even young people with mild comorbidities should opt for proper hospitalization,” they said. As per the data available with the public health department, 48 deceased were in their 40s and 100 in their 50s. Another 255 were aged between 60 and 80. Dr P Murugesan, district’s nodal officer for Covid-19 statistics, said, “Death of people in the age group of 40 to 60 is worrying because they may be the sole bread winners of their families. People in their 60s could also survive the infection and they are not considered old in the present day.” He said more than 70% death of people below 70 could have been prevented if they had gone to hospital on the day they tested positive or developed initial symptoms of fever or sore throat. Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy, infectious diseases expert who treats Covid-19 in Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, said Covid-19 complications would usually occur seven days after the onset of symptoms. “Many people, including youngsters with juvenile diabetes or those above 40 with comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension, may look clinically fine but develop complications such as thrombosis, myocardial stroke and lung damage, etc., later on. The virus behaves differently with different people. In some cases, it suddenly flares up affecting all organs, including brain, due to the clotting it causes.” Doctors said early hospitalization would help control the lung damage with antivirals like Remdesivir and modulate the reaction of immune system with steroids. The virus’s tendency to cause clotting could also be handled with blood thinner injections. “There are many instances of controlling the lung damage of people, who come with initial lung changes or 10% damage. In some cases, lung damage is brought down to 10% from 40% after five days of medication,” Dr Murugesan said. At home, he said, one could have only Tamiflu tablets, which were not as effective as Remdesivir, minimal steroid dosage and blood thinners. “Also, by the time they see drop in oxygen saturation level, their lung could have been 60% affected.” The health department said oxygen saturation may drop in Covid-19 patients suddenly. A 31-year-old Covid-19 patient, whose both lungs were affected with pneumonia, said, “It is so rapid… we function normally and suddenly start gasping for breath. At home, people can’t handle a situation like this.” Pointing out that patients in their 80s had recovered from Covid-19, Dr P Krishna, joint director of medical services, appealed to people above 60 or with comorbidities to get tested for the virus at the onset of symptoms like sore throat or feverishness. “In the present situation, anyone with flu-like symptoms is a suspected Covid-19 case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/timely-hospitalization-will-help-curb-covid-deaths-docs/articleshow/78542465.cms||---

Considering the restrictions in view of Covid-19 pandemic, only the Chief Justice and three of the senior-most judges took part in the 25-minute reference held at the Chief Justice’s court on behalf of all the judges. The reference was addressed by Chief Justice S Manikumar, advocate general CP Sudhakara Prasad, and Kerala High Court Advocate Association (KHCAA) president R Lakshmi Narayan, and was attended by several senior lawyers and women lawyers by maintaining social distancing. In his reference speech, Chief Justice Manikumar described Justice Usha as an activist for social causes throughout her life. She was also a lover of nature and many of her judgments and opinions stood testimony to this, the Chief Justice said. “Her judicial sword was brandished against the plastic menace,” the Chief Justice remarked. Justice Usha was also an inspiration to young lawyers, especially women, the Chief Justice added. Following the speeches, the court rose for two minutes of silence to mark Justice Usha’s demise. The Chief Justice also announced that the court would be suspended for 20 minutes to honour Justice Usha’s memory.

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Presidency College students celebrate the man behind Penrose’s inspiration||KOLKATA: As the world celebrates Roger Penrose’s physics Nobel, a group of old boys of the erstwhile Presidency College are celebrating the root of this success — The Raychaudhuri Equation — invented by Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri, one of the most celebrated professors of physics of the college since 1961 for over four decades. His students rue that though his was a pathbreaking work upon which others built and got recognition, Raychaudhuri did not get the fame he deserved and remained the quintessential mastermoshai all his life, never aspiring for more. The Raychaudhuri Equation was a seminal contribution of AKR, as he is still called by his students, which distilled the essence of Eintein’s equations to explain the phenomenon of warping of space-time in the regions of strong gravity. “This equation played a pivotal role in the work of Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking in their analysis of the initial singularity of the Universe, popularly known as the Big Bang,” explained Gautam Mandal, a celebrated physicist at the TIFR and a student of AKR. “While Penrose is rightfully being celebrated, this is also the time to remind the world of the simple man who laid the foundation on which Penrose and Hawking developed the Big Bang. As students for long we did not know that he was “The” man behind the equation. He never let awe come in between him and his students,” Mandal said. Students worshipped the white dhoti-kurta clad man like God. “Even when he taught in the US, he never gave up his simple attire and way of life. He would take us beyond our textbooks and would help us demystify the link between maths and physics,,” said another student Sutirtha Bhattacharya, now the chairman of the West Bengal Power Regulatory Commission. Students remember him spending hours on calculations that spanned two adjacent blackboards. On some occasions, he would work on these calculations with his students through the day and yet not arrive at an answer. That would leave him frustrated and then suddenly the next day, he would barge into the classroom while another lecture was on and say “peye gechhi!”. He would rush to the blackboard to explain his eureka moment to them. “We should appeal to Indian physicists across the globe to spread the word about AKR. They should know about the man behind the equation. He was from another era when teaching was a passion over pursuing careers, but we should do our bit,” said another student and former home secretary of the state, Prasad Ranjan Roy. The alumni association of Presidency has uploaded a video about AKR and is also getting his students to pay tributes on the website, said Bivas Chaudhuri, vice-president of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presi-students-celebrate-the-man-behind-penroses-inspiration/articleshow/78542473.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Pathologist’s signature must for lab report: Panel||KOLKATA: Digital signatures will not be allowed in lab reports, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) said on Wednesday. The commission feels that manual signature could help in checking typographical errors and prevent untoward consequences in medical treatment. Also, the labs will not able to charge patients for repeat tests if previous reports are found to be erroneous, it has been said. Currently, most private labs use mechanical/digital signature of the authorized official in test reports. The health panel feels that if the labs go back to manual signature after running a proper check of the reports, it could help in preventing errors seeping into the report. “Manual signature is feasible in case of standalone labs. But this could be tough in case of lab chains that have various units,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury, who is attached with Peerless Hospital. Private labs claimed that digital signatures are password-protected and the signature is put only after approval of the reports. They admitted that human error could sometimes happen even if they sign it manually, especially when the workload is huge. “In our unit, we still practice manual signature in lab reports. But this could be difficult for labs that handle various samples in large volumes. But honestly, human error could seep in even in case of manually signed reports despite best efforts,” said associate professor of paediatrics Sumon Poddar, who is in charge of the microbiology lab at Institute of Child Health. “We are framing a guideline to bring down the number of disputes and allegations of wrong report against private labs,” said Justice Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairman of WBCERC. The issue came up during the hearing of four cases against four different labs on Wednesday, in which the panel found lapses on the part of two. A 38-year-old woman, who was in home isolation after she and her husband tested positive to Covid, had sent her blood samples for D-dimer test, a test to confirm blood clotting, to Medica Superspeciality Hospital. On seeing an abnormally high D-dimer value in the report that showed 41,032ng/ml (normal range is less than or equal to 500 ng/ml), the Covid patient’s doctor asked for a repeat test that showed a normal report. Later, Medica admitted to typographical error where the data entry operator had entered 410.32, without the decimal. “The wrong report has caused a lot of trauma to couple’s only teenage daughter who was looking after her parents and the family,” said Banerjee, while asking Medica to pay a compensation of Rs 10,000, along with the refund of the test cost and reimburse the cost the patient incurred in the second laboratory. The hospital has agreed to comply with the order. In another order, the commission has asked Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre to refund test cost and reimburse the amount charged for a repeat test that was done in another lab to a woman from Mominpore. Despite all efforts, TOI could not get in touch with the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pathologists-signature-must-for-lab-report-panel/articleshow/78542459.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
October 8, 2020||Nagpur||OF unions reject govt accusation of ‘illegal strike’||Nagpur: The unions in ordnance factories have hit back at the Department of Defence Production (DPP), saying that it has no powers to decide that their strike is illegal. The letter issued on Wednesday is in response to DPP’s communication to the unions last week that their notice for an indefinite strike from October 12 was illegal. The three unions in the ordnance factories, including the RSS affiliated Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS), have declared an indefinite strike against government’s move to corporatize the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). The three unions, in response to the DPP letter, have cited the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 to prove their point. The unions says that the ordnance employees and their associations are also covered under the same law. Under the act, the employer is not empowered to decide the validity of the strike or strike notice. Therefore, DDP being the employer in this case, is not the proper authority to decide on legality of the strike in ordnance factories. The unions’ letter further says that section 23 of the act would only be applicable when any conciliation is pending before a board. Since no board of reconciliation has been constituted, the provision which prevents employees from going on strike during pendency of talks will also not apply. A meeting has been scheduled with the Chief Labour Commissioner (CLC) on October 9. The letter say the unions are prepared to attend the meeting and will decide on further course of action after that. C Srikumar, general secretary of the All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), said, “Talks can be held with the CLC, in line with the act, as the dispute is related to change in workers’ employment conditions. The workers will no longer be government or defence civilian employees after corporatisation.” Srikumar said the unions have fundamentally rejected the idea of corporatisation and will rather stress during the talks that government should come up with a five year programmer on improving the ordnance factories’ functioning in the existing set up. The unions have stressed that corporatisation cannot be a viable option because defence production is not a commercial viable business. The ordnance factories, on becoming a corporation, will have to become financially self-sustaining. This may not be easy due to fluctuating orders from the armed forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/of-unions-reject-govt-accusation-of-illegal-strike/articleshow/78542506.cms||Shishir Arya
October 8, 2020||Nagpur||NMC allows BJP banner on ambulance at special Covid testing camp||NAGPUR: Displaying BJP banner on a civic body’s ambulance during a special camp organized for collection of swab samples of high-risk contacts of Covid patients and comorbids in ward no. 34 has raised a political storm in the city. Opposition parties have accused Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials and employees of allowing the BJP workers to use the ambulance for displaying the party’s banner having its leaders photos. TOI has picture in which the banner on the ambulance claims BJP unit of ward no-34 has organized the RT-PCR camp. The banner also highlighted pictures of BJP leaders and corporator Nagesh Mankar. The camp was inaugurated by Mankar, co-opted corporator Kishor Wankhede, who is also president of BJP unit of South-West Nagpur and others from the party. With the decline in testing, the civic body has started to hold special camps in residential areas. The NMC is taking the help of corporators, NGOs and community leaders to encourage high-risk contacts and persons with comorbid conditions to get the tests done. When his attention was drawn to the BJP banner on ambulance, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “It is not acceptable. I have already sent strong directions to all field officials not to indulge or permit such things in future.” In a few camps, BJP’s banners were placed near the sample collection centres. NCP state vice-president Vedprakash Arya condemned NMC officials for allowing BJP banner on ambulance and permitting the party to engage in publicity at Covid-19 testing camps. “Special camps used to be organized when Tukaram Mundhe was municipal commissioner. Special camps were not held when they were required most in the last two weeks of August and first three weeks of September. How can NMC administration allow BJP leaders to do party’s publicity,” he questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-allows-bjp-banner-on-ambulance-at-special-covid-testing-camp/articleshow/78549098.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
October 8, 2020||Chennai||A battle neither Edappadi K Palaniswami nor O Panneerselvam lost||In the end, no one lost as both chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy CM O Panneerselvam had their way. But the road ahead is still bumpy. While it was a foregone conclusion that it will be EPS, who will be named the party’s chief minister candidate, the latest round of political tussle helped him to get the party to reiterate that position unequivocally. The fact that he had to indulge in lot of political maneuvering to get it showed he is no super power in the league of party founder M G Raamchandran and his successor J Jayalalithaa, though he too gets to seek another term. OPS must be a happy man too, having got the 11-member committee as a face saver. Beyond preventing him from undertaking yet another ‘Dharmayudh’, it offers very little leverage for OPS. He has been denied any additional power or authority, including becoming the sole signatory over party affairs, as it was strenuously gossiped during the past week. Not to speak about his nominees, barring two, who pale into insignificance against EPS’s generals on the committee. The fact that former MP V Maitreyan, who was the first to support him in his Dharmayudh against V K Sasikala and her clan, does not figure in the list, which a party leader termed as a ‘pseudo committee’, could trouble his support group. But EPS seems to have gained in confidence in deftly handling the political crisis, with enough experience in heralding his government to sustain nearly four years of political turbulence, from within as well as from outside. As the crisis ballooned, EPS stayed put in Chennai, nonchalantly going about his chief ministerial tasks, and exuding confidence about working out an amicable solution soon. Amidst the crisis, OPS left for Theni, perhaps thinking he would make the task more difficult for the mediators. But he had to make a hasty retreat, to be seen as the most wanted during the protracted negotiation process that dragged on till the early hours of Wednesday, the deadline for the big announcement. With the path cleared, EPS is now free to project himself the way he wants – as the common man-CM or simply a farmer-CM. Having slipped his way through the power centre at a crucial time when both the party and the government were in crisis, EPS has outsmarted many. For him, the real test is still ahead. With EPS now the CM candidate, it will pitchfork him into a direct battle with DMK president M K Stalin. The battle is sure to turn bitter. People who were willing to discount the misdemeanors of his governance so far, assuming him to be an also-ran, will sharpen their attacks. “The burden has increased for EPS. Cadres celebrating him being named the CM candidate as an electoral victory could lead to complacency. Besides, the anti-incumbency factor will come to the fore since he was already ruling for four years,” said an AIADMK insider. The electoral verdict is still seven months away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-battle-neither-eps-nor-ops-lost/articleshow/78542536.cms||D Govardan

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Kerala HC orders action against ‘fake voters’||KOCHI: Complaints about inclusion of ‘fake voters’ in draft electoral roll cannot be neglected for the reason that objections are not raised in the prescribed form, the Kerala high court has held while ordering action against ‘fake voters’. Justice P B Suresh Kumar said in the judgment, “True, objections against draft electoral roll are expected to be submitted in the prescribed form, for if objections are vague, the competent authority may not be able to consider the same. But that does not mean that in a given case where the competent authority is satisfied based on complaints or other materials that the name of a person has been included in the electoral roll based on false declaration, he is not without authority to make appropriate corrections in the electoral roll.” The court considered a petition (WP-C No. 18554/2020) filed by P Jayakanth and Benny Thomas of Idukki through advocate Mathew A Kuzhalnadan. It was alleged in the petition that a large number of persons not residing ordinarily in Udumbanchola panchayat have been included in the electoral roll based on false declarations given by them. Several persons shown as residing in particular houses are not even know to the owners of those houses. A detailed complaint was filed before Kerala State Election Commission and objections were filed before electoral registration officer of the panchayat. At the hearing, the petitioners’ counsel submitted that it has become common practice in the state to include persons who are not ordinarily residing in an area in the electoral roll. Even if it is found later in enquiry that they gave false declarations, no action is being taken. Due to this, large-scale enrolments based on false declarations are taking place in the state, the court was told. Ruling in favour of the petitioners, the court directed for considering the complaint and objections before finalizing the electoral roll and ordered for taking action against the ‘fake voters’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-orders-action-against-fake-voters/articleshow/78541328.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Erode||Woman, 51, hacked to death in Erode||ERODE: An unidentified bike-borne man hacked a 51-year-old woman to death near Gobichettipalayam here on Tuesday night. Police suspect that the murder might have been committed by a truck driver, who had vainly approached the woman to marry her youngest daughter. The Gobichettipalayam police identified the deceased as T Mary, of Periyamodachur village. She is survived by five daughters. A police officer said Mary’s second daughter Annamary, along with her husband Pushparaj, had visited her on Tuesday night. “Around 9.30pm, they came out, ready to leave for their house. Mary also came out to send them off. An unidentified person suddenly came on a bike and hacked her. Mary sustained hack injuries to her head and neck. The man also hacked Pushparaj and Mary’s neighbours when they attempted to rescue her. The man then sped away.” Pushparaj and Mary were taken to the government hospital in Gobichettipalayam, where the latter died without responding to treatment. The officer said the condition of Pushparaj was stable. Preliminary inquiry revealed that a 38-year-old truck driver, identified as S Murugan, was in an unrequited love with Mary’s youngest daughter, who was just 19 years old. “Mary had turned down his proposal to marry her daughter about five years ago. He might have hacked Mary to death to take revenge on her,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/woman-51-hacked-to-death-in-erode/articleshow/78542517.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Trichy||900t int’l cargo sent from Trichy on rescue flights in 5 months||Trichy: Though the pandemic hampered cargo operation in the last five months, Trichy international airport has sent 885 tonnes of cargo, mostly perishables, to various countries through Indian and foreign carriers during the lockdown. The exporters have been relying on rescue charter flights and Vande Bharat mission flights for sending perishables to customers. Singapore, Malaysia and middle east destinations like Sharjah, Dubai, Doha and Muscat saw exporters consigning their commodities regularly. “Earlier, countries like Kuwait operated charter flights to Trichy with the Tamils stranded there and lifted some cargo during return. However, after the Director General of Civil Aviation denied nod for charter flights, that was also stopped”, a cargo terminal official said.Though outbound flights are departing from Trichy with minimum seat occupation, Covid-19 norms restrict terminal officials to load cargo on the passenger hold area. Meanwhile, exporters lamented that exorbitant charges were hampering their plans to send more volume of commodities, despite having enough space in the flights. “Earlier, we used to pay Rs 45 a kg as flight charge, but now we are paying Rs 102 for the same weight. In case of charter flights, we have to pay up to Rs 135 per kg for it. Though we have the required space on the flights, considering the charges, we restrict ourselves to minimum volume of perishable”, managing director of MB Cargo, R Muralidharan, said. Cargo consignments through Trichy airport received a fillip after its old terminal was turned into a cargo port in 2011 and the Central Board of Customs and Excise notified it as an export cargo terminal. During 2012-13, the terminal handled 2,400 tonnes. Now it has touched around 7,000 to 8,000 tonnes, airport sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/900t-intl-cargo-sent-from-trichy-on-rescue-flights-in-5-months/articleshow/78544271.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

Asymptomatic ones were asked to stay till Friday. We haven’t received or seen our actual result.”The patients said there has been no water in bathrooms since Monday. “There is no power backup.

October 8, 2020||Vijayawada||CMRF scam: ACB nabs six from Dakshina Kannada||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Wednesday arrested six persons involved in the alleged attempt of swindling Rs 117 crore from AP’s Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF) using fake cheques. According to ACB sources, the arrested persons were identified as Yogish Acharya (40), resident of Moodbidri, Udaya Shetty Kantavara (35), Brijesh Rai – both from Mangaluru, Belthangady, a resident of Gangadhara and two others. Officials said that the six accused were involved in fabricating fake cheques that looked like real ones with same cheque numbers and signatures. Sources said that it was Yogesh who tried to deposit the fake cheque and draw Rs 52 crore from the CMRF at the SBI branch in Moodbidri. Luckily, the transactions were stopped after SBI bank officials verified it with the assistant secretary of the revenue department P Murali Krishna Rao who quickly stopped the transactions. Later, he lodged a complaint with Thullur police. Two cases were registered with the Thullur police in this regard. Within the department, officials also stopped all the transactions from the CMRF as ACB was also ordered to probe into the case. Officials are also looking into the transaction attempts made at branches in Mangaluru, West Bengal and Delhi. Previously, the AP police had arrested a person for allegedly drawing Rs 10 lakh from an SBI branch in Kadapa district. It all started prior to September 19, when one Bhaskar Reddy took three cheques issued to the beneficiaries for Rs 25,000 and assured them of giving the amount. He reportedly tampered with the cheques by changing the amount, deposited in the bank, and encashed them. Bhaskar Reddy too was taken into custody to ascertain his role in the scam. Further investigation is still underway as officials are trying to trace the other transaction attempts made by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cmrf-scam-acb-nabs-six-from-dakshina-kannada/articleshow/78541311.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

October 8, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kollam: Elderly man roughed up by cop||KOLLAM: An elderly man was roughed up by a police officer for not wearing helmet while riding pillion near Ayoor on Wednesday. Visuals of the police officer beating up the man had gone viral and a probe has been ordered into the incident. Probationary sub-inspector Shajeem, attached to Chadayamangalam police station showed scant regard to age as he manhandled the 69-year-old Ramanadan Nair and tried to throw him into the police jeep. The team led by Shajeem was conducting vehicle-checking at Manjappara when they stopped the two-wheeler with two helmet-less riders on it. The rider, one Podimon and Nair, the pillion rider, were told to pay up Rs 500 each as fine. They told the police that they were manual labourers and had no money with them. They said they would remit the fee later at the police station but the police officer insisted on taking them into custody. Nair revealed to the SI that he was a patient and was feeling unwell. He also said that since he was riding pillion there was no justification in slapping a penalty on him. This provoked a furious response from the police officer who slapped Ramanandan Nair across the face and tried to bundle him into the police vehicle. But Nair managed to get out of the jeep and could be seen in the video pleading that he should be taken to a hospital. Noticing that local residents were recording the visuals of the incident, the police team let him go and left the scene taking Podimon with them. Nair was later admitted to Kadakkal taluk hospital. Police claimed Nair was drunk and he tried to attack the SI. But they refused to comment on why he was not taken to a hospital for a medical examination if he was drunk. Meanwhile, the SI has been transferred for rigorous training at KAP (5) battalion , Kuttikkanam. Rural SP Harisankar said further action would be initiated based on the investigation into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/elderly-man-roughed-up-by-cop/articleshow/78541354.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kolhapur||PMDS to install screens across city during Navaratra||Kolhapur: The Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti (PMDS) has decided not to open the Mahalakshmi temple for devotees during the festive period of Navaratra as the state government is yet to allow opening of temples and religious places. The temple trust has, however, said that devotees can avail the benefit of taking blessings of the goddess live through screens that will be installed at several places in the city. The screens will display daily ‘puja’ of Goddess Ambabai during the nine-day-long festivities. Every day, the goddess is draped in different coloured saree. Chairman of Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti Mahesh Jadhav said, “The government has not allowed opening of temples. However, the devotees will not be let down. They will get live darshan. We will ensure that no gatherings take place at the temple premises during the festival.” “The cleaning and disinfection of the temple has been done. The temple will be ready before the start of the festival on October 17. The movement inside the temple will, however, be restricted,” added Jadhav. District collector Daulat Desai has already asked the PMDS to celebrate Navaratra in simple way and not let devotees throng the temple. He has even asked the trust authorities to use vehicles for the Navaratra procession instead of a palanquin. The members of royal family will, however, be allowed entry inside the temple to perform puja as per the old ritual on Dussehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pmds-to-install-screens-across-city-during-navaratra/articleshow/78542544.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Ahmedabad||HC seeks report on women’s shelter home conditions||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has ordered the authorities to furnish details about condition of women protections homes across the state and explain their functioning and budgetary provisions. Taking cognizance of “the pathetic condition of food and also of building and other necessities” in women protection homes, a bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Nirzar Desai on Monday ordered the principal secretary of social justice and empowerment department to depute senior officers to inform the court about details. The HC has sought details on affidavit about functioning of the women protection homes, for both women above 18 years and girls below 18, and total amount of funds allocated for these homes on yearly basis. The HC has called for details on administration, the guidelines framed for running these homes, officials obligated for implementation and its evaluating mechanism. The court has sought details by October 16. The judges observed that the court’s interference is required for improvement in conditions of women protection homes, because the court is getting accounts from inmates about the situation and how they are lacking in amenities. After hearing about the pathetic condition about a protection home in Kutch from a pregnant minor, who has been placed there under care on HC’s order, the judges said that many inmates are young and with foetus in their wombs and they required good care. “It is found and noticed from many of the matters which have come before this Court that it is sadly lacking and hence, there will be a requirement for the court to know these details for the purpose of redressal,” the court said. The HC has made it clear that this is not an adversarial litigation and it is for the welfare of those girls who are directed to be housed in protection homes and for whose benefits, these homes are in existence. “If there is requirement of mending the ways, the same shall be revealed to the court so that a better environment can be created for these girls in future,” the court observed. The HC has recently ordered for imparting education, formal computer training and vocational training among inmates of women protection homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-seeks-report-on-womens-shelter-home-conditions/articleshow/78542187.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest at toll plazas in Punjab result in Rs 4 crore revenue loss in 6 days||CHANDIGARH: At least 17 toll plazas across Punjab have faced revenue loss of nearly Rs 4 crore in the last six days, as 31 protesting farmers’ organisations were not allowing toll plaza officials to collect toll fees. But protesters have not blocked the movement of vehicles at toll plazas. There are 23 toll plazas in Punjab. R P Singh, regional officer, Chandigarh of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), told TOI, “We are going to have a meeting with the Punjab chief secretary on Thursday and will take up this issue.” He added that the NHAI authorities are deliberating as to how farmers’ organisations could be engaged in peaceful talks so that they do not obstruct collection of toll fee at toll plazas. As many as 31 farmers’ organisations had intensified their protest from October 1 across the state against Centre’s three contentious farm Acts. These Acts include The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Besides laying siege to various railway tracks in the state, the farmers’ organisations are also continuing their protest at toll plazas. The farmers’ organisations said it is their strategy that as the Union government would face revenue loss, it would be under pressure to take back these controversial laws. These 23 toll plazas also faced huge revenue loss earlier as the Punjab government had on March 27 suspended operations at all state toll plazas till the period of lockdown to control the spread of deadly coronavirus. The state government had allowed collection of toll fees from May 4. The Punjab government had taken the decision to suspend collection of toll fees considering that the situation arising out of the coronavirus epidemic would be construed as a “non-political force majeure event” in terms of the concession agreement with the toll plaza concessionaire. Force majeure are certain events, beyond the control of both the parties, which may inhibit the parties from fulfilling their duties and obligations under the project agreements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-protest-at-toll-plazas-in-punjab-result-in-rs-4-crore-revenue-loss-in-6-days/articleshow/78543863.cms||Sanjeev Verma
October 8, 2020||Chennai||Third phase of Covaxin trial to begin in Chennai soon||CHENNAI: A month after phase-2 human clinical trials began for the indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, a city hospital has started calling for volunteers for phase-3 trials, set to begin soon, in which the efficacy of the vaccine will be tested. SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre in Kattankulathur, where the trials are underway, was one of the 12 institutions in the country chosen by ICMR to conduct the trials for the vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR and the National Institute of Virology. Dr Satyajit Mohapatra, principal investigator for the trials at the hospital, said phase-3 trials may begin in two weeks after they receive the approval and protocols to be followed, which includes the vaccine dosage to be administered to volunteers, from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). Unlike phase-1 and 2, phase-3 trial will be conducted on a larger population of nearly 40,000 people across all the sites. SRM will require around 1,500 volunteers aged above 18. “Discussions and preparation for the next phase are going on. We are expecting phase-3 to start in the next two weeks. DCGI will give approval for the phase once the data for the first two phases are submitted,” he said. Dr Mohapatra said while the second dose of the vaccine in phase-2 trials is being administered to the volunteers, so far the volunteers in the first two phases have not reported any adverse effects. Phase-1, which started on July 23, involved testing the safety of the vaccine, phase-2, that commenced on September 8, looked for immunogenicity or the vaccine’s ability to provoke an immune response. Phase-1 had 30 volunteers. In phase-2, 45 volunteers are receiving two shots of 0.05ml of the vaccine, containing inactivated coronavirus, within a gap of 28 days. They will have to visit the hospital for a follow up on day 42, 56, third month and on the sixth month. “In phase-1, almost all volunteers were found doing well, so the safety of the vaccine is almost proven. In phase-2, we are administering the second dose to the volunteers and will submit data to DCGI soon. There are some parallel pre-clinical studies going on. So, based on all that, DCGI will approve phase-3,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/third-phase-of-covaxin-trial-to-begin-in-city-soon/articleshow/78542564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

October 8, 2020||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Finance minister hints at lapse of 14th Finance Commission funds||VIJAYAWADA: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has hinted at the lapse of 14th Finance Commission grants to the state government including the funds to bridge the revenue deficit of Rs 22,000 crore as estimated at the time of AP’s bifurcation. “The 14th Finance Commission’s term is over. We are in the 15th Finance Commission’s term. We have already received the interim report of the 15th Finance Commission for the first year,” the finance minister said during her interaction with the media here on Wednesday. The state government is claiming a grant of Rs 2,253.52 crore to the local bodies from the Centre as recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and finance minister Buggana Rajendranath have made separate representations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sitharaman and Union home minister Amit Shah seeking release of these funds, besides other pending dues to the state during their recent visit to the national capital. Though Sitharaman evaded a direct reply by simply saying that the term of the 14th Finance Commission is over, local leaders are of the view that the funds promised to the state under local bodies account and the recommendations of the commission have also lapsed.  This would also mean that there would be no special category status to the state which was also recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. The Centre should give Rs 2,253.52 crore to the state under local bodies account, of which Rs 1,671.84 crore for the rural local bodies and Rs 581.58 crore for the urban local bodies. Of this, Rs 129.45 crore is basic grant for the rural local bodies while Rs 452.13 crore is performance grant. This amount is due since 2015-16 from the 14th Finance Commission. Sitharaman also evaded a direct reply to a question on the release of revenue deficit to the state and approved by the CAG at the time of bifurcation of the state in 2014. The state had claimed Rs 22,948.76 crore revenue gap in the state while the Central government had estimated it at Rs 4,117.89 crore. The centre had already released Rs 3,979.5 crore and Rs 138.39 crore is due for the state. However, the state government continues to claim Rs 22,948.76 crore revenue gap which was also substantiated by the CAG. According to the CAG reports, Rs 18,830.87 crore is due to the state from the Centre. But, release of these funds including those for the local bodies remains impossible with the finance minister indicating that the 14th Finance Commission’s term has expired, political pundits feel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/finance-minister-hints-at-lapse-of-14th-finance-commission-funds/articleshow/78541397.cms||Gopi Dara

October 8, 2020||Meerut||Desperate farmers selling cane to jaggery units at discount, as mills withhold last year’s dues||Bijnor: Cane farmers are rushing to private jaggery units or kolhus to sell their produce at a discounted price, what with this season’s crop ripening in the fields and west UP mills still withholding substantial dues of farmers from the last season. Kolhus pay Rs 230-250 per quintal of sugarcane, whereas the state-advised price (SAP) for mills is Rs 315. With cane ripening in the field, kolhus have begun operations while sugar mills are scheduled to begin crushing from mid-October. The area under sugarcane cultivation in UP is 27.38 lakh hectares. The state has 119 sugar mills, mostly concentrated in west UP. In all, 40 lakh farmers are directly or indirectly involved in cane farming in the state. Cane dues are a burning issue for every government, and sugar mills are yet to clear Rs 8,500 crore dues from last year.SAP for the coming crushing season is yet to be announced. Farmers are demanding it be hiked from Rs 325 to Rs 450 per quintal. They were already up in arms against the government over the Centre’s farm bills. Now, they are eyeing a hike in sugarcane SAP.Across UP, over 8,000 kolhus and crushers have started crushing cane. Kolhu owners are purchasing crop at Rs 230-250 per quintal, while jaggery is sold at Rs 3,500-3,600 per quintal. Mills sell sugar at Rs 3,250 per quintal.According to sugarcane grower Jitendra Kumar, a resident of Madhusudanpur, “Sugar mills have failed to clear Rs 8,500 crore in dues from last year. They are yet to start operating, while kolhus are crushing cane from September. In such desperate conditions, farmers are being compelled to sell their produce at low rates to kolhu owners.”District cane officer Yashpal Singh said, “Mill officials have been asked to clear all dues. I hope they will do it soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/desperate-farmers-selling-cane-to-jaggery-units-at-discount-as-mills-withhold-last-years-dues/articleshow/78541400.cms||Harveer Dabas
October 8, 2020||Bhopal||Bhopal: Self medication? Spurt in sale of Paracetamol & antibiotics||BHOPAL: Consumption to medicines like Paracetamol for fever, immunity boosters like vitamin C tablets and antibiotics, which are used for treatment of sore throat have increased in the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Retailers as well as wholesalers claim that there has been an increase of more than 40% in the sale of vitamin C tablets and more than 25% increase has been reported in the sale of tablets like Paracetamol used in fever and antibiotics like Azithromycin, which is used for the treatment of sore throat. However, it is equally important that a majority of the sales increase has been in the generic medicine segment, not the ethical and branded medicines. This is probably because ethical medicines are higher in cost and are normally sold on prescription, but generic medicines are cheaper and consumers demand them on their own. But at the same time, there has been slump in demand for cough syrups. “There is at least 50% decrease in cough syrup sales all across, compared to the previous year as it is highly regulated and people normally do not sell them without prescription. And since doctors were not available for quite a long time, its overall sales have gone down,” said a pharma wholesaler, requesting anonymity. On the other hand, pharma dealers claim that the sales of other medicines related to fever and other symptoms have increased significantly. “Roughly, the sales of vitamin C medicines have increased by more than 40%. Similarly, sales of medicines like Paracetamol and Azithromycin have also increased by nearly 20% in Covid-19 times, while the sales of cough syrups have nearly remained stagnant,” Mohit Bajaj, from Bajaj drug house, which supplies medicines all over the state, told TOI. Similar views were expressed by the president of Bhopal Chemists Association, Lalit Jain. “There are 2,912 medicine shops in the state capital and people have become aware and a major portion have gone for self-medication, primarily because clinics were not open initially and sales of medicines like Paracetamol, Azithromycin, vitamin C have increased by even 80-90% in some cases. But now, it is slowing down. This also reflects awareness among the people. Sales of generic medicines was higher than ethical medicines, as normally people do not purchase ethical medicines on their own,” Jain said. Another medicine supplier, who only deals with ethical medicine sales, requesting anonymity, said, “It is basically the fact that chemists have prescribed generic medicines on their own and people have gone for self-medication. The sale of ethical medicines have not seen much increase.” Similar views were expressed by another dealer: “We only supply ethical medicines, our sales have not increased significantly, majority of sales has increased in generic medicine category.” Sources said that the trend clearly signifies that a large number of people have either resorted to go for self-medication instead of moving to fever clinics—as it was also evident by the views of senior health officials, additional chief secretary health, Mohammed Suleman had told TOI, “People are not voluntarily coming for Covid-19 tests at fever clinics. Or it could also be the fact that out of fear and awareness, people rushed for self-medication in case of minor illnesses too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/self-medication-spurt-in-sale-of-paracetamol-antibiotics/articleshow/78542570.cms||Amarjeet Singh
October 8, 2020||Kochi||UAPA justified, says NIA; court not convinced yet||KOCHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday submitted in the special court here that the gold smuggling in diplomatic baggage was a "concerted and organised act with a common objective to thwart the security of the country" and denied the defense’s contention that offences under Sections 16, 17 and 18 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act will not hold. The agency also submitted in writing that the main conspirators -- third accused Faisal Fareed and tenth accused Rabins Hammed -- have been arrested in the UAE. Earlier in July, it had announced that they had been taken into custody. TOI had reported this on July 20. “There is prima facie evidence that the accused intentionally committed this act, which falls directly under Section 15 of the UAPA (definition of terrorist act). It is revealed during investigation that the accused had knowledge that their act would threaten the security, including the economic security, and affect the monetary stability of India. They have in fact discussed the prospect of smuggling in large quantities of gold during the time when the economic security of India is being affected. This clearly shows their intention and motive to destabilise the country,” the NIA said. The NIA submission, opposing the bail plea of seventh accused Muhammed Shafi, came a day after the court said it cannot wait for the agency to produce evidence for offences under the UAPA. On Tuesday also, the court asked the additional solicitor general (ASG) who appeared via videoconferencing if the agency still stuck to terrorism charges in the case. It will hear the ASG's detailed argument on Wednesday though he had sought more time to study the case diary. The agency might use the confession statement given by accused Sandeep Nair also in their argument on Wednesday. Sources said Sandeep was produced on Tuesday also before the Aluva magistrate who was assigned to collect his statement under 164 CrPC. The NIA is yet to find evidence for direct financing of terrorism as alleged in the MHA order directing it to take up the probe. It points out in its submission that as per Section 15 of the UAPA, any knowledge that an act is likely to threaten the security, monetary stability and economic security is enough to constitute the crime. It said two absconding accused exiting India for the UAE after detection of the crime indicated that there were players inimical to India supporting and harbouring them outside India. “None of these accused seeking bail are from financially weaker sections of the society, to earn livelihood through smuggling of gold, as claimed by them. They own palatial houses, luxury cars and businesses in India besides the UAE and other middle eastern countries, that are used as a cover to avoid paying Income Tax, claiming NRI status,” it said. The NIA also told the court that the UAE authorities have assured it of strict action against the accused as they have attempted to damage the relationship between India and the UAE. It said efforts were being made to obtain evidence from the UAE in the case and issue Blue Corner notices against six persons -- Faisal Fareed, Rabins Hammed, Siddiqul Akbar, Ahmed Kutty, Ratheesh and Mohammed Shameer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/uapa-justified-says-nia-court-not-convinced-yet/articleshow/78541409.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chennai||TOI’s virtual conclave on mental health begins today||CHENNAI: The spread of Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown has had a great impact not only on our lives but also our mental health. On the occasion of World Mental Health Day, which is observed on October 10, The Times of India has come up with a three-day virtual conclave that will delve into how the pandemic has affected the mental wellbeing of people from various walks of life. The Facebook Live sessions will begin on Thursday, October 8, at 10 am. The theme for this year is ‘mental health for all’, which is all the more relevant given the effect Covid-19 has had on lives. The conclave features a host of doctors, nurses, activists, and specialists from various fields speaking on how different sections of society are coping – or not – with the mental stress and strain of a constantly changing world under siege from a virus. The opening session has Dr K Balakrishnan, director, Institute of Heart and Lung transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support, psychiatrist Dr N Rangarajan and Radha V, a staff nurse at the Omandurar medical college in conversation on dealing with the pressure of being at the frontline of the pandemic. In the second session of the same day, crisis counsellor at the International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC) Shanmathi S and Dr R Thara of the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) talk about managing the domestic violence crisis, which has worsened in the days of lockdown. The third session of the day delves into the stress that professional athletes are undergoing with no certainty in the world of sports. Arjuna awardee Sathiyan Gnanasekaran and sports psychologist Keerthana Swaminathan anchor the session. Friday’s session begins behind the scenes of an industry in crisis – cinema – and the adverse effects it has had on the mental health of those within. Producer G Dhananjayan and Nelson Vinod Moses, founder of Suicide Prevention India Foundation, speak out. No friends, no outdoor sport, increased screen time has skewed the routine of children, making them irritable, anxious and at times aggressive. The second session of Friday will have psychiatrists Dr Lakshmi Vijaykumar and Dr M Suresh Kumar and psychologist Mini Rao speaking about how to get children through the pandemic. The third session focuses on seniors and the anxiety they face on account of being the most vulnerable to coronavirus. Caregiver Mahendra Ramalingam and psychiatrist Dr Sridhar Vaitheswaran talk about what is going on in the minds of elders.

October 8, 2020||Amaravati||Agricultural bills are pro-farmer: Nirmala Sitharaman||VIJAYAWADA: Union minister for finance Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said that the three farm Bills passed in Parliament were aimed at benefiting farmers and bringing great reforms in the agriculture sector. Speaking to media here after her brief interaction with farmers at Gannavaram as part of her visit to the state, the finance minister said that the three Bills were needed to complete reforms in the agriculture sector. “The reforms have been due for the past 30 years. The BJP had promised to bring those reforms and finally three Acts were made to benefit the farmers,” she said. She further added that the restrictions on farmers were withdrawn and farmers can now sell their produce at any place. The finance minister said private players would enter the market ensuring the minimum support price (MSP) and farmers would be free to sell their produce outside agriculture market yards, if they get a better price. She put to rest fears that this would weaken primary agriculture markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/agri-bills-are-pro-farmer-sitharaman/articleshow/78541422.cms||Gopi Dara
October 8, 2020||Bhopal||‘Even Kerala doesn’t celebrate Adi Shankaracharya as much as MP does’||BHOPAL: Those who have heard Sudha Raghuraman, a recipient of the Ustad Bismillah Khan Award, will vouch for her crystal clear musical notes that leave a lasting impression on the listener’s soul. But when she took to stage on Tuesday, to perform at Tribal Museum’s ongoing Gamak Festival, her voice had a divine quality that reflected her innermost serenity. She was accompanied by her husband G Raghuraman on flute and MV Chandrashekar on mridangam. Starting the evening with ‘Kruti’ in raga Hamsadhvani, Sudha deftly managed her recitals in such a way that all kinds of audience felt connected to her, from start to finish. Whether it was Ganesh stuti’s raga and bhava, Adi Shankaracharya’s ‘Bhaj Govindam’ or peppy ‘Swagatam Krishna’ in Sanskrit, Tulsidas’s Thumak Chalat Ramchandra or some of the most traditional Carnatic raga-based compositions, the audience interest never wavered for a minute. After reaching a music high, she ended the evening with Vaishnav Jan, leaving behind a trail of sublime moments that audience cherished in spiritual silence. Later, Sudha said, “Madhya Pradesh is my second home because I have been coming here to perform at least twice a year, for the past 14 years. It is nice to see so much work being done by directorate of culture, Tribal Museum and Ustad Allauddin Khan Academy is truly praiseworthy. I’m really impressed by the fact that so many concerts in MP are dedicated to Adi Shankaracharya. Even Kerala doesn’t celebrate Adi Shankaracharya as much as MP does. I am only being fair when I say this.” Madhu Sikka, an IT professional who attended the concert, said, “Initially, I had my doubts whether I would be able to understand the complicated nuances of Carnatic music, but Sudha’s finesse, clarity and purity of rendition, reached out to me, cutting all barriers. Language, time, place just didn’t matter after that. Only music prevailed all over and engulfed me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/even-kerala-doesnt-celebrate-adi-shankaracharya-as-much-as-mp-does/articleshow/78542618.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
October 8, 2020||Kochi||Thrissur: Double life term for convicts||THRISSUR: The additional district judge of Thrissur P N Vinod on Wednesday sentenced two accused in the murder of a taxi driver in 2011 to double life imprisonment. The sentenced persons are Biju alias Sebastian Joseph alias Sathan Biju, son of Nirmalan from Kakkathottam Colony at Pulluvila in Thiruvananthapuram, and Noufal, son of Cherikkathodi Abdul Kareem from Makkaraparambu in Malappuram district. The convicts are sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh each under Section 302 of IPC, the judgment said. If they fail to pay the fine they will have to undergo a further one year imprisonment. The verdict also makes it clear that they will have to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh each under Section 120 B read with Section 109 of the IPC. The judge has also sentenced them to 17 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3 lakh under other sections of IPC, according to public prosecutor P Sunil.

October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||One in nine exposed to Covid-19 in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: One person out of nine tested during the second sero -survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Punjab showed evidence of past exposure to Covid-19. In a sero-survey, blood samples of people are collected to ascertain spread of virus in selected population. The second ICMR survey was conducted in four districts — Gurdaspur, Patiala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana — for which samples were collected in the middle of September from a randomly selected population of 1,598, of which 180 were found exposed to Covid-19 and had developed antibodies. Highest positivity rate of 18.79% was found in Ludhiana where 75 people were found infected out of 400 tested for the virus and 9.75% were found to have been exposed to the virus in Jalandhar. In Patiala and Gurdaspur, 8.27% and 8.25% of people, respectively, had contracted the virus and recovered. The percentage of people found exposed to the virus in the second ICMR survey is lower than the findings of the survey conducted by the Punjab government for which samples were collected in the middle of August. In the Punjab survey, 27.7% of the population residing in the containment zones was found to be exposed to Covid-19 and had developed antibodies. The percentage of infected people is, however, higher than the first sero-survey conducted by ICMR in four districts — Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Pathankot — in the middle of May and collected 1,600 samples. Of total samples collected, only 1% were found to be positive. Even as there has been a drop in the number of fresh cases, the new sero-survey suggests that a sizable population is still vulnerable to getting infected and there is a need to continue with the containment measures being taken by the government. After struggling for many months, the Covid-19 situation took a positive turn in the middle of September and since then there has been a drop in the number of cases and at the same time there has been a rise in the number of people getting better. The trend has brought down the number of active cases and has pushed the recovery rate up. As on October 6, the percentage of active cases has come down to 9.98%, which at one point had touched 32.73% while the recovery rate has shot up to 86.95%. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, Punjab health department spokesperson for Covid-19, said efforts being put in for identification, isolation and treatment of infected people will continue with the same intensity as we cannot afford to let our guards down at this moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/one-in-nine-exposed-to-covid-19-in-punjab/articleshow/78543892.cms||Vinod Kumar

October 8, 2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh agrees for CBI probe in rape, muder of minor||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh government on Tuesday gave its consent to the CBI for transferring investigations into the incident of rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl at Manuabhan Tekri, Koh-e –Fiza, Bhopal on April 30, 2019. From DNAs to contradictions in statements, this investigation of brutal rape and murder case was in controversy since beginning. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan issued orders to shift this case to CBI saying that criminals will be punished severely in cases of crime against girls. Crime no. 276/19 was registered by the city police under Section 363, 366, 376 IPC and 5 (R) 6 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 in this case. Deceased’s father was not satisfied with the investigations and he had been demanding a CBI inquiry. During Kamal Nath’s regime, Shivraj Singh Chouhan had staged a protest at Roshanpura, demanding justice for the 12-year-old girl. She was raped and bludgeoned to death with a stone in a cave on Manua Bhan Ki Tekri. Her body was found by police. Investigators claimed that the victim's aunt and her boyfriend quarreled on the Tekri hillock, after which she walked away in a huff, leaving the 12-year-old with him. The suspect, as police claimed, was raping her when a pointed stone "fell on her head, and she became unconscious". Scared, he picked up the same stone and battered her head with it, police had said, adding, the suspect confessed to the crime. Schoolboy was arrested and charged with rape, murder and destruction of evidence.

October 8, 2020||Trichy||Parents seek cut in school fee in absence of classroom sessions||Trichy: S Chandrasekar from Woriayur had paid a portion of the school fee of his daughter, studying in class V in a private CBSE school, in April. The school has now started demanding the second instalment of the fees. The school had collected pre-dated cheques from parents ahead of this academic year and now has been asking parents to replace the time-expired cheques. Phone calls from the school have become frequent over the past week which has enraged Chandrasekar. He says that he had to take a 30% salary cut due to the pandemic. But despite the pandemic situation causing financial hardships for many, the school management has not reduced the fees despite reduced operational cost due to closure of schools. This has been the case with many private schools where the schools have started asking second instalment of fee for this academic year. Raising questions on the effectiveness of online classes, M Rajesh, parent of two primary school children in K K Nagar said his children are not getting the required attention. “Teachers are only bothered about completing the portions without checking if the students are focusing on the classes. When the teaching is not proper, schools should bring down their fee as suggested by the high court,” he said. The court had in July this year asked schools to collect 75 percent of the fee collected last year, out of which 35 percent should be collected only after reopening of schools. Schools have not reduced the fee as a case on the same is pending in the court, said Padma Srinivasan, president of Rockcity Sahodaya School complex, an academic forum of CBSE schools in Trichy. “But schools have been very liberal in collecting the fee. It would not be possible to reduce the fee as they also must pay the teachers taking online classes,” she added. On parents raising question on the effectiveness of online classes, she said that only the pandemic has to be blamed as teachers have been trying their best to impart knowledge, considering the limited time given for online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-seek-cut-in-school-fee-in-absence-of-classroom-sessions/articleshow/78544291.cms||Sampath Kumar
October 8, 2020||Chennai||Slap criminal cases on illegal water units: Madras HC||CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered the Tamil Nadu government to start slapping criminal cases against those resorting to illegal water extraction, and said immediate steps should be taken to end all kinds of illegal water exploitation in the state. The bench also said pandemic-time relaxation granted to such units to function even without licences would stand withdrawn. As a consequence, no packaged drinking water unit will be permitted to operate without all necessary licences in the state. A division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice M S Ramesh also gave four weeks’ time for the state government to take a policy decision on charging per-litre basis rate for extraction of groundwater for commercial purposes. Pointing out the submission made by the authorities that 357 packaged drinking water units have not complied with the conditions and that they have been misusing the relaxation provided by the court in view of the pandemic, the bench wondered what stopped the state to act against such units and close them. “The state cannot act only in the lines drawn by the courts. Don’t wait for court orders. A state is a state and it has enormous executive powers,” the bench said. Pandemic is the word that scares everyone. But it should not scare the state as it is the state that should protect the people, the court added. The issue pertains to a batch of PILs seeking to stop illegal tapping of groundwater for commercial purposes. When the pleas came up for hearing on Wednesday, special government pleader Pothiraj submitted that of the identified 1,086 illegal drinking water packaging units operating in the state 396 have been closed and others have been regularised. “In safe and semi critical areas 690 units have been issued no objection certificates and have been permitted to operate. About 510 units have been fitted with flow meters,” he said. However, only 143 such units have complied with the condition imposed by the court to supply 15% of their total production to the state for free distribution to the public during the pandemic, he added. He further informed the court that the 15% supply is not required now as the state has enough water reserve. Recording the submissions, the bench posted the pleas to November 19 for the state to file compliance and status report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/slap-criminal-cases-on-illegal-water-units-hc/articleshow/78542636.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Vijayawada||HC to hear interlocutory applications on Monday||VIJAYAWADA: Implead petitions were moved from Rayalaseema and the state’s north coastal region on the second day of daily hearing on the batch of petitions moved opposing the trifurcation of capital. The court, which heard the arguments on the interlocutory applications seeking to implead them in the petitions and take their version into consideration, said it will give orders on the interlocutory applications. On the other hand, capital region farmers moved an interlocutory application to include the Directorate of Economics and Statistics as a party in the petitions to assess the present financial situation of the state, expenditure incurred so far on capital development and future financial implications that may arise with the trifurcation of the capital. The HC allowed the application and issued notices to the DES. The advocates on behalf of the petitioners from Rayalaseema region argued that injustice has been meted out to them since decades and the four districts of Rayalaseema continue to remain backward till today. Senior counsel Nagi Reddy told the bench comprising Chief Justice J K Maheswari, Justice Rakesh Kumar and Justice M Satynarayana Murthy that Kurnool was the capital when Andhra Pradesh was carved out of Tamil Nadu. However, the capital was later shifted to Hyderabad after AP was reorganised with the inclusion of Telangana region on linguistic basis. After the state’s bifurcation in 2014, though the Sivaramakrishnan committee suggested for decentralised development, the previous government ignored that report and proposed a centralised capital at Amaravati. Establishment of the high court in Kurnool has been a long pending demand and it has to be honoured, he said. After hearing the arguments, the court asked the advocate general and lawyers from the petitioners’ side to segregate the writ petitions subject wise to take up for hearing. Hearing on the interlocutory applications on CM’s camp office, council proceedings and other matters that were posted for Friday will also be taken up on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-to-hear-interlocutory-applications-on-monday/articleshow/78541434.cms||Srikanth Aluri

October 8, 2020||Jaipur||1 crore masks to be distributed, says health minister||AJMER: Health minister Raghu Sharma on Wednesday said though Rajasthan has a good recovery rate of Covid compared to 10 big states of the country, reports of side effects after infection is worrisome. He said the state government was taking necessary steps to control the infection and would distribute 1 crore masks in the state.

He said chief minister Ashok Gehlot called a video conference with opposition leaders, NGOs and doctors and decided that lockdown was not the solution to control the infection. He added that as the GDP of the country dived negative this time, people have to work to revive it. Experts suggested if people regularly and religiously use masks, the infection would be under control.

He said Rajasthan was doing better and the recovery rate was around 85 to 86 per cent and the mortality rate was also under 1 per cent.

The secretary of Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE), in response to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), submitted that the colleges were found collecting about 10% to 15% more than the prescribed fee for students and offering unauthorised courses. Vijay Gopal, president, Forum Against Corruption, who filed a complaint against two colleges in December 2018, said that he had received a response from the NCPCR on October 5 saying that both the colleges have been fined. “Although the complaint was filed for charging an excess fee and offering unauthorised classes, fine was levied only for charging an excess fee. Further, there was no direction from the board asking colleges to return the excess fee to all the students,” Vijay told TOI, questioning why the powers of officials at the district level are limited to conducting an enquiry and submitting a report. As per the complaint filed, while one college located at RTC X Roads was found charging an excess fee, another corporate college located in Saidabad was found violating two norms — charging an excess fee and offering courses such as coaching for NEET, EAMCET and AIIMS.  In the inquiry, TSBIE officials found both the colleges guilty. Syed Omer Jaleel, secretary, TSBIE, said that his office has been following up on the issue and added that they even issued notices to these erring colleges on September 25. “We have asked colleges to repay the excess fee collected and submit an acknowledgement within seven days. As the colleges failed to respond, we will be intimating the police as not responding to a government official’s notice is against law,” said Jaleel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-inter-colleges-fined-rs-1l-each-over-excess-fee/articleshow/78542702.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||Punjab sets ball rolling for reopening of schools||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Wednesday set the ball rolling for reopening of schools, which are shut across the state since March 13 in the wake of outbreak of pandemic. Punjab education secretary Krishan Kumar on Wednesday shared the views of the education department with the department of home affairs regarding reopening of schools as per the guidelines issued by the central government. However, a final decision in this regard is yet to be taken. Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla maintained that the final decision regarding reopening of schools will be taken by the chief minister, Captain Amarinder Singh after reviewing all precautions regarding safety of students. In its October 5 guidelines for reopening of schools from October 15, the central government made the consent of parents mandatory for students to attend the schools. The government has also given choice to the students to opt for online classes instead of attending the school physically. In a communication to the additional chief secretary (home) on Wednesday, Kumar stated that to begin with, only the students from Class IX to XII may be allowed by opening the schools for three hours a day. In the schools, where the number of students is more, teachers may be called in two shifts of three hours each, he said. However, all the safety measures will be followed, including the minimum distance between students and teachers, as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the state health department. As per the plan, on an average, there will not be more than 20 students in a section to attend the class. To ensure that proper distance is maintained, only two students will be allowed to sit on a bench, while other protocols like using sanitisers and wearing masks will be followed strictly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-sets-ball-rolling-for-reopening-of-schools/articleshow/78543943.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Trichy||RTE seats: Parents seek easing of distance norm||Trichy: While school education department has extended RTE admission to fill the vacant seats, parents have sought relaxation of admission norms to become eligible for admission. A total of 3,216 applications were received against 4183 RTE seats across 312 schools in Trichy district. Since the distance norm is followed strictly many parents got their application rejected citing their residence is more than one km far from the school. As most districts received less number of applications, the school education department extended RTE admissions. Education department officials in Trichy say that extension of admission will be meaningless if distance norm is not relaxed. However, there doesn’t seem to be any relaxation announced as the government order on the extension of admission was only released on Tuesday. Distance from the school plays a decisive role in getting a seat irrespective of the student belonging to economically weaker section or not. Residing a few 100 metres away from the school doesn’t mean that they are not deserving, said M Vasantha Kumar, 36 from Kumbakonam whose application was rejected as google map shows his house 1.4 km far. He said up to 3 km distance was allowed in 2017 and it was brought down in the subsequent years. He urged the government to allow candidates who reside within 3 km radius from the school. S Harishchandran from Manachanallur said extension of RTE admission means nothing for many parents, as seats in their desired schools already got over and they will have to choose the school which was never in their priority list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rte-seats-parents-seek-easing-of-distance-norm/articleshow/78544299.cms||Sampath Kumar
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: After coronavirus, MIS hits kids between 0-10 years||HYDERABAD: A sharp jump in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C, a post Covid-19 manifestation) is being reported in the city with over 43 cases recorded at Gandhi and Niloufer hospitals in the last two and a half months and over 100 cases at private hospitals. While MIS is relatively common among adults suffering from Covid-19, it is now being seen in increased numbers among children between 0 and 10 years. So far, 16 children —four at government and 12 at private hospitals — have succumbed to the complications. “Cases are usually presenting with fever, rashes, swelling of face, stomach ache or chest pain. In a recent case when we did RT-PCR test it was negative, but IGG ( antibody test) was positive. The antibody test is usually positive from three weeks to three months of getting infected. In such cases, the child might be asymptomatic when infected,” explained Dr Narahari Bapanpally, associate professor paediatrics, Niloufer Hospital. The phenomenon after Covid-19 (often asymptomatic and undiagnosed) infection could, meanwhile, be a silent killer as the multi-organ dysfunction, especially myocarditis caused by it, can be life threatening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-coronavirus-mis-hits-kids-between-0-10-yrs/articleshow/78542734.cms||Amrita Didyala

Doctors are now prescribing doxycycline, an antibiotic which is quite effective in scrub typhus treatment, in Covid treatment, doctors have claimed. Health department officials in Alwar are well aware about doxycycline as a life-saver. It is the medicine which had bailed them out after scrub typhus, a mysterious fever, had struck the district in 2010. They are still following the same protocol even today. “We are providing doxycycline tablets to patients with fever without waiting for the diagnostic report. It is quite effective as it is a broad spectrum antibiotic. Now, in Covid treatment, the doctors are prescribing doxycycline in combination with ivermetin, which is showing good results,” said Dr Chhabil Kumar, deputy chief medical health officer (Alwar). In Jaipur too, some private and government doctors are prescribing doxycycline in combination with ivermectin, which is a medicine used for treatment of different types of parasite infestation, for Covid treatment. “A number of doctors are prescribing doxycycline in combination with Ivermectin for Covid treatment. Since no Covid-19 drug is available, doctors are repurposing the already available medicine,” said Dr Pradeep Sharma, a government doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/scrub-typhus-drug-being-used-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/78542713.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The figures, released on Wednesday, compared three parameters – recovery rate, proportion of active infections and death rate. The data included in the comparison was updated till October 6. While UP’s recovery rate has crossed 88%, that of the country hovers around 85%. Similarly, there are about 10% active cases in UP as compared to 13.4% cases nationwide. In terms of death rate, UP and India are at par with 1.5%. Health officials attribute UP’s better figures to aggressive testing.

The average number of tests conducted per day in UP over the past fortnight has been 1.5 lakh. Addressing Covid-19 review meeting, CM Yogi Adityanath asserted that prevention was extremely important to avert a second wave of pandemic. He asked officials to ensure that the system maintains an upper hand in the fight against coronavirus and said that contact-tracing should be intensified to check the spread of the virus.

These surveys are not part of the civic body’s sero-surveillance measures. Surveyors told officials that in several instances, heads of housing societies raised concerns over safety and were hesitant to cooperate with health workers. The PCMC’s additional commissioner, Santosh Patil, recently held a virtual meeting with citizens to answer queries. “Some residents raised concerns about individuals impersonating surveyors. Others said they worry the surveyors themselves could be infected. These are genuine concerns, but the survey has proven to be important for tackling Covid-19,” Patil said. The top official added that all surveyors are carrying identity cards, thermal guns and oximeters. “They are following social distancing norms and taking all precautions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/suspicion-impedes-screenings/articleshow/78542785.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: After forced intermission, malls and multiplexes see a glimmer of hope||NEW DELHI: After chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the reopening of cinemas from October 15 on social media, Sona Bahl’s phone started buzzing with ‘Family outings are back’ messages. Apart from reopening of cinemas meaning better business for Bahl’s Epicuria food mall at the Nehru Place metro station, she is excited for personal reasons too — at finally being able to plan a movie outing for family elders who haven’t stepped out of the house since March. She was happy that the reopening of cinemas would drive the footfall at her mall and the cinema complex nearby. Bahl depends on cinema halls in Nehru Place for up to 25% of the people coming to Epicuria. With Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) finally allowing the reopening of cinemas at half their seating capacity, she and other mall operators as well as owners of multiplex chains have heaved a sigh of relief. Alok Tandon, CEO, Inox Leisure Ltd, which has a complex near Epicuria, thanked the Union home ministry and said the guidelines on physical distancing, entry and exit management, staff health and food service norms were audience friendly and would ensure a safe cinema viewing experience. “Our guests will have to mandatorily wear masks and there will be temperature checks at the entrance. We will also keep PPE kits for sale in the complex,” disclosed Tandon, adding that there would be pedal-operated, touch-free hand sanitiser at important points in the cinema complex. Movie shows would be programmed in a manner to prevent simultaneous entries, intermissions and exits. Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, said his chain would reopen in a phased manner, with the primary focus being to build customer trust by following global best practices in health and sanitisation. Dutta added that these would help bring people’s “favourite entertainment’ back to life. While most cinema chains are looking at e-tickets, food orders through QR codes, regular disinfecting of the movie hall, lobby, lounges and food areas, some chains such as Inox are also considering business innovations such as private screenings during which families or smaller groups could book the entire auditorium and enjoy the content of their choice, whether it be movies or, if Inox had these in its library, educational and environmental documentaries screened for their school-going children and their friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-forced-intermission-malls-and-multiplexes-see-a-glimmer-of-hope/articleshow/78544301.cms||Amin Ali

The survey of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) — set to assess antibody levels in 5,000 participants — is being jointly conducted by the PCMC and the DY Patil Medical College and Hospital. Principal investigator Atul Desale said except for sporadic resistance from residents in two locations, day one of the survey was mostly incident-free. “Some were worried surveyors were there to take them to Covid facilities. We will tweak strategies if needed. Many have responded well,” he said. The PCMC’s additional commissioner, Santosh Patil, said he was confident the survey, which is covering areas where people had opposed lockdown measures, will continue without much trouble. “Fear of Covid-19 has reduced among residents of Balajinagar and Ajanthanagar slums, where the civic body had earlier faced stiff opposition to containment measures. We will take help of people’s representatives if citizens need further assistance,” Patil added. The PCMC’s sero survey is bigger than the one carried out by the PMC in July and August, which collected 1,664 samples from only five wards. The PCMC aims to study 5,000 residents from all of its eight zones. The PMC survey had found that seropositivity was the highest among residents of slums — at 66.4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/regions-largest-sero-study-of-5000-citizens-under-way/articleshow/78542763.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Percentage utilisation of beds in private hospitals shows that occupancy rate is 27%, 34% and 31% for general, oxygen, ICU categories respectively. “These figures clearly reflect less number of active cases,” an official said. Though the highest occupancy is found in the state-run Gandhi Hospital with 606 beds in occupation among all the 1,890 beds available and 1,284 beds being vacant. TIMS has now maximum load of patients after Gandhi Hopsital with 201 beds in occupation of 1,261 beds available and 1,060 being vacant. Meanwhile, health minister Eatala Rajender said government is keen to improve oxygen bed facility in districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/70-beds-vacant-in-gandhi-hospital/articleshow/78542810.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
October 8, 2020||Trichy||Server issue adds to woes of biometric system in PDS||Trichy: Server connectivity issue has hindered the implementation of one nation one ration card scheme in Trichy. As the biometric system takes more time to process, many cardholders are forced to return without getting any essentials. However, officials said that they are facing the issue across the state. Around 7.8 lakh cardholders in Trichy district under 1,224 ration shops are getting essential commodities. The biometric system which was installed to curb malpractices in the Public Distribution System (PDS), has turned out to be an ordeal for ration cardholders. Ration shop staff are unable to distribute the essentials to even 40% of their cardholders, said SR Kishorkumar, an advocate from Trichy. “We learnt that the configuration of the main server placed in Collector office is very low resulting in the lag. The district collector should look into the issue and should resolve it immediately”, he added.Meanwhile, a ration shop staff’s audio clip, lamenting about their ordeal faced by him and their colleagues due to the server problem on daily basis is doing rounds in social media. A senior official from the cooperative department told TOI “After the implementation of ‘one nation, one ration card’ system the number of users has increased manifold. That is the main reason for the snag. Particularly between 10 am and 1 pm the issue is at its peak. So, we have instructed the salespersons to distribute essentials skipping the fingerprint process. Works are on to resolve the issue within a few days”, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/server-issue-adds-to-woes-of-biometric-system-in-pds/articleshow/78544302.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

October 8, 2020||Vijayawada||Council ready to give records to Andhra Pradesh HC||VIJAYAWADA: The AP Legislative Council is ready to file an affidavit in the high court to give all records of the proceedings related to the passing of the Bills on three capital cities. As the AP high court had asked for the records, the legislative council officials are getting the records ready to be placed before the court. However, a decision is to be taken by the state government in due consultation with minister for legislative affairs Buggana Rajendranath. Sources in the assembly said that they have already submitted all the records concerning the bills to the court earlier. However, they are getting the records ready for submission once again. “The proceedings are now public documents. They are available in the legislature portal as well,” a senior official said. However, the state government is consulting the legal experts on the issue including the constitutional validity of the court asking for the records of the proceedings. Article 212 categorically says that “courts not to inquire into proceedings of the legislature.” Article 212 (1) says “the validity of any proceedings in the Legislature of a state shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of the procedure.” The court is currently looking into the validity of the proceedings and the validity could be decided only after going through the proceedings, for which the legislative council is ready. When asked for his comment, legislature secretary P Balakrishnamacharyulu told TOI on Wednesday that they are ready to submit the proceedings of the council to the court. “Everything in the legislature is public document. They are available in the legislature’s website and they were widely circulated in the media. There is nothing to hide. The council had strictly followed the rule book,” Balakrishnamacharyulu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/council-ready-to-give-records-to-hc/articleshow/78541493.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Corona curbs on idols’ commute from Kumartuli||KOLKATA: This year, bringing idols to pandals will be a “time-bound affair” because of the pandemic. There will be no procession and no night-long wait on the road to take idols to pandals from artisans’ studios. Rather, puja organizers will be allotted specific time slots and not more than three to six people per puja committee will be allowed entry in Kumartuli simultaneously. Besides, several organizers may be forced to bring the idols during the day once the process begins on October 17. In a meeting attended by Jorabagan traffic guard and Shyampukur police, the artisans were told to allot a specific time slot to each puja committee for collection of idols. “This is to ensure that there is no crowding in the area. We will set up one way and the restrictions will have to be followed in letter and spirit. This year, we have increased parking areas so that each truck can stand by maintaining social distancing. We will be coordinating with the artisans to ensure physical distancing. Those organizers not wearing masks will be asked to return,” said an officer from Jorabagan traffic guard. Ranjit Sarkar, joint secretary of Kumartuli Pottery Cultural Association, said, “Everyone must enter Kumartuli Patua para through the two sanitizing channels set up. We have already tested them and they would become operational from October 16. We have set up Whatsapp groups with organizers and assigned them timings,” said Sarkar, adding that these steps were necessary to ensure safety for both idol makers and organizers before the festival. Idol makers like Sarkar or Bhaskar Pal said they are not expecting too much trouble due to the restrictions. “The fun may be less. But we have to deliver around 3,000 idols this time, instead of 3,800-4,000 each year. Most idols are smaller and Ekchala this year due to budgetary constraints. I have really forgotten when we had made so many Ekchala idols last. This means that a much lesser number of labourers will be required to pick up the idols. The only glitch is that given the time slots, we might have to ask some organizers to come in the morning,” said an officer. Police said they would have wanted labourers, mostly from South 24 Parganas, to get tested for Covid. “But this might not be possible due to the time frame. But anyone not following the rules will be debarred from work,” said the officer. “It is usually an elaborate affair to bring Maa here and at least 60 of us are in attendance. This year, we are not even getting willing volunteers,” said the puja organizer of a housing in Behala. The Covid situation, said Sarkar, has also forced them to stop people from coming and taking photographs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/corona-curbs-on-idols-commute-from-kumartuli/articleshow/78542817.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Of this, Rs 50 crore came from Mauritius, ED sources said. ED officials are tracking some suspects and dissecting data pertaining to the blacklisted website "Justice for Hathras" to ascertain whether it was used as a gateway for foreign funding. Accounts to which money was transferred are also being scanned. The ED is planning to start a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the admins of the website. Without naming anyone, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had said on Monday that "a host of organisations" were using foreign funding to hatch conspiracies to derail his government's development agenda "by stoking caste conflicts". Earlier this year, Rs 120 crore credited to bank accounts allegedly linked to PFI had come under the scanner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rs-100cr-sent-to-up-to-fund-hathras-unrest-says-ed/articleshow/78544596.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

October 8, 2020||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh to digitalise all Waqf properties||AMARAVATI: The state government has decided to digitalise all properties owned by Waqf board and also constitute a separate rents revenue committee to revise the rentals of the waqf properties leased out to private parties. The government has appointed district revenue officers (DROs) as custodians of waqf properties and directed them to convene regular meetings with the field officials to protect the assets. Senior IFS officer and minority affairs principal secretary Mohammed Ilyas Rizvi said that they have asked the district revenue officers to immediately launch a drive against encroachments. “DROs have been directed to conduct review meetings on the measures initiated to protect waqf lands once in three months. District minority welfare officers (DMWOs), waqf inspectors and tehsildars of respective districts should attend the meetings,” Rizvi told TOI. Rizvi said that several hundreds of acres of land owned by waqf board were encroached by private entities and they would initiate all measures like geofencing and records digitalisation to protect their lands. He also said rentals accrued by the board from leased properties were also very low and they would be revised shortly. “A separate committee will be constituted for fixation of rentals of properties that have been leased out to rationalise the revenues,” said Rizvi. He said that deputy chief minister Amzad Basha had directed the committee to inspect all the districts to review the rentals and revise them. He had also said the deputy CM appreciated the East Godavari district administration for freeing about 130 acres of land from the hands of encroachers. Digitalisation of land records would bring transparency to land titles and help commoners from falling prey to middlemen who might try to illegally sell waqf assets, said Rizvi. He said that they would also take measures to collect the old dues of rentals from the leaseholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/state-to-digitalise-all-waqf-properties/articleshow/78541264.cms||Samdani MN

This, even as the amount stipulated by the board is Rs 1,740 for the first year and Rs 1,940 for second year intermediate. According to parents, while corporate and big private colleges charge over Rs 1 lakh, others charge at least Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per year. “I don’t think any junior college adheres to what the board has prescribed,” said M Venkateshwarulu, a parent. College managements, meanwhile, say that as per the norms, the fee should be increased by 10% every year. Yet, it has not been enhanced since 2013. “We are requesting officials to enhance the fee. Also, the state should form a committee and fix the fee so that no management can charge exorbitant amounts,” said G Satish from the Telangana Private Junior Colleges Managements Association, adding that the minimum fee in rural areas should be between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 and urban areas about Rs 25,000 per year. While an inter board official said there is merit in the argument of managements, that fee prescribed is not sufficient to provide quality education, he admitted to several colleges looting parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jr-colleges-dont-adhere-to-what-board-prescribes-say-parents/articleshow/78542819.cms||---

The area in the ‘E’ zone of PCMC limits had 836 active cases on October 4. The Bhosari area has multiple industries and was the worst-affected after the first unlock guidelines were issued. The number of active cases remained steady at over 1,000 and were the highest among all eight zones in the civic limits.

October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Air traffic perks up, retailers eye space at RGIA||HYDERABAD: Four months after it resumed operations, the growth of Hyderabad’s RGIA has hit the fast lane. Apart from domestic passenger footfalls scaling up to 50% of its pre-Covid numbers — it has touched 20,000 to 25,000 per day — and daily air traffic movements increasing from 40 in May to around 200 now, the commercial footprint of the facility too has expanded significantly.  At least five new outlets — two retail and three food joints — have opened up within the RGIA over past few months including popular brands. Not surprisingly, aviation experts say that the Hyderabad airport is among the fastest growing facilities in India, only behind Delhi. Currently, the city airport has 80 retail stores and 53 food and beverage counters. “Among the most sought after items are electronics, cosmetics, perfumes and skincare, apparels, packaged food, footwear etc,” said a spokesperson of the GMR-run airport that’s equipped all stores with UV Ovens to sanitise products that are bought. Admitting that business is slowly but steadily picking up, Sunil Mantri, CEO of WHSmith— a leading travel retail brand — said that added focus on making every touch point contact-less and worked in Hyderabad’s favour, post Covid. In fact, existing outlets say the upcoming festive season will see a further jump in business. “Passengers who visited our store in Hyderabad have assured to come back to purchase more in the festive season...the safety protocols put in place have been appreciated,” said Devender Kumar, partner, Krishna Pearls And Jewellers. This was reiterated by Rajesh Rammani, partner of Karachi Bakery that was among the first retail brands to open at RGIA, post lockdown. “We are looking forward to festive seasons, when we expect even better footfall,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/air-traffic-perks-up-retailers-eye-space-at-rgia/articleshow/78542823.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
October 8, 2020||Visakhapatnam||Hospitals tying up with hotels in Visakhapatnam for patient catering||VISAKHAPATNAM: A new trend has emerged in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic with private hospitals in the beach city now tying up with hotels to prepare meals for patients. Hospital managements said they were eyeing to rope in housekeeping services and contacting hotel management institutes to recruit front and back office executives. “While the city has good medical facilities and is all set to come up with a full-fledged health city, it city still lacks skilled manpower in the hospital sector. The time has come to hire from or collaborate with experts from each and every sector,” Omni Hospitals CEO, Dr Sukumar Chitturi told TOI. Hospital and hotel executives said the idea of collaborating with restaurants of reputed hotels was first conceived during the lockdown. Up until then, hospitals were running their own kitchen units through outsourced catering services or procuring meals directly from caterers. However following the announcement of the lockdown, several catering services failed to provide services to hospitals. As a result, managements started procuring meals from hotels whose kitchens were catering to quarantined travellers coming to Andhra Pradesh from high-risk states and abroad. “Covid-19 was a learning experience as we started preparing meals for quarantined travellers and patients. We started researching and preparing foods that would boost immunity and was ideal for patients. It opened up a new avenue for us and some of the hospitals we were catering to gave us a contract to supply meals for the next one year,” Daspalla Executive Court general manager, Sanjib Karmakar, told TOI. Executives on both sides claimed that there were several advantages to this system. Hotels, whose business had been hit hard due to pandemic, have started offering services at competitive rates. With many patients coming from Odisha and Chhattisgarh, many hospitals and medicine shops have placed displays in the states’ native languages. Even hospitals have started placing orders as per their patients’ palettes. “Earlier, we were supplying only local cuisine and many patients from other states were not satisfied. However, now we have started ordering two types of meals — south Indian and north Indian. With time, we will elaborate the menu,” said Dr Chitturi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/hospitals-tying-up-with-city-hotels-for-patient-catering/articleshow/78541204.cms||Arpit Basu

The students will get their gift kits at their respective schools soon after the CM launches the scheme. The uniqueness of the scheme is that the kit comprises three pairs of uniform, one pair of shoes, two pairs of socks, prescribed text books, notebooks, belt and a school bag to get the student fully prepared for the new academic year. Jagananna Vidya Kanuka puts an end to the earlier practice of erratic and non-supply of books, uniform and other essentials to students. The CM will formally launch the scheme at Punadipadu government school in Krishna district which, the government hopes, will boost enrolment rate in government schools. Over 42 lakh kits would be distributed across the state which will cost the government around Rs 650 crore. “The kits will come as a big relief for parents, as it will save them from spending money on buying books and other items required to send their wards to schools. It will also motivate lakhs of other parents to send their children to the schools,” said S Ramakrishna, state president of Municipal Teachers Federation. Education minister Adimulapu Suresh said the scheme will not only increase the number of admissions in government schools but will also bring down the dropout rate. “The scheme is a result of the CM’s personal monitoring and instructions from time to time,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cm-to-distribute-vidya-kanuka-kits-to-students/articleshow/78541181.cms||Samdani MN
October 8, 2020||Pune||Shoppers flouting safety norms concern retailers in Pune||PUNE: Shopkeepers in the city are concerned about customers not wearing masks properly and the general slackness that has crept in after the recent unlock order. “Since the beginning, we made it a rule that customers without masks will not be allowed inside the shop. Now, since the authorities have imposed fines on people for not wearing masks, people are wearing them, but are pulling them down below their nose or under their chin. We tell customers to wear masks properly before entering the store, but some of them get irritated,” said Monaji Hacharam, a grocery store owner in Kondhwa. Tukaram Choudhary, another grocery storeowner in Wanowrie, said, “We have to interact with so many people daily and it is important for us to ensure that they follow safety protocols. Many customers do not follow social distancing norms.” Ajay Dhopate, a gift shopowner in Salunke Vihar, is concerned about people gathering for smoke and then entering his shop. “When they are talking, their masks are pulled down and often they enter my shop in that manner and I have to tell them politely to pull the masks up.” Pulmonologist Sujoy Ghosh said, “Mask can work as a protective gear against coronavirus only if it properly covers your nose and mouth. Make sure it fits as snugly as possible on your face. If you pull it under your nose or chin, the purpose is completely defeated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shoppers-flouting-safety-norms-concern-retailers/articleshow/78542826.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Vijayawada||Tirupati: Cow dies after biting into explosives||TIRUPATI: A cow died after its jaw was blown to pieces when it accidentally bit a crude bomb, placed by some unknown poachers to kill wild boars, while grazing in an open field near Chandamama Palli in Tirupati rural limits. The incident occurred on Tuesday but came to light on Wednesday after P Rambabu, who owned the cow, lodged a complaint at the MR Palli police station. The owner of the cow sought help of some local veterinary doctors to check the injured bovine. Though they administered first aid to it and tied a bandage to the jaw, the bovine had succumbed to injuries three hours after the incident. “The owner of the bovine heard a deafening noise and when he rushed to the spot, he saw the cow with its jaw blown. As per our preliminary investigation, we suspect that it was a crude bomb, which was fixed for wild boars. We are waiting for reports and only than can we pin-point on what kind of explosive it was,” MR Palli SI Prakash Kumar told TOI. The MR Palli police registered a case under section 286 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and also an explosive act has been registered. A team was also formed to nab those who planted the bomb. “This cruel method is used by local poachers to kill wild boars and other wild animals. This is definitely illegal and we will act tough on them. We will catch the culprits soon”, the SI added.  In June, a 15-year-old cow had died in a similar manner at Kogileru in Peddapanjani mandal three days after it bit a crude bomb. It is said that around six animals have been injured and few dead by falling prey to such activities in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cow-dies-after-biting-into-explosives/articleshow/78541129.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

After police summoned Anushree on September 24 for the enquiry, CCB Inspector Shivaprakash Nayak was reportedly transferred under pressure from a ‘former CM’ but it was withheld following reports in a section of the media. Some activists in Belagavi, who are privy to these developments, alleged CCB sub-inspector Kabbal Raj is the latest target of politicians. Mangaluru-based RTI activist Sunil Bajilakere also alleged that two BJP MLAs and a state BJP functionary have exerted pressure on the state government to transfer Kabbal Raj. Y Bharath Shetty, Mangaluru North MLA rubbished these allegations. Mangaluru police commissioner Vikash Kumar said none of the police officers have come under any sort of pressure from politicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-mlas-face-allegations-of-interference-in-drug-probe/articleshow/78540429.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Pune||Housing societies in Pune urge residents not to host get-togethers||PUNE: Housing societies have taken it upon themselves to urge residents not to arrange get-togethers and stay home to protect themselves from the coronavirus as a part of the state’s “Maze Kutumb, Mazi Jababdari” (my family, my responsibility) campaign. The move comes after an appeal by Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. “All families living in the society receive broadcast messages to avoid get-togethers at home for some more time. We’ve spent seven months like this and we can hope that the worst is over. We must monitor ourselves for just a few more weeks until things get better, otherwise we will be back to square one. We do not have any Covid-19 cases in the society right now, but until the numbers drop across the city, it is our responsibility to help stop the spread of the virus,” said Wanowrie resident Rahul Agarwal. A member of a housing society’s management committee in NIBM road area said, “We do our bit by telling residents not to allow outsiders into their homes just yet for their own safety as well as that of other families living in the building. However, we cannot keep an eye on everyone 24X7 or even prohibit guests from entering the society. While most residents understand the need to follow social distancing norms, others feel like things are already back to normal and they can go to their friends’ or relatives’ homes. To set an example, we are holding our society meetings over an online platform.” Another management committee member of a housing society in Salunkhe Vihar said, “There are many cancer survivors, seniors, and those with heart problems and diabetes living in our society. Even though Unlock 5 has started, we need to be extra careful for their sake. From the beginning of the lockdown, we have been conducting society meetings online. We also arranged the Ganapati aarti online during Ganeshotsav.” Rupali Naik, a home owner residing at NIBM road, said, “We have had two online society meetings so far, and I feel that it is more efficient than pre-pandemic meetings we used to have in the clubhouse. There is no deviating from the topic at hand and all issues are covered quickly. Society management committees have become more serious about the role they play. They have taken up more responsibilities during the lockdown to make sure that residents are safe and comfortable.” Pramit Patil, who lives on rent in Salunkhe Vihar, said, “Living with my elderly parents and two children, we have to acknowledge that the pandemic is still on and we have to be as careful as we can. There is the option of virtual get-togethers that has not only become popular but it’s also the need of the hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hsg-societies-urge-residents-not-to-host-get-togethers/articleshow/78542852.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: More women rely on tech, take to safety apps||VIJAYAWADA: A look at the use of women safety mobile applications and digital services launched by the state, such as Disha app, Cyber Mithra and more recently, the Police Seva app that enables women to seek police help during distress shows the positive response the initiatives have generated. For example, the Disha SOS application launched earlier this year has seen over 758 distress calls, which have translated into 512 FIRs. The Cyber Mithra services was started to address cybercrimes against women and children. Two toll-free helplines—112 and 181—along with a dedicated WhatsApp number (9121211100) and a Facebook page allows victims to lodge complaints online. Between July 2019 and September, Cyber Mithra services catered to 1,850 petitions. Altogether, 309 FIRs were lodged. Police also pointed out that 1.1 million women have downloaded the Disha SOS Application in a short span of time. “We received complaints from 568 people and registered 117 FIRs and acted on them,” a senior police official told TOI. The app has a single touch SOS button that alerts the police control room in case of distress and ensures speedy response. Notably, the state government will also set up an exclusive Disha control room to handle calls from women in distress. The control room will be able to track the nearest emergency response vehicle and automatically dispatch it to the location of the victim. However, practical issues with the applications remain. Police admit that they are at the receiving end of prank calls and false alerts on a day-to-day basis, which often results in very few alerts translating into FIRs. While there has been a spike in women harassment cases due to the accessibility of the application, police clarified that it cannot be mistaken for an increase in the crime rate.

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Police take guard against BJP’s march to Nabanna today||Kolkata: Nabanna will remain closed for routine sanitization during the pandemic on a day BJP Yuva Morcha plans a march to the secretariat on Thursday. The government, in a letter to Yuva Morcha general secretary Prakash Das on Thursday, cited a Supreme Court judgment a few hours go, in which the SC mentioned “certain principles regarding protest and occupation of sites and public spaces and public ways”. The government letter also referred to the National Disaster Management Act that did not allow rallies to have over 100 people. The BJP Yuva Morcha wrote to the government that “around 25,000 youths would participate”. The state held that such gathering was “not permissible in a pandemic”. The Kolkata Police has denied permission to the two rallies originating from Kolkata — one from Hastings and the other from the BJP state headquarters. The second Hooghly bridge will remain out of bounds to traffic. Joint commissioners of police, along with deputy commissioners, will man the Nabanna entry points. But BJP leaders stuck to their Nabanna Aviyan. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh “saw a sense of fear” in the government move over the BJP march. “The government decided to shut Nabanna as Trinamool is scared of the march. They are keeping the Nabanna closed on Thursday because they know it will be shut permanently after six months,” Ghosh said. Participants started coming to the city from Wednesday, said Yuva Morcha president Soumitra Khan. “Did the chief minister pay heed to the National Disaster Management when she took out a rally the other day? We dare the police to stop us.” The state administration isn’t taking the rally lightly. Over 2,000 cops have been readied to patrol central and parts of south Kolkata. Police have planned to barricade spots in Burrabazar, Hastings, Esplanade and Kidderpore. “We are ascertaining the likely routes,” said an officer after BJP MP Arjun Singh announced the party would adopt “guerilla tactic” to reach Nabanna. All police stations in Kolkata and Howrah have been put on high alert. Police have planned three-layer barricades, including normal barricades, followed by a chain of cops, comprising men from the local divisions, battalions, RAF and combat forces. Women cops have been kept on reserve. Water cannon and tear gas experts will take position behind the third barricade. Another contingent has been kept ready for the unrest spreading to adjoining areas. The Howrah Police has requisitioned forces from Barrackpore, Asansol, Bidhannagar and Chandernagore commissionarates. The rally from Howrah Maidan will be stopped near Bangabasi College crossing. The Santraganchi bus terminus congregation will be stopped near the rail underpass. Heavy security has been planned in and around Nabanna at Mandirtala, Kazipara and Foreshore Road. Police have sealed the bylanes from Sibpur and Tikiapara to Nabanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-take-guard-against-bjps-march-to-nabanna-today/articleshow/78542875.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

October 8, 2020||Bengaluru||Inter-faith affair: Man offers to discuss marriage with daughter’s lover, kills him||Bengaluru: An inter-faith love story ended on a tragic note with the girl’s father and his associates allegedly murdering her 24-year-old boyfriend in Kudur, Magadi taluk, Ramanagara district on Tuesday morning. K Lakshmipathi, a resident of Basavanahalli near Nelamangala, was allegedly strangled to death by Nizamuddin, 45, and his elder son Sikandar, 20, (goods auto drivers) who have been arrested, and their associates, Ibrat and Auto Mohammed, who are on the run. All the accused are residents of Islampura near Basavanahalli. Lakshmipathi, a garment factory employee and part-time auto driver, was killed in front of his brother. Investigation revealed Lakshmipathi was in love with Nizamuddin’s younger daughter and both the families were against the relationship. “The two eloped last month to tie the knot but returned after Nizamuddin convinced his daughter saying he would get them married. On Tuesday morning, Nizamuddin and three others took Lakshmipathi and his elder brother Nataraj to a deserted spot in Kanakenahallilaya, a village near Kudur in Magadi taluk, on the pretext of marriage talks where the accused strangled Lakshmipathi to death,” said superintendent of police, Ramanagara S Girish. K Nataraj, elder brother of Lakshmipathi, claimed in his complaint that the accused mercilessly strangled his brother as he watched helplessly. “Around 10am on Tuesday, Nizamuddin took my brother Lakshmipathi to his house, saying they will decide the wedding date and other issues. I accompanied them. Sikandar and the others said we should go out and hold the discussion. Lakshmipathi spoke to the girl, telling her they were going to discuss the matter,” Nataraj said. “We travelled in Nizamuddin’s auto and reached Kanakenahallilaya. He took us to a prayer hall and then to the foot of a rocky mountain. He made us drink alcohol. A little later, they started abusing Lakshmipathi, citing religious differences and told him he shouldn’t even dream of marrying the girl. When he resisted, the four of them started beating him up. They pulled out his belt and as I watched, Sikandar and Ibrat strangled my brother to death. They threatened to kill me too. I ran away and hid in a field. Nizamuddin came looking for me...They grabbed me and bundled me into the auto. They pushed me out near Kunigal Cross and told me not to reveal anything or else they would kill my other family members,” Nataraj, a daily-wage worker, said in the complaint. By evening, Nataraj returned home and narrated the incident to his father Kumar and brother-in-law Gangadhar. “They came to Nelamangala Rural police station and explained what had happened. We were shocked to hear their version and immediately passed on the message to our counterparts at Kudur police station. A shocked Nataraj was unable to recall the crime location at first. Then he told us the body could be lying within 500 metres of the prayer hall. The body was traced around 10pm, and by then, we had nabbed Nizamuddin and Sikandar, who confessed to the crime,” said an investigator from Nelamangala police station. They fell in love while working in factory: Victim’s father Lakshmipathi father Kumar said: “In 2017, my son worked in a garment factory near Nelamangala town, where he met and fell in love with the girl. Though we were not against the affair, I was worried due to the religious differences. In January this year, Sikandar and his friends warned Lakshmipathi saying they will kill him if he continued the relationship. We too had advised him to leave her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inter-faith-affair-man-offers-to-discuss-marriage-with-daughters-lover-kills-him/articleshow/78542905.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Pune||Worry over ‘super-spreader’ events as officials brace for festival crowds||PUNE: State disease surveillance experts said that ahead of the festival season, they are trying to identify groups of people in jobs with high contact frequency. It’s feared that these ‘social cohorts’, or groups, may trigger ‘super-spreader’ events. State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said authorities now plan to scale up antigen testing to repeatedly test these at-risk groups. “With the unlock announced, we will scale up antigen testing for such groups. The testing ratio is 40:60, which means 40% is via rapid antigen test kits. We will be increasing that number,” he said . High-contact groups can include vegetable vendors, shopkeepers or salespersons — essentially, anyone who comes in contact with a large number of people every day. Such a high contact frequency can increase transmission pools within a population. Awate said continuous testing will now be carried out among these groups to prevent surges, especially during the festive season when large crowds tend to gather. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI authorities are keeping an eye out for potential super spreader events. “The only way forward is to carry out more tests. Local authorities have already been alerted as the unlock process continues,” he said. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which has released findings on one super spreader event in Uttar Pradesh, said states should keep a close watch on crowds ahead of festivities. Rajnikant Srivastava, an ICMR spokesperson, told TOI that the research shows state authorities should carry out extensive testing if large gatherings have occurred. “The study found that the funeral of the first Covid victim from eastern Uttar Pradesh turned into a super spreader event. By the time infection was confirmed in the victim, the virus had spread to 16 other people,” he said. State surveillance experts said they are taking all precautions to limit gatherings. “We have already limited numbers as per unlock guidelines. Norms will have to be followed before conducting any large-scale event,” said one official. A recent study, published in the journal Science, has also underscored how the infection can be triggered by a small number of people. The research, carried out by Indian and international experts analysed cases across two states, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, which registering sharp increases in the number of cases. Researchers, through contact tracing, found that a group of patients — just 8% of the analysed cases — went on to cause 60% of new infections. They studied 5,75,071 who were exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases in the two states.

The newborn and his mother touched down safely at Kempegowda International Airport to a rousing welcome on the tarmac. The woman passenger, whose identity has been withheld, had boarded IndiGo flight 6E 122 that took off from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport at 4.40pm. According to airport officials, the woman experienced labour pain mid-air and the crew and some passengers immediately attended to her. The crew and a doctor on board soon created an enclosure, thus assisting the passenger and helping her through labour. Around 6.30pm, she delivered the boy on the flight. It was a premature delivery but the child is out of danger, officials said. The flight landed at KIA at 7.30pm and the mother disembarked with her newborn to a roaring reception from the airport staff who had gathered to welcome them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-delivers-boy-on-delhi-bluru-flight/articleshow/78542862.cms||Petlee Peter
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Presi invites ‘interested’ candidates to report online||Kolkata: Presidency University—where hundreds of applicants are still waiting for their turn on the admission list, while several seats in various subjects are still vacant—has invited wait-listed candidates, who are genuinely interested to study at the institute, to report online on Thursday and Friday.. Colleges affiliated to Calcutta University, grappling with a similar problem of vacancies despite several rounds of merit lists being published, have also adopted a similar strategy of inviting interested candidates to register for a wish list. These institutes will now publish “call-lists” only with names from the wish list, which will help them wrap up the admission process by the end of the month, the deadline set by the higher education department. At Rabindra Bharati University, too, multiple lists have been put up to fill the vacancies, while Jadavpur University has just started its first round of admissions. Inviting candidates, who were specifically interested in studying certain subjects at a particular institute, would save the colleges and universities precious time, which was being wasted in publishing lists after lists with names of candidates, who might have qualified owing to their high Plus-II scores but were not keen on the courses, an official said. Arabinda Nayak, co-ordinating admissions at Presidency University, did not wish to comment but another official said only those candidates could now report online, whose names figured on the original merit list but had not been able to secure admissions in any of the subjects. “Interested candidates can report online on Thursday and Friday. We might publish a separate merit list for only those candidates who report online and express their wish to study a subject in the university. They will have to meet all the criteria though,” said the official. In its fourth provisional list, Presidency has invited students to take admissions to 11 seats in geography, 15 in English, 28 in mathematics, 24 in history and 28 in physics. The university started inviting applications on August 18 and first provisional merit list was published on September 5. Several colleges affiliated to CU have also reopened their portals, inviting fresh applications to UG courses. Institutes, such as Gokhale Memorial Girls’ College, St Pauls’ Cathedral Mission College, Shyamaprasad College and Basanti Devi College, are on the verge of wrapping up the second phase of admission. Many others, some of them premium colleges, are toying with the idea of reopening the portal. “Every year, several seats open up once Jadavpur University starts its admission process. This year, too, we are watching the proceedings at JU. If more seats fall vacant due to migration to JU, we may have to reopen our portal, inviting fresh applications,” said the principal of a girls’ college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presi-invites-interested-candidates-to-report-online/articleshow/78542949.cms||Zeeshan Javed
October 8, 2020||Pune||Push to construction of eight water tanks for better supply||Pune: The water supply and distribution in Baner-Balewadi-Pashan area is expected to improve in the next few months as the construction of eight storage tanks and 154km distribution lines has been put on the fast track after being stagnant during the lockdown.The infrastructure works were expected to be completed in the next six to eight months, with construction of most overhead tanks reaching its final stages. Local representatives recently held a meeting to clear the hurdles and ensure completion of the work at the earliest. Baner Balewadi and adjacent areas had been facing water shortage for long. The supply improved to some extent in the past couple of years. As per the plan, the water tanks are coming up in Baner, Balewadi, Pashan lake, Chandni Chowk, Panchavati (an underground tank) and Chatushrungi. The tanks have various storage capacities ranging between 10 lakh-litre and 65 lakh-litre. Around a 7.5-km-long distribution line is being planned in addition to the 154-km-long water pipelines to distribute water to the residents more effectively. Amol Balwadkar, the local corporator and the head of the city improvement committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said a meeting was held recently to take stock of the ongoing work. “We have now told the authorities concerned to expedite it. I have been continuously following up with the PMC and the contractors. We are trying to complete the work in the next six to eight months,” he said, adding that the work would be completed without any hurdles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/push-to-construction-of-eight-water-tanks-for-better-supply/articleshow/78542934.cms||Sarang Dastane
October 8, 2020||Bengaluru||Suspended ACP, 2 others get anticipatory bail in bribery case||BENGALURU: A local court recently granted anticipatory bail to R Vasu, who was suspended as ACP of Electronics City, inspector BK Kishore Kumar and constable Janardhana BH in a bribery case registered by Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in August. Vasu was suspended for allegedly demanding Rs 50 lakh from financial consultant Vishesh Gupta during the lockdown in April. Gupta and his friend Gopi were caught while reportedly transporting liquor bottles in a vehicle. Gupta later accused Vasu and Kishore of booking a false case against him for not paying the Rs 50 lakh bribe they had demanded. According to the prosecution, the alleged incident occurred around 4.10pm on April 11 on Bettadasanapura Main Road near Electronics City. Vasu and his team stopped the SUV in which Gupta and Gopi were transporting the bottles. The cops demanded Rs 50 lakh to not slap a case against Gupta and later took him to Electronics City police station. Constable Janardhana was assigned to collect the money from him. The cops allegedly agreed to let Gupta off the hook for Rs 25 lakh. They suggested his mother pledge their immovable property to arrange the bribe money. She arranged Rs 2.5 lakh by pledging her ornaments and handed it over to the constable. After the matter came to light, the government suspended Vasu, who alleged his seniors were trying hush up the case. Gupta filed a complaint against the accused trio before ACB in May. ACB sleuths conducted a preliminary probe and wrote to the competent authorities seeking nod to file an FIR against the accused. While the DCP (southeast) gave permission for investigation against Janardhana on August 18, the DG-IGP allowed a probe against Kishore on August 25. Based on the approvals, ACB filed an FIR against Kishore and Janardhana on August 28. The bureau received permission to take up investigation against Vasu from the home department in the first week of September. “We included Vasu as an accused in the case after we got the government nod,” said an officer from ACB. Meanwhile, the trio approached the 23rd additional city civil and sessions court, which granted them anticipatory bail on September 24. The three accused have to appear before the investigation officer on the second and fourth Monday of every month till the investigation is over. They should not tamper with prosecution witnesses and can’t leave the country without prior permission of the court, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/suspended-acp-2-others-get-anticipatory-bail-in-bribery-case/articleshow/78542943.cms||Santosh kumar.B

In order to hide his crime, the accused uncle even tried to apply mobil oil to stop the little girl's excessive bleeding. The five-year-old girl was playing with her friends when the 35-year-old uncle took her to his house in the neighbourhood. The family later came to know about the incident when the minor started complaining of severe pain in her lower abdomen. She was taken to a doctor who confimed rape. Senior cops ensured that the girl's medico-legal was completed quickly and she was admitted to a hospital for treatment. The accused has been booked under the IPC sections of rape and the POCSO Act. The girl's family has been provided Rs 3 lakh under a government beneficiary scheme as they are "very poor". "We have ensured that their ration card was made on a priority basis and a piece of farm land be provided on lease," district magistrate Kumar Prashant said of the steps taken to placate the girl's family. “The accused has been arrested and the girl is receiving proper treatment. Her condition is stable. She has been discharged from the hospital," Budaun SSP Sankalp Sharma told TOI on Wednesday. A circle officer will probe the case and a charge-sheet is likely to be filed soon, Sharma said. "We have sufficient evidence against the accused. We will ensure speedy trial in a fast-track court,” the SSP added.

October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Property mutation requests put on hold until Monday||HYDERABAD: Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has stopped accepting mutation applications (requests for transfer/assessment of property etc) till October 11. “From Monday, we will start accepting applications at all citizen service centres. Around 3,000 applications are yet to be cleared,” said a GHMC official. “We will first clear pending applications, then proceed to new ones,” he explained.  GHMC issued an internal memo directing employees to stop accepting mutation applications. After the applications were stopped, worried residents ran from pillar to post thinking any delay in mutation may delay the enrolment of their property on Dharani portal. “We are in a fix as several property owners in Kukatpally Housing Board Colony (KPHB) are not sure whether their property is eligible to be uploaded in Dharani portal or not. When I tried to transfer my property ownership at a citizen service centre, I was informed that new mutation applications were not being accepted,” said Sai Varun from KPHB phase one. A few others TOI spoke to had similar issues. “I was informed by staffers at a citizen service centre that NOC from the bank is mandatory to obtain mutation certificate. When I brought the NOC today, my application was not accepted by the centre in Serilingampally,” said S Harsha from Whitefields, Kondapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/property-mutation-requests-put-on-hold-until-monday/articleshow/78542923.cms||Nabinder Bommala
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad foundation day needs a date: Expert||HYDERABAD: Heritage experts said there is a need to commemorate Hyderabad’s foundation day. They were speaking at a panel discussion on the 429th foundation year of Hyderabad city. While asking for more research into the actual date when the foundation of the city was laid, historian Sajjad Shahid said: “Initial celebrations of the city’s foundation were held in 1958 in a three-day event, of which there is a comprehensive record. But the celebrations fizzled out year after year.” Shahid said a convenient date can be fixed, which can be celebrated every year. Pitching for October 7 to be considered as foundation day, Gopala Krishna, founder, Hyderabad Trails, said, “Most people are unaware that this was the day when the city was born. In 1591, when the moon was in the constellation of Leo, Jupiter in its own abode, and all celestial planets favourably placed, Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah laid the foundation of the city. So, that makes today the 429th birthday of our dear city.” Speaking about the need for commemoration of this event by fixing a date, he said: “These events are reminders that we are a continuation of the past, and that we have evolved collectively as a people from the journey traversed together across centuries. And this collective evolution as a city, defines who we are, underlining the values that have become a part of our living heritage.” Conservation architect, Vasantha Shoba said: “Earlier, without social media, it was very difficult to commemorate the occasion, but now, creating awareness is easier.” Conservation architect, Vasantha Shoba, spoke about the various hurdles in getting the government to mark the occasion and said a discussion on fixing a date is the need of the hour||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-foundation-day-needs-a-date-expert/articleshow/78542953.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 8, 2020||Bareilly||FIR, fine and certificate cancellation: Pilibhit’s plan to stop stubble burning||PILIBHIT: The local authorities in UP's Pilibhit have come up with an elaborate plan to prevent stubble burning this year - FIR, fine and cancellation of character certificate. Several farmers have been booked in Bareilly division for burning stubble and not following National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines. To dissuade others, Pilibhit district magistrate (DM) Pulkit Khare has ordered suspension of character and status certificates of farmers, and imposing fines. The DM has also ordered action against SHOs and police outposts in charge if any stubble burning incident goes unnoticed. This stringent action has been already enforced against a farmer, Ranjit Singh, of Kataiyya village under Amaria tehsil. The farmer had burnt the crop residue in 1.64 hectare area. The farmer's tractor was also impounded while the area lekhpal, Gurumesh Chandra, the village development officer, Dharmpal, and the Kisan Sahayak (assistance provider to farmers), Mukesh Kumar, were suspended with immediate effect, the DM said. In addition, the village pradhan of Kataiyya, Ravindra Kaur, was served a notice under the Panchayat Raj Act. The Amaria tehsildar, Sher Bahadur, and the SHO, Udai Veer Singh, were issued a stern warning. Recommendation for the suspension of police post in-charge, Veeresh Kumar, and the police beat constable, Shivraj, has been sent to the superintendent of police, Jai Prakash Yadav, the DM further said. “Stubble burning will not be tolerated. The government has evolved a comprehensive structure in the form of introducing a chain of custom hiring centres and farm machinery banks to provide advanced machinery to farmers for the mulching of crop residue in the fields," the DM said. Vijay Kumar Trivedi, the Puranpur tehsildar, said that another farmer, Jasveer Singh, of Pachpeda village was booked for stubble burning under IPC section 435 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI that as many as three farmers were booked for burning the crop residue in the district. The cops are repeatedly appealing to the farmers to avoid stubble burning, Sajwan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/fir-fine-and-certificate-cancellation-pilibhits-plan-to-stop-stubble-burning/articleshow/78540451.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Nehru Children’s Museum seeks ‘Covid aid’ as virus takes a toll on Bengal's institutions||KOLKATA: Nehru Children’s Museum (NCM) — Bengal’s lone museum exclusively for children — has been reeling under dire financial distress and the council of museums is seeking public donation for its sustenance. The museum has been closed since March 20 while its 23 staff on the pay-roll are under ‘no-work-no-pay’ policy. However, NCM is not the only museum in the city, which has been facing deep crisis. Most of the museums are in great trouble and the basic upkeep of rare artefacts and antiquities is also being affected. “We have written to all MLAs and MPs from Bengal across the party line on the current financial distress of the museum. But we got no response from anyone,” said Indrani Sengupta, secretary of NCM. NCM was founded by Jugal Srimal, a child enthusiast and philanthropist in 1972 at its current location on Chowringhee Road just behind Nandan cultural complex, under the parent body of National Cultural Society, which he had established in 1945. Srimal was also behind the toy-train project at Rabindra Sarobar. The museum has collections of dolls from across the world and depicts two epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, in models. “It is sad that the only museum for children in Bengal is reeling under such crisis. But all museums must reinvent themselves to be relevant and attract resources for self-sustenance. I don’t think there is any dearth for funds. One needs to bring in some dynamism so that a larger group of people takes interest in its activities,” said Professor Sachindranath Bhattacharya, an eminent museologist and president of Paschimbanga Sangrahalaya Samiti, one of the oldest associations for museum movement in Bengal. NCM used to earn revenues for sustenance from meagre gate ticket and the fees from different courses run by the museum. “What I feel strongly is that the museum like NCM did not grow beyond what Jugal Srimal had envisioned it 50 years ago. The museum has a great potential to explore avenues to become the best museum for children,” said Bhattacharya, who listed many museums in the city in a moribund state, despite receiving financial support from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nehru-childrens-museum-seeks-covid-aid-as-virus-takes-a-toll-on-city-institutions/articleshow/78542977.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
October 8, 2020||Nagpur||9pm shutdown not allowing bar owners to make it large||Nagpur: Bar owners of the city are despondent as excise department has allowed them to keep their establishments open till only 9pm. They say customers come to their establishments after 8pm and they should be allowed to remain open till 11pm to make their business viable. If the excise department does not extend the closing time then bars will close down soon.While municipal commissioner has not announced a closing time for restaurants that do not serve liquor, the police department is closing them down at 11pm, without any written order according to hoteliers.Bar owners, however, have a ray of hope as the state department of tourism has allowed bars to remain open till 10pm, but the final decision will be taken by local authorities.Hotelier Tejinder Singh Renu told TOI that excise department order was highly impractical and would sound a death knell for restaurants and bars. “How will Covid spread if bars are allowed to remain open till 11pm? Does the disease spread more at night,” he said.Renu further said that bars had remained closed for seven months and the state government order allowing them to reopen had brought smiles on the faces of owners and staffers. “However, the excise department order has spread gloom among us,” he added.The hotelier pointed out that marketplaces were crowded on most days and there was more chance of the disease spreading due to close proximity of citizens. “In bars, we are maintaining distancing and people will enjoy their drink safely in bars if they are allowed to remain open on the lines of pre-lockdown times,” he said.Piyush Rathi, a hotelier of Khamgaon, said that restaurant owners of Buldhana district were even more despondent. “The district collector has ordered the bars and restaurants to close down at 7pm. It is almost like not allowing us to open. We have suffered huge losses for seven months. Now, we should be allowed to do business without such impractical decisions,” he added.Rathi said that only 30% restaurants had started in the district due to the time restrictions. “Lack of staff and working capital are also the reasons. Our association has written a letter to the government asking it not allow local authorities to decide the closing time. The government should fix a time for the entire state,” he added.Vinay Narkhede, a bar manager, said that his operating cost had increased due to sanitization, disposable menus, etc but government was not allowing him to recover the cost by restricting timings. “I have not started the kitchen as it increases the operating cost. We are serving packages snacks to customers. Around 80% of our revenue comes from the kitchen so you can imagine our loss,” he added.BS Dave, president of Nagpur Restaurant Owners Association, said that restaurants and bars should be allowed to remain open at least till 10.30pm. “The government has finally allowed us to reopen. We are thankful for it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/9pm-shutdown-not-allowing-bar-owners-to-make-it-large/articleshow/78541606.cms||Ashish Roy
October 8, 2020||Pune||Maharashtra women’s panel chief post vacant for 8 months||PUNE: Maharashtra is yet to get a new chairperson for the state commission for women. The post has remained vacant for eight months now. The last chairperson of the Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) Vijaya Rahatkar had resigned in February. Women and Child Development (WCD) minister Yashomati Thakur told TOI that she has conducted several meetings regarding the appointment, but the state government is yet to clear the nomination for the post. “I have undertaken 15 meetings for the same but there has been no decision yet,” said the minister, who had recently raised a voice against the Hathras rape case. Thakur further agreed that there is an urgent need for a chairperson but, she said, the three parties in the ruling alliance must come to a consensus on deciding the name. Senior officials from the government stated that each of the parties in the alliance had proposed a name from their party and they were unable to arrive at a consensus. With the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data projecting a grim picture of the state regarding violence against women, a women’s commission without a chairperson is not the right picture, said activists. Social activist Vihar Durve, who had earlier raised the issue, said that it was the need of the hour as the commission is mandated to ensure safety and security of woman. “The government should not just appoint the chairperson immediately but also create six women’s commission branches throughout the state as well as provide all infrastructure for the offices so that women can easily approach the commissions,” he said. Durve added that he had written to CM Uddhav Thackeray regarding more offices in the state, for which he had received response that they had forwarded the letter to the WCD ministry at the centre for approval. Meanwhile, Maha Vikas Aghadi sources said the process of ‘shortlisting of one name’ was causing a delay in the announcement. Thakur said she has also written to the CM, deputy CM and others in the state cabinet. “Hopefully, everyone will arrive at a consensus soon,” Thakur added. The NCRB statistics show that of 278 cases of rape with murder registered across the country, Maharashtra has recorded the highest at 47 cases, followed by Madhya Pradesh (37) and Uttar Pradesh (34). In terms of rape committed, Maharashtra ranks fourth with 2,299 cases behind Rajasthan (5,997), Uttar Pradesh (3,065) and Madhya Pradesh (2,485). As many as 10,472 cases of intent to insult the modesty of a woman were registered in the state, after Uttar Pradesh (11,988) and Odisha (11,308).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-womens-panel-chief-post-vacant-for-8-months/articleshow/78542980.cms||Nisha Nambiar
October 8, 2020||Bengaluru||Activists welcome nod for suburban project but say decision is ill-timed||BENGALURU: Clearance of the long-pending suburban rail project has brought cheer to activists in the city. However, they are still skeptical as the decision was not officially announced after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) meeting on Wednesday. Activists say several such promises have been made in the past by governments at the Centre and state, but the project has remained on paper. Though Bengaluru has figured in many reports pertaining to the most congested cities, a dedicated suburban train network like Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad has been a distant dream. Rajkumar Dugar from Citizens for Citizens, an NGO, said: “We welcome the decision but why did the Centre choose to clear this project weeks before the bypolls? They would have known earlier that the model code of conduct is in force in Karnataka, yet they sat on the proposal for months.” KN Krishna Prasad, founder-member of Karnataka Railway Vedike, said: “My dream is to travel in a suburban train in my lifetime. We have been waiting for several years. The project should have been implemented during former Bengaluru South MP Ananth Kumar’s tenure but it was delayed. It will be a tribute to former Union minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi.” Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a commuter rail activist, who has been fighting for the project for several years, said: “CCEA was the final hurdle for the project. Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (K-RIDE) should now get into execution mode. Unlike Metro, railways has land which is readily available for the project. The focus should be on sourcing funds and completing the project without any further delay.” Tara Krishnaswamy of Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB), which conducted the Chuku Buku Beku campaign, said: “We welcome the cabinet approval but how will the cash-strapped state government implement this project? The Centre should rope in funding agencies like JICA.” Work on airport corridor likely to be taken up first Sources say K-RIDE, an SPV which is executing the project, is likely to take up the airport corridor first. However, the state government has to take a final decision. “We are planning to take up KSR Bengaluru-Devanahalli corridor with airport link on priority after getting the approval from the state government. The 41km section with 14 stations will be completed in three years. We are planning to complete all four corridors in six years,” said a K-RIDE source. Sources say K-RIDE will shift to a new office in Yeshwantpur in a month. “We have started land acquisition. Design consultants will be identified soon. We are also in the process of recruitments and plan to float the tender for civil work in six months,” the source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/activists-welcome-nod-for-suburban-project-but-say-decision-is-ill-timed/articleshow/78542974.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Mangaluru||Mangaluru: Turning crisis into opportunity, young grads sell fish ‘in style’||MANGALURU: Robin, an ITI graduate from a city college is selling fish as he is not able to find a job in his specialised field due to the pandemic- induced recession. Turning a crisis into opportunity, several youngsters and fresh graduates who have lost their jobs are taking to selling fish in makeshift shops along roadsides or in vehicles at residential areas to make a living. “For a month, I ran a shop near Kuloor flyover with two partners and I got to learn inside out about the fishing business. In a few days, I will start business on my own at a rented shop in Bondel. There are several others like me,” said Robin. Among the first ones jump the bandwagon is Varun Shenava, resident of Kunjathbail. Varun, after pursuing Masters in construction management from Coventry University in the UK, started ‘Kadal Fresh Fish Mart’ at Bikarnakatte in August. “After returning to India, I started applying for jobs. I was called for an interview at a Bengaluru-based firm, but the lockdown was announced. I never got lucky even after the lockdown was lifted. Since my friends were in the fishing industry, I too joined them,” he said. “My father ridiculed me for the decision, but friends supported me,” he said. Explaining why selling fish is a profitable and easy business, Yatish Baikampady, chief executive officer, Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project said the investment is less and one gets the returns at the end of the day. “For instance, one buys fish for Rs 2,000 and it’s sold by noon or evening. The investment returns with the profit the same day unlike other businesses,” he added. “Traditionally, fish vendors are from a particular community called Mogaveera, but that’s not the case any more. In fact, several youngsters who had gone astray from the traditional occupation are back and are doing it in style,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/turning-crisis-into-opportunity-young-grads-sell-fish-in-style/articleshow/78540468.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Pune||Tingre bats for PMC plan to address drainage woes||Pune: Wadgaonsheri MLA Sunil Tingre has urged the civic body to finalise a comprehensive plan to remove encroachments from nullahs and stormwater drains in the area, besides cleaning, aligning and properly channelising them after the recent torrential rains flooded parts of his constituency — a regular feature after heavy showers last month. Tingre said he had spoken to multiple officials in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to point out rampant encroachment on nullahs in areas like Wadgaonsheri, Vimannagar and Dhanori. “Builders are required by the law to not undertake any construction close to nullahs even if they pass by their land. But I have seen multiple instances where rampant construction has been done by the builders over nullahs, choking the water flow completely and violating the alignment of nullahs. And all that the PMC can do much later is assign responsibility to the one that did not undertake proper inspection of the encroachment,” he told TOI. He said five main nullahs in the area flowing directly or indirectly into the Mula-Mutha and the Indryani needed the PMC’s attention. He said the PMC was pursuing too many concrete roads in some areas without undertaking stormwater drainage work at some parts, especially in eastern parts of Wadgaonsheri and Mundhwa, and in Kharadi. Incorrect construction of large stormwater drains flowing into nullahs without taking into account the catchment areas and the volume of water generated in the area during rains had complicated things, he said. “The PMC has engaged in construction of concrete roads even in small lanes in and around Ganeshnagar and the old Mundhwa Road. The stormwater drains built there turn at incorrect angles, which may choke the flow of water if there is a lot of rain. The work is still going on at the old Mundhwa Road, where they are laying new cables and constructing a new concrete road. Have they undertaken work to build appropriate stormwater drains first? No, they have not. We need to calculate the water that may be generated in the catchment area, and build stormwater drains of the correct alignment and dimension,” he said. The PMC is preparing a detailed project report on the rehabilitation and channelisation of the nullahs in the area. The project is expected to cost Rs50 crores, according to officials. “A permanent solution is required for waterlogging and flooding issues in the area. There are problems in stormwater drains, especially in nullahs. We are preparing a detailed project report, and when it is ready, we shall seek an allocation to complete the work,” said an official of the drainage department of the PMC, adding that funds were at a premium because of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tingre-bats-for-pmc-plan-to-address-drainage-woes/articleshow/78542966.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
October 8, 2020||Pune||3 divert man’s attention, steal gold||Pune: Three men posing as state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) personnel diverted the attention of a 77-year-old man and stole his gold chain and ring, valued at Rs 40,000, on Tuesday. The incident occurred near a housing society at Karvenagar around 12noon. Police said Ramchandra Kulkarni from Sinhagad Road went there to supervise the work of his bungalow.

October 8, 2020||Nagpur||Dist’s weekly TPR falls by 11%, expert says +ve cases, infection on decline||Nagpur: The weekly Test Positivity Rate (TPR), positive cases as against tests, of the district has reduced by 11% in the first week of October. Expert says it is a sign of decline in positive cases as well as infection. Testing has slightly improved compared to last week of September but remains lower than the first three weeks of September.As per data of District Civil Surgeon, 41,328 tests were done between October 1 and 7 in the district of which 6,069 tested positive, giving TPR of 14.68%. Daily average of tests was 5,904 whereas for positive cases it was 867.Of the 49,880 tests done, 12,905 came positive between September 22 and 30 for a TPR of 25.87%. Daily average of tests was 5,542.22 whereas for positive cases it was 1,433.88. It indicated positive cases did not come down but the tests declined in last week of September.If one compares data of first week of October with last week of September, TPR has reduced by 11.19%.TPR was 23.34% in first week of September followed by 22.96% in second week and 26.75% in third week. TPR was highest in these three weeks in last seven months. Average TPR in the month of August was 13.78% and increased to 24.63% in September.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “An 11% fall in weekly TPR means positive cases and infection are on decline. Cases and deaths are on decline for over last two weeks. Recoveries were more than positive cases for consecutive 17 days till Tuesday. All these are clear signs of peak of Covid-19 ending and district reaching plateau, which may continue for more than two weeks. It is the need of the hour to maintain number of tests. If TPR goes below 10%, it will mean growth rate declined for sure. Epidemic is considered ended if TPR goes below 5%,” he said.The number of tests has slightly improved in first week of October. Daily average tests were 7,024.85 in first week of September and increased to 7,740.71. Decline started from third week of September as daily average tests were 6,211.85 and further declined to 5,542.22 in last week. In first week of October, 5,904 tests per day tests were done.After decline, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started to reach out to people. Special camps are being organized daily in residential areas. Currently, 12 mobile swab collection centres have been operationalized. Attracting some controversy, the civic body also started to test around 7,000 sanitary workers, of which majority are asymptomatic.The district administration and zilla parishad have also chalked out some measures to improve testing in rural parts of the district.Activist Narayan Ahuja said, “High-risk contacts of all positive patients are still not coming for testing despite special camps being organized in residential areas. NMC should pursue the high-risk contacts till all are tested. Also, private clinics and hospitals should ensure testing of symptomatic patients, comorbid and also inform NMC on daily basis.”Corporator Pradip Pohane said, “People are now not ready to get testes unless they have any symptoms. Private doctors say number of people visiting their clinics has also declined. It is possible the season of viral infection is ending,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dists-weekly-tpr-falls-by-11-expert-says-ve-cases-infection-on-decline/articleshow/78541616.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
October 8, 2020||Nagpur||Post-Covid management holds key now for recovered patients||Nagpur: Specialists doctors say cure, popularly believed to be turning Covid negative in a fortnight, is just one part of the healing process and proper management of the disease holds the key. “Newly diagnosed patients have decreased a lot. This is the time that all the follow-up patients can be focused upon to ensure they are protected during the next wave, if it happens,” said chest physician Dr Syed Tarique.Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said there is a bigger risk of more number of recovered patients developing various complications as Covid is a lung disease. “In emergency, patients were cured on short-term basis,” he said.Dr Arbat said post-Covid, lungs will be stiff, less elastic, and may generate less oxygen required for the day-to-day activities and hence it will lead to certain problems. “This problem may be seen in patients having moderate to severe type of disease, where lung involvement is more in CT chest. These patients need careful follow-up with experts to evaluate the disability. Post-Covid breathing problems, intermittent or continuous cough, aggravations of existing diseases will trouble them. It is better to think about long term Covid management,” he said.IGGMCH pulmonology department head Dr Radha Munje said treatment as well as management of Covid is important. “Patient education and rehabilitation are important in post-Covid period. Recovered patient need not be scared. Doctors need to counsel that a few residual change may occur and if at all new symptoms show up, these patients should see a doctor,” she said.Dr Munje added when a patient turns RTPCR negative, it means only infectivity decreases. “But it doesn’t mean the disease process has stopped,” she said.Critical care physician at OCHRI and director of Axon Multispeciality Hospital Dr Santosh Dhole said that there are three types of post-Covid patients. “First is those who didn’t need much oxygen and medical care. Second, those who had high O2 dependence with comorbidities and third who needed ventilator. The last category suffer from pulmonary fibrosis. They take long time to recover, remain depressed and are fearful of death. They need monitoring and counselling on regular basis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-management-holds-key-now-for-recovered-patients/articleshow/78541612.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Protection of women & dalits should be top priority: K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the state police to take effective measures to stop atrocities against Dalits. He also asked police to lay more emphasis on safety and protection of women. Terming the rising incidents of atrocities against the Dalits across the country as unfortunate, the CM said: “The responsibility to prevent any attack on the weaker sections by the stronger sections lies with police.” He directed the cops to behave in a humane manner when the weaker sections approach them for help and protection. He held a review meeting on Wednesday with top officials from home, police and forest departments to discuss the law and order situation, women safety, protection of forests, controlling timber smuggling and regulating the drug menace. The meeting assumed significance as it came in the backdrop of the alleged rape and murder of a Dalit girl at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. Stressing on friendly policing, the CM said police personnel should respect every citizen without any discrimination and there by enhance the spirit of policing. He asked senior police officers to work relentlessly to maintain law and order as Telangana is moving forward on the development path. Stating that Telangana is number one in the country on the law and order front, the CM congratulated the state police in this regard. He also asked the police to take steps to eradicate the sale and supply of ganja which, he said, is harming the youth. To put an end to smuggling of forest wealth, law and order police should join hands with forest officers. KCR wanted cops to put an end to manufacturing of gudumba, which reared its head again in the state during lockdown. Directing the police to increase the use of technology to control criminal activities, the CM said: “Speed up setting up of 10 lakh CCTV cameras in Hyderabad. Also, appointments on compassionate grounds should not be delayed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-protection-of-women-dalits-should-be-top-priority/articleshow/78542988.cms||Roushan Ali
October 8, 2020||Nashik||60% posts at Covid facilities yet to be filled||Nashik: The civic health department has been able to fill only about 40% of vacancies for doctors, nurses and other medical and non-medical staff, said senior officials of the Nashik civil hospital on Wednesday . “The shortage of medical staff has brought a huge burden on the doctors and other employees already working, as the number of Covid-19 cases are continuously being reported,” said the officials. An official said that one of the main reasons why many doctors and others are not applying could be because the jobs at Covid facilities are on contractual basis. The officials said they had put up an advertisement for recruiting 200 doctors, nurses and other staff in July. “The Nashik civil hospital and its rural hospitals are getting a large number of patients on a daily basis. Medical superintendents of rural hospitals have been told to seek assistance of private doctors on call basis, but many of them are not available at times due to their own work-load,” said the officials. The officials said they are trying to get the posts filled as early as possible. Apart from the dedicated Covid hospital (DCH) on the Nashik civil hospital premises, there are 19 dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) all over the district. “Ten more DCHCs will be established in various parts of the district soon. Hence, there will be a need for doctors and other medical and non-medical staff at these facilities,” the officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/60-posts-at-covid-facilities-yet-to-be-filled/articleshow/78540479.cms||Santosh Sonawane
October 8, 2020||Pune||Study highlights role of counsellors during treatment to avert unrealistic expectations||Pune: When a city-based eye surgeon contacted 648 “lost-to-follow-up” cases of retinal disorders to understand why they left the treatment midway, non-affordability and patients’ unrealistic expectations emerged the two most common factors. Most patients admitted that they gave up treatment simply because the eye injections “did not improve their vision” the way they had expected.Though the treatment (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy) was for arresting the vision loss after initial improvement, the patients kept on expecting a further improvement in vision. They eventually got disillusioned in the process.The study findings, experts said, underlined the need for thorough patient counselling about treatment goals in the language best known to them. The study, claimed to be first-of-its-kind in India, has got published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology early this month.“Its findings reinforce the urgent need for appointing full-time counsellors to make patients understand the treatment goals thoroughly. Treating doctors also need to do more and give patients a realistic picture of what to expect,” eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar, who carried out the study, told TOI. Kelkar is the director of the National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO).The anti-VEGF is a life-long treatment meant for patients with retinal disorders like diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. Currently, it is the only treatment that offers hope. Patients may lose vision permanently if they do not opt for it or leave it midway. The treatment improves vision in about one out of three patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/study-highlights-role-of-counsellors-during-treatment-to-avert-unrealistic-expectations/articleshow/78542984.cms||Umesh Isalkar
October 8, 2020||Nagpur||KP’s identity as playing ground lost due to neglect: HC||Nagpur: Stressing on expediting ground levelling work of Kasturchand Park, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed planning department secretary to release funds for it.“We don’t find any difficulty in carrying out such work in a phased manner. The maintenance of ground is collector’s duty. The work is not only neglected for years together, but its identity as playing ground is lost. The reason that funds aren’t available for its levelling can’t impress us,” a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Pushpa Ganediwala said, before directing secretary to file an affidavit.Quoting collector on re-erection of Kasturchand Daga’s statue, the bench noted that his family members were being consulted to subscribe funds for maintaining it in a proper shape. “We expect that by next date, concrete proposal shall be placed before us.”Agreeing with suggestion of amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, the judges added Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) director general as a respondent and directed him to take a decision on repairs/restoration works on heritage structures like Chatri at the historic place.The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL (No 45/2017) regarding encroachments and neglect of historic place based on media reports.Earlier, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) counsel Jemini Kasat informed that work of drainage system at ground was completed.The judges then directed NMC to take immediate steps to frame regulations as per ‘Clause 4’ of the ‘Regulations for Conservation of Heritage Precincts/Natural Features’ by following procedure prescribed for that purpose.“We permit ASI to consider and submit report by taking guidance from regulations framed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for Grade-I heritage precincts in Mumbai, for carrying out renovation and restoration work of Kasturchand Park monument,” the judges said, while asking ASI to complete formalities within two weeks.After their visit to KP ground on September 5, the judges issued a series of directives to all stakeholders to improve its pitiable condition, including levelling the surface after consulting experts, clearing debris, removal of paver blocks for the jogging track around the Chatri (dome) and deployment of guards till the project completion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kps-identity-as-playing-ground-lost-due-to-neglect-hc/articleshow/78541621.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Despite Telangana government passing all intermediate students, some marked failed||HYDERABAD: Despite the state government declaring all Intermediate students as pass in view of the pandemic, students alleged that the same has not been considered while declaring Eamcet (Engineering Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance Test) results as they were declared as not qualified even after securing qualifying marks in Eamcet. In the Eamcet rank card, some students said that the result was given as ‘failed in qualifying examination’. “I secured 45 marks in the EAMCET but failed in Sanskrit in the Intermediate second year. As the state announced all failed candidates as pass, I should have been awarded the rank, but instead, it was mentioned that I failed in qualifying examination,” said a candidate. Another candidate, who belongs to the reserved category, said that he secured 42 marks in the Eamcet examination. “I failed in chemistry in Intermediate first year and have no backlogs in the second year of Intermediate, but surprisingly I was disqualified in EAMCET,” he added. Student leaders alleged that disqualifying students who secured qualifying marks shows the irresponsible attitude of the government and officials concerned. “The students were in a state of confusion because of the government’s fault,” said Balmoor Venkat, state president, Telangana NSUI, demanding that officials rectify their mistakes within 24 hours failing which they will be obstructing Eamcet counselling on October 9. The convener of the Eamcet 2020 A Govardhan, meanwhile, said that ranks of supplementary candidates will be generated by following norms. “For the candidates who passed the Intermediate exam in advanced supplementary (June-2020), their ranks will be generated later as per the government order which is followed every year. For TS Eamcet-2020, these ranks will be finalised and will be published by October 8,” read the circular from Eamcet convener.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-govt-passing-all-inter-students-some-marked-failed/articleshow/78543011.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Sunderbans tiger trapped after 30-hour operation, released in forest||KOLKATA: In a search and rescue operation, that lasted for close to 30 hours, a Sunderbans tiger — an adult male aged around 5 years — was captured on the edge of the forest on Tuesday night while it was trying to cross over to a village nearby. The big cat had sneaked into Baikunthapur 6 village under Maipith Coastal police station from the forest of Ajmalmari 12 under South 24 Parganas division on Monday evening and killed two cows before being driven away by foresters. It then made at least three attempts to reclaim its kill till Tuesday evening before being finally trapped in a cage around 9pm. It was taken to Jharkhali rescue centre and after checking of its health parameters it was released in Chulkathi forest under the same division on Wednesday afternoon, said chief wildlife warden VK Yadav. “The tiger was first spotted in the village on Monday evening, around 6pm. Though it managed to kill two cows, it couldn’t devour them. As our men reached the village with trap cages and nylon nets and intensified patrolling, it managed to cross over to the forest on the other side. Our staff led by DFO Milan Mondal and his team set up nylon net fencing overnight to separate the village from the forest of Ajmalmari,” added Yadav. On Tuesday, around 10.30am, the tiger was again seen trying to cross river Thakuran from the forest side. “Though the foresters managed to drive it away, they were on guard. The foresters even used drones to keep a track on the movement of the tiger,” said Anil Mistry of Wildlife Protection Society of India. “Our staff prevented it from entering the village again around 6.30pm. Finally it was trapped around 9pm in one of the two cages,” said Mondal. The department, along with WWF-India’s Sunderbans chapter, has already taken up the job to repair nylon net fencing along a 50-km stretch covering the forests of Matla, Ramganga and Raidighi ranges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sunderbans-tiger-trapped-after-30-hour-op-released-in-forest/articleshow/78543003.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||IIT-Hyderabad launches new BTech programme in biomedical engineering||HYDERABAD: Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) launched a new bachelor of technology programme in biomedical engineering from the academic year 2020-21. Total 20 seats will be on offer in the new programme.

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Cops propose new road to ease snarls around Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: To reduce the traffic gridlock around the airport in the post unlock period, Bidhannagar Police have proposed construction of a new road inside the Kolkata airport premises by razing a perimeter wall near gate No. 2.5 and expand a portion of the existing Jessore Road. Though local airport authorities do not have any objection in allowing the use of land, it needs to be formally approved by the top brass as the land belongs to airport. The decongestion proposal was submitted by Bidhannagar Police, following multiple inspections by senior officers from the Bidhannagar Commissionerate, state Public Works Department, National Highway Authority of India, State Highway Authority and officials from Kolkata airport at the proposed spot several times. Bidhannagar Police has also submitted a blueprint of the plan to the airport authorities in a joint meeting last week. “We have received a formal application from them and have sent the project details to higher officials in the centre for their approval,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee. As per the plan, a 25m stretch of the perimeter wall between airport gate no. 2.5 and gate no. 3 will be razed. A new road will branch out of Jessore Road and join with the existing Airport slip road. Vehicles coming down the Nagerbazar-bound ramp of Belghoria Expressway can directly take a left turn to enter that road and head towards VIP Road and those willing to travel towards Nagerbazar, can go straight. “The left turn facility at 2.5 no gate will also help city-bound vehicles from Birati, Madhyamgram, Barasat, Basirhat and other places get off Jessore Road. This will certainly reduce the traffic congestion around gate no. 2.5,” said Bidhannagar City Police deputy commissioner (traffic) Dhritiman Sarkar. Sarkar said, they also have a plan to expand the existing Jessore Road by breaking portions of pavement and shifting it deep inside the existing area between the footpath and the roadside shops and buildings on the Birati bound-flank to allow more vehicles. “After cutting the sidewalks, the expanded portion will be wide enough to turn the two-lane road good enough for three-lane traffic,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-propose-new-road-to-ease-snarls-around-airport/articleshow/78543018.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

October 8, 2020||Nashik||Smooth-sailing for YCMOU e-exams||Nashik: Most students, around 85%, of the 1.90 lakh from the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU) are taking online exams of the last semester of final year in various courses without any problems, said a university official on Wednesday. The smooth conduct of the YCMOU online exams assumes significance as a section of media has reported system failure in other universities in the state. “We have no specific application or conditions for using digital gadgets during the exams. Yet there is no complaint from anywhere,” said YCMOU registrar Dinesh Bhonde. “More than 85% of students have already appeared for the exams. Moreover, 65% of the students are from rural areas of the state,” he said. Most of the YCMOU students are from rural areas and hence it has devised a simple technique to ensure students can appear for the exams, which have staggered timings, from their homes or even farms. The exams have been divided into morning and evening sessions of 5 hours each. All that the students had to decide was to appear continuously for two hours between 8am and 1pm and 3pm and 8pm. The university officials said students who were unable to take the exams will get another chance, the time-table for which will be announced soon after the ongoing exams conclude on October 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/smooth-sailing-for-ycmou-e-exams/articleshow/78540506.cms||Abhilash Botekar
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 17 new STPs to clean up Hussainsagar lake||HYDERABAD: The Hyderbad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is planning to build 17 new sewerage treatment plants (STPs) to clean the 450-year-old Hussainsagar lake. Once a drinking water body, this lake, which appears majestically in the middle of the city, has been polluted as drainage water is being emptied into it. Even decades-old lakes have been polluted as there are no proper sewer networks. Apart from Hussainsagar, dozen other water bodies like Durgam Cheruvu, Fox Sagar lake, Kukatpally Nalla Cheruvu, Miyapur Patel Cheruvu would be free from sewerage if the proposed STPs are constructed. “After a detailed survey was done by the water board, a couple of years back, along the Musi and Hussainsagar catchment areas we have noticed that sewerage water is polluting these bodies. We have come to the conclusion that recycling sewerage water through STPs is the only solution to tackle this problem,” HMWS&SB chief general manager (PCC-II), D Sudershan told TOI. “As the water board doesn’t have enough finances, we have decided to build these 17 STPs under the hybrid annuity mode (HAM). According to this method, 40% expenditure will be borne by the state government and the rest by a private agency,” Sudershan said. According to the officials, the estimated cost of the these STPs is Rs 1,081.75 crore. Their total capacity is 376.5 MLD. “All the 17 would be built on the government’s land. Tenders have already been floated and the works are expected to commence in a month,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/17-new-stps-to-clean-up-hussainsagar/articleshow/78543020.cms||Sunil Mungara
October 8, 2020||Agra||Hathras village virtually under siege||HATHRAS: CCTV cameras are being installed on a hut that nobody ever noticed until now. Because the people living there were forever faceless. It's a strange sight. Bright lenses on a crumbling house made of mud and loose faded bricks. The metal detector that has been propped up looks out of place, awkward even, as one walks through it past buffaloes and dung, into a place that has just two doors and is open almost on every side. Not much can get past the barricades screening the Hathras village from the world of "outsiders". No civilian cars, no two-wheelers and people in groups of no more than five — those are the rules. It was around 10am on Wednesday that my photographer and I got to the main access road leading up to the Hathras village. But we were stopped at the barricade. “You can’t take two-wheelers in from today,” a cop posted there said. After a thorough scrutiny of IDs and a series of questions, they let me pass, with advice: “Walking is good for health.”It's a two-km trek in the sun from there. Inside the village, a deathly silence prevails. There are no loitering people, no children, no chatter. Only cops. It's a village virtually under siege. Some distance away, the lush green fields taper into the dusty brown of settlements. It’s where the victim’s family lives. It’s easy to find the house — follow the trail of boots on the ground. The place looks like a police outpost. A convoy of five cars zooms past us. It’s the SIT, on its way out, possibly after another round of conversation with the family. It’s supposed to do that today (Wednesday). There are some 10-12 women cops posted nearby. “For security,” they say. There’s a lot that has been done for that here. There are metal detectors at the entrance. It’s time for another round of ID checks by two women constables. And it's more than just the regular questioning — each person entering must provide their name, phone number, address and organisation’s name in a register. A man, not in uniform, lingers. There are many like him, cops in plainclothes, who have converged around the house. Every movement, that of the family and their visitors, is under their intense gaze. When I had been there a few days ago, the cattle shed had four buffaloes. They are gone now. No one knows where. The family is having breakfast, rudely interrupted by our arrival. But the victim’s brother speaks to us without seeming hassled. The house is milling with cops. “It is for their safety,” police officers there repeated. When an elderly woman in the house needed to use the toilet, she had to wait until a woman constable could escort her. The silence is suddenly broken. A car has somehow managed to get past the barricade and made it to the victim's house. A confused commotion and angry warning later — “gaadi bandh kar doongi (I will shut your car down)” — the driver is allowed to enter the village as I leave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hathras-is-a-village-under-siege-where-cctvs-and-buffaloes-jostle-for-attention/articleshow/78540504.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
October 8, 2020||Goa||‘Sustainable urban devpt can help poor’||Panaji: Well-planned and well-governed cities which are resilient and sustainable, will help address poverty, social disconnect and spatial inequality while also contributing to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, said the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) – Goa.Speaking on the occasion of World Architect’s Day, chairman of IIA – Goa Manguesh Prabhugaonkar said that effective urban policies can ensure that all residents have access to essential services, shelter and recreational space. “Resilient and sustainable urban development can have a positive impact on development and deliver improved living conditions with well-planned urbanization, environmental protection and economic growth,” said Prabhugaonkar.Prabhugaonkar said that the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that disasters affect the poorest and vulnerable populations disproportionately as they often lack access to clean water, air and even personal space. Projections show that 90% of India’s urban growth is likely to happen in the next 30 years and after 2050 around 70% of the world’s population will be living in urban areas.The architects’ body recommends a balance between natural and ecologically-sensitive resources within urban areas, particularly water bodies and green cover that is under threat due to urbanisation. IIA – Goa also called for better transport infrastructure including revival of waterways and other eco-friendly options.“Its time for us to review, re-adapt and co-invent urban design and architecture with an objective to better quality of life for everyone and make our communities strong, safe, equitable and affordable,” said Prabhugaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sustainable-urban-devpt-can-help-poor/articleshow/78543055.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Bhubaneswar||Illness anxiety disorder takes people of all age-groups in its grip||BHUBANESWAR: The outbreak of Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on people’s lives. Such is the fear of catching the infection that a large number of people are frequently getting their body temperatures and oxygen levels checked apart, of course, from using sanitisers excessively, cleaning and wiping their homes several times in a day. Psychiatrists are flooded with complaints of illness anxiety disorder from people triggered by the life-threatening virus and post-Covid complications. “We have noticed many changes in the behaviour of my father since the outbreak of the pandemic. Neither has he stepped out of home for the last six months, nor does he like people coming to our house. God forbid if someone comes, he immediately starts wiping the places s/he touched. He keeps a close watch on any slight change in his health and measures his body temperature and oxygen levels frequently,” said Arabinda Panda, an IT professional. His father is 71-year old, is diabetic and also has heart problems. Such behavioural changes are being noticed in people of all age-groups. Debansh Sahu, an employee of a private company, said, “After a colleague tested Covid positive, I grew panicky thinking what if I have also contracted the virus. I did not come out of home for a week, started using sanitisers more frequently than before, wearing two to three masks and taking multi-vitamins.” Psychiatrists said there has been a significant rise in such patients. “Complaints of illness anxiety disorder has gone up to 60-70%. Anyone showing even a minor symptom or no symptom at all is also thinking that he or she has Covid and starts going for tests repeatedly. Those with pre-existing anxiety disorder or having friends/relatives, who have tested positive, are more prone to this,” Dr Suvendu Narayan Mishra, department of psychiatry at Sum Hospital and secretary of Indian Psychiatry Society, Odisha branch, said. Explaining the illness, doctors said it is the fear a person feels beyond the normal risk factor. “Taking precautions like wearing a mask, using sanitiser and washing hands are common and good habits to keep the virus away. But if a person does it more than the normal level, it causes anxiety. If this anxiety continues for a longer period in a person, it can lead to mental illness,” Dr S K Padhy, additional professor at AIIMS-Bhubaneswar, said. He added that the anxiety may be caused owing to lack of knowledge, wrong information or processing of information in a wrong way. “In case of such patients, we have to identify the gap in knowledge, address the issue, create awareness through proper counselling and ask them to relax,” Padhy said. Doctors advised such people to divert their attention from Covid and engage in other things. “The best way is to keep your mind away from corona and not to go by the number of deaths and infections caused due to it. Not speaking about the disease with people and instead developing some hobbies like listening to music, watch films on TV, doing yoga, pranayama and light exercises can do them a world of good. Think positive and don’t lose confidence,” Dr Rakesh Mohanty, assistant professor at department of psychiatry at Sum Hospital here, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/illness-anxiety-disorder-takes-people-of-all-age-groups-in-its-grip/articleshow/78541662.cms||Minati Singha
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyacinth removal taken up in lakes in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Government authorities are in an overdrive clearing hyacinth from several lakes, including Kapra and Annarayuni Cheruvu. Residents are happy with the restoration work. Municipal commissioner Nagaram Vani Reddy said labourers had worked on hyacinth removal for the last 15 days. “The work was finally completed. The machine was provided by the HMDA. We plan to further augment the lake,” Vani Reddy said. Prashant Mamidala, who has been working on the Annarayuni lake, said: “After one of the local community members tweeted to MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar, we got the floating trash collector machine at Annarayuni Cheruvu. We are now planning to build wetland islands in the lake.” He added that volunteers were asking the irrigation department to mark the full tank level of the lake so that its boundaries can be protected. At Kapra lake, similar efforts are under way. “Almost 50% of the hyacinth has been removed,” said CS Chandrasekhar, secretary, Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad (FNECS). At Shadnagar lake, volunteers have taken up clearing of the hyacinth. Madhulika Choudhary, founder of Dhruvansh, said: “We have incorporated many ideas where workers do not have to venture into the water and hyacinth can be removed completely.” She did not have much hope on the floating trash collector, saying they are expensive and do not work well in shallow waters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyacinth-removal-taken-up-in-lakes/articleshow/78543026.cms||Uttara Varma
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Growth potential for warehousing clusters in top India cities||HYDERABAD: India’s focus on becoming a global manufacturing hub has unlocked a huge growth potential for warehousing clusters not just in top cities but also in tier 2 and 3 centres, a joint report by Anarock Group and Binswanger Commercial Real Estate Services of US said. “Most of these emerging clusters are aligned with the industrial and freight corridors being developed in the country. The emerging tier 2 and 3 warehousing clusters include Ludhiana, Ambala, Lucknow, Siliguri, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Vishakhapatnam, Vijaywada, Coimbatore, Kochi, Nagpur, Indore, Jaipur and Dholera,” said the report. It also pointed out that currently industrial areas spread over 75,000 acres are planned across top cities, including the 19,333-acre Pharma City and 12,635-acre Zaheerabad NIMZ in Hyderabad. Also, policies like National Manufacturing Policy, Make in India and self-reliant India and incentives like reduced corporate tax rates are giving manufacturing and thereby warehousing a boost. Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO, Anarock Capital said that though a chunk of the over 110 million sq ft of Grade A warehousing stock available across the country is concentrated in the top eight cities, a massive opportunity for Grade A warehousing development is also opening up in smaller cities as e-commerce and 3PL players fuel the demand. “E-commerce will flourish in the post-Covid era, giving an edge to online businesses, which will eventually boost new warehousing demand,” Jeff Binswanger, managing partner, Binswanger International said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/growth-potential-for-warehousing-clusters/articleshow/78543049.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Sewerage system maintenance back with GHMC||HYDERABAD: In a blow to the reputation of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), the government reverted the handling of sewerage system at the peripheral municipal circles to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). In this regard the municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) department issued GO 449. “Based on several representations from the public representatives, the operation of the sewerage system has been reverted to the GHMC. Regular maintenance will be done by GHMC with its own staff as it was done before March 2020,” the GO said. In fact, the state government had transferred the operation of the entire sewerage network in 66 GHMC fringe areas to the water board. It was also decided to extend financial support of Rs 8.3 crore per month to the HMWS&SB for a period of five years. The salaries of around 600 employees were paid from this amount. However, in view of the upcoming GHMC polls, the local MLA and corporators urged MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao to revert these works to the GHMC. The leaders were upset as they received several complaints that the water board was unable to solve the sewerage problems. The water board officials cited fund crunch as the reason for not being able to maintain the civic body’s sewerage system. “In view of this decision taken by the government, GHMC has to conduct a fresh survey on the functioning of the sewerage system and prepare an estimation,” a Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sewerage-system-maintenance-back-with-ghmc/articleshow/78543031.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Nashik||Proposal to repair British-era canals||Nashik: The Nashik irrigation division (NID) of the Maharashtra water resources department (WRD) has proposed repairs to the 110-year-old Godavari left bank and right bank canals that provide water for drinking and agricultural purposes to parts of Nashik, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad districts.“This is phase-3 of the developmental works being proposed for the repairs of the old structures. We have proposed repairs to 60 works that include strengthening and widening of arched aqueducts of the canals at an estimated cost of Rs 85 crore,” NID executive engineer Sagar Shinde said on Wednesday.The canals originate from the Nandurmadhyameshwar pick-up weir in Niphad taluka of Nashik district on the Godavari river. The 110km right bank canal (RBC) provides water to Niphad, Sinnar, talukas of Nashik and Kopargaon, Rahata (Shirdi municipal council) and Shreerampur in Ahmednagar district. The 90km left bank canal (LBC) takes water to Niphad and Yeola in Nashik district and Vaijapur in Aurangabad district. “In all there are 364 structures that include crossings and arched aqueducts on both the canals that were built by the British. All of these have become weak and also need expansion to increase the flow of water considering the rise demand,” said Shinde. The repair works were proposed a decade ago and 74 works at a cost of Rs 11.31 crore in the first phase and 47 worth Rs 6.64 crore in the second phase have been carried out so far. Of the remaining 243 works, 60 structures need urgent repairs. The proposal has been presented to the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) to be forwarded to the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/proposal-to-repair-british-era-canals/articleshow/78540521.cms||Abhilash Botekar
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||6 months to turn jheel free of pollution: NGT||KOLKATA: The National Green Tribunal granted six more months to put things in place so that Santragachhi Jheel, a notified bird sanctuary, becomes pollution free. The waterbody, a biodiversity hotspot, attracts a large number of migratory birds every winter. NGT asked authorities such as South Eastern Railway, Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) to set up a sewage treatment plant (STP) so that no untreated sewage gets into the waterbody. NGT bench of Justice S P Wangdi (judicial member) and Dr Nagin Nanda (expert member) earlier observed that the Jheel is badly encroached, filled up and a dump yard for municipal wastes. Environment crusader Subhas Datta, who filed the case in 2016, said, “More than STP, what the lake now requires is diversion of the sewage lines through a garland drainage system so that the effluents don’t get into the waterbody. I, however, noted that HMC has been very proactive off-late to resolve this long-standing issue.” A land in the railway estate has already been identified to set up a STP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/6-mnths-to-turn-jheel-free-of-pollution-ngt/articleshow/78543030.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Goa||After spate of deaths, animal activists demand action against poisoning of dogs||Panaji: The spate of dog deaths along Goa’s coastal belt has prompted animal activists in the state to write to the government requesting for action on the matter. In a letter addressed to the DGP of Goa Police and the North Goa district collector, People for Animals (PFA) Goa, has reported a total of 25 street and owner dog deaths, suspected to have been killed by poisoning. “In the past six weeks, over three different instances of mass dog poisoning have been reported from the Arambol village area, and the surroundings of the nearby fresh water lake,” the letter signed by Alok Hisarwala Gupta read. Stating that these are not isolated incidents, the letter goes on to say that in the past few years, other dogs too have been found dead from suspected cases of poisoning in the vicinity of Arambol. “To put an end to this menace, it is critical that cases of dog poisoning in Arambol are investigated on a war footing. Killing of dogs, or for that matter any animal, in this manner, is a criminal offence both under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860,” the letter read. People for Animals (PFA) Goa has demanded that the Arambol police take immediate cognisance of the cases and begin an investigation. They have also demanded that a dedicated police officer and government veterinarian be deputed to ensure timely recording of deaths and medical investigations that are critical in proving the allegation of poisoning. They have also requested for immediate training of police and government veterinarian staff on laws and procedures to efficiently prosecute animal cruelty cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-spate-of-deaths-animal-activists-demand-action-against-poisoning-of-dogs/articleshow/78543069.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Telangana HC portal to host status of criminal cases registered against politicos||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court will soon host a website that will keep citizens informed about the status of the criminal cases registered against former and current legislators. The website will classify cases based on the agency that registered them. For instance, all cases by CBI and being tried by a court hearing CBI cases will be shown as a special category. Similarly, cases by ACB will form a group. Criminal cases tried in special court will constitute another category. It can be recalled that the Supreme Court had directed the high court a few days ago to ensure trials in legislator cases are not unduly hampered and completed in an expeditious manner. The high court has already geared up its mechanism at the district judiciary to follow the mandate given by the SC. The state government too has appointed a nodal officer to coordinate between state police and trial courts for ensuring smooth functioning at all levels as trial courts are now expected to hear these cases on a daily basis. MA Bari, an additional SP rank officer from Hyderabad city police, was deputed for the purpose, sources said. The website will also have details of stay orders issued by the HC. Chief Justice of Telangana high court may soon take up all such stayed cases, if the prosecution files any stay vacate petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-portal-to-host-status-of-criminal-cases-registered-against-politicos/articleshow/78543109.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chennai||AIADMK sets sail with captain Edappadi K Palaniswami; O Panneerselvam gets steering panel||CHENNAI: The AIADMK on Wednesday announced Edappadi K Palaniswami as chief minister candidate for the 2021 assembly election, an unusual exercise for a party once led by M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa, whose leadership was seldom challenged. The AIADMK conceded to the demand by deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam by constituting a steering or advisory committee and nominating 11 members to it. Both the moves mark milestones in the annals of the AIADMK, reiterating the dual nature of its leadership. The announcements put an end to wrangling between the EPS and OPS-led camps that had lasted several weeks. On Tuesday, the discussions that began in the morning after OPS returned from Theni picked up pace and went on till the early hours of Wednesday. After the formal announcement at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai around 9.45am, the leaders, accompanied by scores of partymen, left for the Marina to pay respects at the memorial of MGR and Jayalalithaa. Earlier in the day, Panneerselvam, flanked by ministers and senior leaders, declared that a consultative meeting chaired by party presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan, and attended by office-bearers of the headquarters, besides the newly appointed members of the steering committee, unanimously resolved to project Palaniswami as the chief minister candidate for the upcoming election. “I am happy to announce the party’s victorious candidate, joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami,” Panneerselvam said, evoking applause from the functionaries. Prior to the announcement, Palaniswami said the consultative meeting chaired by Madhusudhanan resolved to nominate the members of the steering committee. The members include ministers Dindigul C Sreenivasan, P Thangamani, S P Velumani, D Jayakumar, C Ve Shanmugam, R Kamaraj of the EPS camp, and former MLA J C D Prabhakar, former MPs P H Manoj Pandian, R Gopalakrishnan, former minister P Mohan and Sholavandan MLA K Manickam representing OPS camp. Neither was there a representation of women nor anyone from the Muslim community. The marathon discussions among the OPS and EPS groups culminated at 3am on Wednesday, after leaders struggled to give due representation to caste, religion and region. “The opposition’s dream (to seek political gains out of infighting in the ruling camp) will not materialise,” Panneerselvam told reporters, after announcing the CM candidate. The deputy CM said he had announced the party’s CM candidate happily. Later, in the evening, Palaniswami met Panneerselvam at the latter’s residence and thanked him for the gesture. At the party headquarters, Panneerselvam said former CM and DMK founder C N Annadurai scripted history as a common man reaching great heights. MGR founded the AIADMK as a people’s movement and won the assembly elections thrice to work for people and deliver several welfare measures. Later, Jayalalithaa steered the party for three decades, overcame the challenges thrown her way and took the party to heights that no rival could attain. “The dream of MGR was that the party and the government should remain in the hands of cadres, which is being realized now. We are running the party and government well,” OPS said. With the party planning to set up several committees in the run up to the polls, leaders said due representation would be given to those who were left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-sets-sail-with-captain-eps-ops-gets-steering-wheel/articleshow/78540538.cms||Julie Mariappan
October 8, 2020||Bhubaneswar||Robot to serve Covid patients at ECoR hospital||Bhubaneswar: The East Coast Railway (ECoR) Central Hospital at Mancheswar has deployed a robot ‘MeD ROBO’ to assist hospital staff to serve Covid patients and to assist in serving medicines and food without any need for physical contact. The robot is operated through a unique mobile app supported by Wi-Fi. The robot’s sensor can read a patient’s body temperature and transmit the same for display on the mobile phone. If it detects high-temperature, the robot can raise an alarm so that hospital staff immediately attends to the patient. This robot has been developed by ECoR. It underwent extensive trials and demonstrations before deployment at the Central Railway Hospital. It has a remote-controlled driving unit, night vision camera with two-way speaker, circuit for sensor-based hand sanitizer unit, stainless steel trays, thermal scanner, timer based UVC sanitizer box and one kilovolt ampere (KVA) backup power. The robot can carry around 15 kg of items and can be controlled by remote from 30-40 feet. “The camera has a speaker facility, so doctor/nursing staff can interact with the patient and can advise accordingly. The movement of the camera to view from different angles can be controlled through mobile/desktop,” said an ECoR official. The sensor-based sanitizing unit attached with the machine can be used by staff and patient. The UVC sanitizer box inside the machine can sanitize items that can fit inside. Frontline workers can sanitize personal belongings before leaving the hospital or ward. Patients can keep their hands below the thermal scanner for a few seconds and their body temperature will reflect on the indicator. In this way, temperature can be detected.

October 8, 2020||Goa||PWD agrees to protect Chimbel heritage chapel||Panaji: Following protests from Chimbel villagers, the public works department (PWD) on Tuesday decided to drop plans for demolition of the compound wall of the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception chapel. Locals had begun protesting after the compound wall was demarcated for demolition last week for construction of a service road. On Tuesday, PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, Santa Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes and PWD engineers inspected the site. Another location was identified nearby to construct the service road without affecting the chapel or compound wall. Locals had objected to the service road as it was less than two meters away from the chapel, which, according to villagers, is a heritage structure. They said vibrations from vehicles could damage the heritage chapel. “The PWD minister has said that not an inch of the compound wall will be touched. The MLA’s statement has been recorded that not an inch of the chapel will be affected and we take his word. I hope it is true. It is a centuries-old chapel and every part of it needs to be protected,” said activist and lawyer Aires Rodrigues. The chapel is more than 400 years old and it is a heritage monument and it should be the government’s first priority to protect it, said former Santa Cruz MLA Victor Gonsalves. Pauskar said that it will be ensured that people are not affected by any of the ongoing highway expansion work. “Earlier road marked had space for a 40-mt wide road. As per the new location marked for the road, it will be 27mt wide, as per availability of land,” said the PWD minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-agrees-to-protect-chimbel-heritage-chapel/articleshow/78543058.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||Ghumar Mandi shopkeepers close shops in protest against MC notices||LUDHIANA: The shopkeepers in Ghumar Mandi came on road to stage a protest against the municipal corporation for issuing notices for depositing the change of land use (CLU) fee for their commercial establishments, on Wednesday. They kept their shops closed from 10am to 2pm in protest against the civic body action. The MC had recently started issuing the notices to commercial establishments which were without permission. Over 1,600 notices have been served in the entire city. The Ghumar Mandi Shopkeepers Association members showed resentment against the civic body by staging a protest in the market and demanded that the authorities concerned should take back these notices. The shopkeepers claimed that their shops were not constructed recently and were rather very old, but even then notices were being served to them. They also rued the fact that during the pandemic it was not possible for them to pay CLU charges on the basis of the current rate. These shopkeepers will have to pay CLU charges at the rate of Rs 5,700 per sq yd. They claimed that they had requested mayor Balkar Sandhu, along with area councillor and officials, to roll back this decision and the mayor had even assured them of providing the desired relief. He had even claimed of conducting a house meeting over this issue. They rued the fact that the mayor did not call any meeting till date even when the matter was very sensitive and the officials had now started sealing the shops. They claimed if the MC did not stop the sealing exercise, they would have to start an agitation on a large scale. On the other hand, the civic body officials claimed that shopkeepers who were served the notices had started coming for the payment of CLU and those who were protesting were only misleading other shopkeepers and they were trying to bring losses to the public exchequer. Over a month has passed since the MC officials had started serving the notices to commercial establishments in the entire city. As soon as the notices were served the BJP councillors showed resentment and after that even a few Congress leaders also asked the mayor to roll back the decision. The leaders claimed that the government should support people at this time when their businesses had suffered a lot after the pandemic and this burden would only add to their woes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ghumar-mandi-shopkeepers-close-shops-in-protest-against-mc-notices/articleshow/78541667.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||MC asks religious places to ban use of plastic goods, thermocol||LUDHIANA: Ahead of the upcoming festival season, the civic body has made an appeal to religious places for avoiding usage of plastic carry bags and products and thermocol on their premises, and should rather use utensils for serving langar on special occasions. The officials are visiting various gurdwaras and temples asking the management committees to follow the guidelines and also encourage the devotees who come to temple or gurdwara for prayers. The officials claimed that they wanted to declare religious places as plastic-free zones and for that reason this exercise was going on. It is under the Swachhta Survekshan programme that this drive was kicked off on October 2 and the officials visited temples and gurdwaras at various locations like Baba Balak Nath temple and Gurdwara Ramgarhia Sahib in Vishwakarma chowk, Gurdwara Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib in Hargobind Nagar, etc. The civic body officials requested the heads of these places to avoid using thermocol in temples and gurdwaras while they serve food to the devotees because it was very harmful for the environment and there was no way to dispose it. Moreover, sometimes people organise religious functions in their homes as well, so the civic body officials have asked the heads of these places to keep steel utensils on their premises and ask people to take these from them for serving food instead of using thermocol. Chief sanitary inspector Jagjit Singh said, “We have visited many religious places with this motive, so that they could help us in reducing the usage of plastic carry bags or other harmful products.” He said they were making an appeal to public as well that they should not use the plastic carry bags whenever they go for shopping anywhere. He said they could become successful only when people would support the civic body. The MC officials have already made plans to bring a resolution in the MC general house to impose ban on thermocol and one-time use plastic products. Though it is taking time to call a house meeting on this, but they have started their practice to encourage people for avoiding the usage of these to a great extent. It will be seen whether religious heads will help the civic body in achieving the target or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-asks-religious-places-to-ban-use-of-plastic-goods-thermocol/articleshow/78541689.cms||---

Priests and others led by the spirituality wing of BJP on Wednesday discussed the future course of action for the opening of temples. Tushar Bhosale, the head of the spirituality wing, said as the government has not reopened temples though liquor shops are open, a decision has been taken to stage a state-wide hunger strike on October 13 in front of all the temples across the state to put pressure on the government to reopen the same. “But the government has failed to provide any relief to the people who want some sort of mental relief by visiting temples,” said Bhosale.. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bjp-calls-for-agitation-to-open-temples/articleshow/78540545.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||Physical hearing of cases in district court may resume soon||LUDHIANA: The physical hearing of some cases may start in a few days after District Bar Association (DBA) members met the sessions judge on Wednesday. Besides, the registrar general of the Punjab and Haryana high court has written a letter to the district and sessions judges, saying that physical appearance may be allowed in certain cases on the basis of own assessment of the prevailing local conditions. Secretary DBA, Sham Sunder Ahuja said that their members met the sessions judge on Wednesday to discuss the issue of physical appearance in certain cases. He added that they hope that physical hearing of cases of compromise, new and old cases where final arguments are to be held (with the consent of both parties) and one side matter, where either the state is involved or matters are ex-parte, might begin soon. Secretary of the DBA said that the official order had to be issued by the sessions judge. He added that as the cases wherein the accused come to mark their presence were already exempted, it is expected that 70% of rush will decrease. He added that they had already advised the advocates to follow norms related to Covid-19, including social distancing, wearing of masks, etc. Meanwhile, the registrar general, Punjab and Haryana high court, has written a letter to the district and sessions judges of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh about the matter. It has been suggested that the Chief Justice has ordered that the district and sessions judges in the two states and the union territory, keeping in view the urgencies, apart from virtual hearing and in addition to the matters already being taken up through physical hearing, may, where the counsel for all parties give their consent to appear for physical hearing, permit physical hearing in criminal trials where accused is/are in custody, matrimonial cases, compromise matters, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal (MACT ) cases, those under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act or in any other matter. “This shall, however, be resorted to subject to your own assessment of the prevailing local conditions, including the intensity of the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. The guidelines/health advisories and other SOPs issued by the government of India and the respective state governments from time to time shall be strictly followed,” the letter read. The advocates are happy at the development. “Advocates are facing hardships due to the long lockdown as the physical appearance remained suspended. We hope that physical appearance is allowed in certain cases, where there is no crowding, so that advocates also earn their livelihood,” said Amit Tandon, a senior advocate at the district courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/physical-hearing-of-cases-in-district-court-may-resume-soon/articleshow/78541679.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Triangular contest likely in Dubbak||HYDERABAD: It is likely to be a triangular contest in the Dubbak by-poll between TRS, Congress and BJP. Election Commission will issue a notification on October 9 inviting nominations. Solipeta Sujatha, wife of late S Ramalinga Reddy, is the ruling TRS candidate, while Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, son of late Ch Mutyam Reddy, Congress candidate. Both of them are contesting assembly elections for the first time. Chief Minister and TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday handed over the party’s B-form to TRS candidate Solipeta Sujatha for the Dubbak bypoll. BJP candidate Raghunandan Rao is a senior, who has contested Dubbak in 2018 and 2014, and ended up third on both occasions. While the TRS has won the elections in 2014 and 2018, Congress’ recent victory was in 2009. Congress has taken it up as a challenge to win Dubbak against the backdrop of the party having won this seat only once in the last 32 years. Congress biggies, including TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, MPs A Revanth Reddy and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, AICC secretary V Hanumanth Rao and other senior leaders, hit the campaign trail in Dubbak constituency on Wednesday, two days before the process of nominations is set to commence. State finance minister T Harish Rao has been appealing to the voters of Dubbak to hand over a humiliating defeat to Congress and the BJP. “This time the majority of the TRS candidate should be over one lakh and candidates of all the other parties should lose their deposits,” he said, while welcoming some local leaders of Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party into the TRS fold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/triangular-contest-likely-in-dubbak/articleshow/78543096.cms||Roushan Ali

The directive was issued through a letter sent to these establishments on Tuesday and they have been given a three-day window to get the tests done voluntarily. To address the economy-related concerns, the state government has gradually started relaxing the lockdown norms and as part of the same, the hotel industry has been granted conditional permission. From March 18, the district administration had imposed a ban on the operatilng restaurants, hotels and bars across Aurangabad. It was only in the first week of June that the restaurants and hotels were allowed to open but only for takeaway orders. Aurangabad district has around 275 bars, out of which 175 alone are in the Aurangabad city. There are about 600 restaurants in the district and around 200 of them are in Aurangabad city limits. “The hotel industry has been asked to undergo Covid screening so that these places do not become fresh source of spreading the infection,” Pandey said. Though he remained mum on the action against those failing to undergo screening, civic officials have warned of action against those failing to undergo test and askd to allow only Covid-19 negative staffers to work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hotel-bar-restaurant-staff-in-aurangabad-must-be-tested/articleshow/78540555.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Agra||Covid-positive Delhi AAP MLA booked for visiting Hathras||HATHRAS: Delhi AAP MLA Kuldeep Kumar has been booked for flouting Covid-19 protocol and paying a visit to the family of the alleged gang-rape and murder victim in Hathras even after testing positive for the coronavirus. The Kondli MLA, however, has claimed that he went to meet the victim's kin only after he tested negative for the virus. According to police, Kumar had tested positive for Covid-19 on September 29 and was supposed to be in home isolation, but he met the family on October 4. An FIR was registered against the legislator on Tuesday at Chandpa police station on the basis of one of his tweets in which he had mentioned that he had tested positive for the virus. Kumar has been booked for violating prohibitory orders and under section 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and the Disaster Management Act, 2005. In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday, Kumar said he visited Hathras after testing negative for Covid-19. “This is a false propaganda by BJP leaders and their IT cell to save the accused,” he alleged in the video while holding a report which he claimed was his Covid-negative certificate. Meanwhile, two FIRs have been registered against Congress leader Shyoraj Jivan in Aligarh and Hathras for allegedly trying to incite caste riots through provocative statements. The leader of the Valmiki community had purportedly said that “if anyone dares to look at girls from our community, we will gouge their eyes out and chop off their hands.” Jivan was booked along with two others under section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups ), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC on Wednesday at Gandhi Park police station by Aligarh police. Hathras police had also lodged an FIR against him two days ago under 153-A and other relevant sections. A notice has been served to him to appear at Chandpa police station on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/covid-positive-delhi-aap-mla-booked-for-violating-home-isolation-visiting-hathras/articleshow/78540556.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The metal detector that has been propped up looks out of place, awkward even, as one walks through it past buffaloes and dung, into a place that has just two doors and is open almost on every side.

October 8, 2020||Nashik||Antigen & RT-PCR testing at PHC level||Nashik: Nashik’s district health office (DHO) has distributed antigen testing kits to taluka-level officials, who will be conducting tests of the suspected patients of Covid at primary health centres (PHC). According to Dr Kapil Aher, the district health officer, this decision has been taken considering some suspected patients do not turn up in Covid Care Centre (CCC) or a fever clinic after being referred. According to the officer, “The antigen kits have been sent to talukas where the health officer is responsible for drawing up a plan to check suspected patients of Covid, PCH wise, with antigen and RT-PCR tests so patients can be tested and treated immediately.” Many times, people with Covid symptoms or close contacts of Covid patient failed to turn up to CCC after being referred. “To fix this, antigen and RT-PCR tests will be available at PHCs. The health workers with the lab technicians will go to the PHC on a specific day in a village so people do not have to travel for tests and thus ensure there is no spread of the disease on their way in case they are infected, nor can they skip the tests for any invalid reason,” Aher said. People from containment zones and high-risk contacts of the Covid patients, showing no symptoms will undergo antigen testing while those with symptoms will undergo RT-PCR test. The test at PHC will be designed periodically so there is a frequent visit of the health teams with lab technicians to carry out the tests on particular days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/antigen-rt-pcr-testing-at-phc-level/articleshow/78540597.cms||Abhilash Botekar
October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||‘People in Indore support MC in solid waste management’||LUDHIANA: This industrial town which is struggling hard to solve the mess of solid waste through proper management and other related issues can get a breather if the MC goes ahead and follows the model being adopted by the Indore MC. A delegation of the civic body had gone on a tour to Indore for studying the system in Indore, which has remained on the first position in the past Swachhta Survekshan rankings of the Union government. The members of the delegation claimed that strong political will power and public support could help in achieving the target here. One of the members of the delegation and Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran said, “Both cities are almost same in size and the quantum of garbage being produced daily and even garbage management system is similar, but the only difference is positive attitude of people.” He said the MC was handling door-to-door garbage collection at its level in Indore while a solid waste management plant was being run by a private firm and segregation of dry and wet waste was a must at public level. He said in Indore people were supporting the civic body in handling the waste. “Not only garbage collection, but there is also a construction and demolition waste plant, and markets and other areas are so clean that Indore deserves to be at first place,” he said while adding that if public helps and officials work sincerely, then here also they can implement similar things effectively. Secretary of MC Jasdev Sekhon said, “We had gone to Indore in our private vehicles, so it was easier to travel in the city. On the first day we travelled with MC officials and visited the plants for garbage and construction debris management. On the second day, we moved on our own for reality check. But we did not find even a single flaw.” He said the public in Indore was so cooperative and they love their city, that was why they had performed so well in rankings. He claimed that NGOs in Indore were helping the authorities in managing things and now the situation was such that people called NGO members for complaints. As per the delegation members, in Indore, there are 85 wards and for garbage collection it is divided into 19 zones. Each zone comprises three-four wards. Indore MC has 473 garbage collection vehicles with GPS controlled system. Total garbage collection in Indore is 800 metric tonne. Garbage collected from houses is segregated. From houses the garbage reaches 10 small garbage collection centres and then to main garbage recycling plant managed by a private firm. Indore MC is earning Rs 1.25 crore-Rs 2 crore annually from this private firm as the company recycles the waste and sells it to industries. Indore has one construction and demolition waste plant also, where debris collected from the entire city are first crushed and then it is turned into road tiles and MC uses those tiles for construction of road. It has Asia’s largest vegetable market, where every vendor has installed two dust bins for dry and wet waste. Waste collected from this market goes to biomethanisation plant, where bio-methane gas is produced and it is used as fuel in buses plying in the city. Besides, there is a complete ban on plastic use. Not even a single illegal hoarding is allowed in the city. In Ludhiana, the MC has hired A2Z waste management company for solid waste management and door-to-door garbage collection but informal sector has taken over garbage collection. Ludhiana generates 900 to 1,100 metric tonne of garbage daily. Besides, there is almost nil waste segregation at homes. The MC is paying money to a private firm for garbage lifting from dumps and then its management. Moreover, there is just a partial ban on plastic carry bags and poor implementation. The city in comparison is full of illegal hoardings. Previous visits did not find any implementation in city The previous visits made by MC officials to various cities, however, could not lead to any better results for the city. Recently, a team of officials and councillors had gone to Vallore for a similar motive. But not even a single thing was implemented her after that visit. Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran, who was in the delegation which visited Vallore, claimed that as compared to Ludhiana, Vallore was a small town, so it was difficult to find similarities between the two cities. But better planning can help in adopting certain good things from Indore in Ludhiana, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/people-in-indore-support-mc-in-solid-waste-management/articleshow/78541733.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Aurangabad||55-year-old man gets bail in minor’s rape case||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has granted bail to a 55-year-old man accused and arrested on charges of raping a 17-year-old girl and impregnating her. Justice VK Jadhav, while placing reliance on Nirbhaya Case, took cognizance of the fact that the DNA of the foetus did not match with that of the accused following which the conditional bail was granted. The accused had been behind bars for the past one year after being arrested for raping his sister-in-law. Representing the accused, lawyer Abhaysinh Bhosale said the girl was five months pregnant at the time of registration of offence in September 2019. “The foetus was aborted and DNA samples of the girl, foetus and the accused person were collected. The DNA sample of the foetus did not match with that of the accused, raising serious questions on the girl naming the correct accused in the case,” he said. The lawyer also cited observations made by the Supreme Court in the Nirbhaya case and contested that when DNA is treated as clinching evidence in such cases, the same should be applied when the DNA report comes as negative. Justice Jadhav ruled: “A positive result of the DNA test would constitute clinching evidence against the accused. However, if the result of the test is negative i.e. favouring the accused or if DNA profiling had not been done in a given case, the weight of the other materials and evidence on record will still have to be considered.” He added: “In the current case, though the victim has specifically taken the name of the accused as a person who has performed the sexual intercourse with her in the darkness of the night. However, considering the scientific accuracy of the DNA report, the applicant has made out a case for bail. It is for the trial Court to consider the statement of the victim and her mother along with the negative DNA report and decide the case on its own merit. However, since the DNA report is negative. the case is made out to grant bail to the applicant.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/55-yr-old-man-gets-bail-in-minors-rape-case/articleshow/78540594.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Unable to bear this and fearing social ignominy, the survivor’s father committed suicide by consuming poison on September 30. Police said the accused, Ashwin Vadhia (25), had raped the 17-year-old survivor six months ago at knife point after barging into her house. One and a half months ago, he again raped the survivor at knife point. Vadhia threatened to kill the brother and father of the survivor if she complained about the incident. “After the girl’s father came to know about the crime, he feared social infamy and consumed pesticides on September 28. He died at GG Hospital in Jamnagar on September 30. After this, the survivor lodged the complaint against Vadhia on Tuesday night,” said an official from Jamjodhpur police station. The police have booked Vadhia under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and sections 376 (2) (N) and 506 (2) of the Indian Penal Code, dealing with rape and criminal intimidation.

October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Some Bengal theatres may reopen with festival of Sushant Singh movies||KOLKATA: Sushant Singh Rajput’s ‘Kedarnath’ is going to be one of the Bollywood movies that will bail out Bengal theatres, which are worried over the unavailability of Hindi movies, once they reopen on October 15/16. The news came on a day when actress Rhea Chakrabarty got bail from the Bombay High Court in a drug case that emerged from investigations into Rajput’s death. In fact, sources say that some theatres are also toying with the idea of reopening with a festival of Rajput’s films. Satadeep Saha, distributor of ‘Kedarnath’ and ‘Sonchiriya’, said: “I have called up the producer and got the permission regarding re-release of these movies on October 15. I have already confirmed five cinemas, including Banirupa (Berachampa), Rupmandir (Belghoria) and Puspashree (Kadamtala). Though I can re-release both ‘Kedarnath’ and ‘Sonchiriya’, I will not want any competition between the two and will release one after another.” Incidentally, SVF Entertainment was the Bengal distributor of ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’ and ‘Chhichhore’. Mahendra Soni, founder director of SVF Entertainment, is “awaiting response from Mumbai” regarding the re-release of these movies. Kushagra Jalan, who is agent of Yashraj Films in Bengal and had distributed ‘Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!’ and ‘Sudh Deshi Romance’, said: “If cinemas want to host a festival with these movies, they will have to approach us either individually or collectively. We will seek permissions from the copyrights holders of the film. I am sure they will allow that gladly.” New Empire hasn’t ruled out the idea of reopening with SSR’s films. Amit Sengupta, manager of Humayan Properties Ltd which runs New Empire, said, “We will open on October 16. Till October 20, we will screen some recent Hindi releases. We might screen a Sushant Singh Rajput film too. Talks are on to re-release ‘Dil Bechara’ that had got an OTT release earlier.” However, Paradise is not keen to reopen with an old Hindi release or a Bengali film. “This was conveyed at a meeting of exhibitors on Wednesday at the office of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA). Majority of the halls in Bengal are reopening on October 15/16. We have also decided to allow exhibitors to take a call on when they wish to reopen and with what content,” said Ratan Saha, the chairman of the distributors’ section of EIMPA. Arun Mehra, director of Bengal Properties Private Ltd, which runs Paradise, is ready to wait now. “There aren’t any Hindi films. Bengali films don’t work at our theatre. We don’t see any motivation yet to reopen now. We will wait for Hindi products to come before we take a call on reopening,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-bengal-theatres-may-reopen-with-festival-of-sushant-movies/articleshow/78543124.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

October 8, 2020||Ludhiana||Covid effect: This year, Navaratras to remain low key affair||LUDHIANA: The Navaratras are around the corner and city temples are gearing up for the nine-day-long celebrations. But amid the pandemic the temple managements are also paying attention towards the required safety measures for devotees who will come to temple for prayers. Due to coronavirus, the celebrations will remain a low key affair with no large-scale programmes being organised. The devotees will be allowed to visit temples and pray but nobody will be allowed to sit for long inside the premises. Balbir Gupta of Durga Mata Mandir said, “We will decorate the temple as we do every time during the Navaratras and all rituals will take place in similar manner. The only difference will be that no chowkis or langar will be organised this time because we do not want to gather people.” He said mask would be mandatory for the visitors to the temple and inside the premises where idols are kept only priests will be allowed to do any rituals and nobody else. He said people could come, pray and go back but they would telecast live ‘aarti’ from temple every morning and evening so that people could watch it at their homes. Meanwhile, secretary of Navdurga Temple in Sarabha Nagar Anil Bassi said, “We have made arrangements for safe celebrations for the visitors as the temple is open to everybody, but safety measures will be taken care of strictly.” He said there were circles drawn in the temple and sanitisers had been placed at the entrance, so everybody would have to sanitise their hands first and then they could enter the temple and besides, masks would be essential. “We will depute security guards at the entrance for ensuring social distancing among the public,” he said while adding that this time there would be no chowkis of Goddess Durga like they were organising in previous years. Pardeep Dhall from Geeta Mandir, Vikas Nagar, said, “We will light up 108 lamps in the temple, which we have been doing earlier, but apart from that no major celebration will take place.” He said they do not want to take any chance with people trying to break social distancing norms as still the pandemic was not over, so precautions were a must. He said even devotees should understand that in April they could not even pray in temples during Navaratras as the pandemic had started, but now at least they could come to temples. So, they should try to maintain discipline and help temple managements in making arrangements, he maintained. Pandemic hits temple funds hard The pandemic has hit the cash collections at the temples hard as lesser number of visitors visited these temples in the past six months. Dhall of Geeta Mandir said they had to close down one homoeopathic dispensary, one stitching centre for poor girls and one computer centre on the temple premises as they could not manage their expenses. He said they had to reduce the staff in the temple as well as it was difficult to manage their salaries. Anil Bassi of Navdurga Temple in Sarabha Nagar said there were 34 trustees in the temple management and they had contributed Rs 11,000 each earlier and now again they all have contributed similar amount so that they could manage the expenses. He said temples get funds from devotees who come for prayers and when people did not come, then its impact was very obvious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/covid-effect-this-year-navaratras-to-remain-low-key-affair/articleshow/78541751.cms||---

The meeting, which has been called off multiple times, will be held after the first meeting of the Public Private Partnership steering committee at the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) office. Mopa airport authority’s board meeting has gained focus after Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte pointed out that GMR Goa is yet to pay the construction licence fee though it has started work on the project. A month ago, civil aviation minister Suresh Shanbhogue had said that the fees are under dispute and MADA would take a decision ‘shortly’ over the fees to be paid by GMR. Khaunte had said that GMR Goa had failed to pay Rs 49.3 crore as the construction licence fees, but the state government said that GGIAL has asked MADA to reduce the fees. The steering committee will also discuss the construction of the Goa Bhavan at Vashi in Mumbai, construction of the Panaji bus stand, solar power projects and GTDC’s convention centre. Several government departments are expected to present their plans for the selected PPP projects while also pin-pointing specific issues or problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/decision-soon-on-fee-for-mopaconstruction/articleshow/78543157.cms||---

A communique from the board said that the amount was donated by Reliance Industries Limited chairman Mukesh Ambani’s son Anant Ambani, who is a former member of the Badri-Kedar Temple Committee. The donation, officials said, will be used to augment the resources of the board and to pay salaries of employees. Meanwhile, two days after the limit of pilgrims allowed to visit the Char Dham shrines was increased from 800 to 3,000, the yatra has been picking up pace. The board said it has issued a total of 1,18,019 e-passes (mandatory to visit the temples) from July 1 to October 6 and around 66,000 people visited the Char Dham temples this year. Kedarnath, in particular, has been witnessing a large influx of devotees. To prevent an outbreak of the pandemic in the shrine town, the Rudraprayag district administration on Wednesday decided to conduct Covid tests of the chief priests and all those on duty at the temple every two weeks. “In addition to the tests, those on duty (at the shrine) will be changed on a rotational basis every fortnight. Devotees will also undergo thermal screening at the temple,” said Kedarnath chief medical officer Dr BK Shukla. He added the decision was taken after “alarming photos of devotees gathered in large numbers outside the temple, most not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing”, were circulated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ambanis-donate-rs-5-crore-to-uttarakhand-char-dham-devasthanam-board/articleshow/78540629.cms||Ishita Mishra
October 8, 2020||Nashik||Oxygen suppliers told to start supply to industries||Nashik: The District Industries Centre (DIC), Nashik, has directed oxygen manufacturers and suppliers in Nashik to supply oxygen cylinders to industries as per the demand.Around 116 industries have placed a demand for a total of 866 oxygen cylinders. The general manager of DIC Nashik has issued an order in this connection on Tuesday evening. The suppliers have already started supplying cylinders to industries from Wednesday morning. By noon, 78 cylinders were provided to industries, said general manager of DIC Nashik Satish Bhamre.Moreover, the DIC Nashik had also directed the suppliers to give only excess oxygen cylinders to industries after meeting the requirement for medical oxygen. Accordingly, the oxygen supply for industries has been started by the manufacturers and suppliers. “It is difficult right now to inform about the total number of oxygen cylinders supplied to industries on Wednesday. In fact, the complete report about the supply of cylinders to the industries for the last 24 hours is generated in the morning,” said Bhamre. The daily demand for oxygen cylinders is expected to be around 500 a day. “Presently, the production of the oxygen cylinders in Nashik is around 4,500 while the requirement for medical oxygen is around 4,000 cylinders per day,” Bhamre added.“We have also directed the oxygen manufacurers and suppliers to stop the supply of oxygen to industries in case there is shortage of medical oxygen,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/oxygen-suppliers-told-to-start-supply-to-industries/articleshow/78540630.cms||Tushar Pawar
October 8, 2020||Agra||Police trying to frame us with call detail records, say brothers of Hathras victim||HATHRAS: The 19-year-old Dalit girl’s family in Hathras denied being in touch with the man accused of raping and murdering her, and questioned the veracity of the purported call detail records (CDR) that showed 100 calls between them in five months. “It is a conspiracy against us,” the victim’s elder brother, whom the calls have been attributed to, told TOI on Wednesday. “The killers are cunning. They can do anything to save themselves.” He said the SIM had first been bought for his father 10 years ago. “But he would keep losing his phone. So, I used my ID to get the SIM registered in my name. The phone is always kept at home. Everyone has that one number, even the pradhan. It’s the only one we have.” He said it was mostly his father who used the phone. But he denied ever contacting the main accused, Sandeep, whose family lives across the road from the victim’s house. The victim’s younger brother, who works in Ghaziabad, said he would like evidence of the allegation. “UP Police is trying to frame us because we are poor. There is no end to our harassment … If they have records, they should have evidence. I would like to hear call recordings.” CDR documents time, duration, location, and destination number of calls made from a phone number. The family also addressed insinuations that the girl was involved with the accused. “Police are engaging in character assassination, projecting things incorrectly. My sister was under our supervision at all times. I have no doubt about her,” the victim’s eldest brother said. The younger brother, dismissing speculation that she may have made calls to the accused, added, “She was unlettered. She didn’t know how to dial a number on the phone. She could only receive calls.” Surveillance at the victim’s house was, meanwhile, stepped up further on Wednesday. The administration installed CCTV cameras outside the door to “monitor visitors”. A district official said the five security cameras were an “additional step to secure the victim’s family against anti-social elements.” On Tuesday, a metal detector had been installed outside the house. DIG (special inquiry) Shalabh Mathur visited Hathras in the evening to review the security arrangements and found them to be “adequate”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/police-trying-to-frame-us-with-call-detail-records-say-brothers-of-hathras-victim/articleshow/78540620.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Akash Kumar had lent Rs 20,000 to a few locals and now they were not returning it, police said. According to the deceased’s father Kishan Kumar, a hawker, “Five men took away my son on Tuesday evening and later his body was found in a pool of blood. This happened just a month after a local man Daga Singh had threatened me that he would kill my son. At that time my son had gone to Mumbai for some work. Daga and another person Jogender owed Rs 20,000 to my son and were not returning the money.”Additional superintendent of police (SP) Sarvesh Mishra said, “Five persons have been booked in an FIR. A probe is on. Money lending seems to be the cause of murder.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/youth-shot-dead-in-ups-hathras-a-month-after-he-got-death-threat/articleshow/78540656.cms||Sandeep Rai
October 8, 2020||Goa||Gogol enemy property valued by officials at several crores||Margao: The PWD has assessed the value of the buildings and structures that have come up over the 15,000sqm of land at Gogol, Margao, identified as ‘enemy property’ by the government of India, to be running into several crores of rupees. In its valuation report submitted to the office of the South Goa collector, the PWD has worked out the valuation of over 100 units — over 40 apartments, 30 shops, 19 residential bungalows and several commercial houses — which ranges from Rs 28,000 to Rs 80 lakhs, and has also suggested rents for the units. The Gogol land is among the 263 such enemy properties located across the state and nearly 16,000 across India. Upon the orders of the South Goa district administration, the PWD had recently conducted a survey of the Gogol enemy property with a view to carry out its valuation. Following the 1965 Indo-Pak war, properties belonging to Indians who had acquired Pakistani citizenship were considered as “enemy property” and came to be in possession of the Indian government. In Goa, many of the enemy properties are located in talukas of Bardez and Salcete, while a few lie in Tiswadi, Bicholim, and other parts of the state. In 2017, the home ministry had forwarded a list of enemy properties to both of Goa’s district collectors, directing them to collect lease rent from their occupants. However, while a few occupants had moved the court and succeeded in getting back possession of the properties, in case of others, the action was deferred anticipating resistance from the occupants that could lead to a law and order problem. The exercise was recently carried out under police cover at Gogol. In case of the Gogol property, a source pointed out, the original owner of the land, after migrating to Pakistan and acquiring its citizenship, granted power of attorney to a Goan in 1971. “Based on this power of attorney, the enemy property was sold to gullible parties. A deed of sale of the land was found to be registered in 1986,” the source said. While the valuation report will enable the authorities to fix rent in respect of the “enemy property”, sources pointed out that the occupants who had purchased the property by legal means, unaware of its enemy country link, could face a situation where they would have to pay rent to the government for the flat or shop or house “owned” by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gogol-enemy-property-valued-by-officials-at-several-crores/articleshow/78543162.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chennai||Madras HC scraps admission, 65 postgrad doctors lose degrees||CHENNAI: In a strong message, the Madras high court on Wednesday scrapped the admission of 65 postgraduate medical students, who have completed their courses, in six Puducherry-based institutions. In 2017-18, admission to PG medical courses in Puducherry were conducted through CENTAC (centralised admission committee) based on PG-NEET marks, but these institutions admitted 65 students on their own. “Mediocrity should never be encouraged, at least in medical education,” said Justice N Anand Venkatesh, adding: “It would be better even if some seats go unfilled and wasted rather than filling such seats with unmeritorious candidates.” It will lead to compromising the precious lives of the citizens of this country, he said. Justice Anand Venkatesh also imposed 5 lakh each as cost on six medical colleges/universities that had illegally admitted the students in the academic year 2017-18. The judge did not spare the high court too, and said, “this court also should take the blame for having taken such a long time to hear these cases and render judgment.” “On various occasions, the judiciary had shown misplaced sympathy on unmeritorious candidates through interim orders and that has proven to be counter-productive, more particularly when it comes to medical education,” the judge said. Seven institutions Arupadai Veedu Medical College, Vinayaga Mission Medical College, Mahatma Gandhi Medical College & Research Centre, Sri Lakhmi Narayana Institute of Medical Science, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Medical College, Sri Venkateswara Medical College and Research Centre, and Pondicherry Institute of Medical Science & Research admitted 65 students on their own denying admission to students selected through the CENTAC. The colleges claimed that the students referred by CENTAC could not be admitted since they failed to pay the fee prescribed or never turned up for admission within the cut-off date. Subsequently, MCI issued orders cancelling the admission of all the 65 students admitted by the colleges on their own. Challenging the MCI order, the institutions and the students aggrieved have moved the court separately. This apart, students who were referred by CENTAC but denied admission by colleges, also approached the court seeking to admit them at least in the next academic year. Defending their admission, the 65 students submitted that some are even standing as frontline warriors in the fight against COVID-19 and the same should be taken into consideration by the court while deciding the pleas. Refusing to accept any such arguments, the court said, “the petitioners undertook that they will not claim any equity by virtue of the interim orders passed in their favour. Since the matter involves post-graduate courses, this court is not willing to compromise on merits and get swayed by other considerations.” This apart, pointing out that the institutions had adopted an illegal procedure to fill the seats and admit candidates unilaterally, the judge said the institutions were liable to pay Rs 5 lakh each as costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-hc-scraps-admission-65-postgrad-docs-lose-degrees/articleshow/78543160.cms||Suresh Kumar
October 8, 2020||Pune||Pune: Focus on preventive detention to curb criminal activities||PUNE: Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Wednesday said there would be a greater focus on effecting preventive detentions as one of the measures to curb the rise in criminal activities in the city. He said there would be better monitoring of the movement of criminals and gangs and all serious crimes would have parallel probe by the crime branch and police stations for early detection and action. Gupta told TOI that instructions have been issued to police stations for identifying criminals for taking preventive action under various laws such as MPDA, MCOCA, Maharashtra Police Act and CrPC after five recent murders in various parts of the city. He said, “People need to appreciate the fact that we have detected all the recent murder cases. Preventive action will further send a strong message to the repeat offenders, new criminals and first-time offenders. It will serve as a deterrent from committing new crimes.” Gupta said though the police could not prevent a crime from happening, efforts could certainly be mad to control it. “Our effort will be to improve the response to crime situation and ensure that peace is not disturbed,” he said. “We will make good use of technology for controlling crime. We want women and senior citizens to feel safe in night and will launch a number of schemes in public interest in the days to come,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/focus-on-preventive-detention-to-curb-criminal-activities/articleshow/78543161.cms||Asseem Shaikh
October 8, 2020||Goa||Far too few forest staffers to oversee Goa’s 754sqkm of protected area||Keri: Twenty per cent of Goa’s geographical area is protected and is spread over six wildlife sanctuaries and one national park. The strength of forest personnel in the state, however, has been and continues to be far from adequate to guard these vast forest stretches. Only 115 executive range staff man the protected areas in Bondla, Chorao, Mhadei, Molem, Cotigao and Netravali, which together comprise 754sqkm. These include 85 forest guards, 18 forest rounders, and only six range forest officers and deputy range forest officers each. It is not surprising, therefore, that increasing cases of deforestation, poaching and developmental activities in forested areas are being reported, posing a threat to wildlife in Goa. The forest department has appointed many local men in protected areas on contract basis to guard over the forests and also act as nature guides. However, Richard D’Souza, former principal chief conservator of forests in Goa, said much more needs to be done. “There is a need to take policy decisions, to create a conducive environment for sustaining wildlife in the forests of Goa. Today, the forest department is understaffed and guards are not well-equipped and empowered to curtail illegalities inside the forests. In order to face various challenges of climate change, mitigation measures are needed to be taken. We have to initiate tree plantation drives by taking the utmost care,” said D’Souza. During Portuguese rule, the forest department never functioned independently since its creation in 1771. In 1958, it was part of the directorate of economic services and a superintendent with two to three forest guards and 12-15 sepoys was in charge of each of the then 18 forest zones. After Liberation, P M Taggarse was appointed the first conservator of forests on September 10, 1962. Under his leadership, the forest department of Goa came into existence. Presently, the department comprises eight divisions, 11 sub-divisions and with 29 range headquarters dedicated to conserving biodiversity and the verdant forests of the Western Ghats. Though Goa got its first sanctuary in 1967, the government does not have a management plan for its sanctuaries and park to date. Currently, four academicians have been appointed to frame a management plan. During Richard D’Souza’s tenure, a draft for Goa’s forest policy was framed, but the department has not finalised it until now. Arulraj Jebastin, the deputy conservator of forests (wildlife), told TOI, “We have already taken necessary steps to create favourable conditions inside the natural habitat to see that wildlife is thriving. The forest staff concerned has been instructed to be vigilant to protect wildlife.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/far-too-few-forest-staffers-to-oversee-goas-754sqkm-of-protected-area/articleshow/78543159.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
October 8, 2020||Nashik||Education dept serves notices to 3 pvt schools||Nashik: The education department of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has served show cause notice to three private English medium schools in the city following complaints of alleged refusal to allow students to appear for exams and online classes for not paying the fees. Some private schools have also allegedly insisted that the parents pay the complete school fees even though the schools have been closed since March. “I also visited one of the three schools in the city following complaints and have informed the issue to the state education commissioner,” said Sunita Dhangar, the administrative officer of NMC’s education department.  Dhangar directed the schools to submit all the details about the fees they forcibly recovered from the students and those who did not pay the fees. She said the school has a centralized system and students can’t access it if they don’t pay the fees. “I directed them to ensure students are not deprived of the online education and the exams for not paying fees, she said . She said these schools have argued about how they pay salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff if they don’t get fees. When contacted, Himgauri Adke-Aher, the chairperson of English Medium Schools Association said, “The Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and school managements of these three schools should communicate, discuss and sort out the issues. I think the lack of communication between PTA and school has created this problem.” Adke-Aher said schools also have their liabilities like paying salaries to their teaching and non-teaching staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/education-dept-serves-notices-to-3-pvt-schools/articleshow/78540646.cms||Tushar Pawar

October 8, 2020||Pune||Shooter in developer’s murder held, pistol recovered: Pune police||PUNE: The city police on Wednesday claimed to have arrested the alleged shooter in Monday’s daylight murder of developer Rajesh H Kanabar (64) and recovered a pistol from him. Deputy commissioner of police Shirish Sardeshpande and his team arrested Hasmukh Jaswant Patel (31), the alleged shooter, from a spot on the Pune-Ahmednagar road on Tuesday night following a tip-off. Earlier, the police had earlier arrested tourist agency operator Rahul Kamble, real estate businessman Rupesh Kamble and their aide Ganesh Kurhe, a real estate agent, on the charge of conspiring to eliminate Kanabar owing to a dispute over an 11-acre land in Bavdhan, worth Rs100 crore. The name of Patel, having his roots in Junagad in Gujarat, figured in separate questioning of the three arrested conspirators Rahul, Rupesh and Ganesh, all residents of Bavdhan, a police officer said. Patel was earlier arrested in a murder, plot to commit robbery and other crimes in the city between 2011 and 2015. During an interaction with reporters, city police commissioner Amitabh Gupta preferred not to divulge details like when, how and at what price the three arrested conspirators had hired Patel and from where the later sourced the firearm. “We shall disclose all these details in due course of time,” Gupta said. On Wednesday afternoon, a local court ordered the remand of the two Kambles, Kurhe and Patel in police custody till October 13, after the police produced them before it. Investigations so far revealed that the Kambles had a dispute with Kanabar over the piece of land in Bavdhan for over 10 years. Kurhe created interest in the land. A revenue tribunal at the district collector’s office was hearing the land dispute and Kanabar, a resident of Sopanbaug, had gone there to attend the proceedings on Monday. After the hearing, Kanabar was heading towards his car when he was gunned down near the district collector’s office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shooter-in-developers-murder-held-pistol-recovered-police/articleshow/78543163.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hubballi||MoU inked for use of twin cities’ solid waste to generate power||Hubballi: As part of its efforts to ensure effective disposal, management and utilisation of solid waste in the twin cities, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) will soon be using the garbage to generate power. The civic agency will soon put into action its plan to transform waste generated in Hubballi-Dharwad into torrefied charcoal – roasted or scorched charcoal – that will then be used at thermal power plants in lieu of fossil fuels. This plan will, in addition to solving the twin cities’ garbage woes, help generate power into the bargain. HDMC has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a subsidiary of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC – NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN), which will use the garbage from the twin cities as raw material for the generation of electricity. Union minister for coal and mines and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi told TOI that the MoU was the result of a six-month long endeavour. “The project aims at utilising 200 tonnes of solid waste generated in the twin cities daily for conversion to fuel. This is an ideal solution to the disposal and management of solid waste. If not treated, solid waste dumped in a landfill poses a health hazard since there is always the threat of toxic content entering the environment. This technology will help convert solid waste into torrefied charcoal,” Joshi said. The waste-to-energy plant, estimated to cost Rs 45 crore, will be set up by NVVN, while HDMC will provide 240 tonnes of waste to the unit for generation of torrefied charcoal, the Dharwad MP said. Joshi expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union minister of state for power, and new and renewable energy RK Singh and the chief managing director of NTPC for their support and cooperation in realising this project. “This project will also help generate employment for the locals. This will bolster sustainable waste management while also help turn a profit by effective and efficient utilisation of solid waste,” Joshi added. Executive engineer of HDMC’s solid waste management wing Vijaykumar pointed out that only the preliminary agreement had been signed. “We are yet to finalise the terms for handing over of land on lease, and the logistics of setting up the plant. The HDMC has identified a 12-acre plot near the Gabbur sewage water treatment plant, which we think might be ideal for this purpose,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/mou-inked-for-use-of-twin-cities-solid-waste-to-generate-power/articleshow/78542157.cms||Kishan Singh Bhorde

October 8, 2020||Hubballi||Koppal village bans sale, consumption of liquor||KOPPAL: People of Nilogal village in Kushtagi taluk in Koppal district have set an example by imposing a complete ban on the sale and consumption of liquor. It is perhaps the first village in the district and state to completely ban the sale and consumption of liquor for the past one- and- a half-years. Villagers are maintaining a strict vigil on people who try to break the rule set by village heads and impose fines without any hesitation. Mahantesh Shettar, from Nilogal said, “Earlier the liquor menace was so severe that liquor used to be sold through grocery shops and hotels. Most men in Nilogal were addicted to liquor and used to torture their family members under its influence.” “Women in the village demanded village heads to prevent their husbands from consuming alcohol and stop the sale of liquor. After holding dicussions, all villagers took a unanimous decision to ban the sale of liquor about 20 months back. Now, we have collected total fine of Rs 2.5 lakh which will be utilised for developing the village,” he said. Yamanurappa Gaji, also from Nilogal said, “A fine of Rs 5,000 will be imposed on a person who consumes alcohol and Rs 50,000 on people who try to sell liquor. We have formed a vigilant committee with 25 members from each caste and religion. The committee will keep an eye on people who consume and sell liquor. If anyone creates a scene in the village or abuses others in an inebriated state, they will be fined. Some people may drink and stay indoors without giving any hints to others. But if we come to know of it, we will not spare such persons.” Manjula Biragondar, Laxmavva Garani and other women said, “Now we are living peacefully as no men touch liquor. Many are using their hard-earned money for their children’s education and other purposes rather than for liquor.” Panchayat development officer Mallikarjun Ankalagi said neighbouring villages too have taken a cue from Nilogal and adopting its model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/koppal-village-bans-sale-consumption-of-liquor/articleshow/78542211.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani
October 8, 2020||Delhi||Encroachers on govt land not entitled to prior notice, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused to stay an ongoing drive by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to remove encroachments in the Yamuna floodplain at Dhobi Ghat. A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad also ticked off the land owning agency for “keeping its eyes shut” and allowing encroachments to crop up on its land for long. “DDA ought to have protected its land, but the less said the better,” the bench remarked, while declining to stay the eviction drive. The court, however, asked it not to take any coercive action for the next ten days, allowing those affected to approach National Green Tribunal (NGT) on whose directions the Authority has begun clearing Yamuna floodplain of encroachments, or the Supreme Court. The high court was hearing a petition filed by two residents of the area who sought an immediate stay on the demolition drive and claimed that the agency didn’t give prior notice to the locals who face the threat of being rendered homeless. But the bench made it clear that encroachers on government land are not entitled to prior notice and pointed out that NGT’s orders can only be assailed before the Supreme Court, with the high court having no role to play. It refused to examine if the residents are eligible for rehabilitation, leaving it to Delhi government’s urban shelter board (DUSIB) and DDA, even as it gave ten days time to the petitioners to move NGT or SC if they wish. The high court also directed a reluctant DDA, represented through senior advocate Rajiv Bansal, to coordinate with DUSIB and conduct a joint survey of the area in Jamia Nagar. It said the agencies can use drone for videography and for further mapping of the area. Taking note of the court’s stand, the petitioners withdrew their plea for stay and also the writ petition filed before a single judge challenging the encroachment drive, after the bench said it won’t allow parallel proceedings before NGT and court to continue. Last week, DDA had demolished 100s of jhuggis in a drive to remove encroachments in the Yamuna floodplain. Earlier this year, the Yamuna monitoring committee had told the green tribunal that almost 959 hectares of the rivers’ floodplain were currently encroached on and needed to be secured by DDA. In its final report, it stated that an area of 954.2 hectares was encroached on or in agricultural use, while another 5.26 hectares were currently under litigation. It added that the Millennium Park bus depot, which was under the Supreme Court and NGT’s scanner, was indeed a part of the river’s “O” zone where construction and commercial activities were prohibited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/encroachers-on-govt-land-not-entitled-to-prior-notice-says-hc/articleshow/78543197.cms||Abhinav Garg
October 8, 2020||Pune||Crumbling surface makes for rough ride on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass||PUNE: Rough patches, eroded tar, uneven stretches, and wide and deep potholes make driving on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass a nightmare even during the day. The road’s condition has deteriorated since the onset of the monsoon, regular commuters said. Unmotorable stretches “I’ve seen accidents as the road is good in certain parts and pothole-ridden in others. Vehicles often have tyre bursts. I have travelled along this stretch a few times since the lockdown was relaxed and noticed that the road condition has worsened as the monsoon progressed. The potholes are scattered but the road surface in some patches has been so damaged that the loose gravel is strewn all over,” said working professional Ashish Pawar. TimesViewMotoring on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, a part of the national highway linking Mumbai and Bengaluru passing via Pune, is fraught with huge risks. The growth of residential localities on either side of the 34km stretch often leads to merging of slow traffic with the fast-moving heavy vehicles, despite the construction of service roads. The bad condition of the highway due to potholes after the monsoon further increases the risk. The NHAI maintenance team should act quickly to redress road safety issues.Monsoon troubles Baner resident Bharadwaj Phadke, who commutes daily, said, “The road develops potholes every monsoon and the authorities only fix the potholes without resurfacing the bad stretch. Heavy showers or heavy movement of vehicles damage the patchwork, making the road worse. The entire stretch that has broken down must be resurfaced.” Maintenance needs SD Chitnis, general manager of National Highway Authority of India, Pune, said the maintenance of the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass is a continuous process. “We have a patrol van which reports the damaged patches to our maintenance team. Even engineers or officials, who conduct site visits, report about potholes and uneven surfaces for maintenance. The maintenance teams fill up the potholes if they notice any problems. Any damaged patches are repaired as soon as we notice them,” he said Watch Pune: Potholes, crumbling surface make driving on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass a nightmare||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crumbling-surface-makes-for-rough-ride-on-katraj-dehu-road-bypass/articleshow/78543167.cms||Rujuta Parekh
October 8, 2020||Meerut||UP to conduct vulture census to stop the endangered species’ flight into extinction||Strap: A 10-day state-level workshop to train officials on vulture mapping ended last week Bijnor: Unfettered use of diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug prescribed for pain relief in livestock, has pushed the vultures on the brink of extinction in the last two decades, forest officials claim. People in north India also misused it to increase the milk production. “When these birds eat the animal carcass, they also indirectly consume the drug which hits their kidneys,” a veterinarian said. The countrywide population of the bird recently dropped to just 7,000 from eight crore in 1980s. Now, to save these birds, the UP forest department has taken several steps. The first is to count their numbers. Recently a flock of 130 vultures was spotted in Amangarh Tiger Reserve. “The main aim is to conserve this bird and a census will be the first step in this direction,” a senior official said. The Uttar Pradesh forest department is all set to conduct for the first time a vulture mapping to conserve the endangered species that has shown a sharp decline in the past a few decades. A 10-day preparatory workshop to train the participants on vulture mapping concluded last week. According to officials, there are eight species of vultures in UP, and they saw a flock of 130 vultures in the Amangarh Tiger Reserve last year. Bijnor’s divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “The main aim of the mapping is to conserve the species. A census will be the first step towards it.”“A state-level workshop — organised by Institute of Wildlife Science University of Lucknow, UP State Biodiversity Board and Environment, Forest and Climate Change Department UP — for forest personnel was held from September 21 to 30 on the GPS mapping of vultures, their conservation and protection,” said the DFO. “This is for the first time when a vulture mapping will be conducted in UP. We are now planning to set up a vulture restaurant in Amangarh Tiger Reserve area by putting the carcass of an animal. Besides, several other steps for the protection of vultures will be taken, such as, livestock owners will be rewarded for not using diclofenac, which is very harmful to vultures.”The DFO said they had spotted 130 vultures in bordering areas of ATR and Corbett last year, in addition to vultures sighted in Najibabad areas. “There are five species of vulture present in Bijnor district. Of which two are Egyptian vulture, also called white scavenger vulture or pharaoh’s chicken. They are small Old World vultures and the only member of the genus Neophron. The Egyptian vulture is found in the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa and India. Besides the two Egyptian species, there are three Himalayan vultures or Himalayan griffon vultures — Old World vulture natives to the Himalayas and the adjoining Tibetan Plateau. They are one of the two largest Old World vultures and true raptors,” added the DFO. KK Jha, the former principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and professor at Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, said “As a carrion feeder, vultures play an important ecological role. Their counting and qualitative assessments were done over three seasons to assess the richness and abundance of vultures in Uttar Pradesh during 2010-11. Of the nine species found in India, UP has eight: Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus (45.9%), Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris (25.4%), Indian Vulture (Long-billed Vulture) Gyps indicus (16.8%), White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis (10.3%), Red-headed Vulture (King Vulture) Sarcogyps calvus (0.8%) and Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis (0.7%).”“We observed a total of 1,993 adults and 91 juveniles, with the Tarai region having the greatest species richness and abundance. Nesting tree species included Silk Cotton Bombax ceiba, Teak Tectona grandis, Haldu Haldina cordifolia and Sissoo Dalbergia sissoo. A qualitative assessment indicated that the vulture population had declined in the past 15 years with the main causes being the use of diclofenac, shortage of food and habitat loss. Disposal of dead animals was mainly done by removing carcasses to village outskirts, where dogs, crows and egrets compete with vultures. Such a small number of avian scavengers in a large area like UP should be protected by ensuring safe and sufficient food, recovery from accidents and rehabilitation, and a protected environment,” added Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-to-conduct-vulture-census-to-stop-the-endangered-species-flight-into-extinction/articleshow/78536448.cms||Harveer Dabas

October 8, 2020||Hubballi||Surface drain system to mitigate rain woes in Hubballi-Dharwad||HUBBALLI: Whenever it rains in the twin cities, it rains woes on the residents of low-lying areas of Hubballi-Dharwad, who have to grapple with waterlogging on the roads and worse still, the nightmare of water gushing inside their homes. On the other hand, Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) is often flooded with complaints from owners of commercial establishments in several localities of inundation in their basement. However, the HDMC is intent on solving this problem once and for all. The civic agency has decided on developing an effective surface drainage system in areas that the officials have identified as being prone to waterlogging. The new system, which is being designed and implemented in collaboration with a German company, will prevent roads from being inundated and rendering commute impossible and prevent water from entering homes in vulnerable areas. Officials of the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) has urged HDMC to submit its proposal to the state government so that work on the new system can begin at the earliest. Social activist Parvez Konnur highlighted the need for open drains in residential and commercial pockets of the twin cities. “Preventing stagnation is vital to keeping roads in good condition,” Konnur said. The rebuilt road in Badami Nagar, Konnur held up as an example of quality and design. “All roads need to be designed and built in such a manner so that they endure,” he said. Sources in the public works department pointed out that on many of the concrete thoroughfares in Hubballli-Dharwad, provisions had not been made to ensure seamless flow of rainwater. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that the civic agency would utilise funds under various schemes to initiate work on open drains in Hubballi-Dharwad. Itnal confirmed that KUIDFC had sought a proposal on the system from HDMC. “We will submit the proposal soon,” Itnal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-to-develop-surface-drain-system-to-prevent-waterlogging-in-twin-cities/articleshow/78541820.cms||J Abbas Mulla
October 8, 2020||Nashik||Civic body asks MNGL to pay for road damage||Nashik: The civic body has turned down the proposal of the Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL) seeking a waiver of road damage charges. The MNGL had requested the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to waive the charges for road damage caused while laying pipelines for supply of piped natural gas (PNG) used for cooking to households in the city. The NMC administration refused, given its financial condition. The NMC’s revenue generation in form of property, water and other taxes has taken a beating due to the pandemic, confirmed the NMC officials. “We have asked the MNGL to pay the road damage charges,” said Ganesh Gite, the chairperson of the NMC standing committee. A decision to this effect was taken in a meeting held recently between NMC and MNGL officials. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, independent director of MNGL Rajesh Pande, Gite and other officials from both the sides attended the meeting. “The road damage charges vary from Rs 200 per metre to Rs 5,500 per metre depending on the road category — earthen road, macadamized road, tar road and road made of cement-concrete. Currently, the MNGL has started laying a 30km pipeline. We have sought Rs 7 crore as damage charges for the roads the MNGL has already taken permission for,” said NMC city engineer Sanjay Ghuge. “Moreover, the MNGL has also sought permission to lay another 150km of pipeline. We have also asked them to pay the road damage charges for that too,” added Ghuge. Rajesh Pande confirmed the development and said MNGL will pay. “We have plans to provide PNG to all households in the city in phases over seven-eight years,” he said. Apart from PNG, it has also proposed six CNG stations to provide green fuel to NMC’s city buses and other vehicles. These CNG stations are expected to be operational soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civic-body-asks-mngl-to-pay-for-road-damage/articleshow/78540710.cms||Tushar Pawar
October 8, 2020||Pune||PMPML’s airport service to start from October 20||PUNE: A total of 25 buses of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) would be pressed into service to ferry passengers to and from the airport from October 20. The airport bus service, which was stopped last year due to less passenger load, is being re-started with new features and more routes, said Rajendra Jagtap, the chairman-cum-managing director of the transport body. The buses will be operated at 20 minutes’ interval. “Flights will operate at the Pune airport for 12 hours from 8am to 8pm from October 26. After October 26, the number of buses on the airport route will be increased from 25 to 45. At any given point in time, only two mid-sized buses will be able to enter the airport premises and wait for a short time for passengers. Some space has been earmarked for parking the buses right outside the airport premises and two bus stops will come up at those spots. The airport has five gates for entry and exit, including the main entry gate. Space for buses has been provided between the gates,” Jagtap said. “The Pune airport is facing severe space crunch which will continue till mid-2022 when the new multi-level parking will come up. All the land belonging to the Airports Authority of India has been utilised and vacant plots in or around the airport either belong to the Indian Air Force or private parties. We have been appealing to flyers not to bring their personal vehicles,” said Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh. “The buses will stop near hotels, conference halls and railway station, among others. The civic body has shown us two plots in a radius of 3.5km from the airport which can be used by the PMPML to maintain and charge the buses. Since most buses in the service will run on electricity, we plan to set up charging stations on the plots,” Jagtap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpmls-airport-service-to-start-from-october-20/articleshow/78543189.cms||Joy Sengupta

On the other end of the spectrum were 350 respondents who found it “extremely stressful”, and then, in the middle, were the rest who rated the experience of flying during Covid pandemic as either average or satisfactory. “The likelihood of the respondents taking another domestic trip during the next 3 months (42%) is the highest it has been as compared to an earlier sentiment survey done in May (16%). The results show that the confidence in air travel is rising,’’ said the survey. The most important aspect for travel during pandemic was the safety and hygiene measures being adopted by airlines and various properties, the survey said, adding that queuing during check-in/security (64%) and in-flight social distancing (51%) featured among the top apprehensions of these “early travellers”, as the company called them. Domestic air travel restarted on May 25. The biggest travel trend of the season was “workcation”, the survey said. With a majority of Indian companies announcing WFH till the end of the year, 30% of recent travellers revealed that they have already been working remotely from a leisure destination of their choice, the survey said, adding that the travel compnay has seen a 27% month-onmonth increase in search queries for popular destinations and getaways such as Goa, Jaipur, Shimla, Udaipur and Uttarakhand. “Most of the travellers have opted for home rentals/service apartments/villas as their preferred choice of workation accommodation followed by resorts and eco-friendly properties with distant cottages,” said Aloke Bajpai, CEO, ixigo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/42-of-people-found-air-travel-during-pandemic-safe-says-survey/articleshow/78544079.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Gold smuggling case: ED for further probe into Sivasankar’s role||KOCHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) which filed a chargesheet in the gold smuggling case has left the door open for further investigation into the role of M Sivasankar IAS in the case. “The role of M Sivasankar, who was the key person in the present government, in the entire episode has to be thoroughly investigated,” the agency specifically stated in its chargesheet submitted in the special court for PMLA cases on Wednesday. ED has refered to statements given by various persons, including Sivasankar to support its argument. “…Sivasankar inter alia admitted that he had facilitated opening a locker for Swapna Suresh jointly with his chartered accountant P Venugopal. The probe revealed that Swapna was directly involved in the gold smuggling and had earned lucrative profits and proceeds of the crime were kept in the locker in the form of gold and cash,” the agency said it the chargesheet. P Venugopal has also given a statement to ED that Sivasankar was kept informed and the locker was opened on his instruction. He said that he knew Sivasankar for 25 years and it was Sivasankar who introduced Swapna to him and asked him to advise her on financial matters. ED also refers to Sivasankar’s WhatsApp chats with Venugopal and his response when it confronted him with the chats, in the chargesheet. “On being specifically asked about his message to Venugopal --‘the amount is 35. So, it is to be done separately?’ and Venugopal’s reply, “FD for 30 should be ok” to which he replied, “Ok. I will also come to your place by 3.30-3.40—he offered no comments and stated that he is not sure whether the message was written by him or it was forwarded from someone,” ED said in the chargesheet. “In another chat, Venugopal said, ‘Kept in locker in her presence at 2pm today and he replied ‘thanks’ and thereafter Venugopal again messaged him, ‘Sir can you call me when nobody is in ur room and when u r free and he replied ok. Sivasankar offered no comments to these chats either,” the chargesheet said. Sivasankar had claimed on August 15 that he did not know Swapna had a huge pile of cash with her. He also said he did not instruct Venugopal to open a bank locker for Swapna, and that it was Venugopal who informed him of the opening of the bank locker. He told ED that Swapna was facing financial difficulty and he had helped her. “…One or two days after he introduced Swapna to Venugopal, Swapna handed over the cash in a bag to Venugopal at his residence. He was also present when the bag was handed over but he did not know the exact amount in the bag,” the chargesheet said referring to Sivasankar’s statement.  “In August 2019, Swapna resigned from the UAE consulate and sought his help to get a job. He asked Swapna to submit her resume to PriceWaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd with respect to an opening in the Space Park project. He also stated that Swapna had put his name as a reference in her CV,” the chargesheet stated. Despite taking his statement multiple times, ED has not arrayed Sivasankar as a witness in the case. The witness list only includes P Venugopal, Santhosh Eappen of Unitac and Vinod PV of Sane Venture apart from the investigating officers of ED and NIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gold-smuggling-ed-for-further-probe-into-sivasankars-role/articleshow/78541817.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Dehradun||Limit number of tourists into Nainital to 500, make covid-19 certificate necessary for entry into Lake Town: monitoring committee||Nainital: Just days after major tourist destinations in Uttarakhand saw a surge in tourist activity after a lull of over six months, the district level monitoring committee appointed by the high court (HC) has recommended that the number of tourists entering into Nainital should be restricted to not more than 500 people each day till the pandemic is over. The committee, in its weekly report submitted before the HC, has further said that the covid-19 certificate should yet again be made mandatory for entry into the Lake Town. Citing the media reports, the committee said that around 20000 tourists came to Nainital in the last weekend and many of them were not wearing masks or following social distancing norms while taking a stroll on the Mall Road. “The number of tourists has to be restricted, not more than 500 tourists per day should be allowed into Nainital city till the pandemic is over. It is pertinent to mention that the earlier policy of having covid-19 negative report of last 72 hours needs to be implemented,” read the report while adding that if the policy of mandatory covid-19 negative certificate could not be implemented then at least rapid antigen tests should be conducted either at borders or at hotels. In its report, the committee has said that the schools should not be opened for students till class 9th. Apart from this it has recommended distribution of N-95 masks and sanitizers to the people living below the poverty line (BPL). The officials have also highlighted the need for establishing a hospital with at least 500 beds in Haldwani since the Sushila Tiwari Hospital (STH) has only a little over than 200 beds and is catering to not only the Covid patients of Nainital but the entire Kumaon region. In its other suggestions, the committee has said that the cinema halls should be directed to start functioning at only 30% of their capacity, and that the maximum number of people allowed to attend any function or wedding should be limited to only 50. The maximum number of people allowed to enter religious places should also be limited to just 50 persons at a time and the buses should also ply at 50% occupancy, the committee suggested. Meanwhile, in an affidavit filed by health secretary, the state government has argued that it will implement lockdown outside containment zones if and when necessary. This comes after the district level committee from Dehradun in its last report had advocated for a completed lockdown in the district for at least 15 days. Meanwhile, the bench of Acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe HC while holding its weekly hearing on the Coronavirus situation has directed the state government to look into the suggestions. “The court has directed the state government to consider the suggestions made by the committees. The court has also directed the committees to furnish their reports by Sunday evening on latest by Monday afternoon so that the government and the petitioner can study these reports,” said Shiv Bhatt, the counsel appearing for one of the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/limit-number-of-tourists-into-nainital-to-500-make-covid-19-certificate-necessary-for-entry-into-lake-town-monitoring-committee/articleshow/78540715.cms||Prashant Jha
October 8, 2020||Chennai||Assets of J Jayalalithaa in Siruthavur, Kodanad held by Sasikala & kin attached under Benami Act||Benami properties of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, measuring nearly 44.3 acres at Siruthavur village on the Old Mahabalipuram Road (IT Corridor), worth several crores and held in the names of V N Sudhagaran and J Elavarasi, have been attached by the income tax department. This Siruthavur property also includes a huge bungalow that was sparingly used by Jayalalithaa. The department also reportedly attached the properties of Sasikala and her relatives in Kodanad near Ooty. The provisional attachment orders dated October 6 and passed under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, were pasted on the Siruthavur property on Wednesday, mentioning that copies had been marked to Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs niece J Deepa and nephew J Deepak. Since Sudhagaran and Elavarasi are lodged at the central prisons at Parappana Agrahara in Bengaluru, copies were sent to the jails. Noting that the department apprehended that Sudhagaran and Elavarasi might try to alienate the property, the notice said: “It is ordered that you are hereby prohibited and restrained, until further order or till 90 days from the end of month from the date of the notice, whichever is earlier, from transferring or charging the properties….in anyway and that all persons are hereby prohibited from taking any benefit under such transfer of charge.” The order has been issued by U N Dilip, deputy commissioner of income tax (benami prohibition), who is also the initiating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/assets-of-jaya-in-siruthavur-kodanad-held-by-sasi-kin-attached-under-benami-act/articleshow/78543239.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||TRS lures Congress leader after Cheruku’s jump||HYDERABAD: A day after Cheruku Srinivas Reddy had crossed over to Congress, the ruling TRS gave a taste of its own medicine to the party by weaning away its general secretary of erstwhile Medak district Cheruku Kondal Reddy into its fold. Srinivas Reddy, who is entering the Dubbak poll fray on a Congress ticket, is invoking his late father Cheruku Mutyam Reddy’s name. In a Facebook post, he said the constituency got water and roads when his father was the MLA. Meanwhile, TRS candidate Solipeta Sujatha, who hit the campaign trail, said she was hoping that the electorate would help her win with a margin of one lakh votes. TRS leaders are hand-holding her in the campaign. Medak legislator and former deputy speaker M Padma Devender Reddy, who accompanied Sujatha during a campaign meeting on Wednesday, sought to remind the people that it was the late Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy who worked to get drinking water to the constituency. For BJP candidate M Raghunandan Rao, the challenge came from within. BJP’s Dubbak constituency leader Kamalakar Reddy questioned the decision of the party leadership to field Raghunandan Rao. He pointed out that the party had given Rao a chance three times to contest the polls and that he had lost on all occasions. “The party should rethink on his candidature,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-lures-cong-leader-after-cherukus-jump/articleshow/78543268.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

October 8, 2020||Pune||Four teachers trek every day with lesson plans for kids grazing cattle||Pune: The villagers call it the school on the mountain where a teacher with a rolled up blackboard gathers 7-8 students for a maths lesson.Kallekhetpada, a hamlet in Umarani Budruk in Nandurbar district in the Satpura ranges, is as cut-off from the world as it is from 4G network. Headmaster Roopeshkumar Nagalgawe said he and three teachers started a ‘teacher at your doorstep’ initiative. “By mid-June, we had door-to-door classes and gave homework in rotation to cover all 12 hamlets. But, many were herding cattle in the ‘bayadi’, grasslands in the Satpura ranges,” he said. In July, Nagalgawe and Tega Pawara , another teacher, trekked for 3-4 hours, gathered six students on the hilltop to starts classes. “They came the next day with notebooks and we had our first class on the hilltop in the occasional drizzle and strong winds, overlooking the valley with cattle grazing nearby. That was the real unlock for us,” Nagalgawe said. The children go to different mountaintops with their cattle. So the teachers take different trails to reach every student. Sometimes, they find only one. But the child is taught for an hour before the teacher treks to another hill.“The herd on the grassy slopes tells us where the children are,” said Laxmiputra Uppin.The four teachers go at the village at 7am when students leave for grazing and handover photocopies of homework to finish by afternoon. They then teach the students who have stayed back till noon and then walk up the mountain to meet the the other group.Kallekhetpada school participated in an online seminar along with 99 schools in the world education week organised by T4, an organisation based in Denmark. The villagers know they have dedicated teachers. “I watched the teachers from a distance and realised they were teaching the children,” Kota Pawara said.Sometimes, the teachers eat lunch with the students. After class, they sing tribal songs, dance and play games, Nagalgawe said. As the day inclines toward sunset, teachers roll up the blackboard and students gather their books before coming down in scattered pairs , herding the cattle back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-teachers-trek-every-day-with-lesson-plans-for-kids-grazing-cattle/articleshow/78543242.cms||Aditya Waikul
October 8, 2020||Aurangabad||BJP holds agitation demanding implementation of farm laws||Aurangabad: The BJP held protests in different parts of Marathwada on Wednesday to denounce the Maharashtra government for refusing to implement the farm laws. In Aurangabad, BJP functionaries, led by former assembly speaker and MLA Haribhau Bagde, torched copies of the state resolution against the laws. The protesters demanded immediate implementation of all the three laws while claiming that they are pro-farmers and aimed at liberating them financially. In Beed, BJP office functionaries took a tractor rally to the district collector’s office to push their demand. Similar agitations were held in other districts of Marathwada. Taking cognizance of the increasing number of protest marches in different parts of the country, the state BJP decided to counter the narrative by taking out marches in favour of the new farm laws. The party functionaries said that through protest marches and rallies, they want to convey that a large number of farmers in the country are in the favour of the new laws. Meanwhile, leaders of the Mahavikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress slammed the BJP by terming their attitude ‘hypocritical’. Multiple statements were issued by the MVA leaders claiming that during the UPA government at the Centre, the BJP was dead against these farm bills, but had passed the same bills after coming to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bjp-holds-agitation-demanding-implementation-of-farm-laws/articleshow/78540718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

October 8, 2020||Dehradun||HC-appointed panel in Nainital calls for capping tourists to lake town to 500 per day||Nainital: Days after Uttarakhand lifted restrictions on entry, leading to a surge in number of visitors to major destinations in the hill state, a high court-appointed district level Covid-19 monitoring committee in Nainital has recommended capping the number of visitors to the lake town to 500 per day and again making it mandatory for tourists to carry a Covid-negative report. On Wednesday, the bench of acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe directed the state government to look into suggestions of the Nainital committee as well as those presented by other districts. In its report to the court on Tuesday, the Covid-19 monitoring committee in Nainital cited media reports that approximately 20,000 people had visited Nainital last weekend alone and no Covid-19 protocol, such as masks and social distancing, was being followed. “The number of tourists has to be restricted, and not more than 500 tourists per day should be allowed into Nainital city till the pandemic is over. It is pertinent to mention that the earlier policy of a Covid-19 negative report of the last 72 hours also needs to be implemented,” read the report. The report also suggested conducting rapid antigen tests at the district borders or hotels if a Covid-19 test report could not be made mandatory. The committee was also not in favour of reopening schools, at least for students in clas 9 and below while it said that cinema halls should operate at only 30% of their capacity. The maximum number of people allowed to attend a ceremony or wedding should be limited to only 50 while religious places should allow only 50 persons at a time, said the committee, adding that buses should also ply at 50% occupancy. It also recommended distribution of N-95 masks and sanitisers to those living below the poverty line (BPL). The officials further highlighted the need for establishing a hospital with at least 500 beds in Haldwani since the Sushila Tiwari Hospital (STH) has only a little over 200 beds and caters to the entire Kumaon division. Meanwhile, in an affidavit filed by the health secretary, the state government said that it will impose a lockdown outside containment zones if and when necessary. This comes after the Covid-19 monitoring committee in Dehradun in its last report had advocated for a complete lockdown in the district for at least 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-appointed-panel-in-nainital-calls-for-capping-tourists-to-lake-town-to-500-per-day/articleshow/78540777.cms||Prashant Jha

October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Something fishy? CBI inspects NFDB records||HYDERABAD: In a joint inquiry, sleuths of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and vigilance department inspected the books of National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) to verify the complaints filed on alleged irregularities in Blue Revolution scheme. Sources told TOI that based on the information of violations of rules of Blue Revolution scheme and misuse of funds, CBI sleuths searched the NFDB premies recently. A vigilance official told TOI, “In setting up of units, identifying beneficiaries, funding and sanctions under Blue Revolution (Neel Kranti) mission, irregularities took place. Across the country, around 200 such violations were found.” In December 2014, Centre had launched the Blue Revolution mission with a budget outlay of Rs 3,000 crores for integrated development of both marine and inland fisheries. The aim was to achieve a sustained annual growth rate of 6% to 8% in fish production and doubling income of fishermen and fish farmers in five years. Funds were to be utilised for skill development and capacity building in fisheries and allied activities. Additionally, funds were to be used for creation of post-harvest and cold chain infrastructure facilities. The scheme was implemented from 2015-16 to 2019-20. Individual beneficiaries, states, state corporations and Central agencies were extended financial support. Sources said that there are no FIR issues and the probe is in the preliminary stage. The amount misused is yet to be quantified but it would run into a few crores, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/something-fishy-cbi-inspects-nfdb-records/articleshow/78543275.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
October 8, 2020||Bengaluru||Medical, dental students say Covid precautions missing in hostels||BENGALURU: Final year medical and dental students, who returned to prepare for upcoming exams, were in for a rude shock as no Covid-19 precautions are in place in many college hostels across the state. Students allege there are no safety measures – not even sanitisers or social distancing in their dormitories. “We are three or four to a room with common bathrooms on the floor,” said a student from a dental college in Bengaluru. “The bathrooms are very dirty. We use the same utensils in the mess. There is no social distancing anywhere. Everyone seems to be complacent.” Students point out that they share the same hostel facilities with interns and PGs who are Covid warriors besides doctors and nurses who work in hospitals. “We share all the facilities including lifts, stairs and mess with them,” said a final year student of a medical college in south Bengaluru. “When the central government spoke about reopening colleges and schools, it issued strict protocols. But ground realities are different. Those who advocate reopening of colleges should understand it never works the way here as we do not have sufficient infrastructure.” Exams for final year medical and dental courses under Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences are scheduled to start mid-October. The university has postponed exams for junior courses. “The college instructed that we should return only after obtaining results of an RT-PCR test, but no mandate is being followed. In our medical college, many have returned to hostel and have taken the test only after that. The circular clearly said we should not roam around, not eat out and not have gatherings, but none of those norms are followed here,” said a student from a medical college in Tumakuru. They also pointed out that in many hostels, many students are being infected. “They are isolated in separate rooms. Apart from the stress of the exam, this adds to our anxiety,” said a student. Another student from a medical college in Mangaluru pointed out how they have to walk past a Covid Care Centre to reach their mess. A student from Davanagere said some hostels are being used as quarantine centres for interns, making them hotspots for infections. University officials said detailed SOPs had been sent to all colleges on reopening and running of hostels. “Being medical and dental colleges, they should be role models and the first ones to follow SOPs strictly. We have not received complaints from any student yet. But, we will reissue the orders and sensitise them on this again,” said RGUHS registrar Shivanand Kapashi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/medical-dental-students-say-covid-precautions-missing-in-hostels/articleshow/78541358.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityKejriwal was invited among five urban leaders around the world to speak at the action-oriented forum to recognise courageous urban leaders taking bold climate action. Kejriwal was invited alongside urban leaders and decision-makers from Bogota (Colombia), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Los Angeles (USA) and Entebbe (Uganda). “Delhi has been suffering from air pollution for quite some time. But in the last few years, we have taken some very bold and imaginative steps,” Kejriwal said, before sharing the steps taken in the last five years and what the Delhi government proposes to do in the next few years. Kejriwal said the government introduced the odd-even scheme in the winter of 2015-16, when pollution levels had increased a lot. “In many parts of the world, this scheme was implemented with mixed results. Many political people cautioned me when we implemented this scheme. It was a harsh step and could have been politically suicidal for us,” he said. “But we did this by launching a mass campaign and taking the people along. Since then, we have implemented the scheme three times,” he added. “We are increasing the fleet of buses in Delhi. We have recently launched an electrical vehicle policy under which we have aimed to shift to electric vehicles in the next few years,” he said, adding that the target is to ensure nearly 25% of vehicles purchased in Delhi should be EV within 2024. He said that coal-based power plants had been closed and the government was working towards shifting to renewable sources of energy, apart from a strict policy for industries to shift to non-polluting fuel. “We have started implementing mega tree plantation drives and last year, more than 6 million saplings were planted,” he added. Kejriwal also said that to deal with the problem of stubble burning in neighbouring states, a chemical solution developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute that can be used to convert stubble to manure, is being implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-took-some-bold-and-imaginative-steps-to-combat-pollution-says-cm-at-global-forum/articleshow/78543294.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The CM said that he was yet to fully come out of the shock over the untimely death of Angadi. “He was quite fit. Since he was initially asymptomatic, there must have been a delay in his receiving treatment for Covid-19. Angadi must have thought that he would not need treatment in those initial days. He was rushed to the hospital when the situation became very grave,” Yediyurappa said. Highlighting Angadi’s contribution to the development of railways in Karnataka, which he dubbed ‘mammoth’, Yediyurappa said that he felt dutybound to offer condolences personally to the late minister’s family. “Angadi was a close friend, and his loss has created a void,” said the CM, adding that he considered it his responsibility to ensure a memorial for Angadi in Delhi. “I will speak to the central government about the construction of the memorial regularly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/will-speak-to-centre-on-a-memorial-for-angadi-in-delhi-says-bsy/articleshow/78542232.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||IIT-Hyderabad model helps predict Covid path||HYDERABAD: Researchers from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) have developed a model that can help the government and administrators predict an ongoing epidemic. As part of the research titled ‘using epidemic simulators for monitoring an ongoing epidemic’, researchers from the department of biomedical engineering used cumulative infection data from 12 states from mid-March and mid-April to predict the Covid-19 trends of succeeding 10 day period. Primary intention behind building the model is to monitor localized response using dashboards. “Every day, the number of active and recovered Covid-19 cases, deaths change. While the government has the data on its fingertips, they don’t really have a way to know if it is the result of their mitigatory measures or a result of new external factors. This is where our model comes into picture where it can help administrators make sense of the large pool of data,” said Prof Mohan Raghavan, lead researcher and assistant professor, biomedical engineering department, IIT-H, adding that the data used for the model was sourced from www.covid19india.org. A key constraint impose on models is that while it should be able to explain short term trends and effects of interventions, it must also be capable of providing intuitive connections between observed trends and changes in underlying parameters. The model developed by the IIT-H researchers will help administrators estimate time varying interventions that recreate trends in cumulative infections by applying suitable interventions, thereby estimating the underlying changes in epidemic dynamics. It presents a method by which administration may get an objective estimate of several aspects of an ongoing epidemic such as the efficacy of contact tracing apparatus, possible influx of infected, extent of social distancing or transmission.  “Since the model captures the active cases as a function of administrative response, this can be a valuable tool to plan and allocate resources where necessary,” read the research paper, which was published in the Nature Journal, Scientific Reports on October 6.  The model can be further extended to estimate the effort required for achieving a level of contact tracing. “This can be of vital importance for the administration in planning their strategies and estimating requirements of health workers, law enforcement agencies for contact tracing. Not just that, the administrators can also monitor impact of the policy decisions made by them,” said Prof Kousik Sarathy who was also associated with the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-model-to-predict-the-course-of-epidemic/articleshow/78544090.cms||Preeti Biswas

The shrine near Mundakayam, believed to have been established by the Mala Arayas, belonged to the community till it came under TDB. Leaders of the community have alleged that Gangadharan Kannatta and family, who earn their livelihood by selling pooja materials in the premises of the temple, have been banned from selling pooja materials by TDB. “The temple authorities are sending back pooja materials brought from Gangadharan’s shop. This is caste discrimination and insult to our community,” said Mohandas Pazhumala, general secretary of Akhila Thiruvathankur Malayaraya Mahasabha. Vallyankavu Devi is the deity of Mala Araya community and Gangadaharan is a descendant of the family which had rights over the temple, he added. TDB officials allow only pooja materials bought from the TDB shop run by wholesale dealers inside the temple premises, he said. Gangadharan was the oracle of the temple till TDB took over the administration. He had started the stall to earn a living. Meanwhile, Sreedhara Sarma, administrative officer of the temple, said that the board has not discriminated againt anyone and had only put some restrictions since the lockdown. “Unlike other temples, we mostly have devotees coming from other districts. We had given strict instructions to devotees not to bring any pooja materials from outside. We have never imposed any restriction on any particular individual,” he said. He also said that the temple had only followed directions of the health department. Sarma said that the temple is not stopping anyone from bringing any pooja materials from outside since Tuesday evening. “Now nobody is stopped from bringing pooja materials brought from outside. The temple will soon display a board saying that devotees should ensure that materials they bring to the temple should be of good quality,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mala-arayas-allege-bias-in-temple-tdb-denies/articleshow/78541891.cms||---

V Karikalan, deputy conservator of forest (DCF) told TOI, “ A proposal on the need for a survey and an integrated study has been submitted to the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), as part of setting up a dolphin conservation centre. As a first step towards conservation, a survey of the sea stretch from Ullal to Mulky with the help of the Coast Guard or Indian Navy has to be conducted, followed by a detailed study and demarcation of areas for conservation,” he said. Spreading awareness on conservation will be a crucial part of the project, Meanwhile, support from the agencies like the New Mangalore Port Trust is needed. “An integrated approach is essential and scientists from several departments including ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), College of Fisheries need to discuss in detail before implementing the project,” DCF said. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) and sea turtle stranding have been reported across the coast of Karnataka. Of the 120 odd species of marine mammals found in the world, 30-35 cetaceans and one sirenian are found in the waters of the Indian subcontinent. Meanwhile, out of six dead dolphins washed up on the shore last year, four carcasses and two skeletal remains were found. So far the forest department has not conducted an in-depth study exclusively on dolphins. Often it is difficult to ascertain the exact cause of death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/survey-planned-to-conserve-dolphins-off-mluru-coast/articleshow/78540805.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

October 8, 2020||Delhi||Let’s play: 52-acre arena near Delhi airport||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is going to come up with its biggest sports complex in Dwarka’s Sector 19B, which will also be its first such facility to be built, operated and maintained under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. Located near Indira Gandhi International Airport and close to Delhi Metro’s Blue Line (Dwarka-Vaishali/Noida City Centre) and Airport Express Line, the integrated complex will come up on a 52-acre plot and is estimated to cost Rs 250 crore. DDA has developed 15 sports complexes in the capital with state-of-the-art facilities. The popular ones include the Siri Fort sports complex spread over 32 acre and the one at Commonwealth Games Village, which covers over 21 acre.The Dwarka complex will have a football stadium with a 7,000 seating capacity and a practice field with facilities of FIFA-compliance standards. It will include both indoor and outdoor sports facilities to cater to the needs of professionals, training programmes, sports bodies and amateur sports, local communities and private companies, a DDA official said. The outdoor sports complex will include an eight-lane athletic track, tennis court, basketball court, children’s play area and a skate park while the indoor facility will have dedicated space for badminton, squash, table tennis and board games. It will also have swimming pools, a shooting range and a fitness centre. Other public and support facilities will include a jogging track, garden, food court and an auditorium. The complex will also have a sports hostel to support domestic and international sports tournaments with all supporting facilities, the official said. The site was earlier earmarked for a football stadium with a seating capacity of 18,000 spectators, apart from other sporting facilities. Out of the 62-acre plot, 10 acre will be kept aside for other projects, including activities related to Bharat Vandana Park coming up across the site. DDA has floated an expression of interest (EOI) for development, operations and maintenance of the complex under the PPP model. It hopes to attract applicants from sports infrastructure or similar backgrounds to incorporate best practices. The work has to be completed within two years from the award of the tender. The authority believes that by roping in private players, it will be able to bring in professional expertise and ensure optimum utilisation of the sports infrastructure through a sustainable development and operations model. While balancing the objective of local community engagement in sports, private players can also ensure revenue generation for sustainability, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lets-play-52-acre-arena-near-airport/articleshow/78543333.cms||Sidharatha Roy
October 8, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Irregularities in wayside amenities centres deal: Ramesh Chennithala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the government is trying to hand over the contract for construction of wayside amenities on government land to private individuals without fair criteria. Chennithala said the government inducted two individuals – OV Musthafa and Baju George Parappad – in the company Overseas Keralites Investment Holding Pvt Ltd, in which 74% of shares are held by non-resident Keralites and 26% by the government. He said that Musthafa is a director in 14 companies and government should reveal the criteria for choosing the two new directors in the company. The company had reached an agreement with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for coming up with wayside amenities in August 2019. Government chose Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Wayanad to launch the first three wayside units. Chennithala said that in Alappuzha, government earmarked 2-4 acres from Steel Industries Kerala and Norka department has, in principle, given permission to come up with wayside amenities centre on this land. He said government has minority shares in the company and that it is facilitating a process whereby its land will go into the hands of private players. He said that the government’s original move was through PWD and revenue department – which is the actual custodian of the government land – was not aware of the move and it then had taken a strong exception to the move. Chennithala said he had raised the matter in the assembly with proof: a letter by revenue minister E Chandrasekharan, who had taken a stand against PWD move in this regard. The opposition leader, while seeking the memorandum of understanding with IOC in this regard, demanded that the revenue minister must come up with his opinion on this project. He also asked if the matter had secured a clearance from the cabinet, and why the project is not being handed over to IOC despite the firm expressing interest to undertake the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/irregularities-in-wayside-amenities-centres-deal-ramesh/articleshow/78541904.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Bengaluru||No connectivity: Students sit in bus stand to attend online classes||KARWAR: With connectivity almost non-existent in the homes, students of three villages in Devalamakki gram panchayat, Karwar taluk, converge on a bus stand nearby every day to access the internet and attend online classes. Connectivity is a huge problem in forest and hilly areas in the Western Ghats in Uttara Kannada and it has put pressure on students as they have to find a spot from where they can connect. Devalamakki, about 28km from Karwar, comprises eight villages and three of them, Nage, Shirve and Kove, have no mobile network. Shirve is located on a steep hill, while Nage and Kove are surrounded by thick forests. There is only one mobile tower — belonging to BSNL — in Devalamakki. The three villages have 26 houses and a population of 1,500 of which 10% are students. These students now either have to walk or ride a bicycle every day to find a spot from where they can access the net. Some of them sit in shops, while others sit in bus stops or a friend’s house. “We are all poor agriculturists, but we want our children to get an education. With classes now online, we had to buy mobile phones which were of no use till now,” said Nagaraj Padwalkar, a local. Others said, “These villages are rich in greenery and are tourist destinations. People come here to trek. But we lack basic facilities like a mobile network. Government should think about it.” Prajwal Shet, a villager, said people’s representatives in the area should come forward to solve the problem students face by erecting new mobile network towers in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-connectivity-students-sit-in-bus-stand-to-attend-online-classes/articleshow/78541419.cms||---

October 8, 2020||Mysuru||Authorities scale up liquid oxygen production in Mysuru||MYSURU: One of the major concerns reported at several states and a few parts of the state recently is the shortage in Oxygen supply for Covid-19 patients. The shortage has been attributed to several reasons including unavailability of sufficient tankers. To enough oxygen supply to Covid hospitals, liquid oxygen plants are coming up in all districts. In Mandya, two such small plants are proposed in the taluk hospitals at Srirangapatna and KR Pet. A 13,000-litre liquid oxygen plant is already operational at the district hospital in Mandya. “Now we are planning to set up two small plants in Srirangapatna and KR Pet taluk hospitals,” said District Health Officer Dr HP Manchegowda. The existing 6,000-litre liquid oxygen plant at the Mysuru district hospital will be upgraded into 13,000-litres. “It should happen this week,” said DC Rohini Sindhuri. “It will ensure oxygen supply under correct pressure for two days. It will also enable us to increase 200 oxygen beds at KR hospital,” she said. In neighbouring Kodagu district, a new liquid oxygen plant is expected to be available for use soon. “By October 10, it will be inaugurated,” said Kodagu DC Annies Kanmani Joy. The new plant at the district Covid hospital will have a capacity of 13,000 litres. Once it becomes operational, 300 oxygen beds can be supplied with oxygen continuously for 15 days. According to authorities, presently oxygen is being brought to Kodagu from Mysuru every day. Authorities added that once the pandemic abates, oxygen for two – three months can be stored in the plant. It will be helpful to patients in case of natural disasters. In Chikkamagalur district, work for a 6,000-litre plant is completed. “We have ordered for liquid oxygen. Once it is delivered, the plant will become operational,” said DC Dr Bagadi Gautham.

October 8, 2020||Nagpur||Real test for NU as final year exams begin today||Nagpur: Nagpur University is entering into a new era of technology-driven examinations from Thursday when its final year papers would start from 9.30am. It would be a historic occasion for the university that would be celebrating its 100th centenary in a couple of years, as it switches over to online exams from the traditional pen and paper format. Over 75,000 students will appear in their first ever online exams that will conclude on October 31. Although pushed by the Covid-19 pandemic to conduct online exams, it would be also a test for NU officials as they too, would be embarking on the new era where the exams are being held on a mobile phone, which seemed impossible, a couple of months back. According to NU officials, although it was students’ exam, it would be a bigger test for them, as they would be experimenting with such an exam pattern for the first time and complaints were pouring in hundreds every day. They however assured that the students shouldn’t worry as even a zero score can help them get a degree, provided their score was over 70% in internal exams conducted by their respective colleges. On Wednesday, NU finally launched four helplines as against ten announced by it after receiving a host of complaints from aggrieved students, who’re also struggling with the new format of MCQ tests. Even a number of top officials from the Exam Section, including the Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable is also posted on NU website. The examinees can contact any of these numbers for their difficulties. “We’re working round the clock to make it successful. Yesterday only, we worked till 2.30 in night, while some of our employees went home this morning. Many other universities had already conducted online exams and it turned out to be a flop. It’s a real test for us just like students. We’ve set up a control room comprising NU and Promarc officials for helping out the students. The university would be conducting 191 exams in four different faculties, of which 20 papers are scheduled on the first day,” Sable told TOI.

October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||Haryana sets up purchase centre for UP farmers in Karnal district||KARNAL: The Haryana government has set up a separate purchase centre at Mohidinpur village located at the Haryana-Uttar Pradesh border in Karnal district for UP farmers and even started procuring paddy there. The farmers from other states have to first register themselves on the e-portal to sell their produce, after which they would be called as per the schedule in the online portal. To facilitate such farmers, the online registration is being done on the spot. The procurement here was started on arhtiyas (commission agents)’s demand, as there are several farmers who have been selling their produce to the arhtiyas in Haryana for the past couple of years and they had even borrowed money from them in advance. But, following the directive of the government that procurement from other states would be done only after Haryana's produce was procured, setting up a separate centre for the UP farmers was the only way out. Earlier, the farmers from adjoining states were stopped at the borders from entering the state to sell their produce at the state government-run mandis in Haryana. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “A temporary purchase centre has been established at a stadium in Mohidinpur village. The farmers from outside the state can bring their paddy along with the necessary papers to show that they had sown paddy in their fields as an owner or tenant.” He also said: “Their registration on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal is being done on the spot. They can also register themselves on the portal on their own.” DC Yadav also took stock of paddy procurement at Mohidinpur village and ordered quick lifting. Till Tuesday evening, 12.50 lakh quintal paddy was procured at 13 purchase centres of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-sets-up-purchase-centre-for-up-farmers-in-karnal-dist/articleshow/78543336.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||Growers upset as snag in govt portals delays procurement||AMBALA: Amid the ongoing paddy procurement, farmers of the district are facing inconvenience as Meri Fasal-Mera Byora (MFMB) and e-Kharid portals have gone slow due to server issues and some of them are waiting for gate passes to bring their produce to the Ambala City grain market for the last several days. Demanding smooth procurement of paddy, the farmers have been protesting under the banner of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Haryana for about one week now at the city grain market. They alleged that the government is intentionally harassing farmers with delay tactics, so that they are forced to sell their paddy to private players. Harkesh Singh of Teja Mohri village said, “Since the very start of paddy procurement, the MFMB and e-Kharid portals of the government are not working properly. They are harassing and forcing us to sell our produce privately. In one instance, a farmer registered about 250 quintals of paddy on MFMB portal, but he received the message for procurement of only one quintal.” Another farmer Jai Singh of Jalbera village said, “After our continuous protest, senior officials visited the Ambala City mandi and promised to take paddy with 19% moisture after relaxing the condition from 17%, but on Wednesday, they again started insisted on procurement of paddy with 17% moisture only.” Ambala City market committee secretary Asha Rani said, “There is some problem in the MFMB website in entire Haryana. It is running slow, which is taking more time to process the requests. We have faced problems in issuing timely gate passes to the farmers and it has been communicated to the senior officials. It is a new portal and may take some time to run smoothly. Gate passes are not being denied, but it is taking time.” In protest against the inconvenience faced by the farmers, arhtiyas and labourers, Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel on Wednesday staged a protest outside Haryana Vidhan Sabha for about one hour against additional chief secretary (ACS) P K Das of Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department. The MLA alleged, “The government has made pro-people policies, but due to one official’s dictatorial behaviour, the farmers, traders and labourers of the state are facing harassment. I will stage another protest on Monday if the arrangements do not improve.” Responding to the charges, ACS Das said, “The government has made good arrangements for Kharif season procurements. As for the protest by the MLA, it is his political activity, and being a government official, I do not want to comment on that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/growers-upset-as-snag-in-govt-portals-delays-procurement/articleshow/78543337.cms||Jaskaran Singh

October 8, 2020||Nagpur||Ex-min launches IBF for bamboo sector’s growth||Nagpur: In a bid to boost commercial use of bamboo, former railway minister Suresh Prabhu has conceptualized Indian Bamboo Forum (IBF) by bringing together a voluntary group of over 50 committed leaders in the sector who dare to dream big and are willing to give their time to help build the sector for a green economy. The IBF aims at connecting limited islands of excellence with one-another by linking all relevant stakeholders — nurseries, farmers, foresters, enterprises that do the treatment, primary & secondary producers of a range of products, architects, contractors, designers, training institutions, R&D bodies, academic organizations, policymakers, bankers, traders, machinery suppliers and many more. “The forum will work with stakeholders from institutions in India and abroad, policymakers and industry and identify specific thematic areas that require resolution at the state and national eco-systems” said Prabhu at the launch of IBF. Prabhu said, “Five such areas of national importance have already been identified to create a dedicated knowledge dissemination portal, adequacy of technical standards, skill development, provision of mentorship to bamboo start-ups, and a platform for facilitating buyer-seller linkages of bamboo products.” Prabhu recalled how growth of this sector would meet his aspirations for self-reliance and sustainability in line with ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ by making bamboo as an icon of growth. He said bamboo will help prevent deforestation, create jobs, and help increase farmers’ income and suggested that IBF must link itself with international institutions for collaborations, knowledge-sharing, and usage of advanced technology. Prabhu announced IBF will work together to remove the bottlenecks in the bamboo sector and ensure an assured and well-oiled supply chain. It will ensure availability of high-quality bamboo products not only by the use of latest technology and superior processes, but also promoting growth of high-quality bamboo species demanded by the market and ensuring availability of growing material in partnership with agricultural universities, he said. Prabhu laid down a road map for catalysing a green economy in India — one that will ensure regular and increased income to farmers, employment generation and entrepreneurship opportunities for youth and women, an end to deforestation and revival of economy ensuring social, economic, environmental, and cultural benefits to people. He also underlined the importance of integrating bamboo industry with the global economy and linking the IBF to international networks. He said about 2.5 billion people in the world depend economically on bamboo, and international trade in bamboo amounts to about $4.5 million. In India, bamboo has the potential to benefit more than 4 million small farmers and 1.5 million micro-entrepreneurs in next five years, he added.

October 8, 2020||Bengaluru||Covid warrior’s website, put together from hospital bed, a big draw||Bengaluru: Confined to the four walls of a Covid ward, Ameen e Mudassar was on the other side of the fence, moving as he did from a corona warrior to a patient. As a warrior through the lockdown, he had seen people go through immense hardship, but as a patient he witnessed hurdles like never before. The biggest problem was a black hole of information and the lack of a single point of contact to answer queries around testing, treatment and government guidelines. It didn’t take long for Mudassar to surmount the problem. On July 11, barely 24 hours after he was admitted to hospital, began work on a website that would serve as a one-stop spot for all Covid-19 related queries — from beds’ availability to latest BBMP guidelines. His website, https://covidhelplinebangalore.com, was launched on July 17 and has garnered 10 lakh page views and 1,45,000 users from across the globe till date. “When I tested positive, I got all the information because of my connections, but not everyone can,” the resident of Ilyas Nagar told TOI. Mudassar had earlier begun volunteering with Mercy Mission and realised that not many knew about BBMP guidelines, quarantine rules or about free treatment available under government quota. “A central repository of the information is important and some of my friends and I started with bringing all the information under one umbrella – like government guidelines, list of Covid Care Centres, testing centres, oxygen cylinders and ambulance services,” he said. The team included Imran (Eplus), Mohammed Zabeeulla, Ibrahim Khaleelullah Khan, Isaq Ahmed Khan, Tauseef Ahmed, Mohammed Ismail, Abdul Razak Naidu and Mohammed Shoaib. The group’s video on ‘Cashless Free COVID-19 Treatment in Private Hospitals of Bangalore’ received 15,000 views (Kannada) and 9,000 (Hindi) in just five days. Mudassar, CEO of Cigma, a Bengaluru-based career counselling organisation, has 20 years of experience in the field. “Websites have always been my strong point. It helps in systematic assembling of the information flood,” he said. In September, features like ‘Hospital Bed Request’ and ‘Plasma Request’ were added to the website. They have since then received 166 plasma requests and 20 bed requests. “We connect Plasma Requests with plasma donation groups and our volunteers from the Emergency Response Team guide people on hospital beds,” he said, adding that they also help people from disadvantaged background whenever possible. “Because of a lack of information, people from underprivileged background end up shelling Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000 per day on treatment. Our aim to spread awareness and reach out to as many people as possible,” he said. The group now plans to address different challenges. “We want to create a directory of plasma donors and connect with citizens on different levels. We also want to support students in need with donations of books, laptops and other necessities,” Mudassar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-warriors-website-put-together-from-hospital-bed-a-big-draw/articleshow/78541459.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||Buy paddy from farmers in villages, KCR tells officials||HYDERABAD: Owing to lack of marketing facilities for farmers due to the pandemic, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the officials to make arrangements for purchase of paddy in full scale in villages also. He complimented the farmers for cultivating red gram in 10.78 lakh acres as directed under the regulatory farming policy of the state and asked officials to purchase red gram also. Government agencies would be sent to the villages to procure entire paddy crop of ‘vaanakalam’ (kharif or rainy season crop) as was done during March and May this year in view of the lockdown. He directed the officials to ensure that the farmers get their money immediately along with the bank guarantee and sought to advise the farmers not to spend their energy and time on taking their paddy produce to the markets. The CM on Wednesday held a review meeting for the second consecutive day on paddy procurement and said the minimum support price (MSP) for A-grade paddy with less than 17% moisture has been fixed at Rs 1,888 per quintal and the MSP for B-grade variety is Rs 1,868 per quintal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/buy-paddy-from-farmers-in-villages-kcr-tells-officials/articleshow/78543347.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Hyderabad||India’s realty biggies eye Rs 600 crore secretariat complex contract||HYDERABAD: Multiple construction companies which have evinced interest to take up the construction of Rs 600 crore new secretariat complex have sought mobilisation advance and extension of construction period from 12 months to 18 months. Tata Projects, Shapoorji Pallonji, Larsen and Toubro (L&T), Mumbai-based JMC projects and Uttar Pradesh Project Ltd, a UP state government undertaking have purchased the bid documents for the construction of the new secretariat complex. Representatives from these five construction giants on Wednesday attended a pre-bid conference in which they urged the Telangana government to include the provision of mobilization advance in the contract for construction of secretariat complex. They said at least 5% of the total contract value should be given as mobilization advance to start the works. They also said the state government should consider increasing the construction period from 12 months to 18 months as the contract involves a built-up area of 7 lakh square feet on two acres, landscaping and parking among other facilities in the remaining area of the over 25-acre secretariat complex. However, officials of the Roads and Buildings department made it clear the mobilization advance clause will not be incorporated in the contract agreement. “There is no policy to offer mobilsation advance to the contractor. The government will pay the contractor as and when bills are produced based on the extent of completion of work,” a senior R&B official told TOI. The issue of extending the construction completion period from 12 months to 18 months would be taken to the notice of the chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for a final decision,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indias-realty-biggies-eye-rs-600-cr-secretariat-complex-contract/articleshow/78543367.cms||Roushan Ali
October 8, 2020||Jaipur||Injured tigress MT-4 back in Mukundra after laser therapy||JAIPUR: Tigress MT-4, the only surviving big cat at the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR), which was shifted to a biological park for treatment, was released into the wild again on Tuesday. The forest department decided to release the tigress in the 24-hectare enclosure at Darrah range from captivity after injuries were recovered. A senior official said, "The tigress was given laser therapy and can be kept under observation for nearly 10 days. The test reports of the big cat were normal. After consulting a team of experts, the decision was taken to shift the tigress into the wild." The tigress was tranquillised and treated for soft muscle tissue injury on left triceps and front paw on September 10, due to which it was limping. However, after it did not show sign of recovery, on September 26 the department after consulting Wildlife Institute of India (WII) experts shifted the tigress to a biological park. The tigress, which is nearly four years old, was relocated to the 82sqkm enclosure at Darrah range in MHTR from Ranthambore National Park (RNP) in December 2018. In June this year, it was spotted with two cubs. However, the cubs could not survive at the park. The tiger count, which had risen to six in June as per official figures, including the newborns, is now down to one. The tiger reserve, which was notified in 2013 and was on verge of dying a premature death got a breather with the presence of this tigress. The forest department releasing the tigress into the wild at MHTR has renewed hopes of environmentalists that more big cats could be reintroduced. "Survival of tigress MT-4 was extremely necessary. Unfortunately, if tigress could not have recovered, it would have taken years again to reintroduce tigers in the area. Now, it has recovered, sooner or later, the department will also bring in a tiger," said a green activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/injured-tigress-mt-4-back-in-mukundra-after-laser-therapy/articleshow/78543345.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Kolkata||Beer prices head south, spread festive cheer in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Prices of beers across all segments will come down next week, following a new notification issued by West Bengal State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) on Wednesday. As per the new price structure, price of light beer will come down by 25%-40% while for strong beer the drop will be 15-20%, making the beverage one of the cheapest in the country. The move is being viewed as an attempt to boost the demand for beer. Due to Covid and lockdown, the beer industry has been hit hard. “The peak season for beer that accounts for 70% of sales is March to July 31. We shall have to see how the move benefits us now,” a top executive of a beer company said. President of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar welcomed the move. He said, “The new beer rates will be very helpful for bars and restaurants. With reduced prices, it will become affordable for patrons to drink their favourite beers in bars and this would also boost food sales.” Bevco had asked Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and beer companies to submit tenders in the first week of September for registration of ex-distillery price (EDP) and ex-brewery (EBP) price along with registration of logo and brand. Annually, 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL that includes whisky, rum, vodka and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer are sold in West Bengal. IMFL and beer industries in the state were facing a major crisis, following the Covid-induced lockdown and steep increase in sales tax on liquor in April this year. For the beer market, there was an average degrowth of over 85% while for IMFL, the average fall in sales was around 30% from April-July. The figure of IMFL compiled by Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has shown that in April the fall in sales was 84% followed by 37% in May and 27% in June. The trend continued in July and August as well.

October 8, 2020||Kochi||Kochi: Pompe patient delivers healthy baby||KOCHI: Detected with a rare metabolic disorder called Pompe disease, which damages muscle and nerve cells throughout the body, a 24-year-old fashion designer became ‘the first in the country with this condition to deliver a healthy baby’ at a city hospital. Experts estimate that 5,000 to 10,000 people have Pompe disease worldwide “This is the first recorded case of a Pompe patient in India who underwent the entire cycle of pregnancy to deliver a healthy baby. This was only possible as the patient was put on life-saving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT),” said to Dr Sheela Nampoothiri, head of paediatric genetics, Amrita Hospital. Around six years ago, she was diagnosed with juvenile onset of Pompe disease. When she first came to the hospital, she had difficulty even climbing a bus, with one person needing to push her inside the bus and another pull her inside. But after treatment, her condition improved. Doctors performed a caesarean surgery on the Kollam native. The baby, which weighed 2.8kg at birth, does not carry the defective gene and is free of Pompe disease. “This case is a testimony that patients diagnosed with rare diseases like Pompe can lead a near normal life if they are put on life-saving treatment early,” added Dr Sheela. The state government had recently started infusion therapy on two toddlers diagnosed with Pompe disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pompe-patientdelivers-healthy-baby/articleshow/78540895.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Mubarak Pasha to become first VC of Narayana Guru Open University||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Putting an end to speculations, state cabinet has decided to recommend P M Mubarak Pasha as first vice-chancellor of Narayana Guru Open University. A former director of Calicut University’s distance-education wing, Pasha had served as the principal of Farooq College. He is currently the head of governance and strategic planning at Oman-based National University of Science and Technology. The government would convey its decision to governor Arif Mohammed Khan for his stamp of approval. As per an ordinance promulgated for setting up the open university headquartered in Kollam, the state government has the right to appoint the first vice-chancellor, pro-vice- chancellor and other key statutory officers without resorting to UGC-recommended proceedings otherwise applicable for selecting candidates to such key positions. SN College former principal S V Sudheer would become the first pro-vice-chancellor and P N Dileep, a faculty at TKM College of Engineering, Kollam, and additional private secretary of higher education minister K T Jaleel would assume charge as the registrar of the university. The government decision has come as a shocker in academic circles as many were expecting the government to pick K Prabhash of Kerala University as the vice- chancellor. Prabhash, a professor in political science, had done the ground work for the setting up of the university by working as the special officer. Sources say the government had decided to leave out Left-leaning Prabhash so as to strike a communal balance by appointing Pasha in the post. Though the government wanted to appoint a Muslim candidate as the vice-chancellor of Calicut University, the chancellor had chosen a non-Muslim candidate to the post and hence, this selection to the post of vice-chancellor is considered to make up for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mubarak-pasha-to-become-first-vc-of-narayana-guru-open-university/articleshow/78542094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Imambada police booked Rahul Meshram, a resident of Gangabai Ghat, and one Jamnalal in this regard and trying to trace the woman. Police sources said that the 28-year-old woman was married some six years ago. She soon separated from her husband who was a drunkard. She was staying in a rented flat and worked with a catering firm. Later, she shifted to another flat in Gangabai Ghat area with Meshram. They were in a live-in relationship for the last six months, said the police sources. Meshram and Jamnalal reportedly took her to Rajasthan on the pretext of visiting historical places there and placing her with an event management company. Police said on October 6 the woman called her mother to tell that Meshram and Jamnalal had reportedly solemnized her marriage with a person in Rajasthan and didn’t inform anybody about it. They also took Rs2.50 lakh from the man for the marriage, the mother informed the Imambada police. In her complaint filed on October 6, the mother told police that her daughter is being harassed there. Sources said though the mother received the call on October 6, the woman was in Rajasthan for the last many months. The police have booked Meshram and Jamnalal under sections 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Sources said PSI Priyanka Bhoyar under senior PI M Salunkhe is investigating the matter. The police have already put the mobile numbers of both the suspected accused under surveillance. They will be arrested soon, said police.

October 8, 2020||Nagpur||Netas demand shoot order for Rajura tiger||Chandrapur: The demand has intensified to shoot down problem tiger RT-1 responsible for eight human kills in Rajura and neighbouring forest ranges. Attempts to capture the tiger, which has terrorized more than dozen villages, for over eight months have failed. Ex-MLA and BJP leader Sudharshan Nimkar and three-time former MLA of Shetkari Sanghatna, Wamanrao Chatap, said three extensions of order to capture the tiger proof of forest officials’ failure. “The tiger is killing people in their farms and hence there is no alternative but to shoot it down,” Nimkar told TOI. Nimkar claimed that farmers and farm labourers are afraid to go to fields to harvest their crops. Chatap has dashed a mail to forest minister Sanjay Rathod demanding immediate shooting orders for RT-1. “People in Rajura and Virur ranges and forest around Lathi are living in terror. They entirely depend on farming but losing crop to nature’s fury thanks to tiger terror,” he said. He claimed that shooting orders should be issued for RT-1 like in the case of tigers at Ralegaon, Pandharkawda and Bramhapuri. ‘10 human kills’ Both Nimkar and Chatap have pegged the number of human victims of Rajura tiger at 10. Nimkar informed that forest officials are excluding the two human kills in neighbouring FDCM range, where a person each from Parsodi and Tohgaon were killed by the same tiger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/netas-demand-shoot-order-for-rajura-tiger/articleshow/78542025.cms||---
October 8, 2020||Chandigarh||HC: Can’t direct state to decide owners’ land pleas||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that it cannot issue directions to the state for deciding the representation by land owners to de-notify land under acquisition. The high court division bench of Justice Daya Chaudhary and Justice Meenakhi I Mehta passed the order while interpreting Section 101A of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, which covers de-notification of land under acquisition. The bench was of the view that it cannot issue writ of mandamus to the state to decide the representation of the landowners regarding de-notification of the parcel of land, as it will multiply litigations. It observed that the basis of mandamus is the existence of a right in the person concerned and a corresponding duty upon the respondents. The duty must be of public nature and not just a matter of discretion, held the high court. The bench, which disposed of two petitions filed by Karnal residents, had to decide whether liberty to approach the state government under Section 101A of the Act can be given to the land owner, whose land has been acquired by the state. “No doubt the said provision is an enabling provision for the state to exercise such power to de-notify the land but does not give any legal right to the land owner to approach the state government. When it is clear that the power is discretionary and does not confer any corresponding legal right upon the individual right owner, the same is thus, outside the purview of the jurisdiction of this court. Grant of such a liberty would mean commending the government to consider the case under Section 101A of the Act, 2013 which is though only an enabling provision that too de-notifying the entire acquired land and not just a parcel of land …,” the bench held. Section 101A of the Act, 2013 was inserted in the Act by way of amendment in 2017. It is an enabling provision, whereby the state government has been vested a right to de-notify if the public purpose for which the land has been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 has become unviable or non-essential and no right accrues in favour of land owner to represent the state to de-notify his/her land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-cant-direct-state-to-decide-owners-land-pleas/articleshow/78543349.cms||Ajay Sura

Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Institute of Archaeology’s advertisement, inviting online application from eligible candidates for a postgraduate diploma course in archaeology says those with a masters degree in ancient or medieval Indian history/ archaeology/ Indian classical languages such as Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Arabic or Persian are eligible to apply. The intake of candidates for the two-year course is 15. Candidates with a PG degree in other cassical languages like Tamil are not eligible as per the advert. DMK leader M K Stalin and MDMK leader Vaiko slammed ASI and the Modi government for neglecting Tamil from the classical language category and thereby denying Tamil scholars from pursuing the course. Stalin took to social media and tweeted condemning the Centre for ignoring Tamil language and Tamils’ welfare and urged the people of the state to speak up against this. “The Centre has been continuously neglecting Tamil language, its rich culture, and history. The advertisement of ASI’s institute is yet another indication that the Centre is ignoring Tamil,” Madurai MP and writer Su Venkatesan told TOI. It was not a clerical errort, he said, adding, “It has been done intentionally to stop Tamil scholars from enrolling under the course and reduce their opportunities in central-run educational institutions.” Vaiko in a statement said the Centre has been trying to establish one nation, one religion and one language. And the BJP government has been trying to impose Hindi and Sanskrit. The Centre should understand it is against the nation’s plurality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/asi-institutes-ad-sparks-fresh-row-over-language/articleshow/78542001.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

Police said at around 8.30pm, Kamlesh Meshram, 25, a resident of Marwadi Chawl in Itwari, was on way to deliver an order on Amravati road. While he was taking a right turn from Bole petrol pump square towards RTO, the speeding car coming from opposite direction hit his two-wheeler head-on, dragging Meshram for about 100 metres. The car driver sped away after the accident. Meshram had a miraculous escape with injuries to his leg. Passers-by rushed him to a hospital. Later, Meshram lodged a complaint against the four-wheeler driver. Eyewitnesses said the car was driven by a minor who was accompanied by his friends. Despite having car’s registration number (MH31DV 5260) and footage from CCTV cameras, Sitabuldi police is yet to start investigations even 24 hours after the accident, said sources. “We are yet to find out the car owner and who was driving it,” said a cop. Sitabuldi senior PI J Rajput said the car was involved in only one accident, but eyewitnesses said while fleeing via Raja Rani Square on East High Court Road, the car was involved in two more accidents, first near Tirpude College and then on WCL Road. Residents said rash and negligent driving has increased manifold due to casual approach of traffic police. The roads criss-crossing Civil Lines under Sitabuldi traffic zone have become a hub for youngsters indulging in bike and four-wheeler racing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/speeding-car-injures-man-delivering-food/articleshow/78542082.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

October 8, 2020||Nagpur||Why shouldn’t top cops be shunted for failure to regulate traffic: HC||Nagpur: Slamming traffic police for remaining busy on mobile phones while on duty, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed DCP traffic and higher authorities to ensure that constables should be in the middle of squares on duty. Granting a last chance to the police department to take corrective measures, bring discipline, and have control over traffic constables, a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Pushpa Ganediwala warned they would be constrained to direct the government to shift “incompetent and inefficient” higher officials, who were unable to control their subordinates. “The authorities needn’t be under an impression that traffic is regulated by signals and traffic constables are merely to watch and enjoy violation of rules and jumping of signals. Impression has been created among the public that constables are controlling DCP (Traffic). We’re adjourning the hearing till October 15 to check improvement in the situation.” Calling it high time to take serious and effective steps to control or regulate activities of traffic constables, the bench said this would automatically result in discipline and control of traffic. “We gather an impression that traffic constables are controlling their bosses and attitude of tolerance in respect of negligence in performance or dereliction of duties by them is shown.” The directives while hearing a suo motu PIL (No7/2019) on rampant traffic violations where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae assisted by Nidhi Dayani. Pointing out that he had himself lodged a complaint against a female constable who was busy on her mobile phone during duties at Mohammed Rafi Square, justice Deshpande said HC was continuously witnessing male and female constables engaging their handsets, completely unaware of traffic violations. “We are continuously witnessing wilful and persistent neglect in discharge of duties by constables. They’re not found controlling or regulating traffic, even during peak hours. In September 18, 2019, we noted that if constables are made to stand in middle of the road, they wouldn’t engage in mobiles and focus on regulating the traffic. We however don’t find any improvement in the situation till date.” Backing the concept of having traffic booths at the centre of squares, the judges said objective was to regulate and control traffic. “It was expected after HC’s orders that constables could be seen doing their duties. But a sorry state of affairs is prevailing all over. The flying squad is required to be constituted to monitor and supervise their activities. The authorities should now use CCTV cameras to find out whether they're doing duties or engaged in mobiles,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-shouldnt-top-cops-be-shunted-for-failure-to-regulate-traffic-hc/articleshow/78542053.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
