---||India||1-year extension for IB, RAW chiefs; J&K chief secretary shifted to Delhi||NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday announced a year’s extension for Intelligence Bureau director Arvinda Kumar and RAW chief Samant Kumar Goel, making way for continuity at the helm of its intelligence apparatus. The two-year fixed term of both the officers was due to end on June 30, 2021, but now stands extended to June 30, 2022. In another important move, the government replaced Jammu & Kashmir chief secretary B V R Subrahmanyam with Arun Kumar Mehta, currently finance commissioner in the J&K department of finance. Subrahmanyam, the Chhattisgarh-cadre IAS officer believed to have been handpicked by the prime minister three years ago to head the bureaucracy in J&K, had seen the erstwhile state through crucial phases such as President’s rule, abrogation of Article 370 and its reorganization into Union territory. He was on Thursday appointed as OSD in the department of commerce here and will take over as commerce secretary upon the superannuation of incumbent Anup Wadhawan on June 30, 2021. The extension for Kumar, a 1984 batch IPS officer from Assam-Meghalaya cadre, and Goel, a Punjab-cadre IPS officer from the same batch, was given in relaxation of FR 56(J) and Rule 16(1A) of All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rule, 1958. Both the officers enjoy a good rapport with NSA Ajit Doval. While the line of succession in IB is not quite affected by Kumar’s extended term, a couple of senior officers in RAW will retire before the end of Goel’s extended term. The one-year extension for Kumar and Goel is particularly interesting as it comes just after senior IPS officers like Rakesh Asthana and Y C Modi were left out of the race for CBI director’s post when Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, citing a March 2019 ruling of the Supreme Court, insisted on considering only officers with a minimum six-month remainder service. The high-powered selection committee comprising the Prime minister, CJI and leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha finally cleared a panel of three seniormost officers with more than six months of remaining service. Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, one of the 3 officers in the panel, has been appointed as CBI director. There was some speculation about ramifications of the six-month rule applied in the CBI director’s choice, for other DG-level appointments at the Centre, particularly those with fixed-term like DIB and RAW chief. Official sources had however told TOI that the SC ruling of 2019 pertained only to state DGP appointments. Incidentally, Thursday’s decision on Kumar and Goel is merely a case of extension and not fresh appointments. Earlier in 2018, the government had granted a six-month extension to then DIB Rajiv Jain and RAW chief Anil Dhasmana, but that was linked to the approaching Lok Sabha poll in April-May 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1-year-extension-for-ib-raw-chiefs-jk-chief-secretary-shifted-to-delhi/articleshow/83017565.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Times face-off: Is Central Vista an ill-timed vanity project or a much-needed makeover||FOR: RAM MADHAV Vista project is both a matter of pride and necessity. It won’t hit Covid workThe overnight transformation of Nehru-Gandhi parivar bhakts into Lutyens’ bhakts is quite intriguing. Their opposition to the Central Vista Project on the facile grounds that many ‘heritage’ buildings in the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) are being destroyed is totally misplaced. The Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone that houses government offices including Rashtrapati Bhavan was developed by Edward Lutyens over a decade in 1921-31. Lutyens, a lesser-known architect in London, became famous in India because of the opportunity to build a few important structures like the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House, India Gate and North and South Blocks in Delhi. Contrary to the Opposition’s propaganda, none of these heritage structures is being demolished under the Central Vista project. Historical records suggest that all other buildings in the LBZ were built with a paucity of time and resources and do not carry any real heritage value. Renowned hotelier and architectural restorer Aman Nath described the buildings in LBZ as a “design compromise” to “overcome a diminished budget and yet cover the maximum land area.” Incidentally, it was during the UPA 2 government in 2012 that the proposal for constructing a new Parliament House was envisaged initially. Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar had recommended constituting a high-powered committee to suggest an alternative complex for the Parliament citing increased footfall, insufficient space and challenges of structural stability as the reasons. Those concerns were genuine. The present Parliament was built in 1921-27 to host the Imperial Legislative Council and Central Legislative Assembly during British rule. The Constituent Assembly had held its meetings in it during 1946-49. The building has been serving as the Parliament House since 1950, housing both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. India’s population and political activity have grown manifold in the last seven decades. After the delimitation in 2026, a substantial increase in the strength of both Houses is also anticipated. The present structure will thus be insufficient to cater to the growing needs of the Indian democracy. The other bungalows in the LBZ have also become grossly inadequate for the functioning of government ministries. Successive regimes, including those of the Congress, had to make many structural modifications to them prompting the London-based Lutyens’ Trust to rush to Delhi in 2008 to discuss their preservation. Currently, 39 out of 51 ministries are partly or fully housed in the LBZ area. Many ministries have rented office spaces outside the area incurring annual expenditure of over Rs 1,000 crore. These factors led PM Modi to set the ball in motion for the construction of the Central Vista project in 2019. It involves construction of a new People’s Parliament, a Central Vista from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan, a new complex for the Vice President and a new house for the PM. First part of the five-year project, which includes a new Parliament building and the new Central Vista, is expected to be completed by 2022 when India celebrates 75 years of its independence. It will naturally be a matter of pride for every Indian. The government has put criticism to rest by assuring that all the significant heritage and cultural artefacts, presently housed at the National Museum, National Archives and Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), will be carefully preserved. The National Museum will be relocated to the North and South Blocks, and is expected to have 3.5 times more space —–from the current 25,500 sqm to approximately 80,000 sqm. The entire Central Vista project is expected to be completed by 2024. Necessary budgetary allocation for the project cost of about Rs 13,500 crore has been made in 2019 itself. That brings annual expenditure to just around Rs 2,700 crore. No additional spending is happening beyond the previously sanctioned budget. Covid relief activity is not getting hampered in any way. The government has already allocated over Rs 35,000 crore for the vaccination drive in the country. Construction projects have been exempted from Covid restrictions in all states. In fact, many major infrastructure projects have been in progress in the country. The cash-starved Maharashtra government has issued tenders for a 900-crore redevelopment of the MLA hostel at Nariman Point in Mumbai recently. The Chhattisgarh government stalled construction work of the new Raj Bhavan, Assembly and CM House only after BJP president J P Nadda pointed out the duplicity of the Congress few days ago. Congress’ opposition to the project appears more about legacy than about the pandemic. Having named hundreds of institutions after one family, they seem worried that the Nehru-Gandhi legacy of institution-building was being usurped by Modi’s men. They are ridiculing the new PM House as ‘Modi ka ghar’. But it was they who slyly converted the actual PM House at Teen Murti into the Nehru Memorial Museum after Jawaharlal Nehru’s demise in 1964. The new Central Vista is not going to be the legacy of any individual or party. It is the need of the hour and a matter of pride for an Atma Nirbhar nation. Ram Madhav is member of the national executive of the RSS AGAINST: NARAYANI GUPTAThe staging ground of our democracy is being bulldozed without debateThe Central Vista Redevelopment Project, since mid-2019, has been a race between a nimble hare clearing the fences of ‘permissions’, and a motley group of tortoises. Even as the tortoises carefully listed the faults in the selection process, the hare had skipped away to the bhoomi puja for the new Parliament building.  As the tortoises got down to scrutinising this new proposal, the hare nibbled the grass on the Rajpath lawns and put up a board reading “government land”. While the tortoises were dismayed at the prospect of the National Museum being relocated, the hare was giving brisk orders to the staff of IGNCA to parcel their documents and move to Janpath Hotel. When the tortoises reached the Vista, they found stern notices prohibiting entry. When the smallest tortoise started to write down the details that puzzled her, the hare looked over the barricade and mocked her: “But I told you the plan would be an evolving one!” The bulldozers, physical and verbal, grind slowly, and they grind exceeding fine. There have been no debates. There have been questions and criticism. These are sometimes answered, sometimes not. Here are some questions for the hare in a hurry: In 2019, didn’t the ministry promise a website for the project? Where is it? Axonometric drawings and models to scale are needed to get a sense of relative distances and heights. So far, all we have been shown is a sketch of brown rectangles on a green ground. The number of blocks and their positions kept changing over the months (the plan, in the architect’s signature phrase, keeps ‘evolving’). This week, his firm’s website uploaded a plan showing five towers north of Rajpath, with four towers and a convention centre on the south. Is that final or is it still evolving? Even in 1912-13, there were lively debates about design, style, locations. This time, government officials — who are doing most of the speaking — tell us that the ensemble will be representative of the ‘New India’, that it is ‘state-of-the-art’ and ‘world-class’. Today’s state-of-the-art, we all know, is tomorrow’s obsolescent. As to ‘world-class’ — which world? There is a complete lack of clarity on heritage — its content, its relevance. It doesn’t help that heritage has become the prerogative of the Ministry of Urban Development, the DDA and the CPWD. The Ministry of Culture, the ASI and INTACH have been silent. In 1985, the citizens of Delhi viewed and discussed the models submitted by competitors for the IGNCA project. Why has there been no public conversation around the current project ? We, the people of India, are now forbidden entry to the Central Vista. We lost all 80-plus acres of our public space in March 2020 in violation of the 2021 master plan of Delhi. The officials who concocted the plan and the by-laws are impassive when they are bypassed. The CPWD both submits and approves plans ( “I’ll be judge I’ll be jury/ said cunning old Fury”). Much work is going on below the surface — the moles helping the hare — to lay out a tunnel for the Prime Minister to move from his new home to the new Parliament House. It is argued that performance will be improved by consolidation, by herding central government employees scattered elsewhere into nine towers. I wonder who thought that one up, when the country is being catapulted into digital connectivity? Does the humongous allocation for new buildings include that of demolishing 4,60,000 sqm of structures, that of transit accommodation for officials in Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue, or the interior of Janpath Hotel, repurposed for IGNCA? Whoever suffers losses in this annus horribilis, it certainly will not be contractors and builders. News reports announce in a matter-of-fact way that ‘three iconic buildings’ are to be demolished — the IGNCA, the National Archives Annexe, and the National Museum. These are not just bricks and mortar, they have been venues for the meeting of minds: will people remember Dr Sivaramamurti, Dr Sourin Roy, and Dr Kapila Vatsyayan? They were built up by the work of dozens of anonymous curators. The IGNCA was warned about its fate some months ahead, but the Museum was given notice only a few days ago; it takes months to prepare inventories, to pack with care, to plan new homes in North and South Blocks. Apparently one is to house objects and documents till 1857, while the other will focus on the two centuries after 1857. Which art historian in his/her right mind suggested that? A sub-project of ‘beautification’ is being carried out on the verges along Rajpath for Republic Day 2022. Perhaps they will set up barricades to hide the ruins on either side, as has been done in the past to hide our urban poor. Celebrate Republic Day? The War Memorial Arch, which we call India Gate, honours the war dead. For January 26, 2022 we need another memorial, another moment of silence — for those we have lost in the pandemic, who will never see the triumphal parade on the ‘beautified’ avenue. As for those who remain — will they be allowed to eat ice cream at India Gate again?

---||World||USDA rejects request for faster pork slaughterhouse speeds||DES MOINES: The US Department of Agriculture has declined a request by the pork industry to increase the speed at which pigs can be processed into meat, delivering a victory to slaughterhouse workers who had raised safety concerns about the plan.  The USDA announced Wednesday evening it would enforce a Minnesota judge's order issued in March. The judge struck down plans begun years ago but finalized by the USDA under former President Donald Trump's administration that would have lifted maximum line speeds at pork slaughterhouses, allowing dozens of plants to speed up production.  The United Food and Commercial Workers Union International, which represents 33,000 workers in the pork processing industry, welcomed the decision.  "President Biden made a commitment to strengthen safety protections for America's meatpacking workers on the frontlines of this pandemic. With today's USDA statement, the Biden administration is reaffirming its commitment to worker safety," union president Marc Perrone said Wednesday.  The USDA's decision followed a March 31 ruling by US District Judge Joan Ericksen, who had considered a lawsuit filed by the union and found the USDA acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to consider the impact of faster line speeds on worker safety. Ericksen ordered the rule to be vacated but delayed the effective date for 90 days to give the USDA and the industry "time to prepare for any operational change."  The National Pork Producers Council, a group representing pig farmers, this week asked the USDA to appeal the ruling, seek a stay while the appeal is considered and request the agency pursue a fast-tracked rule that would allow higher line speeds.  In a statement posted Wednesday on its website, the USDA said pork processing plants should prepare to revert to previous maximum line speeds as of June 30.  "The agency is committed to worker safety and ensuring a safe, reliable food supply. We will work with the establishments to comply with the court's ruling and minimize disruptions to the supply chain," the USDA said.  Pork processing plants in Hatfield, Pennsylvania; Coldwater, Michigan; Fremont, Nebraska; and Austin, Minnesota, have been working with the faster line speeds under a pilot project for years, and a plant in Guymon, Oklahoma, began faster speeds in 2019. Several others were expected to adopt faster speeds but plans were delayed by the pandemic.  The pork producers group had said the judge's ruling would force plants already operating at faster speeds to return to the previous maximum line speed of 1,106 hogs per hour, significantly less than the 1,450 hogs per hour some plants were processing.  In a statement, NPPC spokesman Jim Monroe said the organization is disappointed with the USDA decision "to support a flawed federal district court decision," adding that "irreparable harm will be exacted on small U.S. hog farmers when this court order goes into effect at the end of June 2021."  The group earlier said the judge's ruling will cut U.S. pork packing plant capacity by 2.5% and result in more than $80 million in reduced income for small hog farmers, according to an analysis conducted for the group by Iowa State University agricultural economist Dermot Hayes.  The group said it will pursue all avenues to reverse the court decision.  The Washington-based North American Meat Institute, a trade group for the meat processing industry, said the judge's ruling could have significant unintended consequences, including that "workers who will now have increased workloads as companies attempt to make up for lost production."  Hayes, in his analysis said some plant managers have told him they may add longer shifts or weekend work to keep up the production pace at slower rates.  The impact on consumer prices for ham, pork chops and bacon isn't immediately clear and will depend on how the industry responds. If the slower speeds cause processors to supply less pork to the market, "grocers and restaurants are left competing against each other for a small amount of pork, which would drive up wholesale and retail pork prices," said Jayson Lusk, head of the department of agricultural economics at Purdue University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/usda-rejects-request-for-faster-pork-slaughterhouse-speeds/articleshow/83019407.cms||---

The focus is on children, with apprehension that they could be the worst affected. From ramping up paediatric beds to prioritising vaccination for parents of kids below 12 years and formulating children-specific protocol, states are concentrating hard on paediatric Covid care along with other measures like setting up oxygen plants and establishing more testing labs. The UP government recently announced that priority would be given to parents of children below 12 years in vaccination. Goa wants to prioritise vaccination for lactating mothers with children below two years. Most states are either adding or earmarking beds for paediatric Covid care, including paediatric intensive care units (PICU), neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and sick newborn care units (SNCU). Sample this: Maharashtra, where the second wave took a heavy toll, has planned to increase paediatric Covid beds from the present 600 to 2,300. BMC commissioner Suresh Kakani said 500 beds will be added in Mumbai alone. In Uttarakhand, DRDO, which is setting up two hospitals, has planned a facility to house mothers of Covid-affected kids in paediatric sections. Odisha too has decided to allow one of the parents to accompany the child in hospital. Focused paediatric treatment protocols have been drawn up by West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Many states are setting up expert panel and task force to protect children. Delhi government is forming a special task force consisting of paediatricians, experts and senior IAS officers. Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Goa too have formed task force for paediatric cases. Jharkhand government recently reached out to experts in Delhi and Bengaluru to seek suggestions in fighting Covid among stunted and anaemic children in the state, which has 43% of its population in the below 18 years category. Training doctors is also a priority. While Maharashtra will train doctors to discern when to refer children to hospital/higher facility, Punjab will come up with training modules for doctors and paramedics. While a large part of efforts to counter the possible third wave is centred around children, states are also ramping up health infrastructure. West Bengal has given a one-time nod to state and private facilities to set up oxygen plants. While UP has asked medical colleges to set up plants by June-end, Maharashtra has chalked up a ‘Mission Oxygen’ plan under which it plans to increase the current production of liquid medical oxygen from 1,250 MT to 3,600 MT. Bengal also plans to create a parallel Covid healthcare network from primary to tertiary level and then delink it from non-Covid treatment.

---||World||Man accused of restaurant shooting charged in jail assault||PAPILLION: The man accused of killing two workers and wounding two others during a shooting at a Nebraska fast-food restaurant last fall has been charged with stabbing a fellow jail inmate. Roberto Silva Jr. has been charged with second-degree assault and using a weapon to commit a felony in connection with the jail assault that took place earlier this month, according to KETV.  Court documents say Silva was found standing near Derick Fuller inside a cell at the Sarpy County Jail on May 12 and Fuller had serious cuts to his ear and neck and superficial cuts on his body. Fuller received one stitch for the cut on his ear and was treated at a hospital for a long cut on the right side of his neck.  Fuller told officers "He stabbed me" and "He shanked me with something sharp and flushed it down the toilet."  Silva refused to answer questions about the attack, and investigators could not find the weapon that was used.  Video from inside the jail shows Silva rushing into Fuller's cell and staying there for about 3 minutes, but it doesn't show what happened inside the room. Investigators said other inmates reported hearing screaming and what sounded like someone being choked while Silva and Fuller were in the cell.  Silva was transferred to a different jail in Lincoln after the assault.  Before the jail assault, Silva, 24, was already charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted murder and arson for setting fire to a U-Haul truck he drove to the Sonic Drive-in restaurant before the Nov. 21 shooting.  The U-Haul was ablaze when officers arrived at the restaurant in the Omaha suburb of Bellevue and found the four victims. Silva was unarmed when he was arrested nearby a short time later and cooperated with officers.  Silva is being held without bond in connection with the shooting. He has not yet entered a plea in the assault case, but he is due to return to court for a hearing next Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-accused-of-restaurant-shooting-charged-in-jail-assault/articleshow/83020492.cms||---
---||World||Auditors find no fraud in disputed New Hampshire election||PEMBROKE: There is no evidence of fraud or political bias in a controversial New Hampshire election where a recount and audit has drawn the interest of former President Donald Trump, auditors concluded Thursday.  Rather, auditors investigating the election in the town of Windham believe a folding machine used by the town to try to accommodate the numbers of absentee ballots in the November election is responsible for mistakenly adding to vote counts for candidates in four legislative seats.  "We found no evidence of fraud or political bias," Mark Lindeman, one of the three auditors and the acting co-director of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, said. "I have heard no one actually articulate a credible hypothesis of how fraud could account for what we found."  The town used the machine to fold the absentee ballots before sending them to voters. After they were returned, the ballots were fed into a counting machine. Because the folds on some ballots went through a Democrats name, the ballot was either not counted or a vote was wrongly given to the Democrat.  The audit, mandated by the legislature and started earlier this month, is set to finish Thursday. It was called by lawmakers from both parties after a recount requested by a losing Democratic candidate in one of the legislative races showed the Republicans getting hundreds more votes than were originally counted. No matter the audit findings, the results won't change.  The discrepancy drew the attention of Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider claim of election fraud from 2020. Trump's cheerleading of skeptics in Windham shows how his search for evidence to support his false claims of election fraud have burrowed into American politics, even at the local level.  Kristi St. Laurent, the losing Democratic candidate who requested the recount, was watching the audit wrap up Thursday at the Edward Cross Training Center in Pembroke. She was satisfied with the audit and was counting on either the legislature or the secretary of state's office take action to ensure the problem doesn't happen again.  "They have been very thorough, very transparent and it's also clear that it's multiple factors that led to the results we had on election night" she said.  But not everyone was convinced the audit would find the reason for the discrepancy in the counts or that auditors had done enough to look at fraud or other factors.  "I wish it wasn't ending. There is still a lot more work that needs to be done. If you are going to turn over every rock and look at every possibility, there is a lot of evidence that hasn't been looked at," said Tom Murray, a contractor from Windham who was watching the audit. He said he has "less faith in the integrity of the system now than I did before this audit started."  Auditors must issue a final report within 45 days and Lindeman said that would include a series of recommendations. But he doubts the findings would have relevance beyond Windham.  "We have no reason to think that it's a statewide or national issue, although it's certainly possible that it occurred in other localities," he said.  That was echoed by Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who said ballots are sent to towns and cities with score marks to facilitate folding and the state ensures those marks don't go through the ovals where votes are marked.  "There's never been a ballot we sent out that was scored over an oval," he said.  While it's unknown how many other communities might use a folding machines like the one Windham did, Gardner said he suspects that few, if any, do. While the number of absentee ballots skyrocketed due to the pandemic, they generally make up a small percentage of the votes and communities don't have a problem folding ballots by hand.  Gardner has overseen 549 recounts in his 44 years as secretary of state, including 16 after the November elections. Those recounts involved 168,000 ballots - 22% of the total cast statewide - and 65 polling places.  "We don't have any reason to believe that any other town is facing this kind of situation," he said. "There wasn't anything else that we saw that was like this, and there's not been anything else like it over the years."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/auditors-find-no-fraud-in-disputed-new-hampshire-election/articleshow/83021173.cms||---

The US is the worst-affected country with 591,957 deaths, followed by Brazil with 454,429, India with 315,235, Mexico with 222,232 and Britain with 127,748. US Live UpdatesThe World Health Organization has said that up to three times more people have died directly or indirectly due to the pandemic than official figures suggest. Here are the latest developments: India scraps local trials for Covid shotsIndia scrapped local trials for "well-established" foreign coronavirus vaccines on Thursday as it tries to accelerate its vaccination rollout, with a government official saying Pfizer shots could arrive by July. The world's second-most populous country in May recorded its highest monthly Covid-19 death toll since the pandemic began last year, accounting for just over a third of the overall total. Boris Johnson defends virus record after ex-aide's attackBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied overseeing the needless deaths of many thousands of Covid patients, after his former chief adviser Dominic Cummings called him "unfit for the job" and said health secretary Matt Hancock was a serial liar. Facebook reverses course, won't ban lab virus theoryFacebook has reversed its policy banning posts suggesting Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory amid renewed debate over the origins of the virus, raising fresh questions about social media's role in policing misinformation. The latest move by Facebook, announced late Wednesday on its website, highlights the challenge for the world's largest social network of rooting out false and potentially harmful content while remaining open for discourse. US urges WHO to carry out 2nd phase of virus origin study in ChinaThe United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out the second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. President Joe Biden ordered aides to find answers to the origin of the virus that causes Covid-19, saying on Wednesday that US intelligence agencies are pursuing rival theories potentially including the possibility of a laboratory accident in China. Vietnam races to vaccinate factory workers after record virus casesVietnam has started vaccinating hundreds of thousands of factory workers in its industrialised north to combat its largest Covid-19 outbreak so far, days after the country reported a daily record in new cases. Vietnam has been widely applauded for its aggressive pandemic response, with mass quarantines and strict contact tracing helping keep infection rates low, but clusters have now been reported in around half of its provinces and cities. Saudi Arabia authorizes resumption of entertainment activities for the vaccinatedSaudi Arabia will allow entertainment activities to resume for those who are vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, state TV reported on Thursday, as the kingdom relaxes restrictions imposed to check the spread of the disease. Entertainment venues will be allowed to open at 40% capacity, it said. Nepal PM appeals for more vaccine jabs to boost Covid-19 fightNepal's prime minister Thursday called on the international community to supply the Himalayan nation with nearly 40 million Covid-19 shots to combat a new wave of infections that has overwhelmed hospitals. The country of nearly 30 million people has so far received just over three million doses from various sources, with another million promised by Beijing. Sweden eases Covid restrictions next weekSweden's government has announced a plan to ease Covid-19 restrictions, starting on June 1 but without a firm date for a complete reopening. Sweden has been an outlier in the fight against the pandemic and has opted against full lockdowns, instead of relying on mostly voluntary measures. It has been hit by a severe third wave of the virus but fresh cases and the number of people being admitted to intensive care are declining quickly. Cyprus to ease virus restrictions from June 10Cyprus on Thursday announced it will ease Covid restrictions on June 10, including lifting a seven-month-long curfew and opening nightclubs. The Mediterranean island aims to vaccinate 65 per cent of the population with at least one dose by the end of June. Israel to rule on adolescent vaccinations, link to heart inflammation next weekIsrael will release next week its findings on heart inflammation cases in Covid-19 vaccine recipients and then decide whether to approve inoculations of youngsters aged 12-15, a senior health official said on Thursday. The health ministry said in April it was examining a small number of such cases among people who received Pfizer/BioNtech's PFE.N Covid-19 vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) made a similar statement earlier this month. MEDICAL DEVELOPMENTS* Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson is unsure it can meet a target of delivering 55 million doses of its vaccine to the European Union by the end of the second quarter, Dutch national broadcaster NOS said, citing J&J's Dutch subsidiary. * Europe's medicines regulator said there was not enough evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with Covid-19, but backed the use of dexamethasone based on sufficient data. * France's Sanofi and Britain's GlaxoSmithKline launched a late-stage human trial for a recombinant Covid-19 vaccine candidate they hope to get approved by the end of 2021. * The US Food and Drug Administration gave an emergency use authorisation to the antibody treatment developed by Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline for treating mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in people aged 12 and older.

---||World||Biden to GOP: 'Don't get in the way' of infrastructure plan||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday warned naysayers in Congress not to ``get in the way'' of his big infrastructure plans as the White House panned a counteroffer from Republican senators to tap unused Covid-19 relief for a more modest investment in roads, highways and other traditional public works projects. After touring a manufacturing technology centre at a community college in Cleveland, Biden held up a card with the names of Republican lawmakers who had rejected his coronavirus aid bill in Washington but later promoted its assistance when they were back home in front of voters. He warned them not to play similar games as he pushes this next legislative priority in Congress. "I'm not going to embarrass anyone, but I have here a list," he said. "If you're going to take credit for what we've done,'' he continued, ``don't get in the way of what we need to do." The political arguments over Biden's ambitious proposals are quickly distilling into a debate over the size and scope of what all sides agree are sorely needed upgrades to the nation's ageing and outmoded infrastructure. As the president reaches for a soaring legislative achievement with his $1.7 trillion American Jobs Plan and a separate $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, he is assessing whether he can cut a bipartisan deal with Republicans or will have to push through his proposals with only Democratic votes. Republican senators outlined a $928 billion infrastructure proposal Thursday as a counteroffer to Biden, drawing a fresh red line against his plans raises the corporate tax, from 21% to 28%, to pay for new spending. Instead, the Republicans want to shift unspent Covid-19 relief dollars to help cover the costs, a nonstarter for many Democrats. The Republican senators said their offer, raised from an initial $568 billion, delivers on ``core infrastructure investments'' that Biden has focused on as areas of potential agreement. With about $250 billion in new spending, the GOP plan remains far from the president's approach. Biden reduced his $2.3 trillion opening bid to $1.7 trillion in earlier negotiations. ``It's a serious effort to try to reach a bipartisan agreement,'' said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the lead Republican negotiator. As Biden left for Ohio, he said he called Capito to thank her for the proposal, but told her, ``We have to finish this really soon.'' Biden toured Cuyahoga Community College, the same school where he was to hold a campaign rally in March 2020 only to have it be the first one canceled due to the pandemic. He cast his return as a symbol of how far the nation has come back, and he tried to make the case that passing his jobs and families plans would further the economy's recovery and prepare it for the decades ahead. The president said he was ``not looking to punish anyone'' with his tax plans. But said it was time for America's wealthy and corporations to help invest in the nation's future. ``Do you want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut? I don't begrudge them the money they make. Just start paying your fair share just a little bit,'' Biden said. Talks are at a crossroads before a Memorial Day deadline to make progress toward a bipartisan deal. With slim majorities in the House and Senate, the Democratic president faces other hurdles if he decides to abandon talks with Republicans and tries to unite fractious Democrats. The Republican offer would increase spending by $91 billion on roads and bridges, $48 billion on water resources and $25 billion on airports, according to a one-page summary released by the GOP negotiators. It would provide for one-time increases in broadband investments, at $65 billion, and $22 billion on rail. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on CNBC that it was time for the administration to ``sober up and realize they don't have a massive mandate in Congress to do all of the things they're trying to do.'' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden and Capito are expected to meet next week, while Congress is on a break. The White House is also ``continuing to explore other proposals that we hope will emerge'' she said. A bipartisan group of lawmakers that includes Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, is also preparing an alternative plan. Psaki made clear the administration's concern over tapping pandemic funds. ``We are worried that major cuts in COVID relief funds could imperil pending aid to small businesses, restaurants and rural hospitals using this money to get back on their feet after the crush of the pandemic,'' Psaki said in a statement. Core differences remain between the White House and GOP negotiators over the definition of infrastructure: Republicans stick to traditional investments in roads, bridges, ports and water drinking systems, while Biden takes a more expansive view. Under Biden's initial proposal, there is more than $300 billion for substantial upgrades to public schools, Veterans Administration hospitals and affordable housing, along with $25 billion for new and renovated child care centers. Biden's proposal would spend heavily on efforts to confront climate change, with $174 billion to spur the electric vehicle market, in part by developing charging stations, and $50 billion so communities can better deal with floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. One area of agreement is on boosting broadband, but the sides are apart on details. Republicans raised their initial offer to $65 billion in an earlier exchange; Biden is seeking $100 billion. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the Republicans' overall proposal reflects what ``what people at home in Wyoming think of is infrastructure, roads with potholes.'' The White House, still expressing public hopes for bipartisanship, welcomed the offer. At $928 billion over eight years, it features $257 billion in new money, more than the $225 billion the White House had said was in the initial Republican proposal. But still far less than the White House had hoped. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said there is $700 billion in unspent COVID-19 aid from the American Rescue Plan, which was the administration's $1.9 trillion response to the coronavirus crisis earlier this year. Toomey said some of that money could fill the gap between the amount of revenue normally collected from transportation taxes and fees, and the new spending the GOP senators are proposing. But he said the Republican negotiators have made it ``very, very clear on every single time we've had a discussion is that we're not raising taxes.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-gop-dont-get-in-the-way-of-infrastructure-plan/articleshow/83021590.cms||---

The voter turnout was 78.66 per cent. Assad's win was not in doubt, in an election where officials said 18 million were eligible to vote. But in the country ravaged by the 10-year-old conflict, areas controlled by rebels or Kurdish-led troops did not hold the vote. At least 8 million, mostly displaced, live in those areas in northwest and northeast Syria. Over 5 million refugees, mostly living in neighbouring countries, have largely refrained from casting their ballots. US and European officials have also questioned the legitimacy of the election, saying it violates UN resolutions in place to resolve the conflict, lacks any international monitoring, and is unrepresentative of all Syrians. Syria's parliament speaker, Hammoud Sabbagh, announced the final results from Wednesday's vote. He said Assad garnered 95.1 per cent of the votes. He was facing symbolic competition from two candidates, a former minister and a former opposition figure. Assad's victory comes as the country is still devastated by the conflict. Fighting has subsided but the war is not over. An economic crisis is deteriorating in a country where over 80 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and the local currency is in a free fall.

---||World||Explainer: What's the Senate filibuster and why change it?||WASHINGTON: Senate Republicans are poised to use a filibuster to derail Democrats' effort to launch a bipartisan probe of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The showdown will be the first vote this year when the GOP has used the delaying tactic to try killing major legislation.  Yet while the GOP seemed certain to succeed Thursday, their victory may prod Democrats closer to curbing or eliminating a legislative tactic that's been the bane of Senate majorities since the Founding Fathers.  Here's a look at the filibuster, how it works and the current political firestorm over it. What's a filibuster?  Unlike the House, the Senate places few constraints on lawmakers' right to speak. Senators can also easily use the chamber's rules to hinder or block votes. Collectively these procedural delays are called filibusters.  Senate records say the term began appearing in the mid-19th century. The word comes from a Dutch term for "freebooter" and the Spanish "filibusteros" that were used to describe pirates.  Filibusters were emblazoned in the public's mind in part by the 1939 film, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," in which Jimmy Stewart portrayed a senator who spoke on the chamber's floor until exhaustion. In a real-life version of that, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., stood continuously by his desk for 24 hours and 18 minutes speaking against the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the longest Senate speech by a single senator for which there are records of speaking length.  Those days are mostly gone. Senators usually tell Senate leaders or announce publicly that they will filibuster a bill, with no lengthy speeches required. Their impact usually flows not from delaying Senate business but from the need to get a supermajority of votes to end them. How do filibusters end? Records from the first Congress in 1789 show senators complaining about long speeches blocking legislation. Frustration grew and in 1917, the Senate voted to let senators end filibusters with a two-thirds majority vote.  In 1975, the Senate lowered that margin to the current three-fifths majority, which in the 100-member chamber is 60 votes. That margin is needed to end filibusters against nearly all types of legislation, but no longer applies to nominations.  Democrats controlling the Senate in 2013, angered by GOP delays on then-President Barack Obama's picks, reduced the margin for ending filibusters against most appointees to a simple majority, exempting Supreme Court nominees. In 2017, Republicans running the chamber, eager to add conservative justices under then-President Donald Trump, lowered the threshold to a simple majority for Supreme Court picks as well. What's the problem? Democrats emerged from the 2020 elections controlling the White House, Senate and House. They had pent-up pressure to enact an agenda that includes spending trillions to bolster the economy and battle the pandemic, expanding voting rights and helping millions of immigrants in the US illegally become citizens.  But Democrats have a slender House majority and control the 50-50 Senate only because of the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. That means that to overcome a filibuster, Democrats need support from at least 10 Republicans, a heavy lift in a time of intense partisanship.  That's frustrated progressive senators and outside liberal groups, who've pressured Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to eliminate filibusters - even as their use has become increasingly common by whichever party is in the minority.  According to Senate records dating back to World War I, the number of votes to end filibusters in any two-year Congress never reached 100 until the 2007-2008 sessions. It hit a high of 298 in the 2019-2020 Congress, mostly on Trump appointees that Republicans running the Senate were pushing to confirmation.  In this year's first five months as of this week, there were already 41 votes to end filibusters, mostly on President Joe Biden's nominees. What can democrats do? It takes a simple majority, 51 votes, to change how the Senate cuts off filibusters. GOP support for retaining them is solid, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying Democrats want to end them in a quest for "raw power."  But with Democrats eager to enact their priorities before they lose their fragile majority, their support for discarding filibusters has grown. Biden, who's influential despite having no vote on the matter, has said the tactic is "being abused in a gigantic way."  Yet Democrats lack the votes to do that. Their two most conservative senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, have opposed a change, arguing the country is better served when Congress can find bipartisan solutions to its problems. What impact might the January 6 commission vote have on filibusters? Democrats consider creating a commission to examine the violent attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters just one of many issues they're pushing that the public supports. Others in that category include House-passed measures easing voting access, expanding citizenship opportunities for immigrants and curbing gun rights.  So far, Schumer hasn't forced Senate votes on many such bills. But advocates of eliminating filibusters hope Thursday's vote on the Jan. 6 commission, a top Democratic priority, will build pressure on Schumer, Manchin and Sinema to eliminate the delays.  Schumer hasn't overtly tipped his hand on what he'll do but has consistently kept the door open. The Senate spent much of this week debating a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening the U.S.'s ability to compete economically with China, which some saw as demonstrating that Democrats work with Republicans when they can.  "We hope to move forward with Republicans, but we're not going to let them saying no stand in our way," Schumer said this week.  Democrats used special budget procedures to push Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package through the Senate with just a simple majority in March. They may try the same with Biden's huge infrastructure bill, but Senate rules limit the ability to use that route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explainer-whats-the-senate-filibuster-and-why-change-it/articleshow/83021977.cms||---

The move by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is part of an effort to boost vaccinations as the state prepares to fully reopen its economy on June 15. Ten Californians who become inoculated before that date stands to win lottery-style prizes of $1.5 million apiece, while another 30 people will each win $50,000. The incentives are being offered as Newsom is fighting off a recall campaign that has become a cause celebre among Republicans nationwide. It is one of many ways that Newsom plans to spend an unprecedented state budget surplus. Across the United States, states and private organizations have offered incentives to persuade people to become inoculated against Covid-19, which has killed nearly 3.7 people worldwide. The incentives range from free baseball tickets and beer to college scholarships and cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/get-vaccinated-win-cash-as-california-offers-116-5-million-in-prizes/articleshow/83022112.cms||---

The daily toll, however, remained over 3,000, with 3,203 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. This was the second time this week that the daily tally of new cases had fallen below the 2-lakh mark, the first time being on Monday, when numbers anyway see a sharp dip due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend. The last time India had reported a lower number of new cases was on April 13, when 1,85,295 were reported, as per TOI’s Covid database. Thursday’s death toll of 3,203 does not include 459 previous deaths revealed by Maharashtra apart from 425 deaths confirmed over the last 24 hours. The state has added over 4,500 old deaths to its total toll over the past 11 days alone. Although deaths have been falling, the daily toll remains high in several states. Karnataka recorded the highest toll on Thursday, with 476 deaths. The next highest count was reported in Tamil Nadu, 474, just one short of highest single-day toll reported on Wednesday). UP (188), Kerala (181), Punjab (178), Bengal (148), Delhi (117) and Andhra Pradesh (104) were among the states reporting a high number of fatalities. Maharashtra reported 21,273 fresh cases on Thursday, the lowest daily number in over two months since March 16 (17,864). Karnataka added 24,214 fresh cases to the tally. Delhi’s count dropped to 1,072, the lowest since March 30 (992), while UP reported 3,278 new infections, the least since April 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-records-1-8-lakh-cases-lowest-in-44-days-deaths-remain-3oooo-plus-deaths/articleshow/83022252.cms||---
---||India||From 10,000 in 1999 to 6 in 2021: How India cut cyclone deaths||NEW DELHI: Since the 1999 super cyclone in Odisha, which claimed over 10,000 lives, to Cyclone Yaas when casualties have been limited to less than half-a-dozen, India seems to have made a remarkable progress in disaster risk reduction (DRR). Largescale rescue and relief operation, with the cooperation of both the Centre and states, ensured more than 14 lakh people evacuated to safe shelters, limiting casualties to negligible numbers in Odisha and West Bengal, the two states that came in the direct path of a severe cyclone making a landfall on Wednesday. This is seen as the result of a rigorous exercise and strengthening of the DRR mechanism over the last few years: a perfect coordination between the Centre and state agencies. The feat has also been possible for significantly increasing funding for DRR activities — up from an average $3-4 billion over five years in the last decade to $4 billion a year for the last two consecutive years. India takes every calamity as a challenge to minimise casualties to almost zero. This remarkable demonstration of “zero casualty” approach has been discussed and celebrated at global forums with the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) citing Odisha’s cyclone shelters and evacuation efforts as role models for others in the world to emulate. More than eight lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and six lakh in Odisha over the last couple of days to evade the fury of a severe cyclone. Besides the alertness of the state administration, the central National Crisis Management Committee, headed by the cabinet secretary, met twice in the last week; the PM and the Home minister chaired separate high level meetings ensuring all missions were in operational mode. The high level of alertness was also necessary in view of last week’s cyclone Tauktae that had left 193 dead, 70 of them on Barge P-305, off Mumbai coast when it sank in the Arabian sea. By the time Yaas made a landfall on Wednesday, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had deployed 107 teams, in addition to the 17 columns of the Army and four warships of the Navy with helicopters onboard in full readiness. The coast guard had put five of its ships and one aircraft in operation. Another five Navy ships were on a standby. The most modern satellites and early warning systems come as useful tools to predict the course of cyclones a week in advance, giving authorities time to prepare. Over the last decade, India has majorly invested in DRR by building safe shelter homes around coastal districts, creating flood embankments, raising of several battalions of the NDRF and SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) — a highly skilled trained force equipped with modern technology and equipment. The NDRF alone has nearly 14,000 personnel. A similar army is available through the SDRFin states, trained in DRR. From investing in flood mitigation measures to building disaster resilient infrastructure, India has set aside huge funds towards DRR. Whether it means deployment of the most modern early warning system or launching of the latest satellites, New Delhi has been pursuing an aggressive agenda to bring down economic losses and loss of lives to disasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-10000-in-1999-to-6-in-2021-how-india-cut-cyclone-deaths/articleshow/83022325.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||World||European Union's Covid-19 recovery fund gets unanimous green light||BRUSSELS: The national parliaments of Austria and Poland approved Europe's huge post-virus coronavirus recovery fund on Thursday, the last of the 27 EU member states, paving the way for ratification. "With the positive votes of the Austrian and Polish parliaments today, the 27 member states finalised the parliamentary approval process," European Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said on Twitter. Officials previously said that if member states gave the go-ahead to the plan, money for the 672-billion-euro ($820-billion) package of grants and loans could "start to flow in July". This will be a year on from the European Union's historic decision to pool debt to fund the recovery package. What once seemed like a hugely ambitious exercise, however, has been dwarfed by the United States' adoption of a $1.9-trillion infrastructure plan. The US has also surged ahead with coronavirus vaccinations, meaning its economy will emerge from lockdowns faster than those in Europe. But EU chiefs have remained upbeat and optimistic. "Our objective is to approve all the plans by the summer," European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said earlier. Spain and Italy are expected to see the biggest injections of funds as part of their roughly 70-billion-euro plan, followed by France with 40 billion euros. The path to putting the plan in place has seen European Commission officials in difficult discussions with national governments on the criteria that spending plans must meet. Each plan has had to assign at least 37 per cent of funds to measures that better the environment or fight climate change. Another 20 per cent is supposed to finance the transition to a more digital economy. The hope is that as European output picks up after a year of Covid and lockdown woes, it will herald a rash of spending in insulating buildings, railway transport, electric vehicle charging points and high-speed internet. "The objective is that the funds start to be paid this summer," Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said at a meeting in Lisbon on Saturday. He promised that efforts would be made to try to speed up the assessment process. "We are working as quickly as possible but these are complex evaluations," he nevertheless warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/european-unions-covid-19-recovery-fund-gets-unanimous-green-light/articleshow/83022499.cms||---

For all ministers, the top priority item on the agenda is taxes on Covid-related goods, vaccines and drugs. But this is where the common interest ends. The Opposition-ruled states, which are looking to flex their muscles after BJP and its allies lost assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, are demanding zero levy on Covid-vaccines, against 5% at present. The Centre, however, believes that the balance hasn’t tilted against it, given that states such as Tamil Nadu did not toe the BJP line and were more often on the other side. “Since the government is the buyer of vaccines and the government is the consumer, it does not make sense to impose GST. In any case, states are also being asked to buy vaccines, which adds to the burden,” said Chattisgarh health minister T S Singh Deo. “If you can have a mechanism for SEZs for zero tax, the same should be applied to Covid-related goods,” he added. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had demanded zero GST on vaccines as well as other items, but Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said this was not feasible, given that entities in the production chain will not be able to claim input tax credit if there was no tax on the final product. The Opposition-ruled states — which had a joint meeting on Wednesday to chart out a strategy for the Council meeting — are suggesting zero-rating, which means that the entire value chain, from raw material to the finished product, is exempted from tax but there is no restriction on taking tax credits. Some of the states are also demanding a similar facility for life-saving drugs, arguing that customs duty along with 18% GST imposes a stiff burden on patients suffering from Covid. Besides, the Opposition-ruled states are going to demand a high level of compensation, arguing that their revenues are impacted by the second wave. The states also want the compensation formula to be reworked, saying that they had to borrow from the market last year and generate some resources on their own to meet the shortfall. But there are other issues which had been put on the backburner in 2017 when the BJP and its allies were gaining control of more states. Punjab FM Manpreet Badal, for instance, wants one of his state colleagues to be appointed as the vice chairman of the GST Council, which is headed by the Union finance minister. When the GST Council was set up, West Bengal FM Amit Mitra was seen to be eyeing the job, although the issue never came up for discussion. “There is a lot of ad-hocism and officers are deciding on issues without states being consulted. Similarly, we need a proper GST Council secretariat, which handles the agenda instead of the Centre, which is an interested party preparing it,” Badal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/stage-set-for-a-stormy-gst-meet-today/articleshow/83022748.cms||Sidhartha
---||India||Over half of Covid patients with secondary infection die: ICMR||Overuse of antibiotics and superbugs could be worsening the Covid-19 pandemic in India, according to an ICMR study across 10 hospitals, including two (Sion and Hinduja) in Mumbai. The study showed that more than half of the Covid-19 patients who get a secondary bacterial or fungal infection die. A secondary infection is one which occurs during or after the treatment of another infection. The numbers in the ICMR study are relatively small: 4% of the 17,000 Covid patients studied had secondary bacterial and fungal infections. But ICMR’s senior scientists Kamini Walia, who led the study, said extrapolating these numbers to the overall Covid-19 hospitalisations shows that lakhs of people must have had a prolonged hospital stay, needing higher doses of antibiotics to stave off hospitalisation-acquired infections that typically develop after 10 days. Covid-19 mortality across the world is 10%. The sub-group of patients with Covid-19 plus a bacterial or fungal infection, that was part of the ICMR study, had 56.7% deaths. The study also highlighted that many patients needed potent antibiotics as they had superbugs that couldn’t be treated with usual antibiotics. Half of the Covid patients with bacterial infection (52.36%) were given “watch category” antibiotics as per the World Health Organisation; these are meant to be judiciously used for specific types of infections. A fifth of these patients were given antibiotics categorized as “last resort” or reserve category. Drug-resistant variants of Klebsiella pneumonia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa were among the most common bacterial infections. Many experts (not connected to the study) believe that overuse of antibiotics and anti-fungals could have contributed to a surge in rare infections such as black fungal or mucormycosis. “The body has an inherent flora, that is good bacteria that plays a protective role. But when antibiotics are given without a reason, these good bacteria too get wiped out, allowing opportunistic infections to attack,” said intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. Dr Khusrav Bajan from Hinduja Hospital, Mahim said studies conducted during the first Covid-19 wave had shown that while 17% of the Covid patients had secondary infections, 73% were given antibiotics. “In the second wave, we are seeing youngsters who come to us after taking two or three antibiotics during the first phase of treatment at home. By the time they come to us, they need higher antibiotics,” said Dr Bajan, who is also a task force member. In patients with long Covid who end up staying longer in hospitals, antibiotics are prescribed to ward off any hospital-acquired infection. “The longer a patient stays in hospital, higher is the chance of him/her requiring ICU or ventilator. Antibiotics are needed for such a Covid patient, but what is worrying is excess antibiotics that could cause ‘pressure’ on the pathogens who will end up becoming drug-resistant,” said Dr Walia. The pattern of antibiotic use at home by Covid patients too could have long-term repercussions; after the rampant use of azithromycin, it remains to be seen if it will be effective against typhoid in the future, said Dr Walia. Her study found that during the first wave, 10% of the patients were given anti-fungals though they didn’t need it. “Now with the fear of mucormycocis, one is sure that a lot of anti-fungals are being misused,” she added. Dr Sujata Baveja from Sion Hospital, which along with Hinduja Hospital contributed to the study, said the least that hospitals could do is “de-escalate” treatment as soon as a patient’s condition improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-half-of-covid-patients-with-secondary-infection-die-icmr/articleshow/83022950.cms||Malathy Iyer

The facility will be able to manufacture about 500 million doses a year, but some investments will be required. We have approached the banks for the funds. If all goes according to plan, vaccines can be rolled out by September,” Wockhardt founder-chairman & group CEO Habil Khorakiwala told TOI in an exclusive interview. He did not disclose details, including the name of the company as the final agreement is yet to be signed. Elaborating on the proposal to the Centre, he said Wockhardt can manufacture vaccines if technological transfer is made available by the government. The company could start making vaccine doses once its facility has been repurposed. “We have experience in biotech and complex technology, and can manufacture vaccines across platforms including messenger or mRNA, protein-based and viral vector-based technologies,” he added. For this, “substantial” investments in plant and machinery will be required, and it could take up to two years for the facility. Wockhardt has a strong diabetes portfolio in India, and was the front-runner in Asia in launching human insulin in 2003, and the long-acting insulin analog glargine in 2009. “Vaccines will be required for a long time, and we need to build capacity for the country as well as emerging markets. We are prepared (to do it) and offer it at a reasonable price. I’ve had discussions with the Centre, and have offered a proposal. The Centre can help (us) in accessing technology and identifying potential partners to make vaccines in our facility. We should not lose our strength as a country with one of the largest vaccine manufacturing capabilities,” Khorakiwala added. The government’s response was “positive” he said, adding funds were also assured as announced under the recently unveiled RBI’s Covid package for vaccine manufacturers. Wockhardt’s UK facility is already offering fill-finish Covid vaccines under an agreement with the UK government, and is now engaged in rolling out the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wockhardt-eyes-pact-for-vax-tech-transfer/articleshow/83019754.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Notes of Rs 2,000 denomination dropped to 245 crore from 274 crore last year. Overall the number of banknotes rose to 12,436 crore from 11,579 crore. “In value terms, the share of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 banknotes together accounted for 85.7% of the total value of banknotes in circulation as on March 31, 2021, as against 83.4% as on March 31, 2020,” the report said. The pandemic also saw a sharp drop in the number of fake currency notes. In FY21, a total of 2,08,695 fake notes were detected down from 2,96,695 notes detected in the previous fiscal. Most of the fake notes were of the Rs 100 denomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/stock-of-rs-2000-banknotes-continue-to-dip/articleshow/83020219.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar: Patients make beeline for ENT, eye centres||PATNA: The number of patients visiting ENT (ear, nose, throat) and eye specialists has gone up in the last few weeks with the rise in mucormycosis or black fungus cases.The infection is generally seen in immune-compromised and diabetic patients who have recovered from Covid and discharged from different hospitals. So far, more than 150 cases of black fungus have been reported in the state. As the infection affects the facial areas like jaw, mouth, nose, eyes and face, people are making beeline for clinics of ENT specialists. Dr Sunil Kumar Singh, secretary of Bihar Ophthalmological Society, said, “Most people are complaining about pain in the eyeballs and redness in eyes, which are typical post-Covid symptoms. Several patients, especially diabetics, visit us out of panic. Very few of them have symptoms of mucormycosis like ophthalmoplegia (restriction of movement of eyeball), diminishing vision, proptosis (bulging of eyes), swelling and pain and redness in eyes. I refer such patients to IGIMS for treatment as the diagnosis and management are all multi-disciplinary approach,” Dr Singh said. Dr Ranjana Kumar, consultant ophthalmologist at Drishti Eye Care and Research Centre, said some Covid-recovered patients visit her just to confirm whether they have contracted mucormycosis or not. “The paranoia in post-Covid patients is the biggest problem. Such patients need multi-disciplinary approach as drugs are available for free at government health facilities,” she added. Head of ENT department at PMCH, Dr Vinit Sinha, said four patients with black fungus have been admitted at the 70-bed ward of the hospital in last two days. Three patients were shifted from medicine department where they were undergoing treatment for Covid. “People are scared with the rising cases of back fungus. Even the slightest symptoms are forcing them to visit the hospital. It is indeed important to consult doctors at early stage of mucormycosis. People are coming with symptoms like headache and pain in the facial areas,” Dr Sinha said. At AIIMS-Patna, the number of mucormycosis patients has increased to 68, while three have succumbed due to the infection. Dr Kranti Bhawna, additional professor and head of ENT department at AIIMS-Patna, said many panicky people people want early admission, medication and treatment. Some, however, come to the hospital after getting their MRI reports. “Most admitted patients are having symptoms in nasal, eyes and palate. We have performed surgeries on some patients and removed their upper jaw to stop the spread of fungal infection. In some cases, the patients have to sacrifice the eyeballs. However, the infection turns severe when it travels to the brain,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mucormycosis-patients-make-beeline-for-ent-eye-centres/articleshow/83015510.cms||Faryal Rumi

Even though the cases continue to fall sharply in the second wave with more recoveries, there has been no decline in the death toll so far. Officially, 98 deaths were reported by the state government on Thursday, on a day the state registered 2,568 new cases. The number of deaths was less when the second wave was at its peak in the state. For instance, on April 27, Bihar registered 85 deaths with 12,604 new Covid-19 cases recorded that day. In the five days between May 23 and May 27, a total of 1,532 new cases have been registered and in the same duration, 500 official deaths were reported. This shows on average there were 3,065 Covid-19 cases per day with a daily average death count of 100. Data for the same duration from April 23 to April 27 showed that the state registered 62,231 cases but 351 deaths. So, on average, the state got 12,446 cases and 70.2 deaths per day during this period. As per data shared by the health department, the overall toll has now reached 4,943 in Bihar. With a total of 6,67,506 recoveries, there has been a decrease in the number of active cases, which now stands at 28,447. Covid-19 nodal officer at PMCH and consultant physician, Dr Israrul Haque said these deaths being reported now are those of the lingering cases. “For example, there are cases of patients who had tested positive four weeks back and after testing negative they developed pneumonia or secondary infection,” Dr Haque said. Senior vice-president of state IMA, Dr Ajay Kumar also cited the same reason. Dr Kumar said all those dying recently are the ones who were infected at least two weeks back. On Thursday, 11 deaths were reported from Gaya, followed by Madhubani (10), Siwan (9), Rohtas (8), West Champaran (8) and Patna (6). AIIMS-Patna and NMCH reported seven deaths each, taking the toll to 14. On the other hand, IGIMS reported four deaths on Thursday. Meanwhile, a drop in the number of vaccinations was also seen on Thursday as a total of 43,251 beneficiaries got the shot which included 38,422 who got the first shot and 4829 who got the second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-tally-in-bihar-crosses-7-lakh-mark/articleshow/83015403.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The weather, which had been moderately wet since morning, deteriorated as the day went by. The evening bulletin issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre stated that the city witnessed 38.5mm rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Thursday. Heavy rain has also been forecast in the state capital on Friday. As a result of the showers, several parts of the city, including the posh localities, reeled from power outages and waterlogging. The rain also brought trees crashing down at some locations, but no major casualty or damage was reported. District magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh and a team of officials went on a surprise visit to different locations. They checked if the sump houses and sewer lines were ready to tackle waterlogging problems. Patna Municipal Corporation’s public relations officer (PRO) Harshita claimed that the civic body had already identified the localities prone to waterlogging. “Instruments have, therefore, been installed in those areas to pump out rainwater,” she added. Chandra Bhushan Kumar, PRO of the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation that manages sump houses in the city, said, “Engineers have been deployed at the sump houses to make sure that all pumps function well.” Meanwhile, Patna divisional forest officer Ruchi Singh told this reporter that two trees, which fell near the airport and the Digha Ghat, had been cleared by three teams. Officials of the disaster management department also pointed out that different teams of the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force had been roped in for tackling emergency situations. Asked about the power outages, Dilip Kumar, general manager of the Patna Electric Supply Undertaking, replied, “Although we have been asked to supply electricity to hospitals and sump houses on a priority basis, we ensured that power was restored in different localities as soon as possible on Thursday.” Phulwarisharif resident Shad Azmi, who is a theoretical physicist, waited all day long for the rain to stop. “I had to buy medicines for my brother from a nearby store. I do not know what to do,” he wondered amid the heavy rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yaas-impact-city-areas-reel-from-power-outages-trees-uprooted/articleshow/83014862.cms||---

Flight operations at the city airport were suspended after 5pm, leading to cancellation of four flights. Airport officials said the flight operations would remain suspended till 9am on Friday. Amritsar-bound flight of Air India (AI-726) was the last aircraft that landed at Patna airport around 4.32pm on Thursday. One Air India flight (AI-764) between Delhi and Patna was diverted to Kolkata around 6.20pm while Vistara’s Delhi-bound flight (UK-715/716) was returned to Delhi from midway due to the bad weather conditions in Patna. Airport director Bhupesh C H Negi said flight operations were stopped at Patna airport in the evening under the impact of cyclone. The situation will be reviewed before resuming flight operations,” he added. As per the information provided by the officials of Patna airport, altogether 15 flights operated on Thursday, including seven of IndiGo, three each of Air India and GoAir and two of SpiceJet. All four cancelled fights were of IndiGo airlines. Airports Authority of India (AAI) had earlier on Thursday put Patna airport and Darbhanga airport on alert due to likely heavy rain and reduced visibility under the impact of cyclone Yaas. Just three flights were operated at Darbhnaga airport on Thursday. One Mumbai-bound flight of SpiceJet was diverted to Varanasi, airport director Biplab Kumar Mondal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flight-operations-at-patna-airport-suspended-till-9am-today/articleshow/83018150.cms||Faryal Rumi

Jha said a 24x7 monitoring of all the rivers, particularly the ones of south Bihar, is going on and an alert has already been sounded to all the officers and staff of the department. “As the cyclone is entering south Bihar via Jharkhand, there is no major threat to the north Bihar rivers. South Bihar rivers require more attention in view of the fact that they can cause flash floods in the event of excess rain,” he said. The minister added, “Water level of all the south Bihar rivers is being recorded every three hours and disseminated to all the concerned. The engineers of the department have been keeping a constant watch on the latest developments and they are well prepared to take preventive steps if the water is found overtopping any river anywhere in the state.” The minister said flood protection work has been hampered to some extent owing to the illness of many engineers and other technical staff during the second wave of the Covid pandemic. “Movement of construction materials has also been affected during the lockdown. However, the department is still working on a war footing to save the state from floods. All the flood protection works would be completed by the first week of June,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/steps-taken-to-avert-flash-floods-minister/articleshow/83014779.cms||B K Mishra

The strict restrictions have been in force in Candolim since April 28. It was among the first villages in the state to impose restrictions on the movement of people and other activities in view of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government had later announced a curfew in the first week of May to break the Covid chain. It was then extended till May 30. People are allowed to move around only from 6am to 12pm for shopping, with only shops selling essential items permitted to remain open. However, the Calangute panchayat, which had also declared similar restrictions in the last week of April, said it is yet to take a decision on the extension of the curbs in the village as the state government’s curfew is still in force. “We’re expecting the state government to extend the curfew till June 6. If there is no extension, we will take a decision on whether to extend the curbs on Saturday, and we may extend it,” Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curfew-curbs-in-candolim-till-june-6/articleshow/83019463.cms||---

Mehta received a remuneration of a bit more than Rs 16 crore in fiscal year 2020 (excluding stock options), which marked a 23% increase over FY19 when his remuneration was Rs 13 crore (also excluding stock options). In the challenging last fiscal FY21, HUL’s employees received an average increase of 3.4% in salaries, other than managerial personnel, while managing committee members received a 4% hike, according to the company’s latest annual report. The company had 8,525 permanent employees on its rolls as on March 31, 2021. "Employees include all employees excluding employees governed under collective bargaining,” the annual report states. A company spokesperson said: “Total number of employees including blue collar employees stands at 21,000." The ratio of remuneration of CMD to the median for employees accordingly came down to 122 in fiscal 2021 from 151 in the previous year. The figure was 194 in 2018-19. The company noted last year was a challenging one for all employees, especially those in the frontline and factories, as they strived hard to ensure production and distribution of essential commodities ran smoothly. A one-time special cash award was also granted to the frontline sales force and factory based employees. The average increase every year is an outcome of the company’s market competitiveness against its peer group companies. The company follows a rigorous practice of assessing the value of every role in the company and benchmarks the same to the market. In FY20, the average increase made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel was 5%, while certain management committee members had received an increase of 20-25%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hul-chiefs-fy21-pay-dips-5-to-rs-15cr/articleshow/83020080.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Got certificate sans jab? Change mobile number on Co-WIN||PUNE: Citizens who may have received vaccine certificates or confirmation SMSs without actually getting a jab can re-register for shots on Co-WIN by entering a different cellphone number, a central official with the Co-WIN management team has said. Though the health ministry has introduced a four-digit security code to prevent this error from happening again, citizens already sent the certificates/SMSs have been unable to get a vaccine dose as Co-WIN shows they have already received one. Gahunje resident Shruti Nair said, “I had booked a slot for May 5 for a Covaxin jab. But even before I could enter the site, I was told it had run out of shots. Around 1.45pm that day, I got a text saying I had been vaccinated. There was a certificate too on the Co-WIN portal stating I had received my first dose.” Co-WIN then didn’t let Nair reschedule her slot since she wasn’t eligible for a “second dose” till June 2. “I will now re-register with a different phone number,” she said. Sheetal Bhatia, a city-based family physician, faced a similar problem and was refused a second dose at a site. She said, “We had to re-register with a different phone number.” The central official said such errors may have occurred while vaccinating someone else in lieu of a person who had not turned up after taking an online appointment. He said, “Sites may have been vaccinating last moment walk-ins and registering the shot in the name of the person it was meant for as per appointment. This was happening especially with the last doses of the day. Sites can now no longer indulge in such practices after the introduction of the four-digit security code system.” The official said those who have Co-WIN showing as vaccinated (though they're yet to get a shot) can re-register with another mobile number. “Even if they re-register with the same ID as the previous registration, the system will accept,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/those-sent-certificate-without-jab-can-sign-up-with-different-phone-number/articleshow/83018665.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Patna||MP: Let panchayat members continue till fresh elections||PATNA: Former Union minister and BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav on Thursday urged chief minister Nitish Kumar to let incumbent panchayat representatives continue in office after expiry of their five-year term on June 15. The term of around 2.58 lakh panchayat representatives will come to an end on June 15. Elections to three-tier panchayati raj institutions in the state are unlikely to be held on time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The BJP MP from Patliputra has urged the CM in a letter to hold parleys with all the stakeholders to reach at a conclusion as panchayat polls are likely to be deferred. Yadav said development works in the panchayats would be adversely affected in the absence of the elected representatives. “It is the prime duty of the present dispensation to continue with the development works launched in the panchayats both by the Union government and the state government,” he added. The former Union minister said a similar demand was put up before the CM earlier by functionaries of Bihar Pradesh Mukhiya Mahasangh. Sangh’s state president Ashok Singh had urged the CM to make provision for continuation of the panchayat representatives till fresh elections are held and new members elected. Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had also made a similar plea to the state government. Panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary, however, said the state government was ready to conduct election to the three-tier panchayati raj institutions. “It is up to the State Election Commission to take a final call on the issue. The state will extend its support to the commission,” he said. Choudhary, however, admitted that the state government was looking for other options as well. “The government will come up with an alternative arrangement soon,” the minister said. Sources said the government has two options. First, handing over the charge of development works to administrative officials and, second, continuing with the outgoing representatives till fresh elections are held and new members elected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mp-let-panchayat-members-continue-till-fresh-elections/articleshow/83014610.cms||Ramashankar

While the IMA-Bihar has formed a team to probe the cause behind such a large number of fatalities, they have also demanded that the government accorded the status of a martyr to doctors, who have fallen in the line of duty and compensate them, including those who died while providing treatment at private establishments. The medical cell of both the ruling JD (U) and BJP have raised this issue with the state government. On Thursday, BJP’s medical cell state convener Dr Manoj Kumar wrote a letter to health minister Mangal Pandey asking the latter to help private doctors get the compensation announced by the Union government. This came a day after JD (U) state president (south wing) Dr Sunil Kumar Singh wrote a letter to CM Nitish Kumar stating that deceased Covid warriors deserved martyr status and compensation to their families. “The notification regarding the compensation under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana is not averse to the families of doctors who worked in their clinics and helped in the screening or treatment of Covid-19 patients as per the directions of government under epidemic diseases act. All private clinical establishments remained open on your appeal. We appeal to our kind-hearted CM to direct health department including those from the private sector as drafted for work and recommend compensation for their families under the insurance scheme,” read a part of the letter written by Dr Sunil, who even urged the state government to announce its compensation like other state governments. State IMA senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said a total of 142 doctors have lost their lives in Bihar, 40 in the first wave and 102 in the second wave. “Of these, 42 were working with the government sector and rest in the private sector. Even amongst those working in the government sector, a family of only four have got the compensation,” said Dr Ajay. He said several families are still waiting for the compensation because of minor issues like a change in the surname of wife after marriage and how families have to write applications again and again for the reminder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ima-demands-martyr-status-for-doctors-dying-of-covid/articleshow/83015600.cms||Sheezan Nezami

By adding our technology, an order for a cappuccino can carry the instruction and be used to initiate payment using UPI after identifying the customer,” said ToneTag co-founder Kumar Abhishek, who was formerly with Infosys. Amazon and Mastercard, besides being payment partners, are also investors in the company. Abhishek sees the technology used by television advertisers, where a mic-enabled smart TV can accept a voice order for the product. Similarly, it can be used in a cafe where Amazon Pay is in talks to deploy acceptance infrastructure. ToneTag has recently acquired global patents from Singapore and Malaysia, adding two more countries to its list of four — the US, Japan, India, and South Africa — where it has already got recognition. These patents majorly cover all kinds of audio and sound communications between devices. The company is also working to bring its payment technology for home automation like embedding RO water purifiers with software for ordering the candle filters or integrating with voice assistant on smart TV to allow viewers to place orders by talking to the television. “Today, India is one of the four largest B2C brand ecosystems. We have lots of brands that are online, and we have the best payment system. It is an absolutely ripe ecosystem to build voice payment experiences,” said Kumar. According to Kumar, using voice for payments also helps in financial inclusion as it can be used in feature phones for those for whom digital literacy is an issue. Unlike most fintechs that target consumers, ToneTag is a B2B tech provider. Its technology is used in payment apps and is also deployed by merchants online and offline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tonetag-in-talks-to-deploy-voice-payment-tech-in-market/articleshow/83020131.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Delhi||Black fungus: Delhi HC allows duty-free import of key drug||NEW DELHI: Faced with acute shortage of Amphotericin B for black fungus treatment despite efforts by the Centre, Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed its duty-free import by individuals or organisations for personal use. The high court pointed out that it is a life-saving drug that is in short supply and if patients or their kin are able to get hold of it from abroad, the Centre must not have any objection. While asking the government to decide about waiving off any duty on the key drug — at least till it is in short supply — the court added that a clause saying those importing Amphotericin B would furnish a bond till the Centre takes a final decision on waiving the customs duty on it. “Considering the fact that the drug is required to save lives of people being infected with this serious disease affecting thousands of people across the country, we are of the view the Centre must seriously consider waiver of complete customs duties on these drugs at least for the period when it is in short supply in India to treat the patients of mucormycosis,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh noted in its order. Till the time the government takes a call, the court directed that the drug imported by any person “shall be allowed on a bond furnished by the importer without the actual duty being paid”. The direction came after the court was informed by senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal that the drug is available in the UAE (Dubai) with chemists who are willing to send it to India to needy patients but the import duty on the medicine is 27%. Another lawyer had earlier claimed it was 78%. The court pointed out that if Delhi government makes efforts to procure the drug from sources other than those explored by the Centre, it should not be stopped. During the hearing, the court also took stock of the steps being taken by the AAP government to provide medical help to the subordinate judiciary. It said the government could show “empathy” and “sensitivity” and consider giving ex gratia compassionate appointments to family members of judges who died of Covid-19. It was informed by Delhi Judicial Services Association that Delhi government has not recognised judicial officers as frontline workers for Covid-19 vaccination and urged that if there were any other benefits available to other frontline workers, these be extended to them too. The association said the principal secretary (law) had been appointed the nodal officer for interacting with all district judges in the matter of providing medical assistances to judges afflicted by Covid-19. Delhi government informed the court that the category was created primarily for only vaccination and in future, if other aspects were covered, they would be kept in mind. The association’s application was filed in the pending petition raising the issues of medical facilities for judicial officers. The bench disposed of the petition and the application along with another plea seeking certain reliefs for court staff, noting that the issues raised had been adequately addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-allows-duty-free-import-of-key-drug/articleshow/83018748.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||Rising surface temperature at sea behind frequent cyclones: Experts||KOLKATA: In the past 12 months, there have been four cyclonic storms in Bay of Bengal — severe cyclone Amphan (May 16-21), severe cyclone Nivar (Nov 22-26), cyclonic storm Burevi (Nov 30-Dec 5) and Yaas (May 23-27). Climate scientists say the cyclogenesis or triggering of very severe cyclonic storms in Bay of Bengal is a result of climate change. The water around the Indian sub-continent is warmer than usual. The threshold value for sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for formation of cyclones is 28°C, but SST over the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean 30°C-32°C. Significantly, the cost of damage, loss of lives and livelihood have enormous socio-economic impacts. A year of climate breakdown by UK-based charity Christian Aid in December 2020 stated that Cyclone Amphan had caused maximum damage to coastal parts of West Bengal, displacing around 4.9 million people, which accounted for the biggest displacement anywhere in the world in 2020 due to an extreme weather event. Because of these high SST, the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean have conditions favourable for frequent formation of cyclones with rapid intensification with a direct impact on rainfall and agricultural productions, apart from destruction, inundation and evacuation. Scientists held anthropogenic causes or human carbon emissions behind such a rise of SST. Drawing similarity between cyclone Tauktae, which wreaked havoc across nine states in west coast on May 18 and Yaas in the east coast on May 26, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology scientist and IPCC lead author (oceans and cryosphere) Roxy Mathew Koll wrote: “Similarity between Cyclone Yaas and Tauktae is that both are preceded by very high sea surface temperatures reaching 31°C-32°C. However, there is one difference. Tauktae spent several days in the Arabian Sea where it could draw the heat and moisture continuously, reaching peak intensity of more than 220 km/hr. In the case of Yaas, it was formed in the north Bay of Bengal, and the travel distance to landfall was shorter.” According to a report by Christian Aid in December 2020, floods and Cyclone Amphan in India accounted for maximum loss of lives globally due to climate change-triggered events in 2020. In fact, Cyclone Amphan was the costliest cyclone of the year and had an economic impact of over $13 billion (about Rs 96,000 crore). According to meteorologist Mahesh Palawat, “we could not evade the destruction across the coastal districts of Odisha as Yaas hit the land as a very severe cyclonic storm. At the time of landfall, winds speed gusting up to 185km/hr along with torrential rains, which can cause mass destruction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-surface-temperature-at-sea-behind-frequent-cyclones-experts/articleshow/83017884.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In a bid to encourage vaccination among common people, the DM has asked the district supply officer to instruct all the PDS dealers to ask the beneficiaries to show the vaccination certificate of first or the second dose and maintain their record in the register. In another initiative, the DM has asked district disaster management officer in-charge Amit Kumar to make a help desk functional to assist kin of the victims of Covid–19, lightning or road accident so that they can get the benefits of disaster management schemes. The DM also asked the staff working at the help desk to prepare a checklist of documents required to get the compensation from disaster management department. The helpdesk would provide information about the schemes to the kin of the victim. According to the data of district health society, the target for vaccination of 19,762 healthcare and 25,522 frontline workers has been achieved. But among other citizen above 45 years, so far 2,81,536 have taken their first dose against the target of 8,64,000, which is 32.59%.

A decision to this effect was taken at a virtual meeting chaired by Sinha to assess the situation arising out of Covid-19 pandemic. The legislative secretariat was closed after several officials and employees were detected Covid positive. Deputy director of the legislative assembly, Sanjay Kumar Singh, said chairmen of all the legislative committees, members of the legislative assembly and officials of the legislative secretariat were present at the virtual meeting. Sinha said the second wave of the pandemic has affected one and all, directly or indirectly, and many have lost their kin. “The impact of the pandemic will be felt for long,” the Speaker said.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Those sent certificate without jab can sign up with different phone number||People who were sent a vaccination certificate and a confirmation SMS without getting a jab will have to re-register on the Co-Win website using a different mobile number to get their shots, a central official with the Co-Win management team said. Though health ministry introduced a four-digit security code to prevent this error again, people sent the certificates/SMSes have been unable to get a shot as Co-Win shows they have received one. Pune resident Shruti Nair said, “I had booked a slot for May 5 for a Covaxin jab. But even before I could enter the site, I was told it had run out of shots. I returned home and around 1.45pm that day, I got a text saying I had been vaccinated. There was a certificate too on the Co-Win portal stating I had received my first dose at the site.” Nair said Co-Win then did not let her reschedule the appointment since she was not eligible for a “second dose” till June 2. Sheetal Bhatia, a family physician, faced a similar problem and was refused a second dose at a site. She said, “We had to re-register with a different phone number. A relative had to argue with staff at a hospital to get her shot because she had the same problem.” Working professional Chandana Pusapati said, “I registered my father for his first dose but he could not go. That afternoon, I got an SMS and certificate stating he had got his jab. I've been struggling since then to get him his first dose. He is 61 and I cannot register for him anymore.” The central official with the Co-Win team said a possible reason for such errors could be sites vaccinating someone else in lieu of a person who had not turned up after taking an online appointment. He said, “Rather than creating a new record, some sites vaccinate someone else and register the shot in the name of the person it was meant for as per appointment. This happens especially when the last few doses of the day are remaining.” “Even if they register with same documents as previous registration, the system will accept it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-those-sent-cert-without-jab-can-sign-up-with-different-phone-no-/articleshow/83018678.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Homes choked as Covid-19 triggers abnormal buying||RAJKOT: When Sapan Pansuriya saw his wife buying vegetables in big quantities, he was a bit surprised but didn’t suspect anything wrong. But Pabariya, 43, started getting jittery when his wife continued buying vegetables even as their refrigerator could no more take in. She then started storing the vegetables in their neighbour’s house. A worried Pabariya then called up the dedicated helpline set up by Saurashtra University’s psychology department to counsel people affected by the prevailing pandemic situation. “We counselled the woman and after a few follow ups she finally stopped purchasing,” said Dimpal Ramani, an assistant professor in the department. A voluminous study report prepared by analyzing nearly 3,500 calls received on the helpline ever since the pandemic broke out in March last year. Of these, close to 1,000 callers had sought help for abnormal buying, mostly by their spouses. The study reveals that a large number of people have developed a habit to hoard essential and non-essential items out of fear that they may go out of stock due to the lockdown. The professors analyzed the contents of calls for nearly a month and ‘hoarding’ as well as selfish behaviour were the most striking “It’s a kind of temporary illness triggered by mindset change over the last 18 months,” said Hasmukh Chavda, assistant professor who co-authored the study along with Ramani and student Arpita Dhamelia. Researchers were stunned to get SOS calls of people complaining about their spouses hoarding items such as cigarettes. Hetal Vithlani (name changed), wife of a businessman, voluntarily sought help after realizing that she was going overboard in buying cosmetics. “I constantly feared that the beauty parlours would never open. So, I started buying all beauty products and cosmetics. But realizing that this was not normal behaviour, I approached the helpline whose volunteers counselled me,” he told TOI. “One woman told us that her husband had stocked up several cartons of cigarettes, which constricted the space in their room,” added Ramani. The study details several cases of people who used to buy groceries for a week or month before Covid but are now purchasing in quantities that could last for a couple of years. In fact, commodities like tobacco, cigarettes, snacks, medicines, masks, sanitizers and soft drinks are lying in huge quantities in many homes. “We also came across people who confessed to having stored petrol and diesel in bottles,” revealed Ramani. According to the researchers, “People witnessed and experienced harrowing times like shortage of beds, medicines, non-availability of non-essential commodities, which left a deep impact in the minds of people.” An ayurveda shop owner in Rajkot added, “Earlier, people used to buy campor worth maximum Rs 50 to purify air in the house. I have come across customers who brought camphor worth Rs 5,000 during pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/homes-choked-as-covid-19-triggers-abnormal-buying/articleshow/83017794.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Man charters flight to save critically ill brother||VADODARA: Sibling love soared high above materialistic concerns when a Palanpur businessman literally paid his way through hell and high to help his elder brother stay alive. It happened three weeks ago, when doctors attending to Rajesh Pujara, a resident of Ahmedabad battling severe Covid-induced lung infection, informed his younger brother Dhiraj that there was little chance of his survival. In fact, doctors gave the 49-year-old patient barely 48 hours of life. But Dhiraj was determined to save his brother at any cost. Dhiraj Pujara who hired chartered flight“I began inquiring in hospitals offering better medical treatment in other metro cities. A private hospital in Chennai agreed to treat Rajesh after three of their doctors examined him. But he was in critical condition and I needed to decide quickly. I, therefore, decided to hire a chartered air ambulance to take Rajesh immediately to Chennai from Ahmedabad,” the businessman told TOI. “In face of death, money wasn’t a concern and I was prepared to spend everything to save my brother. We couldn’t hire a chartered flight from Ahmedabad and had to get one so from Delhi, which reached Ahmedabad on May 7 while Rajesh was brought to airport through a green corridor that was enabled with special permission from the authorities,” said Dhiraj, who doled out Rs 21 lakh for a one-way flight for Rajesh and three medical staff. “Rajesh was admitted to Fortis Hospital in Chennai, where he responded well to the treatment and defeated Covid. His lung infection too is on decline,” said Dhiraj, adding that his elder sibling may, however, need a lung replacement and was kept under observation in the hospital. On April 17, Rajesh, a resident of Science City in Ahmedabad and father of two children, was detected with Covid and he was under home treatment but his condition deteriorated within five days, following which he was taken to a private hospital in the city. Palanpur-based Dhiraj rushed to his brother’s aid after learning about his serious condition. Dhiraj recalled the worst times when his brother was shifted to another private hospital and kept on a ventilator as his oxygen levels dipped and his health kept deteriorating further. “My brother’s condition is much better now and we are all relieved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-charters-flight-to-save-critically-ill-bro/articleshow/83017837.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Fuel price hike hits home budget as items turn dearer||JAIPUR: Increased fuel prices have impacted cost of essential commodities in every kitchen. Prices of edible oils including mustard, groundnut and soybean have doubled in just a year. Also, there has been a marginal rise in the prices of pulses, wheat flour and rice. Wholesalers told TOI that because of pandemic and lockdown, the production has been affected while markets are facing a surge in demand. TOI on Thursday spoke to wholesalers and retailers to know what led to the increase in prices of essentials used in every household. “First, production in oil mills has been affected and second, due to rise in fuel prices, transportation costs have spiralled. With people working from homes, household consumption has increased. So, we have supply issues, but demand has increased. These are a few reasons why prices have increased,” said Pankaj Gupta, a wholesaler dealing in edible oil at Sodala. He added that prices of mustard oil were between Rs 90 and Rs 100 per litre in May 2020 but now it has shot up to Rs 180-Rs 190. “Prices of other edible oils including soybean, sunflower, groundnut and other refined oils have also doubled,” said Tarun Sharma, a retailer at Jhotwara. Likewise, there has been marginal rise in prices of pulses, wheat flour and rice. “In all kinds of pulses there is an increase of 10 to 20 per cent while the prices of wheat flour and rice too have increased,” said Ramawtar Gupta, a wholesaler in Malviya Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fuel-price-hike-hits-home-budget-as-items-turn-dearer/articleshow/83018634.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Business||ICICI Lombard steps up on AI, deploys Microsoft’s speech services||Mumbai: ICICI Lombard General Insurance is working towards using Microsoft’s speech-to-text tools as a stepping stone to build up artificial intelligence (AI) capability in dealing with customers. The company has now deployed Azure Speech Services and Natural Language Processing in its outward call centres to automate supervision of calls. The longer-term goal is to use these conversations to teach its artificial intelligence systems so that they have the capability of facing customers directly in future. The company has already tasted success in using image recognition under Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services in assessing claims. It now aims to make further use of the cloud-based platform. According to ICICI Lombard chief technology office Girish Nayak, the company does around 10,000 outbound calls a day. Earlier, it used to manually screen 20% of the calls to check compliance and quality of its tele-customer services. “For much of the technology that we have deployed, the true value has come out now because of the lockdown situation as it has helped in the last mile reach,” said Nayak. Acknowledging that ICICI Lombard has been a frontrunner in deployment of the software giants cognitive services, Microsoft national technology officer Rohini Srivathsa said that the insurer has shown ingenuity in adopting technology from a platform and customising it at two levels — first for the non-life industry where everyday words like ‘cover’ and ‘claim’ hold different meanings and then for Indian ‘Hinglish’ where two languages are used in the same sentence. According to Srivathsa, ICICI Lombard will have access to all the research and development (R&D) that is happening at Microsoft in developing its voice agent Cortana. “The core technologies as they advance, the advancement will go into any of the customers using the models. For Indian languages, there is a mixing of language, the structural difference of Indian language is also captured,” she said. While banking finance insurance are ahead of game in the digitisation journey, the technology can be used by any industry that has high customer-facing or high customer interaction, said Srivathsa. “Around 2017-18 we started experimenting with the AI/ML piece on Azure. We used image recognition to identify damages on vehicles to come up with break-in solutions. We are running models where it can not just figure whether there is damage, but it can also assess the damage and ascertain whether it needs repair or replacement and virtual run the entire claim process. We have used the Microsoft tools for fraud detection, It is a natural progression from AI,” said Nayak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icici-lombard-steps-up-on-ai-deploys-microsofts-speech-services/articleshow/83045462.cms||Mayur Shetty

Bikaner remained hottest in the state where a maximum temperature of 45.5°C was recorded. Attributing the rise in mercury to active northerly winds, Jaipur Met office stated that the temperatures will continue to rise in the state for the next couple of days. Though some places in the state witnessed cloudy conditions, it did not bring any respite from the scorching heat conditions. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning as a minimum temperature of 26.1°C was recorded in the city. It was followed by a scorching afternoon as the mercury hit of 41.1°C. For the past couple of days, the state is reeling under severe heatwave conditions when there is an increase in the maximum and minimum temperatures. On Thursday, except Ajmer, majority of the places witnessed maximum temperatures above 40°C. Ajmer recorded a maximum temperature of 39.4°C. Jaipur Met office had forecast on Tuesday that temperatures will continue to rise for next nine days. Many places are likely to report maximum temperatures well above 45°C. Bikaner was followed by Sriganganagar where a maximum temperature of 45.3°C was recorded, Pali and Phalodi 45°C each, Jaisalmer 44.5, Churu 44.4 , Barmer 43.4, Karauli 43.3, Sawai Madhopur 43.1, Pilani 42.9, Jodhpur 42.5 and Kota recorded 42.2°C.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Diesel price hike leads to lack of transport, affects vegetable supply||KOLKATA: Vegetable supply to the city suffered on Thursday, not so much because of loss of standing crops but due to non-availability of goods vehicles to carry perishables from the haat to wholesale points and retail markets. Waterlogged roads and a higher diesel price played critical roles. The diesel price on Thursday rose to Rs 87.51 a litre. Diesel prices have spiked 14 times in the past 24 days. “Carriage costs rose 15%-20% overnight. Since suburban trains are not running, we are dependent on road transportation,” said Bimal Ghosh of South Suburban Vegetable Vendors’ Association. Those who managed to turn up did not find good demand. “Most citizens have stocked up on things for the next three-four days, pre-empting an Amphan-like aftermath to Yaas. Because of the frequent showers on Thursday morning, people preferred to stay home. So the gap between demand and supply did not feel normal,” said Shankar Debnath of Barisha market. However, if this gap persists for another day, the demand can push up prices. “Transportation costs have become a cause of worry. Prices of tomato, beans, capsicum, ridged gourd and green jackfruit have risen marginally. Moreover, the loss of standing crop in inundated fields will have an impact on prices in two or three days,” said West Bengal Vegetable Vendors’ Association president Kamal Dey. Before the restrictions were enforced, a small goods carriage with carrying capacity of three tonnes-four tonnes of vegetables cost Rs 3,000. During the curbs, it jumped to Rs 7,000. Now, successive spikes in diesel price has pushed the cost to Rs 11,000-Rs 13,000. This will increase vegetable cost. The same amount of vegetables, when brought by train, cost Rs 1,600,” said Dey, a member of the state’s market task force. Between May 4 and 27, there were 14 hikes in diesel price. On May 4, it rose to Rs 83.8. Ever since, diesel got costlier by Rs 3.71 to become Rs 87.51 a litre. “Our operating costs are spiralling on a daily basis. We initially absorbed the costs. But eventually this led to hike in hiring charges,” said South Bengal Goods Carriers’ Association secretary Suresh Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/diesel-price-hike-leads-to-lack-of-transport-affects-vegetable-supply/articleshow/83017899.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Business||Foreign banks lose card mkt share||Mumbai: Foreign banks have seen their share of credit cards come down by a third in the last three years. In terms of value of transactions, their share has halved as that of private and public sector banks have grown. According to data released by the RBI, foreign banks had 57 lakh credit cards outstanding as of March 2018. At that time, there were 3.8 crore credit cards in India, which gave the multinationals a market share of 15%. However, despite losing market share, the foreign banks had significant clout because of the higher value of transactions by their customers who spent more than the average cardholder. In 2018, the foreign banks had monthly card spends of Rs 10,380 crore — a 23.4% share. Fast forward to March 2021, when the total market expanded to 6.2 crore cards while the number of cards issued by foreign banks stood at 66 lakhs, reflecting a market share of nearly 11%. It is not just in the number of cards that the multinationals have been losing ground. In terms of value of transactions too, foreign banks have a market share of 11.8% in the Rs 72,372-crore monthly volume. While private banks have consolidated their market share in the card space, increasing their share from 63% to 66%, public sector banks have grown from 21.6% to 23.2% in three years. State Bank of India accounts for almost 80% of all public sector banks. Overall, SBI has 19% of the credit card market, which is still behind the 24% share of HDFC Bank.In global banks, four dominate the credit card space — Citi, Amex, StanChart and HSBC. These MNC banks have also played a pioneering role in the card business in India and they dominated the market in the ’90s. Citi’s decision to exit its retail business in India could further reduce share of foreign banks, should the portfolio be taken by a local player. Additionally, American Express faces a freeze on on-boarding new customers due to data-localisation norms even as more private banks are stepping in. In 2018, American Express had 3% of the credit card market in terms of number of customers. But it accounted for 10% of all spending by credit card customers in India. In 2021, their share of cards shrunk to 2.5%, while the share of spending declined to 4%. Citibank, which had a 7% share of cards and 9% share of spend, saw these fall to 4% and 6%, respectively. HSBC has held ground better than others with a market share of 1.4% as of March 2021 (1.5% in ’18) and retaining its 1% share of total spend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/foreign-banks-lose-card-mkt-share/articleshow/83019883.cms||Mayur Shetty

Places which received significant showers included Gaya (68.8mm), Bhagalpur (28.6mm), Purnia (20mm), Aurangabad (26.5mm) and Jamui (30mm). At Gaya, moderate to heavy rain occurred throughout the day since morning, causing waterlogging on some roads in the town. Also, the water level in the Falgu rose due to heavy downpour in Jharkhand. The rainwater flowing down the hills in Jharkhand reaches Falgu after Neelanjana river in Dobhi. A dam has been made at Ghoraghat in Dobhi block of Gaya to stop the water flowing from Jharkhand and use it for irrigation purpose in nearby villages. Junior engineer Sanjeev Kumar and agriculture coordinator Anand Mohan have been deputed as magistrates for Ghoraghat dam to keep vigil on the situation. Besides, other officials, including Gaya executive engineer of water resources department, Dobhi BDO, CO and the SHO have been asked to remain in constant touch with the magistrates. ADM (disaster management) has been asked to keep NDRF and the SDRF teams ready for deployment in any crisis situation. In Bhojpur, DM Roshan Kushwaha has asked civil surgeon and executive engineer of South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited at Ara and Jagdishpur to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Ara Sadar hospital, sub-divisional hospitals and primary health centres to ensure functioning of life-saving equipment without disruption. The DM has also asked Bhojpur civil surgeon to coordinate with private hospitals and keep alternative power supply arrangements in ready mode for government as well as private hospitals. The civil surgeon has also been asked to keep ambulances in ready mode to deal with any eventuality. Ara Municipal Corporation and nagar panchayat officials have been asked to keep pump sets, earthmovers and generators ready to clear waterlogging.

---||Business||Gains from provision pip forex profits||Mumbai: The RBI managed to increase the surplus it transfers to the government by 73% to Rs 99,122 crore in FY21 because of lower provisions following by higher forex profits. The central bank’s annual report for 2020-21 gives a pointer to its finances. According to the report, RBI’s income dropped 11% to Rs 1.3 lakh crore from Rs 1.5 lakh crore last year as the accounts were for a nine-month period due to a change in accounting year to coincide with the fiscal year. However, expenditure too fell by 63% to Rs 34,146 crore from Rs 92,540 crore in previous year. This was because provisions dropped 72% to Rs 20,710 crore from Rs 73,615 crore earlier.The provisions made by the RBI are a percentage of its balance sheet size. In 2020-21, RBI’s balance sheet grew by only 7% to Rs 57 lakh crore — an expansion of Rs 3.7 lakh crore. In terms of the Bimal Jalan-led committee’s recommendation, the RBI strives to maintain 5.5% of balance sheet as contingency reserve. On the forex front, the RBI makes profits from its transactions as the average cost at which it has purchased dollars is around Rs 57. In FY21, the central bank earned Rs 50,629 crore from forex transactions, which is 68% higher than Rs 29,993 crore earned in the previous year. Any sale above that price results in a profit. The RBI typically buys dollars when there is a large inflow and sells the dollars whenever there is volatility. The downside is that more the central bank churns its portfolio, the closer is the value of its dollar holdings to market value. Among other changes in the balance sheet, the RBI has used rupees crore as the unit of presentation from rupees billion earlier. The increase on the asset side was mainly due to increase in foreign and domestic investments by 11.5% and 13.7%, respectively. On the liability side, the increase was due to increase in deposits, notes issued and other liabilities by 26.8%, 7.2% and 43%, respectively. Domestic assets constituted 26.4% while foreign currency assets and gold (including gold deposit and gold held in India) constituted 73.5% of total assets as on March 31, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gains-from-provision-pip-forex-profits/articleshow/83020021.cms||---

Calling it the ‘risk of a bubble’, the central bank in its annual report pointed out that the sharp rally in the stock market came despite an estimated 8% contraction in GDP in 2020-21. “This order of asset price inflation in the context of the estimated 8% contraction in GDP in 2020-21 poses the risk of a bubble,” the RBI said in the report. The central bank also said that the widening gap between stretched asset prices relative to prospects for recovery in real economic activity has emerged as a global policy concern. The stock markets are mainly driven by money supply and foreign portfolio investor (FPI) investments, the RBI noted. Economic prospects also result into stock market movement but its impact is relatively less compared to money supply and foreign fund inflow, it said. The RBI believes that the liquidity support that the economy received to help its recovery during the Covid-pandemic months can lead to unintended consequences in the form of inflationary asset prices, thus liquidity support cannot be unrestrained and indefinite. The bank feels there was a need for calibrated unwinding once the pandemic waves are flattened and the real economy is back on the recovery path.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/risk-of-bubble-in-stock-mkt-cautions-rbi/articleshow/83020051.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They say symptoms like cough, fatigue, muscle pain and shortness of breath, which may last for a few weeks or even months, are not to be ignored. Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former superintendent of the Patna Medical College and Hospital, urges patients to immediately visit the post-Covid clinics in different hospitals in case of any medical complications. Deputy superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Dr Satish Kumar, lists a variety of health issues, including uneasiness, exhaustion, headache, joint and muscle pain, Covid-recovered patients usually experience. He says, “The inadvertent use of steroids and antibiotics can result in partial or complete suppression of an individual’s immune response.” Dr Satish also points out that Covid-19 can lead to a rise in mental health issues among the recovered patients. Throwing light on other post-Covid symptoms like palpitations, breathlessness and dizziness, Dr Gangadhar Singh of Government Ayurvedic College and Hospital advises people to perform respiratory exercises and yoga asanas. He also asks them to eat a nutritious diet that consists of fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, quite a few corona patients, who have defeated the virus, are now in touch with their doctors and seeking medical advice from time to time. Girish Kumar Chaudhary, vice-chancellor of Patna University, got infected on April 9 and tested negative on May 5. He, however, still feels weak and has regular headaches. “I am consuming the medicines that my doctor has prescribed,” he says. Although Shiva Jatan Thakur, former member of the Bihar Public Service Commission, recovered from Covid three weeks back, he is experiencing problems like shortness of breath.

This is the third known case of a Covid patient dying by suicide at a hospital in Bihar. The other two cases, also at AIIMS, were reported last year. The Covid-19 pandemic has over the past year put a lot of stress on mental health. A sudden change in lifestyle due to lockdown, work from home, social distancing and the threat of the virus looming have made people worried and this is taking a toll on their mental health. The worst affected are those who are battling the Covid-19 virus. Several studies have shown that such patients have more chances of developing mental health problems than others. In a report published in The Lancet in November, it was found that 18% of Covid-19 positive patients had mental health problems. In another study based on media reports of Covid-19 related suicides in India, it was found to be more frequent in males as 80.8% of suicides were committed by them. Of all suicides, 37.5% occurred in institutional settings, 13.9% in homes, 9.9% in places close to home and 40.3% in other places like hotels and railway tracks. Also, 88.8% of such people had no medical comorbidity and in 91.3% of them, psychiatric illness type was absent. On the three suicides by Covid-19 positive people at AIIMS-P, the hospital's nodal in-charge, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said such people face physiological and psychiatric problems due to various reasons. “First of all, they live in fear of Covid and then they are away from family and friends. In the case of ICU, patients do not even know whether it is day or night. Also, they see serious patients and deaths in the surroundings,” Dr Sanjeev said. He further said seeing such mental health issues, doctors and nurses of AIIMS-Patna were trained to identify such patients early so that they could be given treatment accordingly. “We even allowed mobile phones so that patients could talk to their family members or watch videos. We have also put a television in all the wards for the same purpose, but I feel these steps are not enough.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/suicide-at-aiims-patna-puts-spotlight-on-mental-health-of-covid-patients/articleshow/83018031.cms||Sheezan Nezami

At an aggregate level, the RBI has said that the capital of banks is enough to meet a severe stress scenario. In its annual report released on Thursday, the RBI said that it has conducted stress tests on banks to check how prepared they are in a crisis. Although until last year many public sector banks were reporting losses due to provisions for bad loans, several have turned the corner and have reported profits for FY21. In its annual report, the central bank has stressed the importance of vaccinations for recovery. It said that with cases beginning to drop recently, the macro-economic costs of this wave can be limited to Q1FY22 with possible spillovers into July. Given the risks arising out of the second wave, the RBI has asked banks to closely monitor their bad loans and prepare themselves for higher provisioning. “With the lifting of the interim stay on asset classification standstill by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on March 23, 2021, banks’ asset quality will need to be closely monitored in coming quarters, with preparedness for higher provisioning,” it said. The central bank has said that it has taken several measures to improve financial market infrastructure. This includes creation of a “request for quote option for illiquid government securities in the central platform for dealing in G-secs”. As part of efforts under way to increase access to government securities market for retail investors, the CDSL was granted in-principle approval to develop an IT-based solution for enabling retail investors to directly access the government securities market through their demat accounts. The RBI also said that it was improving the supervisory framework for non-banking finance companies and creating a central fraud registry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-have-enough-capital-to-meet-severe-stress-rbi/articleshow/83019969.cms||---

When the girl was examined and suggested immediate surgery, she tested Covid positive and was admitted for its treatment in the hospital. The doctors had to wait for over two weeks to undertake the surgery. The team led by Dr Jagjit Pandey and Dr Anil Kumar of surgery department said the tumour size was 34x32 centimetre. Dr Anil said such a huge tumour exerts high pressure on other internal organs like lungs and intestine causing difficulty in breathing and it was sheer negligence in seeking medical suggestion on part of the family that it went on growing. The occurrence of ovarian tumour in early age is mostly genetic. “Since the patient was under Covid treatment, we feared more complications due to low level of immunity but all the physiological parameters after the surgery were found proper,” he said. Others in the team included Dr Nishant Sahay and Dr Sarfaraj of anesthesia and Dr Hemendra and Dr Satish of the surgery department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ovarian-tumour-weighing-9kg-removed-by-docs/articleshow/83015210.cms||---

The class 8 student lost her father Atul and mother Mansi, both 60 years old, to Covid-19 in April. “My uncle and aunt died in succession on April 5 and 8 respectively at Civil Hospital during treatment. My uncle was working with a Naroda-based gram flour manufacturing brand for the past 30 years,” recounts Soni. The couple tested positive in March end when the deadly second wave began. Not wanting to get hospitalized, they opted to get treated by a local healthcare service provider. “After a week, their oxygen level started deteriorating and they were rushed to Civil Hospital. The doctors warned us both were critically ill, and both succumbed within days of each other,” said Soni. The couple leaving behind a minor daughter appears a cruel twist of fate in the lives of the couple who tragically lost two children earlier. “Their first born, a mentally ill girl child did not survive for long. Their second child, a son, too died young following a sudden illness. Yearning for a child, they decided to bring another child in their mid-life. Jharna was born to them when they were in their mid-forties,” said Soni. “They’ve left behind their house for Jharna, but there’s no income source. Jharna wishes to study further and per her father's wish. The government scheme of Rs 4,000 per month would help us pay her fees. Only education can help her pave her own path in society.” Jharna is among the 12-odd children identified by state-based NGOs who have lost both their parents to the pandemic. The state government had announced earlier this month that the kids would be provided Rs 4,000 per month till they attain adulthood. Sources close to the development said that the GR (government resolution) by the Social Justice & Empowerment (SJ&E) department would expand the scope to add the children who have lost their earning parent due to Covid-19. Sources said that the change may add hundreds of children. When contacted, Manoj Agarwal, ACS (SJ&E), said that work on the proposal is on. “We will come out with the draft soon,” he said. Binal Patel, coordinator of Childline (1098) helpline, said they have received only one case of the child losing both her parents. “Majority inquiries are related to children losing their fathers to the pandemic,” she said. Savitri Vaishyak, a resident of Saijpur, lost her 47-year-old husband to Covid on May 13. “He was the sole breadwinner for our family of six including his parents. I have two daughters aged two and four. I have no other option but to start seeking a job to sustain my family,” she said. “If the government extends this help, it would surely be a life-saving gesture for my kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/orphaned-by-covid-teen-wants-to-study-further-fulfil-dads-wish/articleshow/83017865.cms||Parth Shastri

District guardian minister Balasaheb Patil said the trusts and NGOs will be given all necessary financial and infrastructural assistance to set up the isolation facilities. Currently, strict lockdown has been imposed across the district and the whole government machinery is involved in tackling Covid. At present there are more than 12,000 home isolated patients. “It is seenthat all members of families are getting infected after one member gets the infection from outside. The rise in number of cases is due to contacts with the near ones. To stop the spread, the government has asked districts to move the patients and put them in isolation centres. We are roping in the NGOs and trusts for setting up the facilities,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satara-admin-to-seek-help-from-ngos/articleshow/83012354.cms||---

In the last one week, 1,504 beneficiaries have been taken to Madhya Pradesh’s Nainpur, Balaghat and Chhindwara from different places, including Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, for vaccination. A good number of SECR employees and their family members from different places of eastern Vidarbha like Nagpur, Gondia, Nagbhid, Chanda fort, Ballarshah and such places were ferried in eight workman’s special trains to vaccination centres in Madhya Pradesh. The SCER took the initiative due to shortages of vaccines in Maharashtra. Another reason was several personnel and their families had fallen victim to Covid-19 in the second wave. “In an earlier initiative, camps were held to vaccinate SECR employees and their families,” said Nagpur division’s divisional railway manager (DRM) Maninder Uppal. After the latest initiative of running special trains, around 8,400 staffers out of 12,200 have been vaccinated.SECR employees and their family members from Madhya Pradesh too benefited from the initiative of running special trains. Some distance was covered by buses too.The special trains, carrying maintenance supplies and equipment with an additional coach for railway employees and their family members, were operated between Gondia and Balaghat, Nagbhid and Balaghat, Itwari and Chhindwara, Itwari and Gondia, Chanda Fort and Balaghat and also Itwari and Balaghat. This ensured beneficiaries could reach the vaccination centres at the stipulated time as per their registration in the Co-Win app.Sources stated Uppal sought help from Madhya Pradesh government additional chief secretary (health) to get vaccines for railway men deployed at places along the two newly opened broad gauge lines.“The 467-km route between Jabalpur, Gondia and Ballarshah was converted into broad gauge and another 50% conversion had taken place between Chhindwara and Nainpur, which connected Itwari too. Before their conversion to broad gauge couple of years, these routes were narrow gauge and had become defunct. Personnel were needed to operate and manage the trains on the broad gauge,” said Uppal.  “Every 10-12 km we had to post men who moved there with their families. Most of these places neither have hospitals nor any health facilities. We had to ensure that the employees and their families were vaccinated,” said Uppal.Uppal also took up the matter with the MP’s director of National Health Mission, Chavvi Bharadwaj. Collectors of Mandla (Nainpur), Balaghat and Chhinwara were also contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-runs-special-trains-to-mp-to-vaccinate-staff-in-vid-remote-places/articleshow/83016688.cms||Soumitra Bose

Thariyal, an English professor from Delhi University, was shifted to the private hospital from state-run GT Hospital after orders on May 19 from another vacation bench. On Thursday, Thariyal’s counsel Yug Chaudhry informed a vacation bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar that his client’s eye infection has not yet healed and he is still Covid positive, so if he is sent back to Taloja prison, it may prove “fatal”. The HC then requested the hospital not to discharge him till the next hearing and if it has to do so before the date, it should seek the court’s permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-discharge-elgar-accused-till-june-1-court-tells-pvt-hosp/articleshow/83022869.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala exploring scope for customized, online platform||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: General education department is exploring the possibility of sourcing a free and customized version of an online meeting platform by one of the leading multinational companies in the field. Education minister V Sivankutty told reporters on Thursday that the department was keen to introduce interactive classes, in addition to the telecast of digitally-recorded classes through the KITE Victers channel. Director of general education, K Jeevan Babu said the department has not finalized any particular platform to be used for the conduct of online interactive classes that will be offered in a phased manner. According to sources, the government is averse to using any commonly available meeting platforms in the way they are available currently. Email ID is a basic requisite for the host and participants to join a meeting and a majority of CBSE and ICSE schools use this mode of facility for organizing interactive classes. Though the government had introduced recorded classes as a supplementary learning solution last academic year, lakhs of children in government and aided schools had to eventually depend on the same throughout the year. “Interactive classes are a must. But, we cannot compromise on data privacy of students and teachers. What we are trying to bring is a customized platform that would be integrated into the education department portal. Teachers would be able to host meetings using a unique ID being allotted to their respective school and respective students would be able to use their roll number for a password to access the class,” sources said. Babu said that online interactive classes would be introduced in a phased manner and connectivity of students was one of the major concerns. According to a proposal submitted by KITE to the general education secretary Mohammed Hanish, facilities for online monitoring of students’ learning progress and interactive tools for the learning assessment should also be made part of the proposed online interactive classes. Meanwhile, Balasangham, CPM’s children’s organization submitted its study report on the learning experience of students during the previous academic year. The report urged the government to introduce more online and interactive classes by ensuring internet access to all students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-exploring-scope-for-customized-online-platform/articleshow/83027623.cms||---
---||Pune||New Covid admissions stopped at Magar jumbo unit||Pimpri Chinchwad: Owing to a drop in Covid patients, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has stopped admission of new patients at the Annasaheb Magar Stadium Jumbo facility from Wednesday. Officials said the 800-bed facility has treated over 4,000 patients this year after resuming operation in the last week of March. The other jumbo facility at the College of Engineering Pune ground, however, will continue to function as usual. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that they have stopped admissions at the Magar jumbo unit considering that less than 200 patients are being treated there at present. “We are going to wind up the Magar stadium jumbo unit facility at the earliest. Our focus will now be on our existing medical facilities. We are strengthening the Akurdi and Thergaon hospital, which will have 400-bed capacity each with ventilator and oxygen-support beds,” he said. According to Patil, the financial aspect also played a key role in restricting the operation of Magar stadium jumbo facility. Sangram Kapale, director, MedBros Healthcare private limited, which looks after the medical operations at the Magar stadium jumbo unit, told TOI that the operation would most likely be wound up by May 31. He added that over 4,000 Covid positive patients were treated at the said facility. Kapale further added that since resuming operation in March this year, they have treated over 4,000 patients at the facility and around 65% of patient inflow was from outside the PCMC limits. “Most patients were from Pune rural and in some cases, there were patients from other districts as well,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s hospital board of India, said that neither of the jumbo facility should be closed at present. “The current Covid scenario is unpredictable. Considering the ease in restrictions ahead, there could be a surge in positive cases. We should be better prepared in case of such a scenario,” he said. A PMC official said that they don’t have any plan of closing down the jumbo unit facility at the College of Engineering Pune at present. While, Shreyansh Kapale from MedBros said that at most the number of beds will be reduced rather than closing the facility. Last year, the PCMC had decided to halt admissions on December 31, 2020, owing to a drop in cases and had shut the facility on January 15, 2021.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Walk-ins for 45-plus for Covishield first dose?||MUMBAI: BMC plans to liberalise the vaccination drive further by allowing walk-ins for people aged above 45 willing to take the first dose of Covishield. Currently, walk-ins are only allowed for people above 60 who are taking the first dose of Covishield and second dose of Covaxin. For those above 45, walk-ins are allowed only for second dose of either vaccine. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that they were toying with the idea of allowing more people to walk in and get vaccinated. “We are discussing this, and a decision will be taken in 2-3 days,” he said. Mumbai allows walk-in vaccinations from Monday to Wednesday, when one does not need an online appointment. On Thursday, 41,130 took the vaccine in the city. After 493 lactating mothers walked in on Wednesday for vaccination on Wednesday, the number dropped to 20 on Thursday, presumably because vaccination was only through prior appointment on Co-Win. Meanwhile, public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government has shifted its attention to districts that are below the state’s average in vaccination. “We plan to give them more stocks to ensure they climb up the ladder,” said Tope. There is huge disparity in vaccine coverage between districts. Kolhapur, for instance, is leading by vaccinating 63% population in the 45-plus age group with at least one dose. While, Palghar is at the bottom, with 18.5% receiving the first dose. The state’s average is 34.3%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-walk-ins-for-45-plus-for-covishield-first-dose/articleshow/83018731.cms||---

In view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation, school reopening festival (Pravesanothsavam) would be held online. CM Pinarayi Vijayan would inaugurate the reopening festival. This will be followed by school-level festivals. The functions would be telecast on KITE Victers, the state’s education channel, using which general education department has been providing digitally-recorded classes to students from Classes I-XII, since last academic year due to the pandemic situation. “During initial days, classes on Victers channel would focus on programmes aimed at boosting the confidence of students who won’t be able to attend regular classes till the pandemic is over. There would be modules to help students brush up their knowledge base. It would act as a bridge course for students who have been promoted to higher classes,” the minister said. There were different views on how to conduct Plus One exams. A report comprising various factors in this regard was submitted to the chief minister, he said. Later, Vijayan told reporters during his daily media briefing that education department has been asked to make arrangement for the conduct of Plus One exams before Onam vacation. SSLC answer paper valuation camp would be held from June 7-16 and the process is expected to be complete by June 25. The government has already announced the decision to drop SSLC and THSLC practical exams this time, he said. Higher secondary and VHSE valuation camps would function from June 1-19. Higher secondary and vocational higher secondary practical exams will be held from June 21-July 7 Textbook distribution:The minister said 70% of school textbooks have reached school societies for distribution.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Not just deaths, cases among elderly dipping too, says officials||MUMBAI: In January and February this year, before Covid vaccination started, senior citizens accounted for 76% and 84% of the deaths, respectively, shows data collated by TOI from civic reports. In March too, their proportion in deaths was 80%. However, in April and May, despite deaths rising exponentially to 1,475 and 1,581 (May 26), respectively, fatalities in this age group dipped. Nearly 5 lakh senior citizens got vaccinated in March, around 4 lakh in April and a little over 2 lakh in May. But as the most vulnerable age group saw some respite, deaths rose among the lower age brackets (see box). Interestingly, around 48% in the 45-59 age group have got one shot while just 8% are fully vaccinated. Among those under 40, the share of deaths has risen from 3.4% in January to 7% in May. Less than 2% under 44 have got one shot. “If 77% (of elderly) have taken the first dose and there has been a decline in deaths, it’s worth speculating that vaccination may have played its part, but more detailed studies would be needed to make the correlation,” said immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. A clearer picture on the impact of vaccination would emerge once the majority of the population was vaccinated, she said, adding there have been general observations that deaths in the elderly have dropped even with a single dose. Civic officials pointed out that not just deaths, even the share of cases among the elderly is down. “It’s an encouraging sign, but vaccination alone may not have brought down the deaths. We have really pushed people in home isolation to move to hospitals on time or even those in private hospitals to be referred to BMC tertiary centres without delay,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The second Covid wave has indeed hit the young harder, said infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar, as ICUs had a good share of 30, 40 and 50 year olds. According to Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of the Dahisar jumbo Covid centre, “The elderly who bore the brunt in the first wave didn’t delay coming to hospitals, but many younger people did, which combined with low vaccination coverage could have made them more susceptible.” Vaccination will now be a crucial yardstick to measure susceptibility in future surges, said Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease specialist. “Mumbai must compare notes with vaccination coverage and deaths in other districts. We may know the real impact of vaccination by September to November.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-just-deaths-cases-among-elderly-dipping-too-says-officials/articleshow/83018810.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||HC: Every patient has right to life, no one can be given preference||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday said every patient has a right to life and to live with dignity but it cannot give privilege to anyone over other patients for providing medicine to treat black fungus, primarily affecting those recovered or recovering from Covid-19. The court said it was sure that a patient’s granddaughter, who was seeking direction to the government and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) to provide sufficient number of vials of Amphotericin B to him, was not seeking any preferential treatment over other patients. “Since the petitioner has now been included in the system set up in place for allocation of medicine for treatment of black fungus, we are hopeful that further allocation will be made while making it for other patients at SGRH as well,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said. Advocate Iqra Khalid, granddaughter of the 80-year-old patient, informed the court that as they missed one dose of the injection on May 23, when it was not available, the infection got spread to the orbit and sinus and two bones had to be removed and before this also he underwent two surgeries due to the infection. She said the patient has a right to life and to live with dignity and the state cannot deny it just because it is unable to import the medicine, which is already in shortage in the country. To this, the bench said, “Surely this right is there, we are not denying it and he should be given this right. But our order will not give him any privilege. We are sure even you will not ask or expect for any preference over others.” PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-every-patient-has-right-to-life-no-one-can-be-given-preference/articleshow/83018832.cms||---

In the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas, 115 ICU beds with ventilator support were available on Thursday evening. In comparison, 89 such beds were available in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. As many as 1,099 patients are still on ventilator support across the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said the number of critical patients in ICU units of hospitals was declining in the twin towns and the civic body was focusing on improvement of the existing medical infrastructure to tackle any further surge in Covid cases. A PMC official said the small and medium-sized hospitals might be allowed to resume their non-Covid functioning soon. The big hospitals would have to wait a little longer. PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said the administration would wait till June 5 to assess the situation and take a decision on releasing the beds reserved for Covid care in hospitals.

INS Shardul arrived at the Vallarpadam Container terminal (IGTPL) around 3pm to disembark four international standardization organization (ISO) containers carrying around 87 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen, which were handed over to state government officials. “Operation Samudra Setu-II was launched by the Navy for shipment of medical oxygen-filled cryogenic containers and associated medical equipment from various countries in support of the nation’s fight against Covid-19. The deployment of frontline warships, including destroyers, frigates, tankers and amphibious ships of the Navy for the operation forms a significant part of the multiple lines of efforts by the government of India and the Navy to supplement the oxygen requirement in the country,” said the Navy statement. As part of the operation, INS Shardul embarked 319 MT of liquid medical oxygen from Kuwait and UAE, including 11 ISO containers, two semi-trailers and 1,200 oxygen cylinders. During its return, the ship first arrived at New Mangalore Port on Tuesday, where it disembarked 231.77 MT of liquid medical oxygen comprising seven ISO containers, two semi-trailers and 1,200 oxygen cylinders. An amphibious ship capable of carrying troops, armoured tanks, vehicles and armament for amphibious operations, INS Shardul is a versatile platform that is also capable of undertaking humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. The ship attached to the first training squadron of the Navy based at Kochi has actively participated in multiple HADR operations by the Navy in the recent past. These include transhipment of 600 MT of rice to Antsiranana in Madagascar as humanitarian aid in March 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ins-shardul-brings-87-mt-liquid-oxygen-from-gulf/articleshow/83016803.cms||---

These days though it has acquired a new identity as the flight on which the probability of being the solo passenger aboard is the highest. Three days after an Emirates passenger had an entire Boeing 777 aircraft to himself, an Air India passenger flew solo on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner on May 22. After landing in Dubai, the entire crew, including the pilots, walked him right up to the passenger coach bus to see him off. Speaking to TOI from his Dubai office, Oswald Rodrigues said, “I felt like a maharaja on that Dreamliner flight,” referring to Air India’s ‘Fly like a Maharaja’ slogan. But this ‘maharaja’ had a few battles to win before he could board his ‘personal’ 256-seater Dreamliner. A negative RT-PCR report along with a QR-code linked to the original report is mandatory for international travel and the code on his report didn’t work.

Interestingly, the book was published in 2015, and it was continuing till this year, according to the activists of the Green Habitat, a Chavakkad-based conservation group, which has lodged a complaint. The text book gives a rather detailed account Dr Ayinapalli Aiyappan, who was born in 1905 and received his MA in economics from Madras University in 1927. Aiyappan had served as the director of the Government Museums, Madras, and post-retirement he was appointed vice-chancellor of Kerala University. He died in 1988. SCERT sources said they have already taken steps to correct the mistake. The picture of the poet was removed in the Malayalam version, which has been published without any photograph. The SCERT has now corrected the picture in the PDF format of the book available on the SCERT website as well as in the Samagra portal. “We have also given instruction to correct the photograph in the new edition of the book,” SCERT director J Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/scert-book-carries-poets-pic-instead-of-anthropologists/articleshow/83016833.cms||T Ramavarman

However, the doctors at Sir Sunder Lal hospital of Banaras Hindu University, where the newborn was delivered, did not see anything as surprising. BHU hospital’s medical superintendent Prof K K Gupta said on Thursday that the RT-PCR test method has its limitations and hence samples of the mother will be sent for Covid test again. A local couple had been consulting the doctors of the gynaecology department at the BHU hospital since the confirmation of pregnancy. The expectant mother had been called for admission by doctors on Tuesday. “When we reached the hospital for my wife’s admission, I was asked to go for Covid-19 test. The doctors admitted her after she tested negative and she gave birth to a girl child following caesarean delivery on Wednesday. The nursing staff showed me the baby from across the glass door,” said the newborn’s father. Later, the staff told me that my newborn daughter has tested Covid-19 positive, he added. Prof Gupta said, ‘It is nothing surprising in this as the RT-PCR test’s sensitivity is 70%, which means there are 30% chances of false report. In such cases, repeat tests are conducted to confirm results. The same process will be followed in this case, since the expectant woman had tested negative initially.” “We will follow the protocol of sterilizing the operation theatre and instruments,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/newborn-girl-tests-covid-vemom-tested-ve-before-surgery/articleshow/83017671.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The warning has been issued as crocodile breeding is under way on the banks of Krishna, Warna and Panchganga rivers and chances of animal-human conflict are high as these reptiles turn aggressive during this season. Devendra Bhosale, a member of Wildlife Protection and Research Society (WPRS), an NGO, said, “We got a call on Wednesday night that two crocodiles were there in the small stream behind the Panchganga crematorium, but only marks were spotted on the other side of the stream.” He said there are crocodiles in the Panchganga river stretch between the Panchganga ghat at Shivaji bridge and the Shiye bridge near the national highway. Amit Sayyad, a reptile specialist associated with WPRS, said the mating of crocodiles takes place during winter and the females lay eggs in February and March at secluded places near the river banks. “Breeding zones should be isolated and crocodile nests conserved by the forest department as it is a Schedule- 1 species.” Amol Jadhav, a member of Nature Conservation Society in Sangli, said a woman was attacked by a crocodile at Chopadewadi in Palus taluka of Sangli district on May 7 but she “luckily” escaped without much harm. “The Krishna river patch at Amnapur, Dhangaon, Chopdewadi, Bhilawdi, Bramnal in Sangli district is a crocodile habitat.” On Tuesday night, a nine-foot crocodile along with two hatchlings was spotted by brick kiln workers at the confluence of Krishna and Warana rivers in Kothali village of Sangli district. Seven baby crocodiles were found and released into their natural habitat while three eggs were left at their place. Vijay Mane, divisional conservator of forest, Sangli, said, “We have surveyed 12 ghats along the Krishna where crocodiles are found. Forest guards have been deployed 24x7 so that villagers who come to wash clothes or cattle are alerted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/riverside-dwellers-put-on-alert-as-crocodile-breeding-season-is-on/articleshow/83041556.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Sena mouthpiece Saamna said that the mistake BJP made in Bengal — of conducting elections amid the Covid crisis — it is now repeating in UP. It added that bodies floating in the Ganga are pushing the image of BJP and its prominent leaders towards political defeat in UP. Sena said that after the failure of ‘mission Bengal’ PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and UP CM Yogi Adityanath held a meeting and focused on winning Uttar Pradesh polls. “Though elections are important in a democracy, is the current atmosphere proper to hold polls? It seems the only thing left is to announce polls, hold huge rallies and win polls,” stated the daily.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Antibiotics misuse at home may have long-term effects’||MUMBAI: Covid-19 mortality across the world is 10%. The sub-group of patients with Covid-19 plus a bacterial or fungal infection, that was part of a study conducted by ICMR, had 56.7% deaths. The study also highlighted that many patients needed potent antibiotics as they had superbugs that couldn’t be treated with usual antibiotics. Half of the Covid patients with bacterial infection (52.36%) were given “watch category” antibiotics as per the World Health Organisation; these are meant to be judiciously used for specific types of infections. A fifth of these patients were given antibiotics categorized as “last resort” or reserve category. Drug-resistant variants of Klebsiella pneumonia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa were among the most common bacterial infections. Many experts (not connected to the study) believe overuse of antibiotics and anti-fungals could have contributed to a surge in rare infections such as black fungal or mucormycosis. “The body has an inherent flora, that is good bacteria that plays a protective role. But when antibiotics are given without a reason, these good bacteria too get wiped out, allowing opportunistic infections to attack,” said intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force on Covid-19. Dr Khusrav Bajan from Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said studies conducted during the first Covid-19 wave had shown that while 17% of Covid patients had secondary infections, 73% were given antibiotics. “In the second wave, we are seeing youngsters who come to us after taking 2-3 antibiotics during the first phase of treatment at home. By the time they come to us, they need higher antibiotics,” said Dr Bajan, also a task force member. In patients with long Covid who end up staying longer in hospitals, antibiotics are prescribed to ward off any hospital-acquired infection. “The longer a patient stays in hospital, higher is the chance of him/her requiring ICU or ventilator. Antibiotics are needed for such a Covid patient, but what is worrying is excess antibiotics that could cause ‘pressure’ on the pathogens who will end up becoming drug-resistant,” said Dr Walia. The pattern of antibiotic use at home by Covid patients too could have long-term repercussions; after the rampant use of azithromycin, it remains to be seen if it will be effective against typhoid in the future, said Dr Walia. Her study found that during the first wave, 10% of the patients were given anti-fungals though they didn’t need it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-antibiotics-misuse-at-home-may-have-long-term-effects/articleshow/83018864.cms||Malathy Iyer

St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, and Barrackpore will hold an online debate on the fate of board exams on Saturday that will be attended by principals in Kolkata and other cities. Most claimed they did not have a specific answer to the problem of holding an exam in the pandemic, but they agreed a final call had to be taken soon to allay students’ anxiety. Among the principals who will join the debate is La Martiniere for Girls principal Rupkatha Sarkar, Loreto House principal Aruna Gomes and St Augustine Day School, Shyamnagar, principal Rodney Borneo. Ruchi Seth of Lotus Valley Noida, Sunita George, principal of Bombay Scottish School, and Edwin Christopher, principal of Bishop Cotton School, Bangalore, will also be present. “An exam is necessary, but we do not know how to make it possible amid the pandemic. We need to inform foreign universities about the situation here...,” said Sarkar. South City International principal John Bagul said, “A solution for ISC students is not easy to find as we are launching them for higher education.” Janet Gasper Chowdhury, president of St Augustine Education Society, felt open online platforms would help generate public opinion and aid the council to take a call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-debate-on-fate-of-isc-cbse-exams/articleshow/83027253.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Allahabad||Vaccine hesitancy in elderlyvillagers baffles health officials||Prayagraj: Officials of the district health department are finding it difficult to mobilize elderly rural folks to take vaccination against Covid-19 even after engaging ground-level health workers, including ASHA, ANM and ASHA Sangini, to conduct door-to-door contact drives for promoting vaccination and clearing reservations regarding vaccination. At Bagi village in Mauaima block, when a three-member team of health workers approached the villagers appealing them to get vaccination against Covid-19, the villagers asked ASHA and aganwadi workers to leave their doorsteps and they are not interested in vaccination. Several ASHA and aganwadi workers told TOI that many villagers are not ready to listen to them. “A section of villagers flatly refuse to get vaccinated without citing any valid reason. However, we have been making sincere efforts to play down their reservations and make them see reason.” Ironically, those who are not interested in vaccination often term vaccination as ‘jahar ki sui’ ( poison needle), said a health worker. Suman, an aganwadi worker, told TOI: “Villagers, mainly elderly, argue with us regarding vaccination and ask to leave their doorstep. Whenever we appeal to them to get vaccination, they threaten us not to come again for vaccination.” “There is a common myth among villagers that ‘injection lagne se maut ho jati hai’ (injection will lead to death),” said another ASHA worker, adding, “The villagers argue that our village is safe and you needn’t visit us again.” “At a time when urban vaccination centres are witnessing huge rush of people, ground-level health workers are finding it difficult to motivate a section of villagers,” said a senior health official pointing out that “youngsters in villages are quite enthusiastic and earnest about getting vaccinated. They show no vaccine hesitancy and also encourage others to get vaccinated. But aged men and women are reluctant towards vaccination”. Officials, however, claimed that 14 vaccination sites in urban areas and 21 in rural pockets have registered over 80% vaccination till now. The number of recipients who got the first dose of vaccine was much higher in villages than those who received the second dose. As many as 5,25,169 Covid vaccine shots have been administered to beneficiaries of all age groups in the district till May 26. While 4,21,188 beneficiaries have taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,04,380 recipients have received the second dose as well. Additional chief medical officer and district immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “Health teams are interacting with people in villages and are encouraging them for getting vaccinated at the community health centres in the district, so that a maximum number of beneficiaries can be covered in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets.” He added, “The department is identifying big market areas in trans- Ganga and trans-Yamuna areas to hold special vaccination camps from June 1 with an objective to cover the maximum number of people. Joint teams of health and revenue departments are conducting door-to-door contact drives to promote vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vaccine-hesitancy-in-elderlyvillagers-baffles-health-officials/articleshow/83017875.cms||---

BJP MLA from Coimbatore South segment Vanathi Srinivasan accompanied them.Noting that Coimbatore is reporting the highest number of Covid cases in the state, Velumani said there is a dire need to step up efforts to control the virus spread. “There is a mismatch in the data on bed availability provided to the media and reality. Though the bulletin released to media shows that there are beds available in hospitals, relatives of patients have to run from pillar to post to get beds. When patients contact the Covid control room, they are told that beds are not available. Public should be informed about actual bed availability. There should be efforts to set up and equip more beds with O2 support,” the petition said.The MLAs said there is acute shortage of vaccines in the district and people have to wait for days to get vaccinated. “People above 45 years are struggling to get vaccinated and those scheduled for second dose are made to wait for a long time,” Velumani said.“Ensure that Coimbatore gets adequate vaccines which can be distributed to all government hospitals, private hospitals and primary health centres to make them easily available to public,” the petition said.The MLAs also urged the government to create awareness and control the spread of mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mlas-urge-collector-to-boost-covid-measures/articleshow/83018856.cms||---

It has been over 9 months now for Barathi at Foodiee – a Trichy-based food delivery platform. “I am paid far lesser than what I was getting in my prev ious job as I was drawing close to a lakh per month while working on ships. However, I had to return because of Covid-19. I was assuming that things would be fine this year, but we were struck with the second wave,” he said.S Mathan Kumar, 30, who was getting Rs 50,000 per month in an IT company in Trichy, lost his job a few months back. While he is paid lesser at Foodiee, Mathan said that the job appears to be stable as it is one among a few sectors that are still benefitting amid the pandemic.R Sinduja, 30, founder of the Foodiee said the food delivery platforms were operated with half of their usual strength last year due to restrictions. However, in the second wave, food delivery executives are considered almost equal to frontline workers and are allowed to operate.But those delivering food under these food delivery platforms do not come under a regulated system of employment. They are hired as off role employees, who can be hired and fired at any time if their service is unsatisfactory.No doubt that it offers instant employment but at the same time, it may not suit all those who are forced to leave jobs with lucrative salaries, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-food-delivery-platforms-offer-jobs-to-people-in-need/articleshow/83018860.cms||---

They said the second wave of Covid-19 had also affected them.They said the extension of moratorium period would prevent 80% of MSMEs from becoming non-performing assets (NPA). V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said, “We have demanded the Centre to waive interest on all loans, including cash credit facilities, for another one year (till March 31,2022). Banks also must relax NPA norms and extend it till March 2022.”The industrial associations have also demanded an additional 20% loan under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme based on their working capital or cash credit limits from the banks and non-banking financial institutions with a repayment period of five years and two years lock-in period to tide over the economic crisis.“The existing upper limit of Rs25 crore for loan restructuring needs to be enhanced to Rs100 crore. We want the Covid stimulus package for the MSMEs to be expedited,” the letter read.They also demanded releasing of outstanding payments from PSUs and other government sectors, revising down the GST to two slabs of 10% and 15%, releasing of pending GST and IT refunds to industries, and nil GST for another two years for manufacturing oxygen generators, concentrators, pulse oximeter, PPE kit, mask, face shield, gloves and all other pandemic related equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/extend-loan-moratorium-by-one-more-year-industries/articleshow/83018894.cms||---

The MLA office located near Manachanallur government boys’ higher secondary school saw many visitors without masks. Social distancing could not be followed as the crowd kept swelling with the arrival of Nehru, who was given a rousing welcome by a team of drummers.DMK candidate S Kathiravan won with a margin of about 60,000 votes in the recently held state assembly election. An educationist, Kathiravan is the son of A Srinivasan, founder of Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan group of institutions. They also run a medical college hospital in Perambalur.Speaking to TOI, Kathiravan said Wednesday being a full moon day, which is considered auspicious, he wanted to inaugurate the office on that very day.Asked if he could have postponed the inauguration considering the ongoing lockdown, he said there was no other auspicious day in the next two weeks and he was not in favour of postponing the inauguration.“I don’t reside in Manachanallur because of which people could not meet me. I wanted to have a point of contact in the constituency soon, especially during the lockdown when people may have multiple needs to be addressed,” he said.Kathiravan said he had invited very limited people for the inauguration considering the lockdown.

Though 2,930 people were discharged on the day, the number of active cases increased to 37,488 cases.With 1,17,197 people cured of the virus, the district’s recovery rate stood at 75.2%.The district also recorded 32 deaths due to the virus taking the toll to 1,135. Two of them were in their 30s—a 32-year-old man who died three days after hospitalization and a 35-year-old diabetic man who died five days after hospitalization in Salem.Despite it being almost six days since 90% of the industries were closed and four days since a complete lockdown was ordered, even health department and revenue department officials are puzzled at the zooming figures.They say they had expected cases to plateau at around 3,600-odd but it is zooming close to 5,000 cases.“We are also trying to figure out how we managed to bring down the numbers during the first wave and what we are doing differently now. We are analyzing the source of cases and coming up with ways to bring it down,” a health department official said.In a clear sign that the spike is centred around rural areas, the Coimbatore Corporation registered only 1,869 fresh cases on Thursday, accounting for 39.4% of the total cases. Among the 1,869 cases, the south zone accounted for the most number of cases at 458, which is 24.5% of the total cases.The south zone consists of cases from Kuniamuthur, Ukkadam, Podanur etc., which are densely populated and are bordering Madukkarai which is an industrial area.Meanwhile, one more Oxygen Express offloaded six more tankers of oxygen—which accounts for around 89.28 tonnes, at Madukkarai on Thursday, which is the 25th loaded express for the state.This is the third express assigned to Coimbatore and is up to the district administration to distribute it.Meanwhile, the Coimbatore Corporation is planning to go door-to-door and check people for flu-like symptoms or respiratory distress, which is what Chennai Corporation did last year during their first wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-continues-to-record-highest-caseload-in-state/articleshow/83018893.cms||---

It also asked for those responsible to be identified and criminal proceedings initiated against them. More than 100 people lost their lives due to the “negligent behaviour of the state administration”, which did not make adequate arrangements to tackle the problems related to inadequate supply of oxygen to patients until the high court intervened, the association submitted to the high court. “…valuable lives could have been saved had the state administration not acted in a negligent manner and installed adequate infrastructure in the hospitals for supply of oxygen and other related facilities in a timely manner,” it added. The objective of the inquiry would be to identify victims who lost their lives in various hospitals in Goa due to inadequate supply of oxygen and compensation payable to their kin, the association stated.The association has also asked for an inquiry into the inadequate supply of oxygen and for identification of the people responsible for the problem. “…till date, the state government has not formulated any policy to identify the victims who lost their lives due to inadequate supply of oxygen in various hospitals in Goa nor has the state government taken any measures for compensation of such victims,” it stated. “…the government officials concerned or the person whose negligent behaviour led to loss of valuable lives due to inadequate supply of oxygen have to be necessarily identified and this court should direct appropriate civil and criminal proceedings against such erring government officials or persons,” the association stated. There was a huge supply crunch of oxygen for medical use being faced in the hospitals in Goa, particularly at the Goa Medical College, which has resulted in many deaths during March-May 2021, the association submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/probe-deaths-due-to-o2-shortage-lawyers-assn/articleshow/83019361.cms||---

The process of taking high resolution pictures of the six sets of palm leaf manuscripts kept for public view at the museum started on Wednesday. Each set is under a head, namely, Sundarakandam, Bhagavatham, Sri Bhagavatam, Periyazhwar thirumozhi vyakyanam and Thula Kaveri. Sundarakandam is a section in Ramayana which speaks about lord Ram and his life. Bhagavatham narrates the 10 incarnation of lord Vishnu, Periyazhwar thirumozhi vyakyanam is one of the Vaishnava religious canon and Thula Kaveri speaks about the auspicious time to take bath in the Cauvery river. The officials said that the manuscripts will be digitised and the printout of the manuscripts will help researchers go through the content without damaging the original document. Speaking to TOI, temple executive officer and joint commissioner S Marimuthu said that the palm leaf manuscript in the museum have become old and may get damage if taken for reading. “The properties of the temple were documented last year, and it was uploaded on the website. While there is a general instruction from HR&CE to digitise the temple properties, we started the process of digitising the palm script manuscript,” he said. He said the process is expected to take time as the manuscripts are delicate. “We want to ensure that the manuscripts are not damaged while taking pictures as it would also damage the content on it.”R Kalaikkovan, director of Dr M Rajamanikkanar Centre for Historical Research, said that the manuscripts are around 200-300 years old, which is the life span of any palm leaf manuscript. “However, the content could be older than the manuscript. People rewrote the content on fresh palm leaves during those days as palm leaf manuscript tend to get damaged over time. Valuable information could be transferred to the next generation through such practises.

Several schools are said to be asking parents to pay first term fees or fees for April and May before the schools reopen. “My child’s school has been asking to clear April month fee and books fee before the school reopen,” said Krishna V, whose ward is studying in Class VI at a private school in the city. Another parent, Suhasini M, whose children are in Class 6 and Class 8, said she had to pay the first term fee before the schools reopen. “I had to pay about Rs 70,000 for both my kids. The school should give monthly payment option this year as well,” she said. Many even took to Twitter to raise the issue. “In this time when many people are struggling to meet their needs, schools in Hyderabad are increasing fee by 15%. Can your government provide some guidelines to private schools on fee increase and cap it? That will be great help during this tough time,” tweeted Rohit Jain with handle @rohitjain_85. Another user, Satya A, with the handle @SatyaA33405182 tweeted: “Sir, the entire nation is suffering with Covid, but private schools in Hyderabad are not supportive. Fees hike is in spite of online classes, and payment of 50% fee before school opens, if not pay late fee. Telangana state government helped last year in this matter. Please take some action this year as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-collecting-increased-fee-despite-requests-parents/articleshow/83018911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After getting the additional charge of vice-chancellor of the SSU, Lucknow University VC Prof Alok Kumar Rai has started efforts to provide advanced IT facilities at the SSU. “A decision has been taken to enable SSU students to avail the facilities of technological advantages being utilised in other universities,” Prof Rai said while talking to TOI on Thursday. Prof Rai added, “We are planning to introduce a strategic learning application for transformative education (SLATE), a registered and copyright property of LU to make administrative and academic activities of institution students centric by utilising IT advancements. It can be introduced through a memorandum of understanding signed between LU and SSU. This MoU will help in avoiding financial burdens on SSU, in developing SLATE like platforms.” It will bring major changes on both-academic and administrative front, he said. “The IT enabled system will make all the administrative process, from submitting forms for entrance exam and admission, deposition of fee, applications for degree and other documents, online. “It will make the entire administrative system transparent by ending manual contacts generally instrumental in false practices like fake admission, fake degrees and others,” he explained. “The university has around 4,500 students on the main campus while over 40,000 others study at affiliated colleges across the country,” he said adding, “All these students will be benefited by the online system. The same platform will also be used for online classes and studies while social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and others will also be utilised for communication between the university, academicians and students.” Box: Fresh registrations for PhDs in SSU soon Fresh registrations will soon begin in the PhD in courses run by the SSU. New SSU VC Prof Alok Kumar Rai said that after assuming charge, he came to know that no new registration in PhD courses of any subject had taken place in this university after 2017. “Taking note of the issue, I have sought details of the vacant seats on which new aspirants can be registered for research studies. Once the details are received, the process for fresh registration will be started,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ssu-to-embrace-it-tools-start-online-facilities-for-students/articleshow/83017696.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

While tenders were floated for the around Rs 86 crore project in April and the plants were supposed to have been constructed in a month, the BMC is yet to finalise a company for the job and work is yet to begin. The BJP had alleged that a firm blacklisted in November last year by Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Medical College was in the race to bag a BMC contract for setting up oxygen plants at 16 locations. The BJP also alleged BMC had inflated the estimated cost to around Rs 86 crore when actual cost was Rs 25-30 crore. Times ViewThe BMC must clarify on all allegations that tainted and blacklisted firms have been in the fray for this important contract. It also needs to ensure work is awarded to competent and clean firms in a transparent manner. Already there has been delay in implemenation of the project; now the BMC has to see to it that it is completed swiftly.The BJP alleged the firm had tied up with a local company, which was penalised in the penguin scam, and it had participated in the tender by giving a dealership to this local company. Interestingly, the BMC has picked the same firm against whom BJP had made allegations of being tainted and rigging the tenders. “More than a month has passed since tenders were floated. All but one participating company have been disqualified. Now there is no emergency need for oxygen in Mumbai, so BMC can re-invite the tenders and get good, competent and clean companies for the work. We had already warned the BMC about this, but they ignored our warning and allowed this kind of brazen entry of blacklisted firms in the BMC,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. Mishra said he had written to additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu asking him to disqualify the blacklisted firm. Velrasu said, “The tender is finalised. The draft letter to the standing committee is being put up. It is again confirmed from the agency under an affidavit that it was not blacklisted. The one-month period will start once we give the work order to the agency. BMC also has to hand over the working space to the agency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-work-on-oxygen-plants-bmc-had-promised-in-a-month-yet-to-begin/articleshow/83018928.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Dr Hedgewar Rugnalaya Hospital has procured around 5,000 vaccine doses upon request from a few corporate houses for the necessary immunization. Dr Anant Pandhare, one of the hospital board members, on Thursday said Covishield doses have been arranged for the industrial workforce. “The vaccination will be carried out onsite as per availability of space at the industrial units. We have placed a demand of around 12,000 Covishield doses, of which, we have received 5,000,” he said. Pandhare said the permission from the civic authorities was obtained before going ahead with the vaccination for industrial workers. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, the immunization officer of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said a few more private hospitals were expected to start the vaccination drive for the local industries. “Since it is onsite vaccination for identified target groups, the hospitals concerned will not reflect on the CoWIN portal. However, the data of the beneficiaries will be fed into the portal,” she said. Meanwhile, one more private hospital in Aurangabad has started vaccination for the public at large by procuring vaccine doses on its own, taking total number of such hospitals to two in the city by Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/special-vax-drive-for-industrial-workforce-in-aurangabad/articleshow/83012560.cms||---

According to police officers, forensic examination has revealed traces of blood on the floor tiles of the school toilet where the alleged abuse had taken place, which lends credence to the charges of sexual abuse. “The forensic evidence points to presence of blood in the tiles of the toilet. We will be filing a report in the court soon,” a police officer said. K Padmarajan, a school teacher and local BJP leader, is the accused in the case. According to the statement of the minor girl, the teacher had sexually abused her inside the school toilet. The case was initially probed by the Panur police who had arrested Padmarajan. Later, the case was handed over to the crime branch, which submitted a chargesheet against the accused under the Juvenile Justice Act and sections of the IPC but did not invoke sections under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The probe team had then stated that the investigation into the Pocso case would continue. The accused was later granted bail by the court. The family of the child had approached the high court saying that that they suspected political interference in the case and that they would not get justice if the probe was carried out by the team and sought its reconstitution. Acting on the plea, the high court had in October 2020 issued orders for reconstituting the SIT team and a new team led by additional director general of police (ADGP) E J Jayaraj was constituted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-gets-evidence-pointing-to-sexual-abuse-of-minor/articleshow/83016864.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Colleges forcing to pay dues: Students||Hyderabad: Ahead of the final year examinations, several students from colleges affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH), have alleged that college managements are arm-twisting them to collect dues. In a Twitter storm, many have reached out to the authorities about colleges charging excess amounts in the name of exam fee, project, and placement fee. Students rue that colleges are charging as high as Rs 10,000 towards project fee. This, even as the JNTUH board does not prescribe collection of any such fee. “Sir @KTRTRS, @KTRoffice JNTUH board declares that there is no fee for project. But our college management is demanding Rs 10,000 for project fee. Management not following the board orders,” tweeted Sunny. Many others rue that colleges are asking them to pay the fee in the offline mode amid a lockdown. Students also allege that college managements are asking them to render fees for placement training. “Our college is asking Rs 8,000 for placement training, which was conducted from January 15 to March 15. Those two months training was not at all worth more than Rs 3,000. I have no idea why colleges are pushing so hard for unnecessary fees at this stage. This is entirely outrageous,” tweeted Roshan Singh. Sources representing the college managements said several students had not cleared their dues. “We also have to pay salaries to the teachers and maintain the infrastructure. If students don’t pay the fees on time, how do we run the college,” questioned correspondent of a private college in Ghatkesar. The JNTUH authorities said that so far they have not got any written complaint from the students and if they do, necessary action will be initiated against the colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/colleges-forcing-to-pay-dues-students/articleshow/83018885.cms||---

On Thursday, 3,746 people in the 18-44 category took the vaccine in Trichy city, accounting for 75-79% vaccinated in the city. In Madurai, 12,904 people got the vaccine on Thursday, against just 2,872 in the 45+ category.“Most of the youngsters only want to take Covishield, as there are travel restrictions for Covaxin,” said a doctor, while the older category were preferring Covaxin, saying they had heard that it has lesser side effects.While there still remains hesitancy by the 45+ age category, youngsters are turning up at the vaccination camps in large numbers, making vaccine wastage almost nil. The leftover vaccines at the camps are being used to vaccinate street vendors and milk delivery persons on the streets.K Senthil, 20, a college student, who got his first dose at the local PHC in Mastanpatti in Madurai, said he had tried going on Tuesday and Wednesday but it was crowded. “I went very early today (Thursday) and got my first dose of Covisheild.” Like him, many of his friends have been going together to get the shots simultaneously.The demand for vaccines from the young age group was such that Ponmalai zonal corporation office administered more than 200 doses within a few hours of the drive while Srirangam zonal corporation office saw the serpentine queue of 100m. The 18+ age group were vaccinated only in the special camps organised at six locations in the city, while the camps exclusively for 45+ were held at MGM governemnt hospital, Srirangam GH and UPHCs of Trichy corporation.Trichy district had received 51,200 vaccines from the state government of which close to 30,000 were handed over to Trichy Corporation. “The patronage from youths for the camp was overwhelming. The vaccine wastage is almost nil,” said city health officer M Yazhini. Since there was a huge demand from the youngsters in the vaccination camps, the health officials are exhausting their daily allocation of vaccines even before the deadline. Even if there are leftovers, officials said that they are utilising it for vaccinating street vendors near the vaccination camp. “To avoid wastage, we are vaccinating the milkman and street vendors who were not vaccinated so far as they are potential spreaders,” said Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, a doctor in charge of the vaccination camp. The city corporation has planned to continue the drive for the young age group as long as they have stock.At the camp inaugurated at the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry by the Minister for Commercial Taxes and registration P Moorthy, 1,068 people were vaccinated in the 18+ group. The chamber is aiming to vaccinate as many workers in this age category and also their family members so that the lockdown could be eased at the earliest.

---||Goa||Stung by criticism, Goa govt eyes PR exercise||MARGAO: The state government has embarked on a damage control exercise after it has been criticised for its handling of the pandemic. As per the directions of chief minister Pramod Sawant, the department of information and publicity has organised a workshop exclusively for public relation officers (PROs) of the government departments and corporations and for officers of special duty (OSDs) to cabinet ministers on June 1 to train them in countering the adverse publicity. “The workshop is aimed at enlightening the PROs/OSDs about their role and responsibilities and to act forthwith on the critical reports appearing in the mainstream media and to counter the adverse publicity against the government by disseminating factual info to the print/electronic media and social media platforms on day-to-day basis,” reads the circular issued by director of information and publicity Dipak Bandekar. The state government has been on the receiving end of severe criticism from various quarters. The high court of Bombay at Goa has also criticised the government over what is perceived to be its imprudent management of the pandemic leading to deaths of number of patients in hospitals largely owing to non-availability of oxygen beds and ventilators, besides fluctuations in oxygen supply at Goa Medical College. Significantly, the government had also come under criticism from the state core committee of the BJP recently with the members expressing their displeasure over the way the government handled the pandemic. With state assembly elections hardly a few months away, sources said BJP is obviously concerned over the beating the image of the party and that of the chief minister has taken over the issue. Following persistent demands from the Opposition, the state government recently formed a 15-member special task force under the chairmanship of the chief minister to prepare for the third Covid wave, comprising both private and government doctors. Besides the task force, an expert committee headed by GMC dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar has been formed to review the second and third waves and accordingly advise the state government. After the high court came down heavily on the state government, it hurriedly commissioned the super-speciality block of the GMC and transformed into a Covid hospital, thereby reducing to some extent the burden on the existing infrastructure of the GMC. “We do not want to read any report in the newspaper that yesterday these many people died due to lack of oxygen. Let’s focus on tonight and ensure that no one should die. If any Covid-19 positive patient dies due to lack of oxygen, then it is an infringement of the right to live under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. It is the duty and the responsibility of every state to protect the lives of the citizens,” the high court, hearing a raft of PILs on Covid mismanagement, had said on May 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stung-by-criticism-govt-eyes-pr-exercise/articleshow/83019012.cms||---
---||Allahabad||6 new electric crematoriums to comeup in Prayagraj, one in Shringverpur||Prayagraj: In a bid to discourage burial of human bodies on the banks of river Ganga, the Prayagraj district administration will set up seven new electric crematoriums in the district. Of these, six would be within the municipal limits while the seventh would come up at Shringverpur, for which the district administration has already identified 4 biswa land. Presently, Prayagraj city has just two electric crematoriums — one each at Daraganj and Shankarghat (Teliyarganj). The proposal for constructing an electric crematorium at Shringverpur bears significance as the banks of river Ganga at this religious site hogged the limelight recently for having a number of burial sites. The district administration had claimed that this had been the practice amongst locals living in the vicinity of the area. However, considering the fact the practice goes against the norms laid down under National Green Tribunal (NGT), the district administration has decided to make the locals aware of the ill-effects of the practice in terms of pollution and NGT guidelines and provide them with a viable alternative in shape of electric crematorium, district officials said. For this, the revenue department team has identified 4 biswa land (around 500 square meters). A proposal is being prepared by the local administration and the same would be sent to the district magistrate on behalf of the Panchayati Raj department. The papers are being prepared through SDM Soraon Anil Chaturvedi. “We are preparing the proposal for constructing an electric crematorium at Shringverpur and the same would be submitted to the higher-ups in a couple of days. Once the approval is granted, we would move forward with the construction work,” said district panchayati raj officer (DPRO), Renu Srivastava. The idea of having an electric crematorium at Shringverpur is not new. Earlier, the national Ramayana mela organising committee and the local people too had raised a similar demand. Following this, MLA from Phaphamau Vikramajit Maurya had written a letter to the state government. Moreover, six more electric crematoriums would come up in Sangam city. The Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) had held a virtual meeting last week wherein it was decided that four electric crematoriums would be constructed within the city limits. Later, a proposal for having two additional crematoriums, one at Phaphamau and another at Chatnag (Jhunsi), was also included and thus the total number of new electric crematoriums within the city limits increased to six. For the electric crematorium to be constructed at Chatnag, the PMC officials have identified a piece of land and the formalities are being chalked out with the help of respective lekhpals of the area. PMC is also looking for a piece of land near Kanhaipur cremation ghat. Earlier, PMC proposed for crematoriums at Kanaipur, Kerala Bagh area, Arail at Naini and Mahewa. PMC’s public relation officer and chief tax officer, PK Mishra, said, “PMC is working on the issue of having six additional electric crematoriums within the municipal limits and the land for the one at Chatnag has been almost finalised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/6-new-electric-crematoriums-to-comeup-in-prayagraj-one-in-shringverpur/articleshow/83017904.cms||---

Citing lack of disabled-friendly amenities at the camp locations and the need to rely on family or friends to visit the camps, PwDs have sought doorstep vaccination for them as well as caretakers.About 24,000 of the over 64,000 PwDs in the district are in the 18-44 age group, eligible for vaccination against Covid-19. Of these, close to 10% resides in Trichy city. Though they can get vaccinated at any ongoing camp, not many have been turning up. They say most of their caretakers are their parents, who as senior citizens are vulnerable to Covid and can’t venture out. Also, since they are immunocompromised, PwDs express fears over the ambience and lack of ramps at the centres. “Being a quadriplegic, I cannot walk and my parents are too old to help me go out. I will be going abroad for treatments for which vaccination is mandatory, but doorstep vaccination must be initiated for PwDs,” S Krithika, a resident of Officers Colony said.Localities like Palakkarai and Nagamangalam have a significant PwD population. “An exclusive vaccination camp with transport support can ensure all of us are vaccinated. Since our caretakers are with us always, doorstep vaccination must cover our caretakers too,” P Maarikannan, secretary of district differently-abled welfare association, said. “We are vaccinating the PwDs at government recognised homes now. Enumeration and doorstep vaccination will be carried out through the public health department at the earliest to cover all eligible PwDs,” R Ravichandran, district differently-abled welfare officer, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/disabled-people-seek-doorstep-jab-as-vax-camps-not-friendly/articleshow/83018937.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Trichy||Veggie sellers not entering residential streets in Trichy||TRICHY: Three days after the district administration and Trichy Corporation launched the sales of vegetables and fruits through mini-load vehicles and push carts, many residential localities complained that the vehicles are not reaching residential streets. The vendors, despite having passes for selling vegetables during the lockdown, are stationing their vehicles on arterial roads, which eventually attracts crowd. From launching 672 vehicles on Monday, the corporation gradually increased the vehicles to 1,555. As of Thursday, the civic body has given permission for 2,196 vehicles to sell vegetables and fruits in the 65 wards here. Despite increasing number of vehicles, people in Big Bazaar street falling under Srirangam zone and Karumandapam falling under K Abishekapuram zone have complained of not spotting the vegetable vehicles for mobile sales in their areas. It was found that the vehicles were stationed at the arterial roads, attracting crowds, which defeats the purpose of lockdown. The pushcart sellers in Palakkarai stationed their vehicles on Eda Street with people visiting them to purchase vegetables.  “It is better if the corporation directly sells the vegetables or appoints one of the staff in a few vehicles to cover all streets. We have not seen any vegetable sellers in our locality,” K P Rangaprasad, a resident of Big Bazaar street, said. Vegetable vendors upon being questioned blamed the restrictions from city police for not covering all parts. “It is difficult to monitor them. We have been permitting more vehicles for sales, we will streamline the complaints,” a senior official with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/veggie-sellers-not-entering-residential-streets-in-trichy/articleshow/83018968.cms||---

They may be bona fide but not realising there are legal repercussions. What is said by those persons (actor Sonu Sood and Siddique in their replies) is not correct,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges were told about the shortage of amphotericin-B injection for mucormycosis. The AG said as on May 26, there were 3,200 patients, adding the shortage is due to few manufacturers. “We need 14,000 vials per day. We are getting 4,000-5,000 per day (from the Centre),’’ he said. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC said there are 335 black fungus cases in Mumbai. “It is an important issue to be dealt with...Now it is coming to Bombay,” said Justice Sayed. When informed the Centre’s oxygen allocation is adequate, the judges said the state can issue an ordinance or an executive order to allow private hospitals to set up oxygen plants. “There is a possibility of a third wave. There has to be a plan in place if it does. We have to learn from our mistakes,” said Justice Kulkarni. Sakhare said there are 12,052 paediatric Covid cases with only 2 hospitalisations and 17 deaths on Tuesday’s dashboard. “So they (cases) have increased,” said Justice Kulkarni. The court recalled on May 12, it was told there were 11,423 cases. Sakhare said the BMC is increasing facilities at three jumbo centres for paediatric patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/illegal-med-supply-defeats-sc-bombay-hc-govt-orders-on-distribution/articleshow/83019085.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Super-spreader Khammam wedding leaves 4 dead, 100 positive||HYDERABAD: A marriage ceremony in tribal village of Muthyalagudem in Khammam district on May 14 turned out as a Covid-19 superspreader. Four persons, including bridegroom’s father, have died and nearly 100 people have been infected with the virus. Two persons succumbed to the virus on Wednesday. With no villager, including the family members, willing to come forward to perform the last rites, the local gram panchayat in Karepalli mandal stepped in to conduct the last rites of the bridegroom’s father. Those who tested positive are in home isolation. According to health officials, over 250 people attended the wedding in the village. In the tests conducted, as many as 100 people have tested positive for Covid-19 and they all have attended the marriage function. While Covid-19 measures were reportedly taken at the May 14 event, they were not strictly adhered to by the guests as several of them reportedly did not wear masks. For the families of the couple, relatives and friends who attended the wedding, everything seemed fine for a week. One of the persons, who attended the wedding, developed Covid-19 symptoms and his report came positive on May 20. Some more individuals also tested positive in the next few days after coming back from the wedding. The health officials have taken measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the village and advised the people not to venture out of their houses. The officials are also in the process of testing and contact tracing. It may be recalled a wedding ceremony in Hanmajipet village in Nizamabad district in April was a superspreader event after 87 guests tested positive for Covid-19. Elsewhere in Khammam district, two more persons have succumbed to the virus. In Pothireddygudem village of Gundala mandal, a 50-yearold man died. In Vepakuntla village in Raghunathapalem village, a woman who was sent home from the hospital after recovering from Covid-19 developed breathing problems.

---||Goa||Tarun Tejpal case: HC tells trial court to redact details identifying survivor||PANAJI: Upholding the privacy of the survivor, the vacation bench of the high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday directed the trial court to “redact” references in its judgment that reveal the identity of the prosecutrix (survivor) in the alleged rape case against former Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal. The state government has filed an appeal in the high court against the acquittal of the accused by the trial court. The case has been adjourned to June 2. During the hearing, solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the state, strongly objected to references in the trial court order that would lead to disclosure of the survivor’s identity like her email id, her husband and mother. Referring to the court judgment, Mehta said, “Now as per this judgment, any person who is a victim of sexual assault has to exhibit her trauma and unless she exhibits her trauma her testimony cannot be believed.” Additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi in her order had said: “Evidence of witnesses and printouts of photographs clearly prove that the prosecutrix was absolutely in a good mood, happy, normal, smiling, and did not look distressed or traumatised in any manner whatsoever, though this was immediately a few minutes after she claims to have been sexually assaulted again by the accused.” The trial court had delivered its verdict on May 21 and a copy of the judgment was made available on May 25, but it has not yet been uploaded on the court website. High court judge S C Gupte noted that it appears from the impugned judgment of the sessions judge that it contains a reference to the victim’s husband and also her email ID, a reference to the Gmail account of the victim and a reference to the name of the mother of the prosecutrix . “In the interest of protecting the identity of the victim of an offence, such as the one with which we are concerned in the present case, it is appropriate to have the above references to be found in the impugned judgment redacted. The trial court is accordingly directed to redact the above references, as also other similar references, wherever found in the order, whilst uploading the impugned judgment,” Gupte said. Earlier, when Mehta was arguing on the appeal filed by the government, the high court judge asked why it should not come up before the regular court after reopening. “Normally, I would have bowed down. But the way in which the offence has happened and the way in which it is dealt with by the (trial) judge... because in such matters the system expects sensitivity apart from legal jurisprudence, both of which are lacking in this judgment, and the matter should be taken up at the earliest,” Mehta said. He said that he would file amended grounds of appeal within the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpal-case-hc-tells-trial-court-to-redact-details-identifying-survivor/articleshow/83019153.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Delhi||HC says can’t give priority to some on black fungus meds||New Delhi: All of us are “living this hell and facing this problem” but can’t prioritise one’s supply of vials over others, the Delhi high court said on Friday, referring to the shortage of medicine to treat cases of severe black fungus or mucormycosis in patients. “Everyone is living this hell. It’s a situation where we want to help but we are helpless,” the court lamented, while hearing a clutch of petitions by patients making last ditch attempts to procure Amphotericin B vials. “It is a medicine that is in limited supply not just in our country, but across the world. There is a genuine shortage, even in India there is only one supplier. This is a problem that has risen unexpectedly, till a month ago no one knew what black fungus is,” the court remarked, in response to desperate pleas seeking intervention. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh pointed out that amidst whatever resources available, both the Centre and Delhi government is trying its best. “But we can’t order, give vials to person A over person B. We can’t prioritise,” the bench said. The court was examining the issue of shortage of the medicine that was raised earlier by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who said the black fungus cases, affecting Covid patients, are rising. The court, which was informed that steps are being taken by the Centre to procure 2.3 lakh vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from six countries, asked the government to explain the reason behind ordering only 2.3 lakh vials when “today’s requirement of the medicine is much more.” The bench said that time was running out. “If you have placed the order for 2.3 lakh vials on May 24, by when will you get it? Pace needs to be on war footing. We are only expressing our anxiety because of the proportions this disease is assuming every day. The effort here is to save lives and every hour matters,” it said. The Centre clarified that on May 24, the Union health ministry asked the external affairs ministry to reach out to its missions abroad and place the order. Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said as per the information updated on the portal, the number of patients under treatment for Mucormycosis (black fungus) in India are 14,872 on May 28 (9 AM) and including 423 in Delhi. “MEA has also been called upon to procure 50,000 tablets of Isavuconazole. Steps in this regard are being taken by the ministry. Domestic production capacity of Amphotericin B Liposomal injection has progressed as while in April it was 62,000, in May it was 1,40,000 and in June it is expected to be 3,25,114,” the Centre added. In Delhi, the central government has said that 400 vials were allocated on May 24, 300 vials on May 26 and 1,920 vials on May 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-says-cant-give-priority-to-some-on-black-fungus-meds/articleshow/83048263.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Pune||Just 8% of state’s 3.86cr in 45+ gp have got both jabs||Pune: Maharashtra has fully vaccinated only 7.6% of the 3.86 crore people in the 45-plus age category, data compiled till May 26 by the public health department shows. Vaccinations in two categories — over 60 years and over 45 years (with underlying conditions) — began on March 1. The drive to cover all above 45 began on April 1. Numbers show the state has given one vaccine dose to 34% of this population. Vaccine shortages have hampered progress. As of May 26, Maharashtra still has nearly 2.5 crore people in the 45-plus group who are yet to receive a first dose. Also, the state family welfare bureau, in a recent communication to all districts, said Covishield second-dose coverage for healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), which should have been total (100%) by now, is still far from the target. Of the 14.67 lakh registered HCWs, 11.59 lakh (79%) have received the first dose till May 23. Of this, nearly 1.38 lakh Covishield recipients among HCWs and over 23,000 Covaxin recipients were still to get their second doses till May 23. Of the total 17.85 lakh FLWs registered in this category in Maharashtra, 16.49 lakh (92%) have received the first dose. But till May 23, those eligible for the second dose in this group totalled up to nearly 89,000. The bureau has instructed districts to complete second-dose coverage of all healthcare and frontline workers as soon as possible, apart from finishing vaccinations (second doses) of the 45-plus category on priority. This should be followed by diverting remaining doses to improve first-dose coverage among the 45-plus, the advisory said. Experts said vaccine shortages started to show by mid-April, with the government going on to increase the gap between two Covishield shots first by 6-8 weeks and then by 12-16 weeks. These factors slowed the coverage, they said. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “In hierarchical preference, we first need to vaccinate the 60-plus population and then those above 45, apart from focusing on vulnerable groups. Globally, the standard practice during the peak of the pandemic was to finish first-dose coverage in a large population as early as possible. In Maharashtra, by now, first-dosage coverage of the 45-plus group should ideally have been at 70%.” Dr Joshi said the lead vaccine in India, Covishield, will confer at least 76% immunity after the first dose. “It should be followed by a second dose after the interval suggested by the government. For Covaxin, we need to complete both doses — the interval being 4-6 weeks for this shot.” He said a large supply of vaccines may land within the next three-four months, and 70% of the vaccination process in vulnerable districts should be completed in the three months that follow. Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid control, said, “If 60% of its vulnerable population is fully vaccinated by July-end, along with strict checks on potential super-spreading events, Maharashtra should be better equipped to handle a third wave. An ideal situation would have been simultaneous vaccination coverage of at least 80% of people in the 45-plus group, 60% of the 18-44 age group, along with public health measures to best tackle another surge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-8-of-states-3-86cr-in-45-gp-have-got-both-jabs/articleshow/83019124.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Patna||Cops detain seven after woman gang-raped in Bihar||PATNA: Altogether seven people from a Samastipur village were detained early Wednesday for a test identification parade before the police in a gang rape case reported on Tuesday. A 30-year-old woman was found tied to an electricity pole with her clothes torn on the outskirts of Shahpur Parohi village under Bibhutipur police station area by the villagers. The mother of three minor children was admitted to the Samastipur Sadar hospital with swollen eyes, bruises on the neck and face along with scratch marks on her body, which were caused by the assault by two persons who raped her, police said. The seven detained suspects had allegedly reached the woman’s house with tents and crockery for use in her sister-in-law’s marriage on Monday night. Police said out of the seven, two are suspected to have raped the woman. A villager had found her tied to an electricity pole on the outskirts of the village on Tuesday morning in torn clothes after which he covered her with a piece of cloth of his own and raised alarm. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon on Wednesday said even though the victim told the police that the two accused persons could not rape her but an FIR for gang rape has been registered with the women’s police station. “Often, victims in villages don’t tell the police about being raped fearing social stigma. Thus, looking at the overall scenario in the present case, police registered a gang rape case,” he said adding, her medical examination has been conducted and its report is awaited. Dhillon said the victim told police that she was assaulted after she resisted. He said the incident took place around 3 am on Tuesday when the woman had gone outside her house to relieve herself. “Family members admitted her at Dalsinghsarai sub-divisional hospital on Tuesday evening after which doctors informed the police and the matter came to light,” he said. The SP said police are trying to get TIP conducted on court’s order as soon as possible to ascertain the identity of the two accused. Women’s police station SHO Pushplata Kumari said the accused had covered her face, tied her hands and dragged her more than 300 metres to take her to a secluded place. “She has suffered severe injuries from assault and dragging. The clothes used for tying are those used in pandals,” she added.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Notice to 64 private hospitals for inflated Covid bills||HYDERABAD: Telangana health authorities on Thursday served 88 show cause notices to 64 private hospitals for allegedly overcharging Covid-19 patients and set a 48-hour deadline to respond or lose licence to treat coronavirus patients. Health department officials said majority of the hospitals operate out of Hyderabad and Cyberabad. They now stand to lose their licenses as they have multiple complaints against them, mainly of excess billing. “Of the 88 complaints received, 39 are from core Hyderabad city, 22 from Medchal- Malkajgiri, 135 from Ranga Reddy. Majority of the hospitals are in Hyderabad. The one that has the highest number of complaints is a hospital in Kukatpally,” Telangana public health director Dr G Srinivasa Rao said. Most of the complaints received are about excessive billing, vaccination, bed occupancy and drug-related issues. Charge of excess billing was a common complaint with some patients being asked to pay Rs 1.5 lakh bill for an overnight stay in the hospital. Another patient was told to pay Rs 20 lakh for his three-week Covid-19 treatment. The offences are being viewed very seriously as per directions of the task force committee headed by minister KT Rama Rao,” said Dr Srinivasa Rao. In Hyderabad city, hospitals located in Kukatpally, Begumpet, Kachiguda, Abids, LB Nagar, Alwal, Shahpurnagar, Kondapur, KPHB, New Bowenpally and Secunderabad are in the list of offenders. Apart from Hyderabad, complaints were received against hospitals in Medchal-Malkajgiri, Ranga Reddy, Warangal Urban, Mahabubnagar, Nizamabad and Yadadri. “With more discharges happening in the recent past, the number of complaints have gone up. The 88 hospitals have been given 48 hours to respond on the complaints, failing which their licenses for Covid-19 treatment will be cancelled,” added Dr Rao. He said health authorities are looking into the complaints posted on Twitter also. “We urge people to us the WhatsApp number 9154170960 to lodge their complaints by attaching related documents. Our teams will take immediate action,” said the top health official. In 2020, the government slapped notices on three private hospitals and cancelled licence of one of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/notice-to-64-pvt-hosps-for-inflated-covid-bills/articleshow/83021326.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Delhi||In death, 43-year-old saves 5 lives||New Delhi: A 43-year-old woman who died of brain haemorrhage at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital saved the life of a 58-year-old man and four others by donating her organs, including liver, two kidneys and heart, to them. The 58-year-old man, who was admitted at the same hospital, was waiting for a liver transplant for the past two years and had almost lost hope. The woman, only sister among seven brothers, was a hypertensive patient and reached the hospital with complaints of vomiting and severe headache. On May 20, the woman was brought to the emergency room of the hospital where doctors conducted several tests but her condition worsened further. The subsequent tests revealed that she had severe brain haemorrhage and in spite of all efforts of resuscitation, she was declared brain dead. Since she was the only sister, the family members wanted her to live through others and decided to donate her organs. Dr Naimish N Mehta, co-chairman, department of surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital stated that the family members were counselled about donating her organs. “Even in her death, they wanted her to give life to many more individuals with organ failure,” Dr Mehta said. Dr Mehta further said that there was a huge waiting list for cadaver organs, and with Covid-19 pandemic, organ donation rate had reduced remarkably across the country. “Currently, there are 179 patients waiting for cadaver liver and 484 patients waiting for cadaver Kidney transplantation at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.” The woman was declared brain dead on May 21 and later around evening, the process of retrieving the organs began. A team of doctors led by Dr Mehta carried out the surgery, which went on for 12 hours. The 58-year-old patient who received the liver transplant had come to the hospital for some treatment and coincidentally it was his name on the list. The 58-year-old had almost given hope and was on the waitlist for over two years and lost the hope of finding an organ for his survival. Other organs retrieved were two kidneys and heart. A kidney was transplanted at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and remaining organs were sent to other hospitals of Delhi-NCR. Dr DS Rana, chairman of the hospital’s board of management, expressed sincere gratitude towards the family of the deceased for the noble act of organ donation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-death-43-year-old-saves-5-lives/articleshow/83048309.cms||---

---||Pune||Covid positivity rate (11.9%) in Pune district lowest since April 1||PUNE: The district has seen its lowest weekly Covid positivity rate at 11.9% for May 20-26 since the week beginning April 1 when the rate was 31.4%. Health officials on Thursday said Pune’s active cases were 22,115 during the May 20-26 week and the number was expected to decline further. State surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate said, “The cases will come down due to the ongoing lockdown-like restrictions and the containment measures taken by the state. We have increased our contact tracing and surveillance activities not only in Pune but the entire state.” He said, “Testing has increased exponentially. During the first wave of the pandemic, we were conducting around 80,000 tests a day. Currently, we are conducting over 2 lakh tests a day. Increased containment measures have also helped bring down the case positivity rate.” He said, “The decreasing trend is continuing in over 15 districts of the state. There is all likelihood that the cases will plateau further. But this is only a pause button and cannot be continued for a longer period. Whenever transmission dynamics decline, we have to open up in a steady and cautious manner.” In Pune district, the restrictions are more severe than the measures in the state. District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said the stringent containment measures have “definitely helped Pune”. “This can be seen in the steady decrease of the weekly Covid positivity rate over the past 6-8 weeks. The rate has dropped from 31.4% in the first week of April to 11.9% this week. This is the lowest weekly positivity rate in these two months,” he said. Ahead of Friday’s weekly review meeting headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the district health officials have said in their data that the active cases were declining over the last two weeks. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “Though there is a slight rise in the positivity rate in rural areas, stricter measures are being taken.” The state government has favoured more emphasis on institutional care of patients in the rural areas, instead of home isolation, to prevent the spread of the infection within families. “More Covid care centres are being readied in the rural areas,” a health official said. State health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI that the focus should be on institutional isolation in rural areas with a high case positivity rate. The state has allowed districts to spend 25% funds from the grants received under the 15th Finance Commission and also revenue generated by the minor mineral development funds for this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/positivity-rate-11-9-in-dist-lowest-since-april-1/articleshow/83019182.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He said: “On the parameter of collective responsibility, the entire government has failed in public eyes. The state saw 4,000 deaths in four months but some Congressmen are busy in an internal feud." About the solution, he said there must be a legislature party meeting to take the MLAs’ opinions and Sunil Jakhar should call a meeting of the Pradesh Congress Committee to restore the confidence of the party workers and explain to the Punjabis why they couldn’t get any succour during this health emergency." He demanded a white paper on why the government avoided a free and fair investigation into the misappropriation of the Covid fund and where that Rs 1,100 crore it claims to have spent on Covid care has gone." Sekhri was in Chandigarh to raise the demands of the Confederation of Colleges and Schools of Punjab. He said he had been unable to meet the CM to forward him this charter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/come-covid-19-ministers-gone-says-cong-ex-mla/articleshow/83019162.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Cash-for-vote: ED files chargesheet against Telangana MP Revanth Reddy||HYDERABAD: Exactly six years after Rs 50 lakh cash was allegedly offered to a nominated MLA in the legislative council polls, the Enforcement Directorate on Thursday filed a chargesheet against Congress Lok Sabha MP from Malkajgiri, A Revanth Reddy, TRS MLA Sandra Venkata Veeraiah and four others in the cash-for-vote scam. The ED chargesheet also made a mention of TDP president and former AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s name while talking about a phone recording, but did not name him as an accused in the case. The ED had provisionally attached Rs 50 lakh allegedly offered as bribe to Anglo-Indian MLA Elvis Stephenson, asking him to abstain from voting to favour a TDP candidate in the MLC polls in 2015. The alleged offence took place on May 31, 2015. The ED also named independent church bishop Harry Sebastian, Revanth’s aide Rudra Sivakumar Uday Simha, mediator Mathaiah Jerusalem and then TDP MLC candidate Vem Narendar Reddy’s son Vem Krishna Keerthan in the case. The bribe money was arranged by Narendar Reddy’s son, the ACB and ED alleged. The ED investigation established that Revanth Reddy, Sandra Veeraiah and others had conspired to bribe Stephenson to secure his vote in favour of Narender Reddy. The ED chargesheet (prosecution complaint) was filed in the metropolitan sessions judge-cum-PMLA special court in Nampally. The ED recorded the statements of the accused and witnesses, including Revanth Reddy, Sebastian and Uday Simha. The trio was allegedly involved in the actual handing over of the bribe amount to Stephenson.ED sleuths also confronted them with audio-visual recordings of the offence. The points raised by the ACB that Chandrababu Naidu had allegedly spoken to Stephenson before the voting and gave him an assurance were mentioned in the ED chargesheet as well. However,both the ACB and the ED did not produce any evidence against Naidu except confirming that the voice in the audio record was that of Naidu. Stephenson alleged that he was offered Rs 5 crore and a flight ticket to leave the country after casting his vote in favour of the TDP candidate in the legislative council elections held on June 1, 2015. The ACB arrested Revanth Reddy after catching him red-handed while he was allegedly paying Rs 50 lakh to Stephenson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cash-for-vote-ed-files-chargesheet-against-mp/articleshow/83021369.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||Was trying to sell O2 machines to pay staff, help needy: Kalra||New Delhi: Businessman Navneet Kalra, through his counsel, on Friday told a court that he was only trying to sell oxygen concentrators to pay his employees and help the needy during the pandemic and had no intention to cheat anyone. Seeking bail before chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa underlined that as far as oxygen concentrators were concerned, the market was unregulated as the government was yet to fix their price. “I had no intention to cheat anyone. It was all in good faith. I did alternative work so that I could pay salaries to my employees and GST to the government. I don’t have any criminal intent. I’m not running away. The court may impose any condition it feels appropriate,” the plea stated. At the start of the hearing, additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava sought an adjournment saying he wanted to place various facts that had surfaced in the police investigation. The court, however, denied adjournment reasoning that the case diary having all relevant information had been perused. The prosecutor referred to a Delhi High Court order highlighting that the case fell within the definition of medical drug and the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. For elaborating on such points and other aspects, Shrivastava urged the court to adjourn the hearing, adding the order was received the previous night. The court, however, expressed its displeasure and said despite having sufficient time, the reply wasn’t filed. It remarked that all details were with the court. A heated exchange ensued between the court and the prosecutor following which Shrivastava was warned of contempt for making “irresponsible submissions”. While hearing the submissions of the applicant, it referred to the allegations of the prosecution according to which police had received 21 complaints and Kalra was accused of selling at least 10 machines above the MRP. Pahwa said, “The question is if he deserves bail or not after being in jail for 12 days. The only representation made by me was that it was sold through WhatsApp.” “I never made a representation with regard to the quality of the product, because this company has a website. My sale mode is contrary to the allegation of hoarding. The products were pre-booked and after-sale invoices were issued,” the counsel continued. He further submitted that the concentrators sold by his client were of the same make as those available on e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Indiamart. Pahwa added, “I’m not the only one. This is the only make from China. Some days ago, they were purchased by a celebrity.” The counsel questioned when the government had allowed import of the concentrators, which were being widely used, and how was it that what he was selling was labelled substandard. “According to me, it is not substandard. Why did the SDM and police give it to Covid centres? If it is substandard, then would Delhi Police give it to Covid centres?” asked Pahwa. “It is a clear cut case of high-handedness and making a scapegoat. These concentrators have been distributed all over Delhi,” Pahwa added. The prosecution will respond to the arguments made on Kalra’s behalf on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/was-trying-to-sell-o2-machines-to-pay-staff-help-needy-kalra/articleshow/83048353.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Hyderabad||Eatala may join BJP soon, waiting for final word from high command||Hyderabad: Former health minister Eatala Rajender is all set to join the BJP soon, if everything goes as per the plan. Highly-placed sources in the state party unit told TOI that he could join the BJP in three or four days as the former health minister has expressed his willingness to join. “Till May 30, the party workers and leaders will be busy with activities relating to NDA coming to power for the second time. After all this is over, Eatala will join the party in presence of BJP national president JP Nadda,” a source said. BJP sources said that clarity on when he would resign from the TRS is yet to come. In case election takes place, the Huzurabad seat will go to him, but party top leaders said that if his wife Jamuna Reddy is keen on contesting, that will also be considered. “We have placed the matter with the high command, and they are keen on inducting Eatala into the party,” said a source. Speculation related to Eatala joining BJP began two days ago. Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy confirmed that Eatala sought time to meet him but the meeting did not take place. Sources said that Eatala initially approached BJP seeking support for him as an independent candidate for Huzurabad byelection, but BJP leaders told him that as national party they would not do it. “He received the same reply from the Congress party too,” a source said. On the other hand, Congress’ efforts to woo Eatala did not yield any result. Sources said that Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy tried to speak to him on Thursday but Eatala told him he will not join Congress. However, developments in BJP were met with some opposition too, with a few leaders, especially E Peddi Reddy, being unhappy. “He was upset with Eatala being given a chance as he wanted to contest from Huzurabad,” said a leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-may-join-bjp-soon-waiting-for-final-word-from-high-command/articleshow/83017219.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that action has been initiated and said, “Both say they neither purchased nor stocked, but played a role of facilitator,” adding they got them from manufacturers, who have been issued notices. ASG Anil Singh then said manufacturers had told the Centre “that they have not directly supplied to any party, including politicians and celebrities”. In the hearing over a clutch of PILs on Covid management, a bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Girish Kulkarni said, “We take it that the inquiry will proceed in accordance with law.” The AG assured, “We shall take it to its logical end.”The judges said illegal supply defeats the orders of Supreme Court, the high court, the Centre and state on remdesivir distribution. “They have gone to the manufacturers. They may be bona fide but not realising there are legal repercussions. What is said by those persons (actor Sonu Sood and Siddique in their replies) is not correct,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges were told about shortage of amphotericin-B injection for mucormycosis cases. The AG said as on May 26, there were 3,200 patients, adding the shortage is due to few manufacturers. “We need 14,000 vials per day. We are getting 4,000-5,000 per day (from the Centre),’’ he said. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC said there are 335 black fungus cases in Mumbai. “It is an important issue to be dealt with...Now it is coming to Bombay (sic),” said Justice Sayed. When informed that the Centre’s allocation of oxygen is adequate, the judges said the state can issue an ordinance or an executive order to allow private hospitals to set up oxygen plants. “There is a possibility of a third wave. There has to be a plan in place if it does. We have to learn from our mistakes,” said Justice Kulkarni. Sakhare said there are 12,052 paediatric Covid-19 cases with only 2 hospitalisations and 17 deaths on Tuesday’s dashboard. “So they (cases) have increased,” Justice Kulkarni remarked. They recalled on May 12, the court there were 11,423 cases. Sakhare said the BMC is increasing facilities at three jumbo Covid centers for paediatric patients with arrangements for their parents to stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-ups-heat-on-supply-of-meds-to-sonu-sood-mla/articleshow/83021463.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Chandigarh||With 27 Mucormycosis patients, hospital gets only 20 injections; 1 dies||Bathinda: At Adesh Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Bathinda, the number of injections required to treat Mucormycosis or black fungus has not kept pace with the number of patients admitted. There are 27 patients here but the institute received only 20 injections of Amphotericin B Liposmal on Thursday. Two injections are needed for a patient every day and the supply is not even enough for one patient. A 75-year-old patient, Gurbachan Singh of Fazilka district died of Mucormycosis on Thursday and family members of a four-year-old child are learned to have discharged him from hospital for want of injections. So far, Punjab has registered 188 patients of Mucormycosis, of whom 156 are under treatment, nine have recovered and 23 have died of the disease. In the absence of Amphotericin, the state’s expert group has recommended Itraconazole (4000) tablets and Posaconazole (500) tablets. Hospitals in Punjab are unable to cope with rising number of mucormycosis cases for want of adequate injections. While state authorities suggest alternative injections and tablets, doctors are not convinced. Amphotericin Liposomal and Posaconazole injections are administered to the those suffering from Mucormycosis. Nikita Nandwani, whose father-in-law, Surinder Kumar is suffering from Mucormycosis and is admitted in Adesh, said, “We were told on Wednesday that 38 injections are expected to be received by Thursday morning but today, we were told that only 20 injections were received by the hospital from government authorities. This is highly insufficient for the number of patients admitted here. I have asked for a few injections from Dubai but it may take some time reaching. Our main concern is why the government does not source from other places?” Family members of another patient, who did not want to be named said, “We too are waiting endlessly for the injections.” AIMSR medical superintendent Dr Avtar Singh Bansal said, “We got the injections today and our doctors are looking into who needs them more. We have uploaded our demand for more injections.” He also confirmed the death of a 75-year-old patient of Mucormycosis. Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon said officials are coordinating with hospitals to streamline the supply of injections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-27-mucormycosis-patients-hospital-gets-only-20-injections-1-dies/articleshow/83019337.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Ahmedabad||Space crunch: 3.4 lakh vehicles towed in 2020||AHMEDABAD: In 2020, despite the Covid pandemic curfew, the city traffic police department had towed and fined some 3.35 lakh illegally parked vehicles from various locations in the city. In 2019, some 2.26 lakh vehicles were towed and in 2018, over 14.5K vehicles were towed for illegal parking. But here is the catch, against the rising demand for parking in the city, the municipal administration has been able to generate legal parking lots for 32K vehicles, which includes 5.4K four-wheelers and 26.5K two-wheelers. Ahmedabad presently has 74 authorized parking sites. Of these, 40 are off-street parking, four are multi-level parking facilities, nine are on-street parking and the remaining 21 are below flyovers. “When Gujarat state was formed in 1961, there were only 43K vehicles registered in Ahmedabad. This figure has now risen to over 35 lakh vehicles, which is 80 folds in five decades. In these five decades, just 18% of Ahmedabad’s land was made available for public purpose,” says a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official in the estate department. Ahmedabad city had a total number of 0.25 million motor vehicles registered in 2018-19. This went up to 3.5 million, recording an annual growth rate of 6%. Of this, 73% is of two-wheelers. But what makes earmarking legal parking space in the city more challenging is the fact is that Ahmedabad has a more dispersed economic activities in relation to its citizens residential clusters. “Ahmedabad is a polycentric. The main industrial areas Vatva, Narol, Naroda, Odhav and Kathwada are located towards the east of the city, while commercial activities are centred around Ashram Road, CG Road and Sarkhej. Apart from this, commercial developments are allowed on all roads having width of 18 metres and above which encourages a mix development pattern and dispersed trips,” adds the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/space-crunch-3-4l-vehicles-towed-in-2020/articleshow/83017254.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Slow start to Telangana’s global vaccination bids, state government optimistic||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government’s global tenders for Covid-19 vaccines have so far received a lukewarm response from manufacturers. While the state requires four crore doses to vaccinate all, the suppliers have expressed their inability to ensure huge quantities in the available time. So far, close to 60 lakh people have received the jabs in the state. The manufacturers also cited huge monthly supply targets, lack of time and high demand for vaccines across the globe as other reasons for their helplessness. Health officials, however, said they are optimistic as they have time till June 4 to receive some more tenders. At least a dozen states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Uttarakhand are inviting global tenders citing the shortage of vaccine stocks. Uttar Pradesh was the first to float a global tender 10 days ago for 40 million doses of the vaccine, while the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation floated a global tender for10 million doses. The Telangana government had invited global tenders through Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation recently for procuring one crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine from the manufacturers or their agents in case of imported jabs. A prebid meeting was held on Wednesday with prospective bidders on the tenders. The manufacturers of AstraZeneca (UK) and Sputnik V (Russia) vaccines participated in the prebid meeting apart from agents and distributors from other firms. They sought clarifications about supply schedule, cold chain and payment methods,” TSMSIDC managing director K Chandrasekhar Reddy told TOI on Thursday. Sources said the manufacturers are believed to have asked the state government to ease the clause that the successful bidder of vaccine should supply a minimum of 15 lakh doses a month and that supplies have to be initiated within seven days after issuance of letter of intent. They reportedly told the TSMSIDC officials that there is a huge demand not only from various states in the country, but also from other countries. One company is believed to have sought cold chain facilities as it has two versions of vaccines. Senior officials said the government is keen to get global vaccine producers on board as local manufactures may not be in a position to meet the vaccine requirements of the state within a short time. With Pfizer and Moderna making it clear that they would deal only with the Centre and not with states, the Telangana government has a limited scope to procure vaccines from the global manufacturers, officials explained. As per the Union government’s directive, 50 per cent of the total number of vaccines should be given to the Centre, while the rest would be handed over to state government and private hospitals. “Of the total production, the states may get only 30-35%of vaccines in the country,” a senior official said. Chandrasekhar Reddy said indigenous manufacturers did not attend the pre-bid meeting as they have been supplying vaccines to the state. “Earlier, they had attended meetings on vaccine supplies to the state,” Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slow-start-to-ts-global-vax-bids-state-govt-optimistic/articleshow/83021437.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: National Green Tribunal stops NTPC plant expansion||HYDERABAD: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) suffered a temporary setback when the National Green Tribunal south zone bench in Chennai on Thursday kept the environment clearance (EC), issued to NTPC for its new thermal power plant in Ramagundam, in abeyance for seven months. The NGT bench wanted a re-appraisal done as per the additional terms and conditions of the Union ministry of environment and forest. It announced this verdict in a petition filed by a local from Karimnagar district identified as Uma Maheshwar Dahagama, who alleged that the NTPC had initially applied for 2X600 MW thermal power plant and later enhanced it to 2X800 MW capacity in violation of the terms. The EC was granted to the NTPC in 2016 and it got amended clearances in 2017 and 2020. Maheshwar alleged violations and lapses in the EC given to NTPC in his petition. The NGT bench said in its orders, “After getting the impact assessment report, the MoEF should forward the same to the expert appraisal committee (EAC) for further appraisal. The EAC has to give recommendations. All this exercise will have to be completed within seven months.” The NTPC was also directed to conduct a fresh study regarding the area for installation of flue gas desulferisation system (a set of technologies used to remove sulfur dioxide) and do a hydro-geological impact assessment on account of the ash pond due to storage of ash slurry, besides study the impact on water quality. “The project proponent should be directed to conduct radio activity and heavy metal test of coal to be used. These tests should also be done for alternative coal and mitigative measures to be taken to reduce impact on environment,” the NGT said. The NTPC was told to conduct a cumulative impact assessment of ambient air quality modelling for a radius of 15 km from the project area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngt-stops-ntpc-plant-expansion/articleshow/83017260.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The locals of the colony alerted the police that a few youngsters were threatening locals who were on the road to stay indoors by brandishing a stick and occasionally beating them up. When police analysed the CCTV footage, they realized that the locals information was correct as motorcycle borne persons were moving with sticks and threatening the locals. “Some of the colony members were staying indoors when police are present in the area. Once they move to a different area, many were coming out. Noticing this, four youngsters by moving in bike tried to give an impression that they belong to some security agency and they are enforcing lockdown in mufti,” Balapur police station inspector B Bhaskar said. Police said a case was registered against the four persons under Disaster Management Act and they were arrested. All the four were doing petty jobs. The unauthorised movement of accused during the lockdown itself is an offence and hence they were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-held-for-threatening-locals/articleshow/83019303.cms||---

Speaking to newsmen after attending a Covid-19 review meeting at the district collectorate on Thursday, he said when Palaniswami was CM, the oxygen available in the state was only 250 metric tonnes a day as against the required 575 MT, but CM M K Stalin had taken effective steps to prevent shortage. “There are no deaths in the state due to oxygen shortage,” he stated. The CM had advised ministers to concentrate only on people’s welfare till the virus spread is contained. He urged everyone to work towards preventing Covid-19 spread and not to politicise issues. The government is also taking steps to directly procure 3.5crore doses of vaccine. Vanathi Srinivasan had also spoken about shortage of vaccines. Instead of politicising the issue, she could take it up with the concerned authorities in the central government to get what is required for the state. He said while the spread of the infection has seen a decline in 13 districts including Virudhunagar, Tenkasi and Tirunelveli in the past week, cases have been going up in Coimbatore. The CM had deputed two additional IAS officials to contain the spread in Coimbatore. As for the situation in Virudhunagar district, Subramanian said there are currently 401 beds with oxygen support of which 72 are vacant. Revenue and disaster management minister K K S S R Ramachandran have been taking steps to set up 200 additional beds with oxygen support. Steps would be taken to distribute 60 oxygen concentrators to the district. He further said officials have also requested to establish a trauma care centre in the district to treat patients who sustain injuries in cracker unit fire accidents and road accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-deaths-due-to-o2-shortage-min/articleshow/83021438.cms||---

However, Eatala got a partial relief when Justice B Vijaysen Reddy directed Maisaipet tahsildar to defer the survey for two or three weeks. “You can fix the survey in the second or third week of June,” the judge said. Citing orders from RDO of Toopran, revenue officials of Masaipet and a deputy inspector of survey issued notices to Jamuna Hatcheries on May 6. Challenging this survey notice, Jamuna approached the high court urging it to declare it as illegal and unconstitutional and sought an order setting aside the notice. When her counsel D Prakash Reddy contended that assigned land cannot be seen as government land, the judge asked him what prejudice would be caused to his petitioner if a survey is done. “You can have a grievance when the assigned land is resumed, but not prior to that,” Justice Vijaysen Reddy said. The senior counsel replied that a survey would only fix the boundaries and would never result in determining the ownership. At this, the judge asked: “What is the alternative left before a state to know the status of the land.” Doubting the intentions of the government, Prakash Reddy said a survey should be undertaken for the public good and not for extraneous considerations. “What is sought to be done now is malice in law,” he argued, adding that a survey should be in tune with circular proceedings. Advocate General BS Prasad said the survey had the approval of the CCLA. He told the court that the purpose of the survey was to ascertain the quantum of assigned land under encroachment or in possession of the petitioner and also others. “It is not correct to say that no one has asked for the survey. We initiated the process based on the complaints of original assignees of the land,” the AG said The judge, while dismissing the interim application seeking stay on the survey, posted the main case to June for examining the legality of the government’s action. Second Story SagarKumar.Mutha Hyderabad: Eatala Rajender’s wife Jamuna’s petitioner, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy said the notices issued were not in tune with the Telangana Survey and Boundaries Act, 1923. Appearing for the petitioner in the high court, he said the notice cites a report from Toopran RDO as the basis for the survey of assigned land, but a copy of the same was not given to the petitioner. He reminded the court that earlier a single judge had thrown out a survey report prepared by Medak district collector on land belonging to Jamuna Hatcheries. Justice B Vijaysen Reddy sought to know from the senior counsel as to how issuing a notice for the survey is illegal. “Earlier, you had secured an interim order from this court on the ground that you were not put on notice. Now you are notified, but again you are before this court challenging the notice,” the judge said. The senior counsel explained that a survey is generally taken up when the owners seek the same and neighbours will be notified about such survey. “In this case, no one sought the survey,” he said. Responding to a query from the court on why the government chose to issue a survey notice separately when it already issued notices under the provisions of the Assigned Land (Prohibition of Transfer) Act, advocate general BS Prasad said that they cannot ascertain the quantum of assigned land under illegal occupation without a survey. “It would be unfair to say that the state government has got no powers even to conduct a survey,” he added. “They cannot prevent the government from knowing the truth,” the AG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-refuses-to-stay-survey-of-eatala-firms-land/articleshow/83017269.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||IIT Mandi decodes coronavirus protein||Shimla: A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT), Mandi have elucidated part of the structure of a key protein in the Covid-19 virus, which helps understand its mode of action, its role in spread and severity of the disease and development of antiviral therapeutics. The team’s findings have been published in the journal, “Current research in virological science.” The research team was led by Rajanish Giri, assistant professor, School of Basic Sciences, IIT Mandi. The team experimentally studied the structural conformations of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 under various conditions – in an organic solvent, membrane mimetic environment and inside liposomes. A statement issued by IIT Mandi said current Covid-19 treatments simply manage symptoms while the body fights off the infection. There are, as yet, no confirmed antiviral drugs that can stop the virus from replicating. One route to neutralising any virus is to attack its proteins and such an approach holds true for the Covid-19 virus as well.  Scientists across the globe are involved in studies to elucidate the structure and functions of these proteins to understand the viral disease and develop drugs that are effective against the virus. Rajanish Giri said that their finding provides valuable insight into disorder-order conformation of the NSP1 C-terminal region (residues 131-180) of the SARS-COV2 virus under various environments, which will help in understanding the broader aspect of NSP1 and its interactions with binding partners that are currently unknown. He said that an understanding of the conformational structure and associated functions of key viral proteins such as the NSP1 could eventually help develop therapeutics that could these proteins and stop the virus in its tracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/iit-mandi-decodes-coronavirus-protein/articleshow/83019257.cms||---

They stopped vehicles posing as cops and then robbed those in the vehicles. Officers of Adalaj police said they had received an input that four persons who were involved in loot of a man on May 17 were passing from Annapurna Circle in Adalaj. Police kept a watch in the area and nabbed the four men who were travelling in two different vehicles — a scooter and an autorickshaw. A police officer said that cops found Rs 60,000 cash from one of the accused, who was riding a scooter. On questioning him, the man confessed that he had looted the money from a scooter-borne man in Adalaj on May 17. On further questioning, the four accused, identified as Ahmed Pathan, 42, resident of Vatva, Sameer Pathan, 36, resident of Juhapura, Mohammed Jafar Shaikh, 34, resident of Danilimda and Mustaq Shaikh resident of Vatva said that they were involved in various other loots. On their modus operandi, police said that they used to stop people travelling alone at night and introduced themselves as police officers. One of them used to hold the victim, while the others removed his wallet and other valuables. Police said that they were involved in around 12 such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gang-of-four-fake-cops-nabbed/articleshow/83017280.cms||---

The number of fatalities also declined to 117, the lowest since April 15 when 112 people had died of Covid-19. The last time Delhi recorded a lower positivity rate was on March 24, when it saw 1,254 fresh cases with a positivity rate of 1.52%. Thursday is the second day in a row when the positivity rate was less than 2%. Health minister Satyendar Jain had on Wednesday ascribed the sharp dip from a high of over 28,000 cases and a positivity rate of more than 36% during the current wave to the lockdown that has been in place since April 19. The new cases in the past 24 hours were from 49,348 RT-PCR and 20,720 rapid antigen tests. With 3,725 patients recovering during this period, the number of active cases on Thursday stood at 16,378. From an all-time high of 99,725 active cases on April 28, the count has dipped by 83.6%, with the number of recovering patients outnumbering the fresh cases. On Wednesday, for instance, 300 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised — the lowest since April 2, while the number of patients who got discharged was 644. Delhi recorded 130 Covid-19 fatalities on Wednesday, for the first time below the 150-mark in seven weeks. This month saw the figure hover around the 450 mark. The overall death toll stands at 23,812 with a case fatality rate of 1.67%. The number of patients in home isolation is 8,247, while 6,743 are hospitalised. Out of the 25,084 hospital beds, 18,341 are vacant; while 6,070 of the 6,332 beds in Covid care centres and 535 of the 606 beds in Covid health centres are available. Out of the 6,902 Covid ICU beds, 3,400 were vacant at 10pm on Thursday, according to the government’s online Corona dashboard. This includes 821 vacant beds with ventilators out of 2,563. Jain had some time ago said it could only be said that Covid-19 was under control when the positivity rate dipped below 2%. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had also said on Sunday that Delhi government would start the unlock process gradually from May 31 if the declining trend of Covid cases continued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-at-a-64-day-low-1072-new-cases/articleshow/83017285.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Given the size and sophistication of India’s pharmaceutical industry, there is certainly hope that India can leverage on its strength and contain future waves,” the report added. Highlighting the turn that the pandemic has taken in May, RBI said that increasingly, country experiences underscore the paramount need for speedy and universal vaccination on a war footing.” The virus will mutate as long as it stays with humans, nobody is safe until everyone is safe,” the report said. The central bank said that mutant strains, slow pace of inoculation in several parts of the world and visceral vaccine protectionism has once again turned domestic and global outlook grim. “While the economy has not moderated to the extent during the first wave, the surrounding uncertainties can act as a deterrent in the immediate period. On the supply side, agriculture has proven its resilience, enduring the shock of the pandemic, thus providing support to rural demand and the economy at large,” the report said. It said that in the case of services, recovery has been varied, with the revival in construction, trade, freight transportation and information technology (IT) related activities. While the performance of contact-intensive sectors is still sub-par, it is also improving. “Going ahead, as the vaccination drive picks up and cases of infections fall, a sharp turnaround in growth is likely,” the report said. On inflation, the evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. “The food inflation path will critically depend on the temporal and spatial progression of the south-west monsoon in 2021. Second, some respite from the incidence of domestic taxes on petroleum products through coordinated action by the centre and states could provide relief, although international crude oil prices continued to be volatile,” the report said. It said that a combination of high international commodity prices and logistic costs may push up input price pressures across manufacturing and services. “Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is expected to average 5% during 2021-22, - 5.2% in Q1; 5.2% in Q2; 4.4% in Q3; and 5.1% in Q4, with risks, broadly balanced. During April 2021, inflation moderated on favourable base effects, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/universal-vaccination-on-war-footing-key-reserve-bank-of-india/articleshow/83023418.cms||---

Personnel of the school ensured that equipment used for Covid treatment was up and running in hours of crisis. The school was contacted by the district administration and possibilities of ways in which the school could help were discussed. After the discussions, a helpline was started by the school to repair any medical equipment that developed snags. If a government hospital needed help with repairs of a machine, expertise from the army was just a call away. The engineers and other personnel at the school have expertise in electronic, mechanical and digital equipment, an official release stated.

A case has been registered against Upendrasinh Becharsinh with the Airport police station where he is posted. Bharat Soni, a resident of Kubernagar, told police that a case of voluntarily causing hurt had been registered against him last July. Becharsinh was investigating the case. “The cop called to say that he would not parade Soni in public or beat him after being arrested — all for a price,” the complaint read. Soni recorded the call and registered a complaint with the office of additional police commissioner (sector-II). An inquiry was conducted in this matter following which the complaint was registered. Soni told police, “I regularly visited Matruchaya Society. One Kalu Rabari, whom I knew, suspected me of being involved in an elopement case. On July 15, 2020 when I was sitting outside the society, Kalu’s son Govind attacked me. Following the scuffle, I left the area.” Later, on July 17, Soni’s friend Bunty who runs a pan shop informed him that a complaint had been registered against him. The head constable allegedly called Soni on July 19 last year, and asked for Rs 1 lakh for the police inspector Rs 25,000 for himself in exchange for going soft on him. Soni said that the Airport police took his mobile phone into custody and sent it to the Forensic Science Laboratory for verification. The FSL issued a report that the recording had not been tampered with. Following this, the Airport police registered a case against the cop under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/policeman-seeks-bribe-for-not-parading-accused-in-public/articleshow/83017301.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: How hospitals are shoring up defences just in case third wave catches children||NEW DELHI: Terming the next six weeks as crucial, the paediatrics departments of city hospitals are gearing up to deal with coronavirus infection of children. Child specialists are educating paramedics under them in treating children with Covid. As Dr Dhiren Gupta of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said, “We can’t say whether the expected third wave of infections will affect mostly kids, but we need to boost our system right away.” While Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, pointed out that data from across the globe, not just from India, showed most children suffered mild Covid symptoms, with only those with comorbidities falling severely ill, he felt it was better to be overprepared than underprepared. The next three months will be crucial and it will depend a lot on human behaviour, he said, and people should not ignore the fact that the coronavirus was still out there and mutating. There were justifiable concerns, Guleria said, that if schools, colleges and other educational institutions opened, children would be exposed to infection. “Our hospital already has a strategy for children. We hadn’t as yet felt the need to expand the existing paediatric section in our Covid centre,” the AIIMS director said. “Now, with the expected third wave, we have started procuring consumables.” The main problem making doctors apprehensive is multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), in which kids develop serious complications usually after two to four weeks of Covid. Ganga Ram currently has seven children aged 10-15 years with MIS-C, the youngest being six months old. Dr Gupta there advised parents to seek medical help if fever or rash continued after the usual recovery period of Covid. Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital have started training their nurses and paramedic staff on caring for children with Covid. Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of both Rajiv Gandhi Hospital and Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya who also holds the additional charge of medical superintendent of GTB, has written to Delhi government to see if a temporary Covid centre exclusively for children can be created. “Since children can’t be left alone and need attendants or either of the parents, it is important that a facility with enough space is available,” explained Sherwal. “We are preparing by setting aside beds for children, upgrading our oxygen supply and getting medical equipment. For children, we need equipment that is appropriate for them, the sizes of ventilators, masks, tubes being able to fit their nostrils.” Private hospitals are also augmenting their resources. At Fortis Healthcare, doctors are exploring the possibility of treating kids in the comfort of their homes through video. Dr Krishan Chugh, director, paediatrics, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said the chain had chalked out a plan not only for Delhi, but for all units across India. “We have been meeting online to discuss how our hospital needs to adapt. Aware of the fact that children might be more susceptible, we are seeing how we can treat them in their homes, while keeping tabs on them through online platforms and videos,” said Chugh. Apart from this, Chugh said, ambulances needed to be modified to have equipment suitable for kids. “Every hospital must have a dedicated ICU facility to deal with post-Covid complications. We at Fortis Delhi have such a facility, but must ensure them in our other hospitals too,” the paediatrician said. At Apollo Indraprastha Hospitals, the emphasis is on vaccination of children. Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director and senior paediatric gastroenterologist, said, “As per NCDC data as on May 25, about 3% of the Covid-infected were below 10 years in age and 8% between 11 and 20 years. This shows that children have had significant infections, though the impact in terms of hospitalisation and serious manifestations has been on the elderly. As we have 36 crore children below the age of 14 and another 10 crore aged 15-19 years, we are talking about a large proportion of the population that is theoretically vulnerable unless vaccinated. They may appear a low priority, but we must consider vaccinating children.” Sibal added that several parents of sick children had panicked and consulted paediatricians. “We request everyone not to panic. In case of any emergency, just reach out to your paediatrician,” he advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-hospitals-are-shoring-up-defences-just-in-case-third-wave-catches-children/articleshow/83017408.cms||---
---||Kochi||Govt to speed up file movement||Thiruvananthapuram: The government has fixed a time frame to speed up file clearance and put an end to the red tape on the basis of a meeting of the secretaries chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. As per the order issued by the industries department, all memorandums received by the government should be converted into files on the same day of receiving them. They should be attended to within three days in case of routine matters, and sent to the department undersecretary on the same day in case of urgent matters. If the undersecretary is on leave, it should be submitted to the next higher authority. The new order also says that in the case of urgent matters but not involving policy matters, the file should reach the department secretary within three days, and in the case of routine matters, the file should be submitted to the secretaries within five days. The files are not to be submitted directly to the chief minister, without clearance from the minister concerned. This would mean that the roles and powers of the ministers are not undermined. Last year, when the government had formed a cabinet sub-committee to amend the rules of business, ministers E Chandrasekharan and K Krishnan Kutty had opposed the amendments that suggested more power to the department secretaries and submission of files directly to the chief minister without the knowledge of the minister concerned. As per the latest order, the files submitted to the CM should have proper noting with analysis and opinion or remarks of the ministers. It also says that once the CM issues orders to place the file before the council of ministers, the file should not be circulated to other departments. As per the existing rules of business, there is a distinct list of 26 items that has to be shown to the CM specifically, before issuing any orders on them. The entry 26 in the list says that “any other case or class of cases that the chief minister specially wants to be submitted to him”, will also be routed to him, practically giving the CM control over every file in the government. The latest order has stated that there would not be any physical touchpoints after October 2, this year, and by then, all the services covered under the Right to Services Act should be made available online and should be implemented. Even as it maintains the age-old Tottenham system of file processing, the state does not strictly follow the mandatory procedures mentioned in the system for the smooth movement of files. “For example, the Tottenham system mandates that the personal register that records file movement should be systematically inspected weekly by the joint secretaries, monthly by the additional secretaries and once in three months by the secretaries. This is never done,” a senior government official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-to-speed-up-file-movement/articleshow/83017370.cms||KP Saikiran

Goa has reported ten cases of black fungus so far. Goa Medical College (GMC) has eleven patients, while one patient is being treated in a private hospital. Goa has reported two deaths linked to black fungus so far, but one had a chest CT score, and hence his cause of death could not be linked to mucormycosis. The Centre has allotted Goa 100 vials of amphotericin B, the anti-viral drug used in the treatment of patients afflicted with black fungus. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/black-fungus-notified-under-health-act/articleshow/83019387.cms||---
---||Thane||Petrol tops Rs 100 in Thane, Navi Mumbai, 6p shy in Mumbai||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Will India’s financial capital, Mumbai, become the first metropolis to see regular petrol sell for Rs 100 a litre? Looks like it, if the trend of retailers revising pump prices by tens of paise every second or third day is anything to go by. After Thursday's hike, the 14th this month, petrol shot past Rs 100 mark in Thane and Navi Mumbai to a record Rs 100.06, and it was just 6 paise shy of Rs 100 in Mumbai. It will take just one more hike to hit a century in the city. The cumulative hike over the past one year is Rs 24 for a litre of petrol in the city. While Mumbaikars are bracing for the impact, Jaipur has become the second state capital after Bhopal where petrol price has topped Rs 100. Rajasthan has the highest VAT on fuel, followed by MP and Maharashtra. This explains the surge in these states, although petrol is selling well above Rs 90 per litre in all other states. Rajasthan had earned the dubious distinction of seeing petrol price cross Rs 100 for the first time in the country at Sri Ganganagar on February 17, followed by Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. The difference in the cost of transporting fuel from the source—refinery or supply depots—to pumps in a district causes prices to vary within a state. Octroi or entry tax in some cities is another reason for such variation. Since January, petrol price has risen about 11%, or Rs 9.60 a litre in Mumbai and Rs 9.97 in Delhi. Diesel has become costlier by roughly 14%, or Rs 11.36 a litre in Mumbai and Rs 10.74 in Delhi as retailers passed on the impact of rising international crude price and a weakening rupee. The diesel price in Mumbai was at a new high price of Rs 91.87 per litre at pumps on Thursday while in Thane and Navi Mumbai, the rate had escalated to Rs 91.99 per litre. “Unless the government intervenes and partially rolls back taxes, VAT and excise duty on fuel, there is little hope for any relief in fuel prices,” said experts from the oil industry, adding, “These taxes and VAT contribute to 66% of what we pay for the fuel as on date.” Across Maharashtra, highest price of petrol was a record Rs 102.30 in Parbhani while 22 other districts including Nashik had petrol price over Rs 100 a litre. Petrol dealers association president M Venkat Rao said there was no significant drop in customers for petrol across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, but there was around 15% drop of those coming to refill diesel at some of the pumps. Ravi Shinde, a petrol pump owner from Amar Mahal area, said, “Despite unprecedented increase in price of petrol and diesel, the pump owners across MMR have not received a stipulated increase in dealer margin since the last four years. Many petrol pumps are finding it difficult to purchase fuel for the next day.” In the wake of increasing petrol and diesel costs, a few citizens have opted to go for new electric vehicles—SUVs, cars or scooters—whose running and maintenance costs are cheaper. There are few takers for electric cars, though, as the city still lacks a robust e-charging infrastructure, said a transport official. The price of petrol in 23 districts across Maharashtra is over Rs 100 a litre. They include Alibag Rs 100.05, Amravati Rs 101.37, Aurangabad Rs 101.18, Beed Rs 100.93, Bhandara Rs 100.33, Buldhana Rs 101.50, Gadchiroli Rs 100.54, Gondia Rs 101.17, Hingoli Rs 100.88, Jalgaon Rs 101.09, Jalna Rs 101.04, Kolhapur Rs 100.08, Latur Rs 100.87, Nanded Rs 102.10, Nandurbar Rs 100.65, Nashik Rs 100.32, Osmanabad Rs 100.40, Parbhani (highest) Rs 102.30, Ratnagiri Rs 101.29, Satara Rs 100.47,Thane Rs 100.06, Wardha Rs 100.23 and Washim Rs 100.47. When it comes to diesel, Nashik, Pune, Nagpur and 29 other districts now have diesel over the alarming level of Rs 90 a litre and this has upset transporters. “They are fuming as they fear that diesel going over Rs 90 will have an impact on the economy, and will lead to rise in costs of transportation and prices of essential goods like vegetables, fruits, etc,” said Bal Malkit Singh of All India Motor Transport Congress. Pump prices had remained static between February 28 and May 3 when the retailers paused revisions during electioneering in five states, even though crude hit $70/barrel during this period. Crude is currently hovering around $68, boosted by demand from the US, western Europe and China. The high central taxes and VAT are amplifying the impact of elevated crude. The Centre raised excise duty by Rs 13 on petrol and Rs 16 on diesel between March and May last year when oil prices collapsed due to the pandemic. The two hikes raised excise duty 65% on petrol from Rs 19.98 to Rs 32.98 a litre and 79% on diesel from Rs 15.83 to Rs 28.35. VAT adds to the pinch since it is levied as a percentage and rises each time the base cost goes up. At a time when the state government and the Centre are blaming one another for rising fuel rates, the petrol rate in Thane and Navi Mumbai crossed the Rs 100 mark on Thursday morning and is now retailing at a record Rs 100.06 per litre. The petrol price in Mumbai was just 6 paise shy of Rs 100 a litre and it will take just one more hike to hit a century. It retailed at Rs 99.94 a litre on Thursday, leaving scores of motorists fuming as the cumulative hike over the past one year is Rs 24 for a litre of petrol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/petrol-tops-rs-100-in-thane-navi-mum-6p-shy-in-city/articleshow/83025018.cms||Somit Sen
---||Ahmedabad||Covid deaths: Christians, Parsis turn to cremation||AHMEDABAD: As Gujarat struggles to recover from the latest Covid wave, which has proved to be more deadly than previous ones, space and convenience have become an issue for those who bury their dead during these times. This has led Christians and Parsis — whose religious practices do not allow cremation in normal circumstances — to consider this path for their deceased kin. Till May 14, some 15 Catholic members and 10 from the Parsi community have been cremated in the city. In this extreme crisis, the Catholic Diocese of Ahmedabad had issued a circular on April 12 to its adherents to consider cremation as a possible option. It is under extraordinary circumstances that Catholic Christians in Gujarat were reminded that cremation is a legitimate choice, explains Fr Vinayak Jadav. Clement J Chammasheril, a physics professor at St Xavier’s College, was reportedly cremated on May 8. He is survived by his wife and son. “The only incident known to us before this was where Fr Herbert D’Souza, the first principal of St Xavier’s College, had died in California in the US, cremated there, and his ashes flown back to Gujarat to be preserved. Cremation has thus far not been a popular option in Gujarat. Prior to the Covid pandemic, we hardly had community members cremating anyone. While cremation is being encouraged, people’s traditional option of burial must be respected,” Fr Jadav said. George Fernandes, representing the Malayalee Catholic Fellowship in Gujarat (MACAF), claimed that 15 of its members had been cremated within Ahmedabad, and a few outside the city. “Lack of burial space and the present circumstance has demanded that families opt for cremation.” The April 12 letter issued by Bishop Athanasius Rethna Swamy read: “The present situation poses a challenge to the church in administering the last rites to the departed ones in a dignified manner. There are also issues of dwindling space in our cemeteries.” The letter added, “In circumstances when cremation is chosen because of sanitary, economic or social considerations, this choice must never violate the explicitly stated or the reasonably inferable wishes of the deceased faithful.” The church raises no doctrinal objections to this practice in the pandemic because the cremation of the deceased’s body does not affect his or her soul, the letter said. The Parsi community has been encouraged to weigh the options for the last rites along the same lines. Ervad (‘priest’) Khushroo Ghadiali of Anjuman Vakil Addran at Khamasa, said, “The cremation option is only for those who succumbed to Covid. We have cremated some 10 individuals in the city. The usual last rites remain the same for individuals who die of other causes.” He added: “Usually Parsis follow the tradition of ‘dokhmenashini’ which is grounded in science. But in this pandemic, our community has decided to strictly observe government guidelines for the disposal of bodies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-deaths-christians-parsis-turn-to-cremation/articleshow/83017368.cms||---

---||Madurai||Madurai auto driver gives free rides to Covid patients||MADURAI: Till a few months before the pandemic struck, A Raja was a well-paid mechanic at a shipyard in Singapore. He left all that behind and returned to his native city and rode an autorickshaw to earn a livelihood. Now, an auto driver-turned-multi-purpose hospital worker, the 30-year-old has been providing free rides to Covid-19 infected people for the past two weeks. Hailing from Sellur, Raja had lost his livelihood during last year’s lockdown. A diploma holder in mechanical engineering, he took up the job of a multi-purpose worker in the Covid-19 block of Government Rajaji Hospital as contract employee on a monthly salary of Rs 9,500.  After the end of his shift at 4 pm, he provides free rides to Covid-19 infected people. He has mentioned this on the back of his vehicle. He has also circulated his numbers on social media. Nurses and other hospital staff would also call him for picking up and dropping infected people. “I have so far given free rides to more than 30 people. I am happy that my vehicle is of help to people in need. I had rented out the vehicle after joining the hospital job. But I got it back after the complete lockdown came into effect on May 10,” he said. Being a hospital worker himself, Raja says he knows well how to handle Covid-19 patients. He wears a PPE kit and masks while handling them. During lockdown, vehicles are not available for people even for emergency purposes. Not many will come forward to help Covid-19 patients at this time. Hence, he thought of giving them free rides. Raja who got married only four months ago, had mobilized rice and other essentials and distributed it to the needy during the first wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/he-gives-free-auto-rides-to-covid-19-positive-people/articleshow/83021527.cms||V Devanathan

This also leads to complaints by the relatives of the patients and the consequent factfinding inquiries. We, thus, feel that state governments need to issue necessary directions in this regard on the analogy of PGIMER, Chandigarh and other reputed institutions,” the HC ordered. With respect to complaints against private hospitals for overcharging from Covid-19 patients, the HC directed both the states and Chandigarh to furnish the reports of fact-finding inquiries. Asking the authorities to keep a copy of such inquiry reports in a sealed cover, the high court made it clear, “At the appropriate stage, this court may call for such report and examine the same to consider whether further action needs to be initiated.” The high court also ordered that the rates for RAT and RT-PCR tests in all the two states and the UT must be made uniform. A division bench, comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh, passed these orders while hearing an ongoing petition regarding arrangements and facilities available in the region to tackle the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/set-up-icu-control-rooms-in-hosps-hc-to-states-ut/articleshow/83019389.cms||Ajay Sura

Wildlife biologist and secretary of MARC Roshnath R said that they have confirmed that the vulture sighted in Sahyadri Tiger Reserve is the same bird they had rescued from Kannur on December 28, 2020 and later released into Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) on seeing the photographs and details shared by officials of Sahyadri Tiger Reserve and experts from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The bird was wing tagged and ring tagged before its release in WWS, which led to its identification.  “We are delighted at the sighting of the bird in good health in a faraway sanctuary. When we rescued it in a house compound at Chakkarakkal on Dec 28, 2020, it could not even stand on its legs. The bird, which was sighted for the first time in state, was exhausted and we had brought it to the rehab facility of MARC in Kannur. Now, photograph of the bird soaring high over Sahyadri Tiger Reserve four months later shows that our rescue programme was a success. The bird could be on its way to the northern wintering grounds in the Himalayas before the onset of monsoon in South,” he said. Roshnath said that after a month of rehabilitation, carried out as per the instructions provided by BNHS deputy director Vibhu Prakash (also the principal scientist of BNHS vulture breeding programme), the bird regained its health. It became active, started flapping its wings, preening and feeding well. Before releasing it into the wild in WWS, patagial tags (bird bands) and a colour band were fitted for future identification. After its release at Muthanga range of WWS on Jan 31, the bird was sighted on Feb 28 when a forest watcher saw the tagged one at a carcass amongst a group of vultures near the release site. The massive tricoloured vulture with whitish head and neck, pale brown body and contrasting dark flight feathers breeds in south Europe, north Africa and Asia. In India, it is mostly seen as a migratory bird in the Himalayas and the northern plains. Griffon vultures were first sighted in southern India on January 2, 1990 at Sriharikota Island, Andhra Pradesh and again in 2017 in Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu. “The species was reported as absent in Western Ghats and coastal zones of peninsular India, but these recent records suggest that they probably stray more frequently southwards in the subcontinent,” said a paper published in the latest issue of Indian Birds journal co-authored by Roshnath and senior ornithologist C Sashikumar. The vulture was recently spotted by forest officials in the Jungli Jaigad area of Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary, which is part of Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, while on patrol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rare-vultures-800km-journey-brings-cheers-to-its-rescuers/articleshow/83017417.cms||---

A team of party functionaries including R B Udhayakumar, Sellur K Raju, Theni MP P Ravindranathkumar and Ayyappan, among others met district collector S Aneesh Sekhar and handed over a memorandum on Thursday. They said the increasing death rate among Covid victims in the district was a cause of concern. Udhayakumar alleged that villages coming under Thirumangalam, Thiruparankundram, Usilampatti, Madurai West and Melur constituencies which have AIADMK MLAs were facing discrimination. Amma clinics established by the previous government have been closed citing lack of manpower, but these would go a long way in helping to combat the disease, Udhaykumar said. As many as 1,538 people were affected by Covid in the district, and 15 succumbed to the disease on May 26. Over 1,000 people have been testing positive in the district since May 7. Many villagers were dying without even knowing they were affected by Covid. The result of the huge crowds that the state witnessed when it relaxed the lockdown completely last weekend would be known next week, he said. Fever camps, vaccination camps and ambulance and medical services should be made available throughout the district without showing any bias, he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-alleges-bias-in-vax-allotment/articleshow/83021545.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: 39 Covid deaths on Thursday, case positivity down to 25%||PANAJI: Goa reported 39 Covid-19 casualties for the third day in a row, pushing the toll to 2,539. Since Saturday, there have been surprising similarities in the death figures. On four days, the daily count of Covid mortalities has been 39, while on Monday, it was 38. Of these, the majority of deaths are recorded in Goa Medical College (GMC), eight to 15 from South Goa District hospital (SGDH), and about five by different private hospitals. The daily mortality bulletin is prepared by GMC. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said the cut-off time for counting Covid casualties is 3pm. “The deaths reported post 3pm, are counted for the next day,” he said. Even if the death count for the last three has been the same, the number of deaths recorded in GMC for those three days has been different, he said. The GMC reported 23, 24, and 19 casualties on Thursday, Wednesday, and Tuesday respectively. That of SGDH were 8,6 and 11, for the three days. The state has been witnessing a decline in new infections. The case positivity rate fell to 25% for the first time in a month, but the mortalities continue to be high. Out of the 39 fatalities reported over the last 24 hours, three were brought dead. An unknown man around 40 years old was brought dead to Hospicio hospital, while a 42-year-old native of Uttar Pradesh was also declared brought dead at the SGDH. A 74-year-old man from Amona was brought to the primary health centre, Quepem after he had passed away. A 62-year-old woman from Fatorda and a 72-year-old man from Kerim died within a few hours after they were brought to the hospital in a critical condition. None of the deceased were fully vaccinated, while just four had received their first dose, stated mortality bulletin. A 36-year-old man from Solapur was the youngest casualty of the day. On Thursday, 1,557 people were cured, and the recovery rate was at 88 %. Hospitalisation dropped below 150, while 141 were discharged. Manipal Hospital Goa will open online slots for registration and scheduling of Covaxin vaccination (second dose) for 18-44 years age group on May 28 at 11am. The slots will be available from May 31 to June 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/39-covid-deaths-on-thurs-case-positivity-down-to-25/articleshow/83019423.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Minister objects to extensions for bureaucrats||MUMBAI: Textiles and fisheries minister Aslam Shaikh on Thursday objected to granting of extensions to retired bureaucrats or re-appointment on contract basis after retirement, as it has a “demoralizing effect on the entire bureaucracy”. For the first time in recent history a cabinet member has objected to this. “It is demoralizing for the bureaucracy, it indirectly implies that no serving officer is as capable as the retired officers... this also, to quite an extent, maligns the image of the state government, as it can be easily construed that such extensions are given on the basis of some consideration for doing work beyond the ambit of rules or legality,’’ Shaikh said in a two-page letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Shaikh mentioned Radheshyam Mopalwar, who continues to be managing director, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, MMRDA commissioner R A Rajeev, who has been given a three-month extension after retirement, additional chief secretary V K Gautam, appointed as officer-on-special-duty after retirement from water resources department, while Ajoy Mehta was given a nine-month extension after he retired as chief secretary. “The government intends to give a further extension to the MMRDA commissioner and MSRDC MD,’’ Shaikh said. He said these bureaucrats do not fall in any category that warrants extension after retirement. “Extension is given to officers who are on emergency or election duty, but these IAS officers are not eligible for extensions. The extensions violates service rules and causes injustice to serving officers, who otherwise would have been considered for appointment to these posts,” he said. “The CM must realize that no officer is indispensable. It will be wrong to grant extensions to bureaucrats, who hold high and crucial posts,’’ a former chief secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-min-objects-to-extensions-for-bureaucrats/articleshow/83021623.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Goa||Goa: CCTV cameras in Colvale jail delayed||PANAJI: The plan to have CCTV cameras installed within the premises of Colvale Central Jail has been deferred due to the pandemic even as the proposal was approved by the government in principle few months ago. A jail official said a visit by the stakeholders to the prison prior to spots for installation of cameras finalised, was postponed due to a rise in cases over the last two months. “A fresh schedule for their visit will be decided only after Covid-19 cases drop significantly,” he said. The proposal to have CCTV cameras in the prison that houses about 540 prisoners, was moved in a bid to heighten security as during the last one and a half a year, there have at least five escape attempts by the prisoners by hoodwinking the security. The jail has a three-tire security and after every escape, security arrangement has been examined and tightened, another official said. There have been several instances when security personnel have been caught red-handed in a bid to smuggle in goods including mobiles and other things. “We suspect there are rotten apples among our people that help jail mates and see that their needs are met. If we have CCTV camera surveillance, it will help us to keep a tab on all simultaneously. In case, if anybody escapes, through CCTV footage we will learn how he managed it,” he said. When an inmate escapes from the prison, the jail guard or a police security is placed under suspension if prima facie found guilty. A temporary suspension doesn’t work as a deterrent, and it was suggested to the government, that independent inquiry through an official be conducted and stricter punishment meted out to them such as termination from the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cctv-cameras-in-colvale-jail-delayed/articleshow/83019413.cms||---

Police on Thursday booked three persons —Bhimbha Jagatia, Bhupatbha Manek, and Vijay Sumaniya— for the murder of Lalbha Manek, an autorickshwa driver. The victim as well as the accused are residents of Arambhda village. The incident occurred at a tea stall in Suraj Karadi village when Lalbha was having tea on Wednesday evening. After the accused attacked Lalbha, he was taken to hospital in Mithapur where he succumbed to injuries. Police said that about a fortnight ago, accused Bhimbha was talking on his mobile phone loudly while standing behind Lalbha’s house at midnight. Lalbha asked Bhimbha to go away and not talk loudly near his house, which the accused did not like. “To avenge the rebuke from Lalbha, Bhimbha and his associates attacked the deceased and stabbed him resulting in his death,” police said. Lalbha’s elder brother Devubha Manek had lodged a murder complaint against the three accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/auto-driver-stabbed-to-death-by-three-over-petty-issue/articleshow/83015077.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||GSHSEB warns of action against schools enrolling students in Class XI||AHMEDABAD: The state education department has swung into action following reports of schools in Saurashtra and other parts of Gujarat enrolling students in Class XI even as mark sheets are being prepared for their Class X (SSC). Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) secretary Dinesh Patel said all district education officers (DEOs) have been asked to keep watch on schools that have started admissions for Class XI. “If any school is found giving admission before the Class X results are handed out, they will face strict action,” said Patel. The decision to grant mass promotions to regular Class X students of the Gujarat Secondary Education Board was taken by chief minister Vijay Rupani to protect students from being infected with Covid-19, the government stated in a media release recently. Due to mass promotions, many schools will have to increase the number of classrooms and overall intake of students for Class XI is going to witness a steep rise, said sources in the education department. “Some schools in Rajkot and a few other areas have reportedly started giving admission to students well in advance. They are under government scrutiny now,” a source said. A decision on ‘repeaters’ or students who had failed in earlier attempts and were to retake the exams this year, will be taken after assessing the situation once the number of Covid-19 cases drop, the statement said. The state government has already granted mass promotions to students of Classes I to IX and Class XI in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to restrictions on the movement of people and non-essential activities in the state. According to initial estimates by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), about 2,000 new classrooms will be needed to accommodate the higher number of students in Class XI. This will require 3,500 teachers more teachers for Class XI. Of the 7.92 lakh regular students, 60.64% or about 4.80 lakh students cleared the Class X board exams last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gshseb-warns-of-action-against-schools-enrolling-students-in-class-xi/articleshow/83017412.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Wealth management firm CEO, 3 others booked for cheating||PUNE: The Deccan Gymkhana police have registered a case against the CEO of a wealth management company operating from Law College Road, his wife and three others on the charge of cheating depositors of Rs31.92 crore since 2018 by promising them handsome returns on their investment. The firm would offer 100% to 270% returns on investments made for terms ranging from six months to a year, claiming it was utilising the funds in stock, bullion and commodity markets. So far, six depositors, including a 51-year-old owner of two small-scale industrial units in Chakan, who invested Rs2 crore, have come forward with their complaints. The other complainants are into realty, garments and other businesses. The police have also invoked provisions under Sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, besides, applying the IPC section for criminal breach of trust against the CEO and four others. The CEO’s wife is a team leader in the firm while the other three booked are his brother, who is the chief financial officer as well as the chief technical officer; the chief operating officer and the overseas support head of the firm, which claims to have been registered in London. All the five are on the run and the police are searching for them. Senior inspector Murlidhar Karpe of the Deccan police told TOI, “In 2019, the same company’s CEO was arrested on charge of cheating people to the tune of Rs65 lakh in a similar fashion. He then secured a conditional bail from court, promising that he would return the money to the victims within six months but failed to do so. Now, we are looking for him in both the cases. The CEO and his wife stayed in a rented flat on Law College Road. They left the flat after the 2019 case. They are native of Jalgaon and don’t have a permanent address in Pune.” In the latest case, the small-scale unit owner, who also resides on Law College Road, stated that in November-December 2018, the firm spread the word that it would give 100% to 270% returns on investments made for terms ranging from six months to a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wealth-mgmt-firm-ceo-3-others-booked-for-cheating/articleshow/83017432.cms||---

The video, which went viral on social media, showed Vadivelu, 50, an agriculture coolie from Perumalpatti, eating a snake. The man is seen claiming that snakes were good antidotes to Covid-19 and that he was eating one to keep the disease at bay. The video was taken to the notice of Madurai district forest officer S Anand, who sent his personnel and arrested the man from Perumalpatti. The DFO told TOI that the man hailed from a very poor background. As he was inebriated, some people instigated him to eat the snake which was found dead in a drain. They also egged him on to make the statements on Covid. ``He chewed the snake, which was already dead, but he was lucky enough not to bite into its venom glands as it was later identified as a common krait,’’ he said. The common krait’s venom is neurotoxic which could paralyse a human being. The man was also slapped with a fine of Rs 7,000 for his act by the forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-eats-snake-claims-it-keeps-off-covid-arrested-fined-rs-7k/articleshow/83021589.cms||---
---||Mumbai||On south Mumbai temple premises, locals get their Covid vax||MUMBAI: Right beside a house of prayer, with soothing music playing softly in th background, residents of Bhuleshwar are getting their Covid vaccine shot. This vaccination centre is located in a banquet hall on the premises of the 160-year-old Madhav Baug Temple compound at CP Tank Road. Already, 1,000 vaccine doses have been administered since BMC launched it earlier this month. Residents who stream in at the air conditioned banquet hall which has soft music playing said they are glad that they do not have to wait in the hot sun or rain.  Corporator Atul Shah from the BJP who was instrumental in getting this centre set up said that before the BMC could start vaccine centres at every civic ward, residents of the area would go either to Nair hospital or JJ hospital to get the accine. “People used to complain about having to keep waiting long hours and said there was no social distancing being maintained at these places. So, when a location was being finalised in my ward, I wanted a place that was welcoming,” said Shah. Local vaccination centres were started with insistence from corporators for benefit of locals. It also helped rein in crowds at big hospitals. Prior to the lockdown, the banquet hall was used to host wedding receptions and other functions. “When the trustees offered the place for the vaccination drive, I immediately got it approved byt the BMC as this spacious hall can accommodate up to 500 people at a time,” said Shah. Bhuleshwar resident Nutan Soni (61) who had gone to this centre to take her first dose on Thursday said that the place was well maintained. “Also, volunteers were helpful,” said Soni a home-maker. Shah has launched two helpline numbers (022-66667129 & 022-66667131). “We also have a facility to conduct antigen tests for those coming to take the jab so that the person knows his/her Covid status before taking the jab,” said Shah. The BMC, however, does not mandate such a test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-sobo-temple-premises-locals-get-their-covid-vax/articleshow/83019484.cms||Richa Pinto

"For the last six months, Deepak and Piyush had been raping the minor girl in the factory. The crime came to light after she got pregnant and her mother noticed physical changes in her body. When her mother inquired about it, she revealed that the duo was raping her,” police said. After medical examination, doctors on Wednesday evening confirmed that she was pregnant. Police have detained Koli and Dangar and they will be arrested after their Covid-19 test results.

When whether the long power outages during Cyclone Tautkae had any impact on the vaccines and whether there was need to worry about the approaching monsoon when power interruptions are experienced, Dr Borkar said all provisions have been made. The Covishield vaccines, that must be kept between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, are stored in ice lined refrigerators (ILRs) which are also routinely used to store other vaccines. These protect the vaccines from power outages for up to 72 hours, Borkar said, adding that these ILRs are a prerequisite for the sites to be qualified as a vaccination centre. Beyond 72 hours, they can be kept inside ice boxes with ice packs for up to seven days. The Covid vaccines, like the tetanus ones, are freeze sensitive and cannot be kept below 0 degrees. “They are kept hanging in the ILRs in a basket or on the top shelves. They cannot be allowed to touch the bottom of the ILR,” a doctor said. The vaccination centres also have to keep tabs of the temperature of the ILR to ensure that the cold chain is maintained. “The system is good because of the long standing immunisation programme that has been going on for years,” an official said. Once opened, the vials which contain between 10-12 doses must be used within four hours. As a result, to avoid wastage, many vaccination centres open their last vial for the day only if there are ten and more people in the queue. If there are just one or two people in the queue at the end of the day, they are asked to return the next day. Goa’s efficient utilisation of vaccines earned it praise from the Centre as it administered more doses than those allotted by making use of leftover doses in vials. Goa was rated highest, even higher than Kerala, Odisha and Himachal Pradesh for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccine-centres-equipped-to-handle-power-outages/articleshow/83019513.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The polilce zeroed in on the duo after analysing footage from over 60 CCTV cameras. The youths robbed people of a motorcycle, cash and cellphones in Bibvewadi, Kondhwa and Handewadi. The stolen bike, three cellphones, a wristwatch and some cash, collectively worth at Rs1.65 lakh, was recovered. “The youths — Akash Gaikwad (21) and Omkar Bahule (24) — do odd jobs and are first-time offenders, committing crimes to make a quick buck,” inspector Hemant Patil from crime branch (Unit V) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-youths-in-the-net-for-robberies/articleshow/83017486.cms||---
---||Goa||South Goa hosp’s occupancy less than 50%, but severity of disease still high||Panaji: Half the beds at the South Goa district hospital for Covid are vacant, but the severity of the disease continues to be very high, officials said, appealing to people not to let their guard down and not to delay seeking treatment. The hospital, which escalated its beds to its full capacity of 568 during the peak of the second wave, has less than half of its beds occupied. Daily admissions which were around 90, and had even crossed 100, now average 30, with discharges more than the admissions. Since Thursday, the hospital has had more than 200 beds vacant. The hospital’s casualty that saw up to 1,600 each day during the peak has also drastically reduced, but a doctor said patients continuing to be brought dead is worrying and indicative of the fact that people are not seeking treatment in time. Majority of those succumbing have also not taken the vaccine, the doctor said. “Those who have tested positive and have symptoms can visit the hospital’s flu OPD between 8am to 8pm, and the casualty 24 hours if they are very symptomatic. Those who are positive and have fever, headache, slight breathlessness or any other unusual symptoms, must visit the hospital where an X-ray will be done to ascertain the extent of the disease, after which the patient will be guided properly and advised hospitalisation or not,” a doctor said. Doctors and nurses from MPT hospital have also been shifted to the South Goa district hospital which enabled it to commission the last 68 beds. An official said patients who were about to be discharged would be shifted to MPT hospital, and those from MPT hospital who turned severe were shifted to South Goa district hospital, but this got too complicated. “MPT hospital didn’t have all the resources and antibiotics, and it isn’t a tertiary level hospital. Instead of shifting patients back and forth, the government decided to shift the manpower to South Goa district hospital,” the official said. The 568-bed hospital, however, continues to have a very small ICU with only nine beds and an ITU with nine beds. A five-bed high dependency unit (HDU) has been set up next to the casualty where patients brought in, in a serious condition, can be stabilised. The unit is likely to be made functional on Friday. “A patient who is serious can immediately be put on a non-invasive ventilator and stabilised in this unit before being shifted to the ICU, ITU or the ward. Simultaneously, blood samples can be collected and investigation can be fast tracked instead of any delays,” the official said. Daily mortality at the hospital has been under 10 for the past few days and doctors are trying to bring this number under five, and then down to zero. “The severity of the disease is still very high and patients are very serious. The work is tremendous,” a doctor working at the hospital told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-hosps-occupancy-less-than-50-but-severity-of-disease-still-high/articleshow/83019501.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||PCMC approves Rs 12 crore payment to transport utility||Pune: Relief came for the cash-strapped PMPML on Thursday with the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation approving Rs12 crore for the transport utility at its standing committee meeting.Nitin Landge, chairman of the panel of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), confirmed the development and said it was now up to the PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited) on how to use the money. “The transport utility has been facing issues in paying Rs53 crore to the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) against the CNG supplied to it,” Landge told TOI, adding that the PMPML should now ensure proper services in the PCMC limits.Last week, the MNGL had sent a letter to the PMPML stating that if its dues were not cleared, the CNG supply to the transport utility would be stopped from June. Deepak Sawant, the director of the board of the MNGL, had said the pandemic had resulted in problems for them too and that the PMPML needed to ensure that it at least paid Rs30 crore of its outstanding amount to ensure the supply of the CNG.Rajendra Jagtap, the chairman-cum-managing director of the PMPML, had earlier said the Pune Municipal Corporation had paid its monthly contribution of Rs20 crore and funds from the PCMC was awaited. “If the PCMC pays us for both the months (April and May), we may be able to pay the MNGL all of Rs12 crore for the month of May. If only Rs12 crore come, we can pay only up to Rs5 crore to them (MNGL),” the CMD said on Wednesday.Another official of the transport utility said the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations paid for the operational losses of the PMPML at a ratio of 60:40. “The PMC pays around Rs20 crore each month, while the PCMC pays around Rs 12 crore per month. The money which has come from the PCMC is for one month and the payment for another month is pending. Some of this can be paid to the MNGL but we cannot comment on whether the issue would be solved,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-approves-rs-12-crore-payment-to-transport-utility/articleshow/83017497.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid positivity rate down in first fortnight of restrictions||KOLKATA: During the last 12 days, when restrictions are in place in Bengal, the positivity rate has slid by 7%. On May 15, a day before the restrictions came into force, the positivity rate in the state was as high as 29%, when 19,511 samples out of 66,563 samples had tested positive. On Thursday, 13,046 people tested positive to Covid-19 out of 57,165 tests conducted, bringing the infection rate down to 22%. Health experts hoped that extending the restrictions for another fortnight might bring the infection rate further down by about 15%. “These restrictions ensure that people stay home, thus preventing them from either getting infected or infecting others they come in close contact with. That is how the infection rate has come down. Now, with an extension of the restrictions, we are hopeful of seeing the number of fresh cases going down further,” said senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee, who is a member in the Bengal’s global advisory board for Covid-19 management. “At the same time, death rate has not come down much. Is that because of late detection, late medical attention? We must also go down to the bottom of this,” added Mukherjee. Public health specialists said that incubation period of the virus is between two and 14 days on an average. Therefore, some people might be harbouring the virus before the existing restrictions were imposed and if their movement is not restricted, they might now infect others. “Such restrictions are always preferred for at least double the length of the virus’s incubation period. But we should also be seeing that the measures recommended are being followed strictly in rural areas as well. We are noticing a decline in cases in urban areas but not the same in districts,” said public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan, Anirban Dalui. Kolkata, where fresh cases had touched close to 4,000 and which used to have the highest active cases on any given day, had only 1,489 cases on Thursday. North 24 Parganas has gone past Kolkata on Covid count. Community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandopadhyay is hopeful that restrictions for another fortnight should ensure a decline in the mortality rate as well. “For the past few days hospitals have become accessible by those who need hospital care. Having restrictions will not only ensure a decline in positive cases but also allow partial economic activities for the poor,” said Bandopadhyay, who is an assistant professor at ID Hospital Beliaghata. “During these enhanced restrictions we must also ensure scaling up of tests,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri of Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-positivity-rate-down-in-first-fortnight-of-restrictions/articleshow/83017518.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

They prepare two varieties of rice every day and give the beneficiary the privilege to choose. “Our village is more than 90 km from Madurai city and 60 km from Tuticorin city. Places like Tiruchendur are over 90 km from our village. Due to the lockdown, hotels are closed and people are struggling to get food. So we decided to play a small role in feeding them,” said K Jeya Kannan, 38, who is coordinating the initiative. Most of the youth are college students or those who graduated and are searching for a job. Those who are employed bought a few bags of rice while those unemployed collected rice from their homes to prepare variety rice for lunch. The Ettayapuram Police has given the men a pass to buy fresh vegetables from the market every morning and at times they even assist the boys in distributing food packets. Their daily expense is lesser than Rs 3,000. Food is prepared at the hotel owned by Kannan’s uncle Raja at Sinthalakarai on the highway and is closed now due to the lockdown. Around 320 to 340 packets are prepared almost everyday and around 250 packets are distributed on the highway from 12 noon to 2 pm. Meanwhile, the rest of the packets are taken to Ettayapuram to feed the people with learning difficulties and other homeless people. Kannan said that they intend to do so till the lockdown eases and hotels reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tuticorin-youths-feed-more-than-300-people-daily-amid-lockdown/articleshow/83021647.cms||M K Ananth
---||Chandigarh||CHB to start auction process of 150 commercial properties on June 8||Chandigarh: The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) will begin the process of e-tender of 150 leasehold commercial properties from June 8. It will be completed by June 30. The decision was taken in a recent meeting. Confirming the development, CHB chief executive officer Yashpal Garg said the proposal had been cleared by UT adviser Manoj Parida, who was also the CHB chairman. “We have made arrangements to start the process of auction of 150 leasehold commercial properties in different parts of the city,” he added. Meanwhile, he said, the bidding process of 79 freehold residential properties in various sectors of the city through e-tender would be completed by May 31. Thereafter, the list of successful bidders would be displayed.  In the last auction of residential properties, the CHB was able to auction 36 freehold dwelling units. The highest bidders were required to deposit 25% of the bid amount within five working days. However, six highest bidders could not deposit the 25% amount within the prescribed period and so, their earnest money deposit of Rs 2 lakh each was forfeited by the board. Thereafter, the board included these six freehold properties in the auction, taking the total to 79 units.The board had adopted complete secrecy in the last auction and the same formula will be implemented in the upcoming auction.The CHB had prepared a list of 270 properties, including 11 residential (leasehold), 109 residential (freehold) and 150 commercial (leasehold), for sale. It had started with auction of freehold residential units. To get a good response, the board had reduced the reserve price of the properties by 10%. Not even a single bidder expressed interest in the auction of CHB properties held in 2019 as the reserve price was too high for both residential and commercial properties. This time, the CHB has decided to replace the e-auction process of selling properties with the e-tender one. In e-auction, the earnest money deposit for participation cannot be paid online. The bidder deposits it in the CHB account and submits a proof. The payment is confirmed by the CHB officers before allowing the bidder to participate in the e-auction process. Hence, number of bidders for particular property and their identity is not fully confidential. However, in e-tender, earnest money deposit can be paid online and there is no need of any approval and hence there is complete secrecy about the number of bidders and their identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-to-start-auction-process-of-150-commercial-properties-on-june-8/articleshow/83017541.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Delhi||Man posts video of pet flying with balloons, arrested||NEW DELHI: A YouTuber, who tied helium-filled balloons to his pet dog and tried to make it “fly” was arrested in the city. Gaurav Sharma (32), who has over four million subscribers on YouTube, had shot a video of the act and uploaded it on his channel on May 21 to gain likes and earn money. However, the video was criticised by viewers, following which he reportedly “deleted” it and uploaded a clarification elaborating on the safety measures he took while trying to make his dog, Dollar, fly. The video showed Sharma standing atop a car with his Pomeranian and letting it go. The dog, having over a dozen balloons tied to it, flew in the air and reached second floor of an adjacent building. It was in the air for a few seconds. The incident was brought to the notice of People for Animals NGO, which filed a complaint against Sharma at Malviya Nagar police station. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said, “We received a complaint from PFA alleging that Sharma had risked his dog’s life and registered an FIR under sections of Disaster Management Act and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Vihar in Malviya Nagar, was arrested.” He was, however, released on bail later. During questioning, he told the cops that he made it as a gesture of fun for his channel. In another incident, two men were apprehended for beating a stray dog to death in Okhla, DCP R P Meena said. One of the accused is a minor, while the other was identified as Jaivinder. “A video was going viral on social media on Thursday in which two boys were seen beating a street dog with sticks.

Thirty-three individuals were administered the jab. On Friday, the vaccination will be available in the adjoining village of Cavelossim. Earlier in the week, that is on May 24-25, the vaccination programme was held in the villages of Benaulim constituency, where around 70 people were vaccinated. Most of the sarpanches in these village said they are using all the platforms at their disposal, from public announcements to social media, and even personal calls urging those 45 years and above to avail of the facility. However, a small section of villagers are still apprehensive of the vaccine. Carmona sarpanch Allwyn Jorge said they can only inform people about the vaccine, but cannot force anyone to take it as it is voluntary. Most of the sarpanchs said that they are unaware of the number of villagers who have taken the vaccine as the data is not made available to them for their record and for monitoring. Orlim sarpanch Tamica Rosa e D’silva said she has conducted a survey in her ward, and found out that 30 people are yet to be vaccinated. Medical officer at Chinchinim health centre Nixon Fernandes said they don’t have a physical record of vaccinated people as it gets registered on the portal, nor do they take down the addresses of people who come for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tika-utsav-held-at-carmona-33-people-in-45-age-group-get-jabs/articleshow/83019565.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Covid fatality rate in the city is 0.62% in the last three months while Nashik rural recorded 1.26%. This is despite Nashik city reporting 1.43 lakh cases between March 1 and May 26 and Nashik rural recording 1.07 lakh in the same period. Even in terms of recovery of Covid patients, Nashik city is ahead of Nashik rural. District health authorities have cited multiple reasons for higher deaths in rural parts. They said most of the Covid hospitals are based in the city unlike in rural Nashik. The city has better health infrastructure. Many patients in critical condition from Nashik rural could not find vacant beds in city hospitals and they had to take treatment at the hospitals in taluka level. Moreover, some patients came late for treatment despite having symptoms of Covid. The delay in treatment is also a major reason behind more Covid deaths in Nashik Rural areas despite the best efforts of the doctors. There has been a significant improvement in the Covid situation in Nashik city. The number of active patients in the city has reduced from 28,012 on April 24 to 5,813 so far. The number of active cases in Nashik rural has reduced from 17,760 on April 24 to 7,601 so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-death-toll-higher-in-nashik-rural-than-in-city/articleshow/83013054.cms||Tushar Pawar

This was revealed in a four member inquiry committee’s report that has also recommended penal and legal action against the hospital. The report read, “The stock statement for the period April 20 to May 20 was taken on record… These injections of Remdesivir, which were allotted to the hospital by the government, were meant for IPD use only and not for overthe-counter sale. However, during scrutiny of the record it was found that the firm had made 24 sale entries in the form of various bills entered and dispatched in the name of various staff members, doctors and CFO of this hospital, as well as private companies.” Highlighting that the staff members denied the purchase of injections, the report said, “The staff members on whose names the injections were sold have denied the purchase in writing. In addition, few entries were made in the name of patients who were not even admitted in the IPD. The patients in whose names the bills have been entered or dispatched in the record ledger of the pharmacy cannot be easily tracked as the patient ID of the IPD has not been recorded. The mode of transactions in most of the cases is found through cash.” The report said, “The committee concludes that there is a definite unethical sale of Remdesivir injections to persons other than the patients admitted in the IPD. Hence, the committee recommends a thorough inquiry regarding the total purchase-sale of Remdesivir injections and the role of Mukesh Sharma, Kshitij Sharma, management of M/s Chandigarh Healthcare Pvt Ltd Pharmacy, and management of the hospital in Sector 69, SAS Nagar. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, the committee recommends that an action may be initiated under the valid provisions of the Drug and Cosmetic Rules, 1945, and an FIR should be lodged against these persons and entities under sections 51(b) and 58 of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, as well as sections 420 and 120(b) of the lPC.” The four-member inquiry committee comprised SDM Jagdeep Sehgal, deputy superintendent of police Deep Kamal, senior medical officer Dr Vijay Bhagat and drug inspector Jai Singh. The report was submitted on May 24. After receiving the complaint, DC Girish Dayalan had served a show-cause notice on Mayo Hospital for misappropriation of government supply of Remdesivir injections for Covid patients. Thereafter, the probe panel was formed. Hospital management, pharmacy under scanner:Raising questions on the conduct of hospital management and pharmacy, the report said, “The procurement of Remdesivir through the government was done by the hospital management. Also, the pharmacy was the overall incharge of stock keeping and distribution among patients. These two managements were responsible for the overall purchase, stock keeping and distribution of injections among patients in their IPD. The siphoning of such a large number of injections within one month raises significant suspicion on the conduct of pharmacy and hospital management.” ‘No justification given’:The report said 83 Remdesivir injections were sold in a month and neither the hospital management nor the pharmacy could submit a valid justification. All these facts are well illustrated in the report submitted by the inspection team. ‘Lodge fir’:In the report submitted to Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, the committee recommended an FIR against the hospital management, chief financial officer (CFO) Mukesh Sharma, his son Kshitij Sharma and the pharmacy on its premises. The Mayo Hospital had recently changed its name to Mount Star due to an ongoing litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/entries-made-in-name-of-patients-not-admitted-in-mohali-hospital/articleshow/83017572.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The board had adopted complete secrecy in the last auction and the same formula will be implemented in the upcoming auction. The CHB had prepared a list of 270 properties, including 11 residential (leasehold), 109 residential (freehold) and 150 commercial (leasehold), for sale. It had started with auction of freehold residential units. To get a good response, the board had reduced the reserve price of the properties by 10%. Not even a single bidder expressed interest in the auction of CHB properties held in 2019 as the reserve price was too high for both residential and commercial properties. This time, the CHB has decided to replace the e-auction process of selling properties with the e-tender one. In eauction, the earnest money deposit for participation cannot be paid online. The bidder deposits it in the CHB account and submits a proof. The payment is confirmed by the CHB officers before allowing the bidder to participate in the e-auction process. Hence, number of bidders for particular property and their identity is not fully confidential. However, in e-tender, earnest money deposit can be paid online and there is no need of any approval and hence there is complete secrecy about the number of bidders and their identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-to-start-auction-process-of-150-commercial-properties-on-june-8/articleshow/83017580.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Delhi||Plea in HC for probe into death of eight Covid patients at Jaipur Golden Hospital||New Delhi: Families of eight Covid-19 patients who died last month in Jaipur Golden Hospital allegedly due to oxygen shortage have approached the Delhi high court demanding a probe monitored by it to fix accountability. In their plea, the victims’ kin have claimed that the deaths on the intervening night of April 23-24 “took place due to deliberate inaction and failure of the respondents to provide adequate oxygen to the patients of Covid-19 despite knowing that any shortage of oxygen supply would cause immediate death of the patients.” The plea filed through advocate Utsav Bains wants that the CCTV footage and other important records of those two days of Jaipur Golden Hospital be seized. It also demands compensation for every affected family, monthly sustenance allowance to single parent, orphans or to the families that have lost their earning member, and prosecution of “erring officials responsible for non-supply of oxygen.” The petition further challenges the findings of a three-member committee set up by the Delhi government, which gave a clean chit to the state. “The report prepared by the committee is erroneous and has been prepared in order to favour the Govt of NCT of Delhi.” “The observation by the committee that the patients were receiving some form of oxygen therapy has been made to mislead the court. The committee did not examine the issue of demand and supply of oxygen to the hospital and has not taken statements by families of victims on record,” the petition argues. Over the findings of the government panel that the patients were suffering multiple comorbidities, the plea says out of all the petitioners’ family members, it was only one patient who was facing other ailments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-hc-for-probe-into-death-of-eight-covid-patients-at-jaipur-golden-hospital/articleshow/83017628.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 18 new black fungus cases, drug still in scant supply||LUCKNOW: Even as 18 more patients of black fungus infection or mucormycosis were admitted to government aided hospitals on Thursday, private hospitals started referring their patients to government facilities due to acute shortage of lifesaving drug Amphotericin B. While 16 more patients were admitted to KGMU, taking the number of patients at the medical university to 186, two more admitted to RMLIMS, taking the total cases in the city to 288, including 40 in private hospitals. Though no death was reported in 24 hours, a private hospital on Shahmeena Road referred patients to government facilities due to unavailability of the Amphotericin B injectable drug. The supply of the drug is said to be adequate in government hospitals, but private facilities have run out of stock. Since the drug is also not available in the open market, the health department made provision to sell it to patients through the Indian Red Cross Society-Lucknow (IRCS-L). However, authorities have not been able to supply the drug in sufficient quantity to the IRSC-L, leaving patients in the lurch. On Thursday, against the demand of 720 injection vials for 40 patients admitted at private hospitals, only 50 vials, were distributed to eight beneficiaries by the IRCS-L. “A day’s dose (six vials each) was given to kin of eight patients,” said IRCS-L chairperson Om Prakash Pathak. As a result, 32 attendants of patients under treatment went back empty-handed. Similar situation has been prevailing for several days. Now, with a little hope to get supply, private hospitals are refusing new patients and referring existing ones in their facilities to government hospitals. “We shifted two patients to government facilities as they could not arrange amphotericin B injections. We are in touch with families of these patients and taking note of their recovery," said Dr RK Mishra, director SIPS. " Another patient whose surgery was done on Thursday would be referred to a government hospital, if her family agrees to it,” he added. As of now, 10 patients with the infection have been operated upon for removal of infected tissues in SIPS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/18-new-black-fungus-cases-drug-still-in-scant-supply/articleshow/83019649.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh reports to Wildlife Institute of India proof of leopard pugmarks||CHANDIGARH: With the direct evidence of sighting of wild animals, besides the proof such as pugmarks of leopard and other animals, the UT forest and wildlife department has sent the report of data collected during wildlife survey at Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). In this census, the department is hopeful of an increase in the number of wild animals. UT’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai said his team had spotted a number of wild animals and pugmarks of leopard were also recorded in various parts of the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. They had finalised the data and sent it to WII last week. The survey findings will be used in preparing the second wildlife census of the sanctuary. The data collection had started on May 5 and completed on May 10. During these six days, the department had used line transect method, sign survey and point count survey. A survey was also conducted to evaluate the species’ richness in other forest areas outside the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. It was on the request of the UT forest and wildlife department that WII, Dehradun, had agreed to provide necessary technical assistance to conduct the exercise. On April 22, a team of scientists from WII had visited Chandigarh and conducted the training and handholding of the department staff. The UT forest and wildlife department was to carry out the second census in April last year, but the pandemic struck and the plan had to be abandoned. Consequent to the outbreak, a lockdown was imposed and the ideal season to conduct the census elapsed. The first wildlife census was carried out in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, spread over an area of 26 sqkm in the catchment area of the Sukhna Lake, in 2010. A team of experts from the WII, environmentalists, representatives of NGOs and biology and zoology students from Panjab University took part in the first census. The team took three days to count nine species of mammals and 65 of birds by using direct evidence—animals and birds spotted in the area—and indirect evidence—foot-prints and animal faeces. Findings of 2010 census:As per the first census report prepared by the WII, the population of sambar in the sanctuary was between 1,000 and 1,200 and peafowl population was between 900 and 1,100. However, leopards were not spotted directly, but their pugmarks were found. The main animals spotted in the sanctuary included sambar, chital, pangolin (anteater), wild boar, jackal, small Indian civet, jungle cat, porcupine, Hanuman langur, Rhesus monkey, Indian hare, common mongoose and three-striped palm squirrel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-dept-sends-report-to-wii-with-evidence-of-leopard-pugmarks/articleshow/83017596.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Parents ask Zirakpur school to waive annual charges||CHANDIGARH: About 153 parents, on Thursday morning, signed a representation and submitted it to the authorities of a school in Zirakpur, demanding waiver of annual charges due to the pandemic. There are over 200 parents from Zirakpur and Derabassi who are on the social media too against the school. Parents gave one-week time to the school management to act on their demands else they would intensify the stir. Claiming that the school management was not ready to pay heed to them, parents demanded a complete waiver of development charges of Rs 9,000, 15% reduction in monthly tuition fee and adjustment of funds of those who had already paid the charges. Vivek Gupta, a resident of Derabassi whose daughter studies in nursery, said as the situation was similar to last year, then why the school management was charging a development fee of Rs 9,000 along with tuition fee of Rs 3,600? “Students have not been using any school infrastructure since March last year,” he added. Another parent, Gurpreet Singh of Zirakpur, said, “We are spending on internet, electricity and other infrastructure from our pockets for the online classes. Instead of giving relaxations in fee, the school is demanding annual charges. We are ready to pay tuition fees, but the annual fee is unacceptable.” Other parents also said the students were at home and not using any single facility of the campus, and the school management must have saved overhead and recurring costs on various items, such as petrol/diesel, electricity, maintenance cost, water and stationery charges, among others. “Despite the clear directions from the apex court as well the state government, this institution had increased the fee more than 10%. The permissible limit for the hike is 8% under the provisions of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Education Institution Act, 2016,” the parents said in the representation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parents-ask-zirakpur-school-to-waive-annual-charges/articleshow/83017587.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||Lucknow||Home isolation: Costly infra, meds drain emotions, puncture pockets||Lucknow: Gaurav Sidhwani spent over Rs 2 lakh on medication of his mother-in-law who had to be kept in home isolation after getting critical due to Covid-19 in April for the want of beds in hospitals. Gaurav, his wife and mother also contracted the disease but had mild symptoms. Altogether, the family has spent over Rs 3 lakh so far as medications continued after they tested negative. Treatment of home-isolated patients is not just physically and emotionally exhaustive, but also a costly affair. If a family with a patient with mild symptoms spends at least Rs 50,000, the ones with serious patient spend Rs 1-3 lakh on a range of things from pulse oxymeter and general medicines to pathological/diagnostic tests, oxygen cylinders or concentrators and lifesaving drugs. “I already had an oxygen concentrator but its double battery inverter backup cost me Rs 35,000. We also arranged an oxygen cylinder for my mother-in-law and sent a staff daily to Kanpur for refill, each costing Rs 1,500, because of shortage in Lucknow. She also required 12 doses of Remdesivir which I had to buy for Rs 8,000-20,000 in black market due to shortage,” said Gaurav. Delhi-based Siddhi Garg, who came home after her parents tested Covid-19 positive, spent more than Rs 1.5 lakh for 20-day isolation in April. “Tests – RTPCR, blood examination and CT scan – also cost Rs 20,000. Another Rs 13,000 were spent on medicines, oximeter, BP monitor, nebuliser and glucometer. Since my father was on oxygen support, we spent Rs 80,000 on jumbo oxygen cylinder and its accessories and Rs 17,000 on refilling for 12 days,” she added. Asma, a resident of Aashiana, bought two mid-size oxygen cylinders with regulators for 75,000 each after she turned critical during home isolation on May 3. She also hired a personal nurse for Rs 3,000 per day. As her condition deteriorated, the family had to arrange six Remdesivir injections from Delhi at higher rate. “Total isolation expenses, including drugs and tests, touched Rs 3 lakh,” said Asma’s friend, Garima. “As her condition deteriorated, Asma was hospitalised where the 16-day stay in ICU and lifesaving drugs cost her family Rs 8 lakh,” she added. Ram Chandra Verma of Jankipuram spent over Rs 50,000 for treatment of his wife and son who were in home-isolation. “Expenses included Rs 20,000 on medicines alone followed by various tests that cost around Rs 25,000,” he said. Similarly, Akhilesh Rao (49) of Kalyanpur spent more than Rs 35,000 for treatment during 15-day home isolation after three family members tested positive in April. Four family members of Jankipuram resident Shailesh Singh (54) tested positive in April last. His son developed lung infection for which steroids were administered. “Besides costly drugs, I also arranged oxygen cans. Fortunately, all of us who have recovered are now going for CT scan,” said Vipin, who has spent about Rs 45,000 so far. Nirupa Verma (52), a resident of Gomtinagar, spent over Rs 75,000 during 20 days of quarantine after she and her husband tested Covid-19 positive in April. “From oxygen to drugs like Remdesivir and Fabiflu and various pathological and diagnostic tests, we managed everything.” she said.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 24x7 water supply pilot project for Manimajra to start soon||CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) is all set to sign a contract with a company to carry out the 24x7 water supply pilot project in Manimajra next week. The CSCL has received Rs 2.16 crore as security deposit from the company, which will start work as per the terms and conditions. Initially, the company will prepare the project’s detailed system improvement plan (SIP), which will include a survey of the area, requirement of manpower and technical logistics. The plan will be submitted to the Chandigarh Smart City Limited’s committee that will examine it and accord approval. “The company will bring its manpower and machinery and carry out the work, but senior technical officers and staff of the CSCL will regularly monitor it,” an official said. The Rs 160-crore project has two components, capital work and installation of water meters. Out of this, Rs 70 crore will be spent on capital works and rest Rs 90 crore on maintenance works for the coming 15 years. As per records of the CSCL, there are approximately 13,700 water connections in Manimajra which will be covered under the project. Decreasing the non-revenue water (NRW) or leakage from 50% to 15% in this area is the major segment of this project. Besides the pipelines of outer areas, the authority will also lay those inside the houses so as to stop contamination. Decision taken last year:After completion, MC’s engineering department will maintain the project for15 years. This decision was taken by the members of the general house in February last year when MC commissioner KK Yadav, who is also the chief executive officer of CSCL, had tabled the matter. There were two proposals, one that CSCL will do both capital work as well as handle the operation and maintenance, and charge the water bill from Manimajra residents. The second was that CSCL will do only capital work and MC will do the operation and maintenance and charge the water bill. After the discussion, the house agreed to the second proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/24x7-water-supply-pilot-project-for-manimajra-to-start-soon/articleshow/83017609.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Kolkata||Plant-a-tree move in Cov victims’ memory||Kolkata: A city-based organization has come forward to plant a tree in memory of everyone who has succumbed to Covid and whose friends and family members pay tribute to them on a dedicated online platform. The idea of initiating such a platform has been mooted by 24-year-old Soham Chatterjee who was in the headlines recently for singing Tera Mujhse Hai Pehle Ka Naata to his dying Covid-affected mother on a video call. If all goes well, the initiative will take off in June. Ajay Mittal of Project Life Force (PLF), which had helped many patients with blood and plasma donors during the pandemic, was moved by Chatterjee’s idea of setting up a page called ‘Loss Stories’. Those who have lost their near and dear ones to Covid can share their memories in the page. The posts will be run past a moderator before being shared. “The idea is really touching. Apart from Project Life Force, I have another initiative called ‘eachoneplantone’. My partner, Pankaj Maloo, and I have a mission to plant a tree for every person who has lost their lives to Covid. Once a person contributes to ‘Loss Stories’, we at eachoneplantone.org will plant a tree anywhere in India,” Mittal said. Mittal intends to plant 20 saplings the day after the launch of the platform. “Subsequently, we will take things forward once he informs us about the number of posts. We can plan a plantation drive for every 20 posts. We will update him about the numbers and share some pictures from drives too,” he said. While deadlines never work for emotional healing, some feel that the immediate intensity of the shock after bereavement can be reduced through collective virtual remembrances. On May 17, Chatterjee first took to social media to share memories of his mother, Sanghamitra. In 10 days, his instagram post singing the Kishore Kumar number stands at 100,097 views. Nishi Puri Gupta, who lost her mother on May 3 to Covid, didn’t know Soham personally but could relate to his grief. She wrote to him saying she too had spoken to her dying mother on a video call. Arunima Ghoshal, who lost her 78-year-old father to Covid last October, reached out to Soham after reading on TOI about his plans for the online platform. Wishing him luck, she wrote to him saying: “My dad’s doctor was not as humane as your mom’s doctor – so I did not get to say my final goodbye to my dad. It has been over seven months now and every night before I go to sleep, I still wish/pray/hope for a miracle. I still feel that maybe one day he will call me and ask: ‘ki re aaj call korli na je!” Initially, Chatterjee would get eight to 10 messages daily. “During the course of what transpired in the last two weeks, I've formed a few friendships online that have helped me keep my sanity in such turbulent times. I try to engage with people, sometimes between work hours or after I'm done for the day,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plant-a-tree-move-in-cov-victims-memory/articleshow/83017637.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Agra||Aligarh police books farmers for burning effigy of PM||Agra: The Aligarh police on Thursday booked 8 persons, including five farmers, under section 6 of the United Provinces Special Powers Act (UPSPA) of 1932 along with other sections of IPC for allegedly burning an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a nationwide protest against farm laws a day earlier. However, the case under UPSPA has been registered despite the Allahabad high court earlier opining that burning the effigy of a living person prima facie does not amount to violation under Section 6 of the Act. According to section 6 of the Act — Whoever with intent to annoy any person or with the knowledge that annoyance is likely to be caused to any person performs or takes part in or abets the performance of any mock ceremony, resembling any ceremony associated with or consequent upon death. The FIR registered at Mahua Khera police station states that the suspects violated the Act by allegedly burning effigy of the government besides violating prohibitory orders which are implemented across the state due to partial lockdown in view of pandemic and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Circle officer (civil lines) Vishal Chaudhary said that he is aware of the Allahabad high court’s observations but in this case, this section is valid because there are other sections also imposed along with section 6 of UPSPA Act. He said, “The offence under the Act is bailable and imprisonment may extend to three months or with fine not exceeding Rs 250 or with both.” According to reports appearing in the media, Justice JJ Munir of Allahabad high court had stayed criminal proceedings under UPSPA going on in a lower court (additional chief judicial magistrate, Jalesar, Etah) in August 2018, while hearing a case against 20 people who had allegedly burnt an effigy of the Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav.Justice Munir had observed, “Burning of effigy of a living person is not prima facie an offence under section 6 of the United Provinces Special Powers Act of 1932, which makes organising the mock funeral of a living person an offence punishable with three months’ imprisonment along with a fine.” He had issued a notice to Darmendra Singh Yadav who had lodged the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-police-books-farmers-for-burning-effigy-of-pm/articleshow/83013136.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The committee will also draw up the criteria to award compensation of up to Rs 5 lakh in case of death due to lack of oxygen. The six-member panel includes Dr Naresh Kumar, director-professor (medicine) at Lok Nayak Hospital, Dr Amit Kohli, senior anaesthetist at the same hospital, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, specialist (anaesthesia) at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, Surender Kumar, assistant director planning at DGHS headquarters, Dr AC Shukla, medical superintendent of Mata Chanan Devi Hospital in Janakpuri and Dr JP Singh, the medical superintendent of Tirath Ram Hospital in Civil Lines. The order issued by the health department stated, “The committee will assess on case-to-case basis, complaints and/or representations received regarding death due to lack of oxygen for grant of ex gratia compensation over and above the no-fault ex gratia of Rs 50,000 already ordered by the government.” The complaints and representations to the committee can be filed online as well as offline at the nursing home cell in the DGHS office. The committee would meet at least twice a week either physically or through videoconferencing. It would be empowered to seek any documents from the hospital concerned, including records of oxygen supply, storage and stock and would also check whether oxygen was being used properly according to the norms. “The committee will check the steps taken by hospitals for maintaining sufficient oxygen stock with reference to the patients admitted there. It will remain functional till further orders and submit a report to the principal secretary, health and family welfare, on a weekly basis,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-give-rs-5l-for-death-due-to-o2-shortage/articleshow/83017709.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Probe team records statement of barge’s chief engineer on video||MUMBAI: An investigating team from the ministry of petroleum & natural gas on Thursday video-recorded the statement of the chief engineer of ill-fated barge P-305 that capsized at Bombay High during Cyclone Tauktae on May 17. Chief engineer Mustafizur Rahman Shaikh has stated that the desk officer on board the barge, appointed by ONGC, had sent an email to barge master, Rakesh Ballav, who is still missing, and the barge company to take necessary steps to move the vessel to a safe location, but they didn’t pay heed. A total of 75 personnel lost their lives in the tragedy. The ministry had set up a high-level committee two days after the incident to enquire into the sequence of events. The team set up under this committee will submit its report to the Director-General of Shipping after collecting evidence and recording statements. The mishap will also be recreated using a simulator. A source from DG Shipping told TOI it appears the barge did not have a black box that could have helped in getting more details about the mishap. “The team shot a 20-minute statement. I informed the probe team that the barge master, the barge company and the charterer are responsible for the mishap because they were not in favour of moving the barge despite weather warnings,” Mustafizur, who is currently recuperating in hospital, told TOI. A source from the Indian Navy told TOI that the DG Shipping met the rescue team that carried out the operation. “They were provided with details about the SAR and informed that survey vessel INS Makar did not find any bodies trapped inside the four-storey P-305 and tugboat Varaprada,” the source said. Coast Guard inspector general Anand Badola said two of their ships were still patrolling the location, though ONGC has confirmed that the bodies of all missing personnel have been accounted for.  Yellow Gate police, probing the case against missing captain Ballav and several others, had written to the companies that had sent their employees to work on the barge, to send the survivors so that their statements could be recorded. “The statements of 16 survivors were recorded on Thursday. The previous day, we recorded the statements of eight survivors,” said a senior police officer. DNA samples of family members of 25 crew members have been taken to match them with those of the unidentified bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-team-records-statement-of-barges-chief-engineer-on-video/articleshow/83021843.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Nagpur||10% of all new vehicles to be electric by 2025||Nagpur: One in 10 new vehicles registered in major cities of the state would be electric by 2025. Going by city-wise targets, Nagpur will have 150 charging stations by that time. This was revealed by the state transport department on Thursday during a virtual town hall organised by Climate Voices - a collective of three organisations Purpose, Asar and Climate Trends along with the state environment and climate change department’s Majhi Vasundhara initiative. Hosted by the Waatavaran Foundation and WRI India Ross Centre for Sustainable Cities, the discussion aimed at highlighting the future of electric mobility and key highlights of the draft Electric Vehicles (EV) Policy 2021. The policy, which is awaiting final nod from the state cabinet, targets across urban agglomerations-- Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Aurangabad, Pune, Nagpur, and Nashik. Apart from achieving 25% electrification of intra-city public transport and last mile delivery vehicles by 2025, the draft policy also has an ambitious plan to convert 15% of the existing fleet of 18,000 Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses to electric over the next five years. “The state intends to make four highways and expressways fully EV ready by 2025-- Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, Mumbai-Pune Express Highway, Mumbai-Nashik, and Nashik Pune,” said Avinash Dhakne, state transport commissioner. Apart from this, the state government has also proposed that from April 2022, all new government vehicles will be electric across major cities. The share of electric vehicles in new vehicle registrations across the state in 2025 is expected to be 10% for all vehicles, 10% for 2-wheelers, 20% for 3-wheelers, and 5% for 4-wheelers. “Today, Maharashtra’s share of the country’s vehicle registrations is around 12% (32,000) but the size is still not large enough to excite manufacturers. We are keen to take advantage of the schemes by the central government,” said Ashish Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (transport) of the state. As per the target, at least one gigafactory for manufacturing advanced batteries in the state will be set up. By 2025, the proposed city-wise targets of charging stations are 1,500 for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, 500 for Pune, 150 for Nagpur, 100 for Nashik, and 75 for Aurangabad. Pointing out that the concept of electric vehicles almost failed in Nagpur, experts stated the government will have to do more. “The policy-makers need to extend some benefits like tax rebate or other incentives to encourage usage of electric vehicles. Policy should be made to reuse worn out electric batteries as the battery has approximately over 50% energy capacity still available,” said environmentalist Kaustav Chatterjee. He further stated the policy will have a positive environmental impact only if the charging of electric vehicles was done using solar energy. “Power plants should be upgraded to solar-based technologies. Though the concept of electric vehicles is environment- friendly, it has certain challenges in implementation. Charging time is a big disadvantage for electric vehicles.

The party's state secretary, Vijay Shivhare, said that though the party has already been doing work in the field, mass contact programmes are being held for creating awareness of vaccination, sanitisation among people along with helping them as per their requirement in the ongoing second wave of pandemic. He said, “Party workers will be assigned the job at sector levels to provide all help to the people.” Mainpuri district president, Pradeep Chauhan, said, “We will convey to all our 298 sector in-charges in the district today through virtual meetings so they can plan accordingly.” He added that apart from providing sanitisers and face masks, rations would be provided to the needy as well. “We have been asked to maintain Covid-19 protocol and contact people in distress and understand their issues and provide necessary help to them,” said BJP’s district president in Agra, Giriraj Kushwaha, adding that they have to express gratitude to the public who brought them to power. According to political observers, these are attempts to mitigate anger among the public after Covid surge in villages following panchayat elections. Opposition parties are criticising the ruling government for not making enough efforts to procure vaccines, failure to anticipate the massive second Covid wave and develop the necessary health infrastructure to fight the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/to-mark-modis-7-years-in-office-up-bjp-to-distribute-covid-kits-ration-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83013143.cms||---

But Pabariya, 43, started getting jittery when his wife continued buying vegetables even as their refrigerator could no more take in. She then started storing the vegetables in their neighbour’s house. A worried Pabariya then called up the dedicated helpline set up by Saurashtra University’s psychology department to counsel people affected by the prevailing pandemic situation. “We counselled the woman and after a few follow ups she finally stopped purchasing,” said Dimpal Ramani, an assistant professor in the department. A voluminous study report prepared by analyzing nearly 3,500 calls received on the helpline ever since the pandemic broke out in March last year. Of these, close to 1,000 callers had sought help for abnormal buying, mostly by their spouses. The study reveals that a large number of people have developed a habit to hoard essential and non-essential items out of fear that they may go out of stock due to the lockdown. The professors analyzed the contents of calls for nearly a month and ‘hoarding’ as well as selfish behaviour were the most striking “It’s a kind of temporary illness triggered by mindset change over the last 18 months,” said Hasmukh Chavda, assistant professor who co-authored the study along with Ramani and student Arpita Dhamelia. Researchers were stunned to get SOS calls of people complaining about their spouses hoarding items such as cigarettes. Hetal Vithlani (name changed), wife of a businessman, voluntarily sought help after realizing that she was going overboard in buying cosmetics. “I constantly feared that the beauty parlours would never open. So, I started buying all beauty products and cosmetics. But realizing that this was not normal behaviour, I approached the helpline whose volunteers counselled me,” he told TOI. “One woman told us that her husband had stocked up several cartons of cigarettes, which constricted the space in their room,” added Ramani. The study details several cases of people who used to buy groceries for a week or month before Covid but are now purchasing in quantities that could last for a couple of years. In fact, commodities like tobacco, cigarettes, snacks, medicines, masks, sanitizers and soft drinks are lying in huge quantities in many homes. “We also came across people who confessed to having stored petrol and diesel in bottles,” revealed Ramani. According to the researchers, “People witnessed and experienced harrowing times like shortage of beds, medicines, non-availability of non-essential commodities, which left a deep impact in the minds of people.” An ayurveda shop owner in Rajkot added, “Earlier, people used to buy campor worth maximum Rs 50 to purify air in the house. I have come across customers who brought camphor worth Rs 5,000 during pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/homes-choked-as-covid-19-triggers-abnormal-buying/articleshow/83015411.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The busy stretch was nearly empty due to Covid lockdown. The landing, near the milestone 72 in Mathura’s Naujheel area, was “safe” with no loss of life or property reported, according to in-charge of Yamuna Expressway corridor control, Agra-Mathura sector, Major Manish Singh. The area has been cordoned off by the police. “The incident took place around 12.30pm. The aircraft belonging to Pioneer Flying Academy in Aligarh had two individuals onboard - a trainee pilot and an instructor. Both of them are safe,” he added. Talking to TOI, Mathura SSP Gaurav Grover said the incident is said to have occurred due to a technical glitch in the aircraft. Their technical team is on the way to Mathura. “The aircraft was on a flight from Aligarh to Haryana’s Narnaul and back,” he added. When contacted, the company's chief pilot Captain Anil Kumar said, “The aircraft had to make an emergency landing as it lost power due to a technical snag in the engine.” The captain said that he is on his way to Mathura to bring the aircraft back to Aligarh after disassembling it. "It is a training aircraft and has been used for the past 12 years." Onboard the Cessna 152 were Captain Jagrat Singh and trainee pilot Aditya Ghosh. Captain Kumar further said that the pilot onboard came to know about the power loss when they were flying at 5,000 feet and then "decided to make an emergency landing at any available clear land space". “Luckily vehicle movement was less on Yamuna Expressway due to lockdown. They landed safely, else they could have flown only 10 km ahead,” the captain added. A combined team of Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Aircraft Accident Investigation Board will now probe the matter, he said. According to Yamuna Expressway officials, traffic movement on the busy route was only 5 percent of the usual flow due to the Covid lockdown. It could have caused problems on a normal day, they said. The landing created quite a stir among locals who rushed to the spot to click selfies. Soon, a huge crowd gathered. They were not allowed near the aircraft, though. Bhuvnesh, an excited local resident who had never seen an aircraft so close, said he was out for some work when he suddenly saw the plane coming over his head and then landing on the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/two-seater-cessna-152-makes-emergency-landing-on-yamuna-expressway-in-mathura/articleshow/83013196.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Aurangabad||Cops nab woman for getting her husband eliminated 9 yrs ago||Aurangabad: While probing a contract killing case of a man by his wife and her elder sister, Aurangabad rural police have found that even the elder sister, too, had gotten her husband eliminated in 2012 after he learnt about her extra marital affair. Following her footsteps, her younger sister allegedly got her husband eliminated by agreeing to pay the contract killers Rs 2 lakh through her elder sister on May 18. In this case too, the accused woman’s husband had learnt about her alleged illicit relationship with his cousin and had started harassing her. When contacted, Pachod police station in-charge Ganesh Survase confirmed the development. He said, “We have taken the incident on record.” He refused to divulge further details. It all began with the police finding an unidentified body on the evening of May 20 with injury marks and hands tied up. The deceased was identified as Ashok Jadhav (50) of Kadethan Budruk in Paithan taluka. Based on the complaint lodged by his son Ashok, a murder case was registered. Local crime branch team led by inspector Bhagwat Phunde swung into action and arrested the deceased’s wife Ranjana (36), her paramour Ramprasad Jadhav (32), her elder sister Meenabai Pathade (40) of Karajgaon in Badnapur, her paramour Santosh Pawar (40), his three accomplices Karbhari alias Bapu Gholap (37), Arun Nagre (35), Prabhakar alias Sham Tambe (25) all from Badnapur. During the course of investigation, assistant inspector Survase found that the even Meenabai’s husband Mansaram went suspiciously missing in February 2012. On further questioning, Meenabai confessed that her husband Mansaram had learnt about her illicit relations with Santosh and so they together decided to eliminate Mansaram. Police said that duo have confessed to offering a cold drink spiked with sleeping pills to him while they were on the way back from a marriage in Khultabad. Later, they took help of Santosh’s accomplices and strangulated Mansaram to death in a jeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-nab-woman-for-getting-her-husband-eliminated-9-yrs-ago/articleshow/83013218.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Dehradun||'Animal sacrifice to be stopped at Champawat's Ma Shila Devi temple'||Pithoragarh: The temple committee of Ma Shila Devi shrine in Champawat's Machiyar village has decided to "ban animal sacrifice and alcohol consumption on its premises". Those found violating will be fined Rs 5,000, the committee has stated. The temple is around 7 km away from Sikh gurdwara Ritha Sahib and is revered by over 50 villages in the area. Villagers usually sacrifice their animals here and the decision was reportedly taken as people use the space to also prepare food, particularly, on the banks of the nearby river Ladhiya and then litter the place. Some of them were also found consuming liquor, sources said. "Empty bottles, plastic rugs, bones and remains of animal carcass can be often seen lying along the river bank," said Deewam Singh, chairman of the temple committee. "People are polluting the river and the environment around the villages. Some individuals are also illegally selling and consuming alcohol," he added. So, the temple panel has decided to preserve the environment around the temple, said Bhagwan Ram, a local resident. "Felling of trees at the temple premises and its surrounding areas will be prohibited," the resident added. "It was also decided that every year the temple priest will be selected through a draw of lots," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/animal-sacrifice-to-be-stopped-at-champawats-ma-shila-devi-temple/articleshow/83015413.cms||Prem Punetha

The patient, 63-year-old businessman Mohammad Hamim, had oxygen saturation level of 75% and was severely infected with bilateral interstitial pneumonia with sugar fluctuation ranging up to 600 mmol/L. He had failed to find any bed with ventilator in his native district of Gopalganj or state capital Patna after which his son Dr Yusuf Iqbal brought him to Lucknow. With his father free of infection now, Dr Iqbal has written a ‘thank you’ note to the doctors, nurses and paramedics at the DRDO hospital for saving his father’s life. “The tsunami of the second wave in the last week of April had hit my village Balhan hard. I had lost my aunt because of corona. Since medical infrastructure in Gopalganj was poor, with insufficient oxygen beds and ventilators, I decided to get treatment for my father at home. We managed to stabilize his condition by May 9. However, his co-morbidity deteriorated his health on May 10. I attempted to find a bed in Patna but in vain. My cousin, who is in the army, suggested that I take my father to the military-operated hospital in Lucknow,” said Dr Iqbal who has completed his MBBS in 2020 from Jamia Hamdard. “The distance was over 450km, but I took a chance. Since I was not sure my father would be admitted in the DRDO hospital, I attempted to contact other private hospitals in Lucknow too, but all of them refused. I was emotionally broken seeing my father gasping for breath in the back seat of the car. Finally, on May 11 around 8 pm, I reached the DRDO hospital and after a few queries, the staff admitted my father,” said Dr Iqbal. Brig Girish Chandra Gulati, the nodal officer of the hospital, said, “We have never turned away any patient. Hamim was in critical condition when he was brought here. We had to shift him to ICU, as diabetes was complicating his health parameters. However, our staff took care of the patient and on May 23, he was discharged. Later, Dr Iqbal left a thank you note, for which we are grateful.” “Had I stayed back in Bihar, I wouldn’t be alive today. The armed forces medical staff gave me a second life,” said Hamim, who is steadily recovering at home now. Dr Iqbal said, “I attempted to express my gratitude to doctors, nurses and paramedics in my note but it’s not enough. From changing a patient’s diaper to medical support and free of cost service, it has no match anywhere.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/25-year-old-bihar-doctor-drives-450km-to-get-father-admitted-to-drdo-hosp-in-city/articleshow/83019818.cms||Arvind Chauhan

While some shifted pavement-dwellers to safe shelters, others distributed clothes, tarpaulin sheets, dry food and medicines much before the cyclone made landfall on Wednesday. A group of students in College Street even fed street dogs. Quarantined Student Youth Network, a group of students from several colleges and universities who have been helping the less privileged since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, shifted close to 100 pavement dwellers to a government school on Tuesday. “We did not know how the cyclone would behave after the landfall, but we know what happened after Amphan hit the state last year. So, we did not want to take any chances. We immediately shifted more than 100 people — mostly children and women — into a government school. The students arranged for dinner and milk for children. Since it has been raining now we have kept them there,” said Sayan Chakraborty, a Quarantined Student Youth Network member. Sofia Khan has been distributing food to people in distress since restrictions came into effect from May 16. “On Tuesday and Wednesday, we did not stop the distribution due to the cyclone but reached out to more people so that nobody went to sleep hungry. We have also been distributing essential items among the less privileged,” said Khan, the founder of Sufi Humanity Foundation, a philanthropic enterprise. Due to the restrictions, eateries are only allowed to cater to home delivery orders. Street dogs who mostly survive on residual food from these eateries have been struggling.“On Tuesday and Wednesday, we prepared enough food to feed around 40 dogs in College Street, Mahatma Gandhi Road and Surya Seen Street,” said Tripti Banerjee, a student of Presidency University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-aiding-people-to-feeding-dogs-citizen-groups-weather-the-storm/articleshow/83017717.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Aurangabad||Kharif season may slow down vaccination in rural areas||Aurangabad: Different preparations related to imminent Kharif season may slow down the Covid vaccination drive in rural areas as the immunization programme is currently largely limited to Primary Health Centres (PHCs) only. These PHCs are remotely located for many farmers. Farmers’ leader Jayaji Surywanshi said that the vaccination booth must be set up in every village to immunise the farming community. “Many PHCs are located far from villages and hamlets. Farmers, especially women agricultural workers, find it difficult to take out time for vaccination. Government intervention is, therefore, must considering rural areas also exposed to Covid-19 outbreak now,” he said. Raising apprehensions about poor vaccination coverage among rural population, a teachers’ body roped in for the vaccination drive among other Covid duties has also requested the government authorities to enhance the drive across every village. “The fear observed earlier with the vaccination has withered away gradually now. However, the Kharif preparations coupled with the limited availability of doses may deprive many farmers and rural population from vaccination,” Kailas Gaikwad, a member of teachers body Shikshak Sangh, said. Aurangabad district is likely to have cultivation of Kharif crops over increased 6.81 lakh hectare area for upcoming season with sowing of Tur and Soybean along with of maize and cotton, among other crops. Aurangabad ZP CEO Dr. Mangesh Gondawale said that the dearth of vaccine doses presently was proving a roadblock in expansion of immunization drive in rural areas. “The vaccine supply is limited and there are plenty already in queue. So, village-level vaccination is not possible as of now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/kharif-season-may-slow-down-vaccination-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83013249.cms||Prasad Joshi

This can be complied with by pilgrims if the gap between doses is reduced from 84 days to around 30,” said Yusuf Ahmed Kherada of Al Khalid Tours and Travels. He said initially the government had allowed a gap of 28 days, increasing it to 45 and then 84 days. The advisory said only 60.000 pilgrims from across the world will perform Haj, around July 20 this year. Around 15,000 will be domestic pilgrims, while the rest will be international, , including around 5,000 Indians. “Since most Muslims began taking jabs after the end of Ramzan (May 12), and there has been a shortage of vaccines for first and second dose, it will be difficult to find pilgrims fully vaccinated before they leave for Haj unless the gap between jabs is reduced from 84 to 20 days,” said Imran Alvi of Alvi Tours. Haj Committee of India is informing pilgrims to get fully vaccinated. “We are awaiting a communication about India’s quota. We are informing applicants (58,000) that only pilgrims aged 18-60 will be allowed and all have to be vaccinated. We don’t know how many will qualify as vaccination in India for the 18-44 age group started only in May,” said committee CEO M A Khan.

With the video going viral, several public figures, including Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel, took to social media demanding action against policemen involved in the alleged thrashing. The man seen in the video has been identified as Shivraj Naryalwale and is district secretary of BJYM. He can be seen getting thrashed by Jalna police’s team led by deputy superintendent of police Sudhir Khiradkar and senior inspector Prashant Mahajan of Kadeem Jalna police station. Deshmukh told TOI, “26-year-old gym owner Darshan Dewawale was seriously injured in an accident and was admitted to Deepak hospital where he died on April 9, following which Naryalwale, along with his supporters, ransacked the hospital and broke into the ICU where several critical patients were undergoing treatment.” Based on the complaint lodged by hospital’s security staffer, some unidentified suspects were booked under relevant section of Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of violence and damage or loss to property) Act – 2010. When contacted, inspector Mahajan said, “At the time of ransacking by the mob, there were 70 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment. Through their acts, suspects were directly posing threat to the lives of patients in the hospital.” He also questioned the reason for delay of 47 days in lodging complaint. Citing the police records, Deshmukh said that the suspect seen in the video was earlier nabbed by the police in a raid on gambling den. “We do not support such thrashing by police and have ordered a probe into the incident by additional superintendent of police,” said Deshmukh while stating that he has received an official complaint only on Thursday after the video went viral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/video-of-cops-beating-jalna-bjym-office-bearer-goes-viral/articleshow/83013283.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Around Rs 2.5 lakh was spent on the treatment, but he could not be saved,” sources said and added that the kin of the deceased started exerting pressure on the doctor to return the money. However, when the doctor did not listen to their pleas they planned the attack, the sources added. Police commissioner, Lucknow, DK Thakur said that the police have got substantial leads in the case.

CTI convener Brijesh Goyal said markets and factories in Haryana and Gujarat were being reopened on certain conditions as cases were reducing. “Traders here also have requested the government to allow opening of markets and factories,” he said. There are speculations that the Delhi government will relax the lockdown and permit some economic activities from Monday. The final decision will be taken towards the end of the week. Goyal added that the Delhi government had adopted a balanced approach by reviewing the Covid situation every week. “Since the current lockdown is expected to expire on Monday, we conducted this survey covering 560 traders’ organisations”, he said. CTI vice-president Navdeep Malhotra said that of the 560 organisations, 450 said that markets and factories should be opened in Delhi from June 1. “Some associations, however, suggested that the lockdown should be extended by one week...while some others said they will comply with the decision that the government will take,” CTI treasurer Sudhir Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/80-of-traders-want-lockdown-eased-survey/articleshow/83017835.cms||---

Thursday's meet was headed by state president Madan Kaushik. BL Santosh, appointed as the party's national general secretary (organisation) earlier this year, was present. It has also been decided that the party’s grassroot workers would reach each village, even the remote ones, to ensure containment measures are in place against the virus. Manveer Singh Chauhan, the party's media in-charge, told TOI that youth wing presidents were given targets aimed at ensuring Covid containment steps reach the villages. “The BJP Yuva Morcha has been asked to 'run my village corona-free' and 'my booth corona-free' campaign from June 1 to 12. All fronts were asked to regularly communicate with people at the booth and divisional levels. Party workers have also been asked to make a list of Covid warriors who must be felicitated. It should include people from all walks of life,” Chauhan added. At the team meeting, Santosh said there is a need for a serious plan to stop the migrants from returning home during the Covid wave. At the same time, it was decided that the service work carried out by the party's organisation will continue till the end of corona. Kaushik said that state general secretary Suresh Bhatt will be made in-charge for the service campaign in the village on May 30. He will inform all MPs, MLAs and office bearers their specific tasks. “CM and ministers will not participate in the service campaign in person due to Covid guidelines,” Kaushik added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-core-panel-meet-dedicate-upcoming-month-in-felicitation-of-covid-19-warriors/articleshow/83015415.cms||Ishita Mishra

His brother Surendra Singh Jeena, who passed away in November last year due to Covid-19, was a three-time legislator and had won from the Salt assembly constituency on two occasions. After his demise, the BJP gave the ticket to his brother Mahesh, who defeated Congress candidate Ganga Pancholi. After taking the oath, Mahesh said, “I will try to complete the works started by my brother and live up to the expectations of the people of Salt and Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, political developments have recorded an uptick in the state as three by-polls are scheduled in the state in the next few months. With Tirath Singh Rawat being made the CM, the Pauri Lok Sabha constituency has fallen vacant and he needs to win an assembly seat before he completes six months in office i.e before September 10. Meanwhile, the death of Gangotri MLA Gopal Rawat in April this year due to cancer has also necessitated a by-poll but the CM is unlikely to contest from the constituency as he would prefer a seat from his home district of Pauri. Some legislators from Haridwar, Pauri and Chamoli districts have expressed their willingness to vacate the constituency in favour of the CM. “CM’s traditional assembly seat is Chaubattakhal but tourism minister Satpal Maharaj is unlikely to leave it. While party MLAs of different districts have offered their seat, CM Rawat is likely to prefer a Pauri constituency,” political analyst Jay Singh Rawat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mahesh-jeena-takes-oath-as-salt-mla-3-by-polls-likely-in-ukhand-in-next-few-months/articleshow/83015449.cms||Kautilya Singh

As per the division of work between the accused duo, Nawab was responsible for selling off stolen bikes to gullible people from rural areas at throwaway process. Authorities said that the detection was the result of idea floated by deputy commissioner of police Nikesh Khatmode-Patil, who identified the list of places, including Jama Masjid area, Buddhilane and Shahgunj vegetable market, which reported high number of vehicle thefts for the past few months. Accordingly, a police team was deployed for 23 consecutive days at these spots, before the police team arrested Gauskhan red-handed while he was lifting a bike.

Four workers, Tanmoy Ghosh (32), Subrata Ghosh (30), Amit Sen (28) and Swarup Das (38), were feared trapped inside a hosiery factory that was gutted and they could not be traced even after 18 hours of firefighting. Six gas cylinders kept inside the factory reportedly exploded, causing the fire to spread to the adjacent medicine godown and later a chemical factory. Sixteen fire tenders were pressed into the service to douse the flames. However, the fire could not be controlled till the last reports came in. The officials from disaster management, fire brigade, cops and factory workers were all involved in the firefighting operation. According to locals, the fire broke out around 2.30am on Thursday at the hosiery factory housed in a three-storey building at Bilkanda industrial belt in New-Barrackpore. They alleged that the factory was still operating in violation of the restrictions put in place since May 16. The state fire brigade minister, Sujit Bose, rushed to the spot to supervise the firefighting operation. sSeveral cracks developed in the building, where the hosiery factory used to run, due to the fire.

Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said that all the demands made by the junior doctors were justified and that the state government should encourage them. BJP’s state unit president Bandi Sanjay also expressed support for the doctors’ cause and added that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should ensure that junior doctors across the state have a hassle-free atmosphere for work. Speaking on the rise of black fungus cases in the state, Kishan Reddy said that before Covid-19, black fungus cases were very limited in the country, claiming they were in the single digits. “Now, the cases (of black fungus) have increased. Eleven companies have been asked to manufacture the requisite drugs and we hope that around three lakh injections will be available by the end of this year,” Kishan Reddy said and expressed confidence that the vaccination programmed in the country will be a success by end of January next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-should-be-more-considerate-towards-junior-docs-bjp/articleshow/83019390.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Consumers shocked with mega water bill||Hyderabad: Consumers across Greater Hyderabad and its periphery were in for a shock after the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) issued water bills with added arrears of five months in one go. Welfare associations and residents of gated communities and even owners of individual homes have claimed that they have received bills in the range of Rs 2,500 to Rs 25,000. The water board has calculated the total amount based on water consumption from December 2020 to April 2021 and issued the bills. “I was shocked after receiving my bill issued by the water board, charging Rs 20,000 in one go. In my building, there 22 flats and every month we would pay around Rs 4,000 but the water board has issued us this inflated bill without any prior intimation,” the secretary of Golf View Enclave in Uttam Nagar, told TOI. Following a government order (GO) pertaining to 20kL free water scheme in December 2020, the water board had stopped issuing monthly water bills to consumers within GHMC and peripheral areas. It had stated that consumers wanting to avail the 20kL free water scheme have to link their Aadhaar with the consumer account number (CAN) by March 31. The board had extended the deadline till April 30 after it received a lukewarm response from consumers. “Over 40 per cent consumers have come forward for Aadhar linkage. Nearly four lakh out of the 11.8 lakh consumers had availed the facility by April 30. Even now, the water board is allowing consumers to link their Aadhar to avail free water scheme,” a senior water official told TOI. Meanwhile, a general manager with the water board’s O&M Division-V, B Mahesh Kumar, informed that the board had repeatedly appealed to consumers to utilise the facility to link their Aadhaar, have water meters installed in order to benefit from free water supply. Kumar explained that the consumer will get ‘zero bills’ from the date of Aadhaar authentication. “In case the consumer has failed to do it (link Aadhaar and CAN) within five months — the deadline given by the water board — he/she has to pay bills for all five months,” he said adding that as soon as a consumer completes the Aadhaar linkage, the water board’s records will update automatically but till then the system will show the entire water consumption. Another water board official said that for non-domestic consumers, they are issuing monthly bills as the free water scheme is meant for domestic consumers only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/consumers-shocked-with-mega-water-bill/articleshow/83019626.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government hikes pay, junior doctors withdraw strike||HYDERABAD: Patient services were badly hit at Gandhi Hospital, Telangana’s nodal Covid-19 nodal hospital on day two of the strike called by Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) over better wages and facilities for their kin. The strike was eventually withdrawn late in the evening. Gandhi Hospital took the maximum brunt of the strike, seeing several delays and impact on patient services as there were a handful of doctors present at key wards. In addition to Covid-19 patients, the hospital is now seeing more admissions of mucormycosis cases. “Patients were neglected. There were around 30 admissions of mucormycosis patients on Thursday as compared to 22 Covid-19 patients. There were delays in medical management of such cases,” a top hospital source said. “Covid-19 patients who are co-morbid and ones on insulin could not get medications on time as only a handful of nurses were managing the wards. There were no doctors around,” the offical added. Slight delays in administering injections, daily rounds and medications were seen in other government tertiary care centres too, with doctors staging protests and boycotting duty for some hours. However, the impact was not as severe at these centres as doctors resumed OP services after a few hours. Junior doctors and senior residents staged protests across tertiary centres like Gandhi Hospital, Osmania General Hospital, TIMS, Kakatiya Medical College and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Adilabad among others. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has now backed TJUDA’s demands saying these are genuine demands. While junior doctors were reluctant on Wednesday to call off the strike despite assurances by the government as their demands were only partially met, they decided to call off the strike after marathon negotiations with state health authorities for the second day in a row on Thursday. “Keeping in view of patient’s health as our priority and also our responsibility to serve them in present pandemic crisis, we T-JUDA are calling off the strike and will report to duties from 9 pm,” TJUDA said in a statement. The government issued formal orders enhancing stipend of junior doctors by 15 per cent, which was one of the key demands. “We express our gratitude to our CM and health authorities for addressing stipend hike for interns, post graduates, super specialty post graduates, senior residents and allocation of beds for doctors and their family members in NIMS Hospital,” TJUDA immediately said. The only issue that was not completely addressed was about ex-gratia for healthcare workers who lost their lives due to Covid-19. “Health officials have given us verbal assurance that an alternative for ex-gratia will be discussed with the chief minister. We hope that this issue will be addressed,” said Dr V Naveen, president of the TJUDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hikes-pay-junior-doctors-withdraw-strike/articleshow/83019369.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Early ENT check-up must to detect mucor, say doctors||HYDERABAD: Black fungus or mucormycosis is not a post-Covid-19 complication but there is every reason to be alert from the day one tests positive, say experts. The latest guidelines issued by Indian Medical Association (IMA) say it is better to go for a complete ENT verification within 30 days of testing positive. The ENT check up is necessary as those infected have low immunity, besides other factors that could lead to mucormycosis. IMA’s latest guidelines say that black fungus is not really a post-Covid-19 complication. However, it is better to get ears and nose checked up on the first day after being tested positive, and also on the seventh day as a follow up. According to regional medical director at Dr Agarwal’s Eye Hospital, Dr Gaurav Arora, the type of mucormycosis seen in India is known as rhyno-orbito cerebra. “In this type, the fungus reaches the nasal track, then to the eyes. And eyes being part of the brain, it leads to health damage.” Dr Arora said the popular conception that mucormycosis happens only after recovery is not true. It can happen any time when the immunity is compromised. “For the same reason, IMA has issued guidelines that ENT check up has to happen even on the first day. We suggest ideally everyone should get an ENT check up. It is compulsory for everyone with co-morbidities,” he said. “Fungus can hit any time, not just after recovery. With low immunity and usage of steroids, it only gets worse,” the doctor added. Doctors said that before the pandemic, the infection used to be seen in people with cancer, renal failure, HIV+ patients and severe diabetics. “Now, there is an increase by at least 10 times, and mostly associated with Covid-19 as immunity gets compromised,” Arora said Doctors have also been observing an early onset of the infection. “It is observed that there are some cases of mild infection early on, hence an ENT check up in the early days is better,” said Dr Kiran Madala, associate professor, Nizamabad Government General Hospital. Superintendent of the state-run ENT Hospital, Dr Shankar, said that early identification of mucormycosis makes the treatment manageable. “It is better to identify the symptoms and take medical help early, so there is no need of fear,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/early-ent-check-up-must-to-detect-mucor-say-docs/articleshow/83019431.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Moderate rainfall (22.3-55.3mm) was witnessed in south-western districts like Buxar, Rohtas, Aurangabad, Arwal, Gaya, Jehanabad and Nalanda. Similar intensity of showers was witnessed in West Champaran in northwest Bihar and Vaishali in central Bihar. Patna witnessed 34mm rainfall between 8.30am on Wednesday and 5.30pm on Thursday. Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said the city received 38.5mm rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Thursday. Gaya, on the other hand, recorded 68.8mm rainfall, Purnia 36.6mm and Bhagalpur 28.7mm. The turbulent weather also led to suspension of flight operations at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport here from 5pm on Thursday to 9am on Friday. Weathermen said the impact of the cyclone would be felt till the next 24 hours and yellow alert was issued by Patna Meteorological Centre for heavy rainfall (64.5- 114.4mm) in entire northwest and few districts of central Bihar, including Patna, Vaishali and Saran. Districts in northwest Bihar like West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Siwan and Muzaffarpur are expected to receive heavy rainfall,. Weathermen have attributed the light to moderate intensity showers to remnants of the very severe cyclonic storm, which originated in the form of a low-pressure area over east-central Bay of Bengal on May 22 and had made landfall in coastal Odisha on Wednesday morning. It had weakened into a deep depression as it reached near Ranchi in neighbouring Jharkhand by Thursday afternoon. The IMD, in its all-India bulletin issued at 8pm on Thursday, stated that deep depression over south Jharkhand moved northwards with a speed of about 9kmph during last six hours and weakened into a depression. The system is very likely to move northwards and weaken into a well-marked low pressure area in the next 12 hours, it said. “Yaas has weakened into depression and situated over Jharkhand and adjacent places in Bihar. It is expected to weaken further and move in northwest direction and get positioned in Bihar and adjacent eastern Uttar Pradesh by Friday. Light to moderate rainfall is expected across Bihar and heavy rainfall at one or two places over the next 24-48 hours,” Kumar said. He added winds would blow at maximum speed of 30-40kmph over the next 24 hours. “Warning has also been issued for lightning at some places in the district over the next 24 hours. Some low-lying areas may also witness waterlogging,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cyclone-yaas-drenches-bihar-showers-may-continue-today/articleshow/83017959.cms||Piyush Tripathi

---||Hyderabad||Only 30% black fungus patients at Telangana ENT Hospital have diabetes||HYDERABAD: Amid the rising cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) at the Government ENT Hospital, officials said the infection is increasingly being seen among non-diabetics. According to officials, only 30% patients with black fungus, under treatment at the government facility, are diabetic. “There have been many cases with no history of hospitalisation, steroids, oxygen support, who are non-diabetic and were in home quarantine but still contracted black fungus. The mutant strain of the virus is responsible for decreasing immunity and making patients vulnerable to black fungus,” said Dr Manish Gupta, resident medical officer at Government ENT Hospital, the nodal centre for mucormycosis treatment which has seen nearly 400 cases so far. Inhalation of fungal spores present in the environment which can get embedded in the nasal mucosa, sinuses or respiratory tract can result in the infection if the immune system is not healthy. When the immune system is suppressed or there is damage to the lungs — as seen in severe cases of Covid-19 — fungal spores can grow in the sinuses or lungs, can invade deeper tissues and spread to the brain. In immunocompromised individuals such as those who are obese, have diabetes, cancer, are transplant patients or HIV positive, black fungus infection can become life-threatening. However, increasing instances of the infection in younger and otherwise healthy recovered Covid-19 patients have caused doctors to believe there are other reasons. “Many Covid patients had started taking medicines through self-prescription with no monitoring or control of sugar levels. Some also resorted to home remedies. Additionally, unhygienic lifestyle habits such as using the same mask several times without discarding can lead to several complications and attract black fungus,” added the ENT Hospital RMO. Meanwhile, state health authorities on Thursday said there are 44 private hospitals in the state that are currently treating 278 mucormycosis patients. They said the state has planned to streamline the process of getting the antifungal injections for private hospitals. Patients under treatment at private hospitals will still be required to apply to the state government to get Liposomal Amphotericin-B — the main antifungal injection used in treatment — but other antifungal injections can be directly purchased by hospitals from manufacturing companies. “Currently there is a shortage of only liposomal amphotericin-B injection which hospitals need to apply online to the director medical education,” said Telangana public health director, Dr G Srinivasa Rao||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-30-black-fungus-patients-at-ent-hospital-have-diabetes/articleshow/83019519.cms||Amrita Didyala

Not only heavy rain but even high tides led to the flooding. This caused loss of valuable mahogany trees that the British had planted here for wood required to build ships. Finally, in 1890 two sluice gates were set up on the eastern frontage of the Garden to escape the wrath of the Hooghly. This was not enough. A network of 24 water bodies was created, so that water from the Hooghly could be flown in through the sluice gates into them. The excess, after the lakes were filled, could be flown out as the sluice gates were shut when the water level of the lakes reached the optimum point. Wednesday’s flooding of Howrah happened because of the high tides at Hooghly but it is this 131-year-old technology that saved the Garden on a day when the authorities were extremely tense about the Yaas outcome. The high water of the Hooghly was flown into the 24 lakes as the sluice gates were opened, leaving the Garden safe. Initially the British would close and open the gates manually and thereafter a steam engine was deployed. Recently, keeping the technology unchanged, the gates have been semi-automated for opening and closing. “The gates and the network channels were so scientifically made that they operate smoothly even today and saves us during such crisis,” said Garden head, Kanad Das. A three-hour long inspection of the Garden was done by botanists on Thursday morning to check if the strong wind circulation during Wednesday’s cyclone had left any impact on the Garden. “We were very worried about the 300-year-old Great Banyan Tree that was severely damaged during Amphan. A wide gap measuring 20 metres in diametre was caused and the tree is still being healed. However, the mud embankments that we have given it this time has helped to firm up the tree,” Das said. Not a single tree has been affected, he asserted. Big mud mounds have been created around ancient and weak trunks to prevent swaying. Hundreds of bamboo support networks have also been created for the weak branches and bamboo stilt feet have been given to train the young prop roots to the ground. “We also fear a fungal attack from the portions, wounded by Amphan and have applied Blytox, an anti-fungal, already. However rain washes it off and we are keeping a close watch on any outbreak,” Das added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/b-garden-uses-131-yr-old-tech-to-prevent-flooding-save-trees/articleshow/83017827.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Therefore, we have sought help from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to carry out an awareness campaign along with us,” said SInnar taluka medical officer Dr Mohan Bachchhav. There are many misgivings among people. Some people fear that a person may die after taking the shot, or contract the infection and become critical etc. “When our medical professionals try to explain the benefits of the vaccine, some people are convinced, but many still refuse. Some even run away when they see our staff approaching,” Dr Bacchav said. To change this picture, the health department has now launched a campaign. The NGOs — Save The Children, and Pune-based Centre for Youth Development Activity (CYDA) — are carrying out the awareness campaign in the villages along with the health department. Volunteers from the NGOs go to the beneficiary homes or the vaccination centres and spread awareness. They also help in crowd management and the vaccination registration process. “Our volunteers travel with the health officials to assist them in crowd management and in persuading people to get vaccinated. They help people understand the concept in the local language to remove all fear and misgivings linked to the vaccination process,” Dhananjay Dighe, the project manager for Sinnar, said. “We are working with the administration in 20 villages and the scenario is started changing slowly in the villages visited over the past week,” Dighe added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/yes-to-vax-no-to-ventilator-drive-turning-the-tide-in-sinnar/articleshow/83013327.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While consumers have to spend Rs 15 to Rs 18 per kg for tomatoes, Rythu Bazars are selling them at a lower price. Horticulture officials said at one of point the state had to completely import the produce from other states and price even touched Rs 100 per kg. But the scenario is different now. “I was quite surprised today when I found prices have dropped so much. I bought 5 kilos of tomatoes and I plan to make some homemade sauces,” said Jyothi Rajan, a resident of Bnajara Hills. During the last lockdown, the farmers procured for Rs 16 to Rs 19 per kilo but this year the prices have come down with bumper crop and more suppliers. “I have invested Rs 2 lakh per acre and got produce of 30 tonnes each acre but the price drop has resulted in me losing around Rs 14 lakh of my investment,” said K Ramesh Reddy, a farmer from Vikarabad. The state also gets supplies from neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh. This season, only 500 acres of tomato was under cultivation but with more innovation methods, Telangana government has encouraged the cultivation in 5,000 acres. While there is more supply than demand, the transport charges also are making farmers lose more on each box of tomato. For each box of tomatoes, it takes around Rs 60 for transportation while other grading charges will cost around Rs 40. “We don’t have anything for us. In fact, it is better not to transport the produce from fields” said another farmer, Yadagari Y. Earlier, when there was a shortage of supply in the state, there had come a time when farmers got as much as Rs 50 per kilo in wholesale market. However, now not only are farmers at a loss, even the consumer isn’t reaping much benefit from the lower prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tomato-prices-plummet-as-lockdown-enters-13th-day/articleshow/83019566.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Mumbai||7 killed, one injured in 2nd building crash in Ulhasnagar in two weeks||Ulhasnagar: The city of Ulhasnagar, notorious for its illegal constructions, witnessed another building collapse when part of a ground-plus-four storey residential block, Sai Shakti, crumbled at around 10pm on Friday, killing 7 people. The dead were identified as Krishna Bajaj, Dinesh Chandwani, Mohini Chandwani, Punit Chandwani, Deepak Chandwani, Lovely Bajaj and Namrata Bajaj. This is the second collapse in Ulhasnagar this month —barely two weeks ago, Mohini Palace had collapsed, killing five people. On Friday night, the fire brigade and rescue team reached the spot soon after the crash, and efforts were on to rescue those still trapped in the debris of the building that contained 29 flats. Most residents managed to rush out in time, while others were pulled out with the help of locals. At the time of going to press, one injured person was pulled out of the rubble, said rescuers. It is learnt that a slab in the hall of a fourth-floor flat collapsed right down to the ground floor. UMC chief Raja Dayanidhi said the building was not on the list of dangerous buildings. The UMC spokesperson said it was among the many buildings that came up in the mid-1990s and which were constructed using inferior quality sand.The latest tragic incident led to panic in Ulhasnagar, where in the last 10 years, more than 50 buildings have collapsed, killing many. “Sai Shakti building was also constructed in the 1994-1995 period, during which buildings were constructed using inferior Ulve sand,” said civic officials. Ulhasnagar is home to a large section of Sindhi refugees, and the city has faced the tragic spectre of a building collapse almost as an annual ritual. The bulk of constructions here are flagrantly illegal, mostly built in the 1990s with the connivance of authorities. The use of inferior sand and construction of buildings beyond the permissible limit has been rampant, said local residents. Attempts to raze illegal structures were blocked by a law enacted by the then Congress-NCP government in 2005, allowing for regularization of illegal buildings. However, since then, very few buildings have applied for regularization owing to the steep penalty. There is now a growing demand from residents on the state government to appoint a special committee to resolve technical problems related to the redevelopment of buildings to stop such tragedies. In the last decade itself, over 2,000 people have become homeless and have been forced to live on a rental basis after at least 50 buildings either collapsed or got sealed by UMC due to their dilapidated condition. Local sources said only one of these 50 ill-fated buildings has been redeveloped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/7-killed-one-injured-in-2nd-building-crash-in-ulhasnagar-in-two-weeks/articleshow/83050610.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The high-value medicines required will be provided through the civil hospital on case to case basis,” Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of Nashik said.The government hospital include SMBT, Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre (VPMCHRC), Civil Hospital, Malegaon General Hospital. While Sahyadri Hospital, Wockhardt Hospital, Six Sigma Hospital and NAMCO Charitable Trust are among the private hospitals.People below the poverty line and those who are left alone to fend for themselves get saffron or yellow ‘ration’ cards issued by the district supply office (DSO) under the Public Distribution System (PDS).The treatment cost of the disease for those bearing the card will be footed by the state government under the MJPJAY scheme. The Amphotericin B injection is a costly injection required to treat the patient and it is not easily available in the market, especially when the district collector has taken over the distribution and allotment of the injections to the patients in the private hospitals only after a procedure is followedIn cases, where the patients are admitted under the MJPJAY, the hospitals concerned have to place a demand with the civil hospital with all the required documents including that of the patient and then the medicine would be made available by the hospital based on the stock available.People who have any issues in getting across the MJPJAY empanelled hospitals – especially for the mucormycosis cases, can call on 18002332200 or contact the MJPJAY cell at the civil hospital||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/8-nashik-hospitals-to-treat-black-fungus-under-mpjay/articleshow/83013382.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||U’khand’s only central university gets notice from information commissioner for ‘continuously failing to give apt response to RTI queries’||Dehradun: Taking cognisance of a complaint lodged by a former student of Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal Central University (HNBGU), who claimed to have missed two attempts of the PCS exam as the university delayed his results for over two years and did not respond to repeated RTI queries filed by him, the Uttarakhand information commission has issued a notice to the university’s chief public information officer (CPIO). Terming it’s “very unfortunate” that students have to opt for the RTI route to redress their study-related grievances, information commissioner Saroj Punhani said, “This shows the casual approach by HNBGU in dealing with the RTIs that tantamounts to causing unwarranted obstruction to the RTI and is also in gross violation to the provisions of the RTI Act.” The commission, in its order, a copy is also with TOI, maintained that it is baffled with the fact that no reply was provided by the CPIO in response to the instant RTI application within the time frame as prescribed under the RTI Act in several cases. “The CPIO has been directed to send his written explanation to a show-cause as to why action should not be initiated against him under Section 20 of the RTI Act,” the commission’s notice reads. According to the complainant, he had sought information from HNBGU via online RTI, in which he had asked for "the results of LLB students to the roll numbers' list (annexed)". He had also asked that “why the results of the students named in the roll list have been delayed for the past one year and who is responsible for the harassment, the loss of time, life and the damage done to the students.” Having not received any response from the CPIO, the appellant filed a first appeal on June 14, 2019. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the non-receipt of information, the appellant then approached the commission. Talking to TOI, Ankit Rawat, the complainant, said “Although my final semester exams were held in May 2018, the result was delayed by two years. Therefore, I suffered a career opportunity loss as I could not write PCS (J) for two years due to the negligent approach of the university’s RTI cell and lack of digital knowledge of the RTI officers in dealing with the online application.” Rawat claimed that despite filing multiple RTI applications, apart from the one in the question, no reply was ever provided within the stipulated time. Besides, the representation made to the VC was also not responded to, said Rawat, adding that the university’s “website also does not have the updated details of CPIO and FAA, and their contact details”. When contacted, HNBHU CPIO Rawat, who is also the exam controller, said he had not received a copy of the notice, and hence, would not be able to comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhands-only-central-university-gets-notice-from-information-commissioner-for-continuously-failing-to-give-apt-response-to-rti-queries/articleshow/83015490.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Kolkata||Frequenters offer help as coastal belt hotels stare at deluge of loss||Kolkata: Citizens from Kolkata, who frequently travel to weekend destinations like the mangrove islands in the Sunderbans or seaside locations in East Midnapore, have launched a campaign to help the owners of resorts and hotels that have been badly hit by Wednesday’s cyclonic storm Yaas. Though the cyclonic storm did not directly hit the coastal areas of Bengal, the storm surge it caused inundated most of the hotels in Sunderbans’ islands like Mousuni and Frazerganj as well as Digha, Mandarmani and Tajpur in East Midnapore. Though most hotel owners are yet to assess the damage, they fear it may take several seasons to mitigate the losses. Sensing the problem, a section of weekend travellers from Kolkata has come forward to commence a pre-booking campaign starting with as little as Rs 1,000 for a night so that owners and staffers at some of their favourite hotels can receive some help. Started through Facebook and Twitter initiatives, these travellers are asking fellow travellers not to suggest any pre-book dates, unsure about how long the Covid situation will continue or the time that hoteliers might need to get their hotels back in shape. Moumita Patra from one such Facebook group — Weekend Tours From Kolkata — have urged the tourists to lend the affected hoteliers a helping hand. Ratnabali Sarkar pointed out that these coastal hotels must take a cue from how hotels in Puri rebuilt themselves after cyclone Phani. Several tourists believe that “unplanned construction and cutting of trees to build roads” could be behind the calamity. The damages at some hotels are worth lakhs, its owners and managers said. In Digha and Shankarpur, at least 300 hotels closer to the beach came directly under the effect of the cyclone and spring tide. In Tajpur and Mandarmani, roofs of several nature camps and resorts were blown away and the rising sea water damaged room walls and furniture. “Such has been the situation of most resorts here that even if the restrictions are relaxed, it would be difficult to accommodate tourists anytime soon,” said Biswajit Das of Tajpur Nature Camp. Among the worst affected was Dreamhut Resort whose videos have gone viral after the cyclone. Almost all the 60-odd resorts and nature camps at Mousuni island in South 24 Parganas were devastated or washed away. “Half of my resort’s property is under water and the rest has been devastated by the raging sea waves. I don’t know how I can rebuild it,” said Monirul Islam, a resort owner at Mousuni. “We had removed the tents prior to the landfall of the cyclone but the buildings have crumbled and water has flooded our premises. It will take years for us to overcome these losses,” said Subhrangsu Bhandari, who runs a nature camp at Mousuni as well as G Plot in Patharpratima.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/frequenters-offer-help-as-coastal-belt-hotels-stare-at-deluge-of-loss/articleshow/83017868.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Not one NHAI road with good plantation, says Gadkari||Nagpur: Nitin Gadkari, union minister for road transport and highways, on Thursday admitted not a single road constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was perfect when it comes to roadside plantations. The minister urged the NHAI officials to engage experts for tree plantations to follow green highway policy. “Plantations along the road were a must to maintain ecological balance and curb pollution,” he said. Gadkari was virtually addressing the two-day ‘International conference on resource sustainability - Sustainable pavement technologies (icRS SPT-2021) hosted by IIT, Tirupati. The minister called the experts to come up with an alternative to steel and cement to construct low-cost highways, which were the need of the hour for our country. “During the last financial year (2020-21) NHAI constructed 13,000km highways and in the next five years, we have a target of 60,000km. Plans are afoot to construct 22 greenfield expressways. Country’s first 14 lane highway has already been thrown open for traffic in Meerut,” said Gadkari. For road development, the highways ministry will promote unconventional modified pavements such as asphalt-rubber, polymer composites, fibre-reinforced concrete, rubber-modified concrete, mixtures with construction and demolition wastes, recycled asphalt, and recycled concrete aggregates, the minister said. Gadkari said, “The country generates 100 million tonnes of construction waste and we are devising a plan to use this in road development.” He also stressed on the need for water conservation through pits dug for extraction of construction material like murrum. In Buldhana, such an experiment was successful, he said. “We have submitted a proposal to the PWD to implement the Buldhana water conservation model while constructing roads. The NHAI has also issued guidelines to use 8% of plastic waste in road development,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-one-nhai-road-with-good-plantation-says-gadkari/articleshow/83017873.cms||---

The STF, which comprises, several private medical practitioners along with the senior officials from the government establishment and headed by the civil surgeon, said the medicines were costly and there were fewer manufacturers of the specialized medicine as a result of which the shortage could not be ruled out. During the normal course of time the medicine – which is costly, is sold below the maximum retail price. But when there is a shortage, all of a sudden the prices increase, which further affects the people.“The pattern was observed during the treatment of Covid and mucormycosis when the rate of the remdesivir and tocilizumab for Covid and amphotericin B for mucormycosis skyrocketed as the shortage was felt. No parent would like their child to have health issues and complication. Hence the administration should take the steps,” said Dr Ravindra Sonawane, the president of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP), Nashik branch.The medicine, immunoglobulin, is costly as the maximum retail price is above Rs 14,000 now. He said not every child would require the medicine as this was to be used only in critical cases. It is observed that less than 1% of the children admitted in critical cases require medicine. “Though the number is small now in case the wave affects the children – as being discussed – then the number could go up and we have to be ready for the eventuality,” Sonawane added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/keep-medicines-required-for-kids-ready/articleshow/83013424.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Several people who reached the vaccination centres on Thursday were returned by the health department. According to officials, the district, which has a population of more than 21 lakh people, has just 90 vaccine doses left. A request has been sent to the state for more vials and the inoculation will be resumed soon, say officials. Dr SK Jha, CMO, Haridwar, told TOI, “The vaccination drive was stopped on Thursday as we do not have enough vaccines and we have sent a letter to the higher authorities demanding more doses. I hope the district will get a sufficient number of vaccines soon. Subsequently, we will resume the inoculation drive.” The official added that the vaccination drive for those above the age of 45 years is ongoing. Meanwhile, city locals have complained that the health department did not give any information regarding the shortage of vaccines. Yagnik Verma, a Haridwar resident, told TOI, “People reached vaccination centers after registration only to find that there was no vaccine. Nobody informed us about the shortage of vaccines. The district administration should inform the people beforehand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccination-drive-halted-due-to-shortage-of-vaccine-for-18-to-45-age-group/articleshow/83015503.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Lucknow||KGMU swings into action to counter probable 3rd wave||Lucknow: As the vaccination of those below 18 years of age is yet to be undertaken and around 95 per cent in this category have not been exposed to Covid in the second wave, they are at the utmost risk during the third wave which might hit the state in October. According to experts, 40% of the cases in the third wave will be of patients below 18 years of age. Based on these estimates and taking lessons from the pattern of the third wave in countries like Japan and Singapore, the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has initiated steps to set up a strong defence mechanism which will be ready by mid-August. “Children below 18 years of age got affected in the first and the second wave too, but not in very high numbers. However, based on the experience of countries hit by the third wave we can say that around 40 per cent in this age group might get affected in the state. Most in this age group have not developed antibodies naturally or through vaccination and hence the presumption,” KGMU’s paediatric department head Prof Shally Awasthi told TOI. “But it is also true that children don’t have the burden of comorbidities and their general immunity is higher than adults. Thus, the impact will be mild and fewer patients will need hospitalisation. Still, we have started preparation for it,” she added. KGMU itself is readying up its 100-bed paediatric Covid wing in the psychiatric department and has also started facilitation as an expert group for setting up paediatric ICUs across the state. Prof Awashti as incharge, the university will be taking online and hands-on training of healthcare staff and has also proposed links between district hospitals PICUs and closest medical colleges to the state government. “We want to ensure that there will be no shortage of beds, oxygen, medication and other requirements for children. Proposal includes virtual training modules, linking of district hospitals with medical colleges and to run a 25-bed PICU with trained staff for Covid care,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-swings-into-action-to-counter-probable-3rd-wave/articleshow/83020047.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Chartered flights up 50% at IGI since September||NEW DELHI: The current Covid wave has seen a sharp rise in the number of private jets and charters being handled at the Delhi airport’s separate general aviation (GA) terminal that opened last September. Till the onset of the second wave, it used to handle over 20 flights a day, but now this number is almost 50% higher at 35. The key reasons behind this jump are air ambulance movement, suspension of schedule commercial flights by some countries and the super rich preferring the safety and enhanced hygiene of leaving on their own jet plane instead of taking regular flights to places where the option is still available. This is in sharp contrast to the massive fall in both domestic and international travellers that’s forced Delhi and Mumbai airports to shift all their passengers to just one terminal each. “India’s first exclusive GA terminal for private jets was opened last September. On average, it witnessed 35 aircraft movement (ATM) per day during April as compared with 24 ATMs at the time of opening of the terminal. It saw about 1,000 aircraft movement last month,” said Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL). The operator of IGI Airport added its GA terminal had handled over 100 air ambulance flights since April, “contributing to the surge in demand”. Rajan Mehra, CEO of Club One Air and former India head of Qatar Airways, said India had seen a significant growth in charter travel since last October. While earlier charter business used to be 70% domestic and 30% international, the restrictions on foreign flights has now changed it to 50:50. “The exclusive GA terminals in Delhi and Mumbai have incentivised several first-time travellers to choose charters. Passengers now want to avoid the crowds of terminal buildings and prefer the spaces available to them in private terminals,” Mehra said. The IGI terminal has been “a game changer in this pandemic time. There are no queues, minimum interface with others and a very short distance to cover before they reach the aircraft”, he added. Since DIAL has now commissioned exclusive immigration and customs counters at the GA terminal, more passengers are using private jets for their international travel too. People who would earlier travel first and business classes in commercial airlines are now turning to charters, despite the cost differential. “They would want to ensure the safety and hygiene of their families above the budget factors and would happily pay the extra cost,” Mehra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chartered-flights-up-50-at-igi-since-sept/articleshow/83017893.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The incident took place after a senior citizen member of the Kandivli family succumbed to Covid-19 at the hospital. The police have seized the licensed revolver and five rounds. No arrest has been made yet. The police said the 85-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital on May 7 after she tested positive for Covid-19. On Tuesday night, she died. The family members claimed that when they went to claim her body, but the hospital insisted that they pay the medical bills first, which infuriated them. But the hospital cashier, Prashant Khaire, told the police that the argument started when the family said they wouldn’t clear the bills of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. Khaire told the police that the family created a ruckus in the hospital, verbally abused and assaulted and one of them brandished a revolver and threatened him. An FIR was registered under IPC sections 323, 504 and 506 (ii).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-pull-revolver-on-hosp-cashier-in-bill-row-after-covid-19-death/articleshow/83017909.cms||---

Retailers Association of India, which has borne the brunt of local lockdown and poor consumer sentiment sought in a memorandum to extend renewals of existing permits/ and licenses for one year, relax compliance requirements of retailers to pay MSME suppliers in 45 days’ time till March 2022, asked government of India to pay PF contribution of both employer and employee (12% each) till September 2021 for all employees earning less than Rs 15,000 a month, besides seeking relief on property tax and electricity charges. The Association also sought extension of benefits of ECLGS 3.0 to retail companies and asked for a moratorium on principal and interest for 6 months. Exporters also joined in. “Like last year we seek waiver of penal interest on loans, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) payments for 2019-20 and April to December 2020. We also seek enhancement of working capital limits,” said Mahesh Desai, chairman, Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC) India. Tirupur Exporters Association’s president Raja M Shanmugham wrote to the finance minister seeking a moratorium for all existing loans of three months, extension of ECLGS loans to SMA-2 accounts also, extend additional liquidity support of 20% so as to quickly get revival of the MSMEs in ready made garments (RMG) sector and also simultaneously protect the labour sector. He also sought the extension of interest equalisation scheme for three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-lockdown-impact-chorus-gets-louder-for-stimulus-package/articleshow/83017888.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Ahmedabad||No dine-in, restaurateurs irked||Ahmedabad: In the recent revision of guidelines issued by the state government, restaurateurs have little relief as dine-in continues to be prohibited by the state administration. Restaurateurs are little relieved because an hour’s cut in curfew timing will provide them with some relief when catering to customers, as order volumes are expected to go up. “Most orders pour in during the evening time and therefore, an hour’s extension will certainly help. However, one size fits all policy does not apply to restaurants. People go to plush fine dine restaurants for the experience and ambience along with the food and their takeaway volumes will be minimal. We expected that some relief would be provided to restaurants by allowing them to start with dine-in services,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, Gujarat. While takeaway services are providing restaurants with some cushion in terms of revenue to help keep their business running, it adversely impacts their margins. “People come to enjoy a thaali and food being served to them. Takeaways don’t work for our kind of business,” said the owner of a restaurant in the city that serves thaalis. “On top of this, each takeaway order received from food-delivery apps takes out a chunk of our revenue as commission,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-dine-in-restaurateurs-irked/articleshow/83017882.cms||---

We have clear transparency reports, when we comply with government requests, we highlight that in our transparency reports,” Pichai said. The Google CEO said that a free and open internet is “foundational”, and that India has long traditions of that. “As a company, we are very clear about the values of a free and open internet and the benefits it brings and we advocate for it, and we engage constructively with regulators around the world, and we participate in these processes, I think it’s a part of how we learn.” He added that the company respects the legislative processes, and in cases where it needs to push back, it does so. “It’s a balance we have struck around the world.” Pichai noted that technology is touching society in deeper and broader ways and the landscape is evolving at a fast pace. “So, we fully expect governments rightfully to both scrutinise and adopt regulatory frameworks. Be it Europe with copyright directive or India with information regulation etc, we see it as a natural part of societies figuring out how to govern and adapt themselves in this technology-intensive world,” he said, adding that Google engages constructively with regulators around the world. The new IT rules for social media companies, which came into effect from Wednesday, are aimed at making platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram and Google more accountable and responsible for content hosted on their platforms. The rules, which were announced on February 25, require social media players to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer. Google has previously stated that it has consistently invested in significant product changes, resources, and personnel to ensure that it is combating illegal content in an effective and fair way, and complies with local laws in the jurisdictions it operates in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/always-respect-local-laws-says-google-ceo-sundar-pichai/articleshow/83023753.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Restore industrial oxygen supply’||AHMEDABAD: With the reduction in Covid-19 cases across the state and subsequent drop in consumption of oxygen for medical purposes, industries want the supply of oxygen for industrial usage to be restored. Citing that the demand for medical use of oxygen for Covid-19 patients has gone down substantially, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Thursday wrote to the Union home ministry urging the government to restore supply for the industries. “There is an urgent need to lift the ban on oxygen supply to industries. Due to the imposed ban, industry is suffering huge financial loss and the workers and labourers working with such industries are migrating,” the industry body said in its representation. “We request you to lift the ban completely or allow 70% of the total supply to be diverted towards industry, to reduce financial burden on industries, especially MSMEs,” it added. Echoing similar views, Ship Recycling Industries Association of India (SRIA)’s secretary Haresh Parmar added, “The government should start restoring supply of oxygen for industrial purposes. Despite having surplus oxygen now, the suppliers are unable to cater to the industry as the government’s mandate of providing 100% oxygen for medical purposes only is still in force.” Oxygen is a key ingredient for cutting and dismantling ships beached at the world’s largest ship breaking yard in Alang, Bhavnagar. “The ship-breakers have suspended their work for 50 days now for want of oxygen. The government should review the situation and allow whatever surplus oxygen is available to be used by the industry. Even if the surplus is 10% or 20%, it will be a great help if the same is allowed to be consumed by the industry,” he added. “The industry is ready close down again if the need for medical oxygen arises,” he said. He also demanded that the government should come out with a special relief package for those industries which could not function for the lack of oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/restore-industrial-o2-supply/articleshow/83017902.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Housing societies keen on getting vaccines from pvt hospitals||Nagpur: With some big private hospitals set to receive vaccines from manufacturers by June first week, many housing societies are seeking a tie-up to conduct exclusive Covid vaccination camps for their members. Such camps would largely benefit people with special needs and elderly who were otherwise dependent on government centres and till last month on private hospitals for vaccination. The enquires are in addition to those from corporate houses and private entities.However, private hospitals are yet to make any commitment due to lack of clarity from government and local authorities.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the civic body was ready to take everyone’s contribution for implementing vaccination drives as per guidelines. Recently, BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation permitted housing societies and offices to tie-up with private hospitals for Covid vaccination. The civic chief said, “It can be done. We will explore it and issue necessary guidelines. But right now, the remaining beneficiaries are from low income groups. Let us first focus on them.” The NMC has so far followed examples of other big cities for starting initiatives like drive-in camp and vaccination at your locality. Dr Sadashiv Bhole, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said that they have received lots of enquires for mass vaccination. “Even small housing societies are approaching us for holding a drive on their premises. But we can’t commit till we get the vaccines. Also, the activity must be done as per guidelines,” he said. Dr Bhole claimed they have resources to vaccinate 500 to 1,000 in outdoor camps. “For people with special needs, it will be beneficial. As part of society, we have to vaccinate as many as possible,” he said. Sengupta Hospital director Dr Shantanu Sengupta said clear guidelines in this regard are awaited. “We too are getting queries from many companies. They are trying to procure vaccines on their part as well. We have to get a clear indication from the government if this can be done,” he said. Dr Tushar Gawad, director-Administration at Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said they have received multiple enquiries from corporates for exclusive association as well as on-site vaccination. “We have placed orders directly with manufacturers as well as through AHPI and are expecting supply by first or second week of June. However, continuity of supply is a concern which will only be addressed by increase in production.” he said.Delivery of vaccines is a major issue, mainly for hospitals who have only one centre. Those with multiple centres or pan India presence have been able to procure the vaccines far easily as compared to others. Civic officials said the bigger the order size, the early hospitals will get the delivery. But it remains to be seen what response they get as it will be paid vaccination with one dose said to be around Rs850 to Rs1,250 depending on the type of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/housing-societies-keen-on-getting-vaccines-from-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/83015612.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||A day after cyclone, state inoculates more than 1.5L||Kolkata: Vaccination drive regained pace on Thursday, a day after Yaas hit parts of Bengal. Main reasons for the drive getting a short in its arms are expanding the programme to the 18-44 category and also re-launching the first dose to recipients which had been restricted only to healthcare and frontline workers since May 1. Even as many government vaccination centres had not closed its drive on Wednesday people did not turn up fearing of getting caught in the middle of the cyclone. The state administered only about 60,000 doses on Wednesday. But the number of doses administered on Thursday was around 1,57,000 till reports came in last. “We started offering first dose to the priority group within the 18-44 age group from Wednesday and first dose to 60-plus recipients from Monday. But again due to the rains the footfall was not that encouraging. But we are hopeful of the drive regaining momentum once the weather condition gets better,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhay, vaccination coordinator at ID Hospital Beliaghata.According to a KMC borough executive health officer, the turnout at the KMC CVCs was much lower because of rains. Despite the rains, the number of doses administered in Kolkata also went up from a mere 1,640 on Wednesday to nearly 15,000 doses on Thursday.NKDA resumed its drive from Thursday. After the Centre’s decision to raise the gap between two Covishield doses to at least 12 weeks, NKDA has been giving first dose to 60+ senior citizens along with frontline workers and hawkers in New Town for a week now. The inoculation was suspended last Sunday as precautionary measures of the impending cyclone. KMC is engaged in a minor change of a WhatsApp chat bot before it resumes Covishield first dose for recipients of 45-plus age group. Recipients can register their names using the KMC WhatsApp chatbot (8335999000) from Friday (11am onwards).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-after-cyclone-state-inoculates-more-than-1-5l/articleshow/83017890.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Lucknow||Common minimum syllabus: DUTA backs stand of LU teachers||Lucknow: Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) has extended support to the demand of Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) of not implementing the common minimum syllabus (CMS) as it is against the rights of teachers to frame syllabus. On Monday, LUTA had written a letter to Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who is also the state higher education minister, requesting not to implement CMS as it is not at par with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and not in students’ interest. The higher education department had drafted the CMS for state universities last year after the Union government framed NEP and directed state universities to include 70% of the content prescribed in CMS in their syllabi and have 30% content of their own. Former executive council member DU and former joint secretary DUTA, Rajesh Jha, while talking to TOI, said, “All teachers of Delhi University support LUTA. CMS is adopted nowhere in the world. Even in best universities like University of Cambridge, England, and University of Oxford, England, don’t teach similar syllabus as both have their own expertise, identities and academic strengths.” “Same syllabus means murder of curioustiy of teachers and students. Syllabus evolves over time, hence restriction of adopting 70% syllabus framed by the government should not be imposed,” he added. DUTA vice-president Prof Alok Pandey said, “Universities and colleges in Delhi, UP or any other state still don’t have the required infrastructure for the adoption of NEP or to provide industrial training to run skill development courses, hence a common syllabus cannot be adopted since every academic institution varies in its academic strengths and resources.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/common-minimum-syllabus-duta-backs-stand-of-lu-teachers/articleshow/83020079.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Places which received significant showers included Gaya (68.8mm), Bhagalpur (28.6mm), Purnia (20mm), Aurangabad (26.5mm) and Jamui (30mm). At Gaya, moderate to heavy rain occurred throughout the day since morning, causing waterlogging on some roads in the town. Also, the water level in the Falgu rose due to heavy downpour in Jharkhand. The rainwater flowing down the hills in Jharkhand reaches Falgu after Neelanjana river in Dobhi. A dam has been made at Ghoraghat in Dobhi block of Gaya to stop the water flowing from Jharkhand and use it for irrigation purpose in nearby villages. Junior engineer Sanjeev Kumar and agriculture coordinator Anand Mohan have been deputed as magistrates for Ghoraghat dam to keep vigil on the situation. Besides, other officials, including Gaya executive engineer of water resources department, Dobhi BDO, CO and the SHO have been asked to remain in constant touch with the magistrates. ADM (disaster management) has been asked to keep NDRF and the SDRF teams ready for deployment in any crisis situation. In Bhojpur, DM Roshan Kushwaha has asked civil surgeon and executive engineer of South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited at Ara and Jagdishpur to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Ara Sadar hospital, sub-divisional hospitals and primary health centres to ensure functioning of life-saving equipment without disruption. The DM has also asked Bhojpur civil surgeon to coordinate with private hospitals and keep alternative power supply arrangements in ready mode for government as well as private hospitals. The civil surgeon has also been asked to keep ambulances in ready mode to deal with any eventuality. Ara Municipal Corporation and nagar panchayat officials have been asked to keep pump sets, earthmovers and generators ready to clear waterlogging. In East Champaran district, 10 trees were uprooted in Motihari, Raxaul, Chakiya, Areraj and few other places due to gusty winds. A young couple riding a bike were killed on Motihari-Turkauliya road near Kathiya when a roadside tree uprooted and fell on the motorcycle. Light to moderate rainfall occurred in West Champaran district since early morning. Gandak canals of water resources department, which originate from Valmikinagar, were closed in view of the cyclone.

Rajbahadur Yadav, a migrant worker in a textile unit, was caught by the traffic cop near Gabheni crossroads close to Sachin GIDC on the highway. Ironically, the challan issuing cop wrongly cited The Motor Vehicle Act instead of the Gujarat Police Act. The challan shows offence under section 184 of MV Act - driving dangerously. Senior officials later confessed that the section mentioned is wrong. “I was going to work on my bicycle and was on the wrong side near Gabheni crossroad when the traffic cops stopped me. They issued the challan and asked me to appear in court and pay the fine,” said Yadav, a native of Uttar Pradesh who lives in Pandesara area with his family.  Yadav earns Rs 400 per day and is worried about paying the fine as he did not go to work in the first half of the day. “I don’t know how serious my offence is but I will have to take a day off to pay the fine now. I did not know that even a bicycle rider can be fined like this,” Yadav told TOI. Yadav’s relative Raj Yadav said, “I have seen for the first time that a bicycle rider is penalized for driving on the wrong side.” Meanwhile, there was anger against police as the photos of Yadav with challan went viral. But police claim they have been penalizing bicyle riders on this road to prevent fatal accidents.  Traffic police officials also claimed that riding a bicycle on the wrong side is punishable. “A bicycle rider cannot ride on the wrong side and one can be penalised under the GP Act. The action by the cop on duty was correct but the section mentioned is wrong,” said H D Mevada, assistant commissioner of police, traffic.  When asked if police can stop people from going on the wrong side instead of issuing challan, he said, “A large number of people often ride on the wrong side so we have to start penalizing them. It is a dangerous stretch and driving on the wrong side leads to fatal accidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-on-cycle-challaned-for-dangerous-driving/articleshow/83013631.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The current reserve price was due for revision in March 2021. Cidco says this will help land owners and developers during these tough times. For the past one year, the real estate sector has been severely affected due to economic recession brought about by pandemic and prolonged lockdown. “It is a welcome move. The real estate will get a boost now,” said Rajesh Prajapati, founder president of MCHI-CREDAI, Raigad. “Taking into consideration the present economic crisis, we have decided to freeze the reserve price of land in Navi Mumbai and surrounding areas.

---||Mumbai||City reports 924 Covid cases, lowest daily count in 87 days||Mumbai: While Mumbai on Friday recorded its lowest number of Covid-19 cases in 87 days, Maharashtra is staring at another grim milestone: the highest ever monthly toll for any Indian state due to Covid-19. Covid deaths for the month of May are likely to touch 25,000 on Saturday, making the month the deadliest so far since the outbreak of the pandemic. Maharashtra has recorded 24,385 deaths in May so far, just 615 short of the 25,000 mark. The entire pandemic toll of the capital Delhi, one of the worst-hit regions in the second wave, is around 23,000 so far. Although Maharashtra has added 19,295 deaths as part of its daily addition, over 5,090 additional deaths have been added to the cumulative toll in the span of 12 days as part of a reconciliation exercise. The highest deaths earlier—13,835—were reported in the month of April 2021. Mumbai’s Covid case graph dipped below 1,000 on Friday after March 2, when 849 cases were detected. On Friday, the city health authorities added 924 cases and 30 deaths, taking the cumulative tally since March 2020 to 7.02 lakh cases and toll to 14,750. Mumbai also recorded one of its lowest test positivity rates—3.1%—with 29,573 tests conducted in a 24-hour period. The city’s positivity rate has been below 5% since March 24. “The Covid-19 situation in Mumbai has improved. Beds in every category, be it regular, oxygen-support or ICU, are available in most public as well as private hospitals,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital, who is the coordinator of private hospitals with the BMC. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell in the state government’s public health department, said, “Many more people were affected in the second wave than during the first. Hence the deaths are likely to be higher as well.” The second wave has affected double the number of people than the first in Maharashtra. However, Dr Awate said despite the higher number of deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) is lower during the second wave. “CFR was over 2.5 in September last year, but it is around 1.5 these days,” he said. Meanwhile, the state reported 20,740 cases on Friday, taking the total caseload to 56.9 lakh, and 424 fatalities were reported and 549 old deaths added, taking the total death toll to 93,198. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that though daily positivity rate of the state was in single digits and it was steadily on the decline, “we have directed all districts to ensure that they are not randomly testing people to report a drop in positivity. Tests have to be conducted on targeted population – high- and low-risk contacts of a positive patient.” He also said that for better management of Covid patients and to reduce fatalities, especially in rural areas, districts have been asked to ensure home quarantine is discouraged. On a positive note, active cases in the state dropped below 3 lakh and were fewer than the highest active cases reported in the first wave. The state had reported 3.01 lakh active cases in September 2020. On Friday, it had 2.8 lakh active cases.

---||Ahmedabad||How Amdavadis can turn the tide on third wave||AHMEDABAD: The second deadly Covid wave taught us how without support from strangers, neighbours and friends for oxygen support, medicines, hospital bed availability information, ambulances the pandemic could have been much worse. Now, just as the government begins relaxing the curfew, similar public support to increase mask compliance and induce behavioural change among Amdavadis will be required to keep the third Covid wave at bay — especially when children and young adults are at risk. Experts suggest all measures be put in place — from free mask distribution in houses, at religious places, and markets; endorsements by community leaders; promotion of the masks through videos and brochures in vernacular languages to appeal to different communities. “In short, one should be making sure that people understand that everybody in the community, the young, the old and children get masks and everyone is expected to wear them to protect each other,” says a senior community medicine expert at NHL Medical College. The expert also suggested deployment of “monitors” who will walk around public places and gently intervene when people aren't wearing masks. “In Bangladesh, if a person didn’t have a mask or couldn’t go home and get one, the monitor at the market place offered a free surgical mask. Monitors will regularly go to neighbourhoods and reinforce the idea of safety offered by masks,” said the NHL expert.  Experts have also suggested how Resident welfare Associations (RWAs) could prove to be of assistance in the city. Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNHA) president Dr Bharat Gadhavi says that the time for pleas is over, “As a society we lack civic discipline. Wearing masks, physical distancing, ensuring ventilated indoors are basic ways we can bring down Covid infection. We should begin now. People who refuse to abide by rules should have their government documents seized.” Public health expert IIPH-Gandhinagar director Prof Dileep Mavalankar believes that the state and municipal authorities should revive the Information Education and Communication (IEC) wing for health communication. “In the 1970s we had the IEC Gujarat accomplish polio, smallpox vaccination through unique messaging. A similar strategy with a community-based approach is the need of the hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/how-amdavadis-can-turn-the-tide-on-third-wave/articleshow/83018029.cms||Paul John
---||Delhi||BJP seeks Rs 1 crore for all Covid warriors||New Delhi: Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Thursday claimed that nearly 500 Covid warriors had succumbed to the infection but the AAP government had recognised only a few of them and given their kin Rs 1 crore as compensation. “The government initially recognised doctors, nurses, lab technicians, paramedical staff and others working in hospitals, including sanitation workers, as corona warriors, but later this category was expanded to include police and civil defence personnel, principals and teachers. It was announced that the kin of everyone in these categories would be given compensation in case of their death,” said Bidhuri. According to Indian Medical Association, 103 doctors had died of Covid-19, he said. “It is unfortunate that Delhi government is creating its own list. Last year, 33 police personnel lost their lives and this year almost 25, but Delhi government has not given compensation to 15 of them last year. Only three people have got compensation this year,” Bidhuri said. He urged lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to get a list prepared under his supervision and ensure compensation for all. No reaction was available from Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-seeks-rs-1-crore-for-all-covid-warriors/articleshow/83017942.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Thursday, additional sessions judge V V Parmar rejected pre-arrest bail filed by PSI Janak Brahmbhatt and a women head constable, Shardaben Khunt. They had claimed innocence and argued that they should be given the protection of provisions of Section 197 of the CrPC, because they acted in the case in line of their duty.However, public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt vehemently opposed the anticipatory bail applications and termed the offence as a conspiracy to extort money from people, who would feel ashamed to come out in the open to file complaints against the extortionists. He submitted that first there was a complaint against four persons, who used to fix dates with the victims on social media and then accuse them of sexual assault and extort money. They got support from the police officials. But when the complaint was filed, investigation revealed involvement of police officials also in the extortion racket.After hearing the case, additional sessions judge V V Parmar said, “It seems to be a very well-planned designed to extort money by misusing social media in creating close proximity with different persons and also by misusing the police department. It needs to be mentioned here that such kind of incidents are on increase in the society and it is utmost necessary to curb this menace and to maintain deterrence in the society and therefore, no leniency is required to be shown towards the applicant. This Court deems it fit and proper that custodial interrogation of the applicant is a must looking to the tactics adopted by the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/honey-trap-extortion-racket-court-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-two-cops/articleshow/83017919.cms||---
---||Lucknow||In Varanasi, youths help girls cope with menstrual challenges||Lucknow: To help girls in rural UP cope with challenges associated with menstruation amid the Covid crisis, a group of youths across 281 villages in Varanasi’s Sewapuri block have joined hands. The young girls and boys will address issues like unavailability of menstrual hygiene material, stigma that intensified with the presence of too many family members in crammed homes, health issues like missed periods or menstrual cramps caused by stress during lockdown, and clear doubts and fight myths around the subject. Sewapuri block is very dear to PM Narendra Modi and he has expressed a desire to get the cluster developed into a model on various counts of governance including health, education, sanitation and infrastructure and girl child empowerment. “While the demand and supply chain has been disrupted, expenditure on menstrual hygiene has been on low priority in many villages. Decreased income due to loss of jobs has aggravated the problem. Many girls are suffering because of this,” said Madhushree Pandey, director of Sarthak Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation working on health issues in and around Varanasi. The foundation was engaged by Varanasi district administration to mentor the 281 youngsters. Unicef’s UP office is providing technical support for the project. “The youth leaders or volunteers have formed a Seva Dal to address different issues related to adolescents. Menstrual hygiene has gained centrestage during the pandemic. We are supporting young girls in this crisis situation. The teams keep in touch on social media to clear doubts and reach out to those in need,” said Shivani Mishra, a volunteer. “While awareness on menstrual hygiene is mandatory, including sanitary hygiene products among essential commodities can help. The girls also need to be provided facilities for disposal with privacy and dignity to mitigate stigma,” said Kumar Bikram, a Unicef official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-varanasi-youths-help-girls-cope-with-menstrual-challenges/articleshow/83020119.cms||Shailvee Sharda

According to the complaint lodged by the rape survivor’s mother before Nikol police, the alleged incident had happened last year, but the teenage girl did not inform the family members about it following threats from the accused. The accused was sent to custodial interrogation after his arrest and upon being sent to judicial custody, he sought regular bail claiming innocence. The assistant public prosecutor N R Lodha opposed the bail plea and argued that the accused might tamper with the evidence, if released on bail. He also submitted that releasing the accused on bail in this case would send a wrong message to the society and people would not fear the law. After the hearing, additional sessions judge V J Kalotara said that looking at the gravity of the offence and the punishment provided for it, the court did not think it fit to grant bail to the accused in this case.

Chandrapur led the chart with over 8,300 inoculation in the day.

This would benefit around 18 lakh students enrolled in madrassas. These institutions will have the freedom to choose from various social media platforms for online tutorials. UP minority welfare minister Nand Gopal Nandi cleared the UP Board of Madrasa Education’s proposal for online classes from standard 1 to postgraduate level. UP has about 16,000 recognized madrasas, including 560 government-aided ones. “Until madrasas can’t resume classroom teaching, proposal for starting online classes has been approved. Covid cases in UP are on a steady decline and the pandemic has hit education hard. Online classes will make up for the loss in syllabus. These classes will begin with immediate effect,” said Nandi. Madrassa Board registrar RP Singh told TOI that the proposal was sent to the government after UP Board was allowed to hold online classes for its students from May 20. “During the last year’s lockdown too, we had held online classes for some months. The proposal has been approved and online classes will begin within a week,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-nod-to-online-classes-in-madrassas/articleshow/83020168.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Nagpur||With cases, Covid-19 testing too dips in dist||Nagpur: The district on Thursday recorded 476 Covid-19 positive cases, nearly 200 cases less than that on Wednesday, while deaths remained at 16. But the fatalities in the city increased to eight after remaining under five for last two days in a row. Nagpur rural reported four deaths and four patients from outside district also succumbed while taking treatment here. There were 1,151 recoveries while active cases dipped to 9,072.There is a sharp decline in daily testing too. The low turnout has been attributed to less number of high-risk close contacts and less number of people suffering from common flu-like illness. Generally, the testing numbers spike when people develop symptoms of cold , cough, sneezing or fever which are akin to Covid-19 and necessitate testing. On Thursday, the testing numbers dropped to 12,991. This was probably the second time in 72 days when testing fell below 13,000. On May 15, 11,611 tests were conducted mainly due to festive season impact on the turnout at centres. On March 15, the labs in district had performed 13,364 tests, including 9,308 from city and 4,056 rural. The testing numbers started increasing from the next day, with 15,000 samples being examined for RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests. The highest-ever testing was recorded on April 17 (29,053). This included almost equal number of tests in rural (14,448) and in city (14,605).Till date, 27.48 lakh tests have been performed in the district. This is close to half the population of district but it can’t be assumed that same number of citizens have been tested. Initially, same suspects/patients were tested more than once. Also, the figures include healthcare workers and professionals who have to go for repeat testing. It took nearly 11 months, from March 2020 to February this year, to conduct 12.45 lakh tests. Between March and May, 14.94 lakh tests were done in a span of just three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-cases-covid-19-testing-too-dips-in-dist/articleshow/83015702.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

According to a civic official, the pre-monsoon work normally begins in April and gets over by May 31. The delay in completing road repair work causes more harm than good and leads to traffic congestion.

If roads are found dug up, action would be initiated against those responsible, the official said.Only emergency and essential work is allowed during the monsoon. These include water and electricity supply. Work like laying of utility lines and cables must be completed before the arrival of the monsoon. The work is monitored not only by the road department, but also by 15 ward offices, said a senior civic body official.“We have given instructions to local ward officers and asked them to maintain strict vigil. Anybody found violating rules will face action. The decision to file criminal offence will be taken on case-to-case basis,” said Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner, PMC.Work related to road restoration, cleaning of storm water drains and nullahs, which started late due to delay in issue of tenders, can be carried out till June 10.The PMC has issued 22 tenders for cleaning nullahs, each costing around Rs65 lakh. Each ward office has issued tenders worth Rs15 lakh.The civic data shows that 236 major and small nullahs are located in PMC area. Their length is around total 526 km.

Long queues of cars were seen not just within but outside the ground on Thursday morning where paid, drive-through Covid vaccination for people above 18 years of age began, with on-the-spot registration. The vaccination drive is a joint initiative by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and a private city hospital, Apollo Hospitals. Civic authorities did not divulge details on how many people were vaccinated on the first day. “Private hospitals in Ahmedabad have been empowered to procure vaccines from manufacturers on their own. Since we learnt about a certain private hospital to have procured vaccines at their own cost, AMC has only facilitated the drive-through facility on payment basis so more people can be vaccinated,” said Bhavin Solanki, medical officer of health, AMC. This is above the 242 vaccination centres across the city where 35,000 people are getting vaccinated every day, for free. “With this, people in Ahmedabad who are financially capable can pay for their own vaccination and get vaccinated easily. This will also enable people easily get slots for vaccination at the other centres where they can get their shots for free,” Solanki further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/serpentine-queues-seen-for-paid-vaccination-as-well/articleshow/83018023.cms||---

The residents of Hudkeshwar, Narsala and surrounding areas have to travel quite a distance to either Manewada or Gangabai Ghat for cremations.Some local Shiv Sena leaders including Vishal Korke, Mukesh Revatkar, Mahadev Kuhite among others on Thursday reportedly opened the locks of the Narsala crematoria and announced it was “now open for use”.The Rs 1.23 crore crematorium was built on 0.5 acre land sanctioned by the Devendra Fadnavis-led government. The project was executed by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s Hanuman Nagar public works department and completed in December 2020. However, it is yet to be handed over to the health department (sanitation).It took almost four years for the project to complete, said sources. However, there are still works including electrification and garden pending, said sources and blamed the zone’s PWD for the delay.Sources said the land for the crematorium was already earmarked when Narsala was a gram panchayat. After it became a part of the city, the then guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule provided funds for its development.Despite repeated attempts, Hanuman Nagar zone’s executive engineer Avinash Barahate was not available for comment.A senior official from the health (sanitation) department confirmed the delay. The official claimed they too have been following up with the zone. “Since the last couple of months, we have been asking them to complete the remaining work and hand over the premises to our department so we can start the facility,” he claimed.Shiv Sena city president Nitin Tiwari alleged the crematorium has been waiting for inauguration and had caused inconvenience to the citizens in this part of the city.Residents also met local BJP corporators Swati Akhatkar, Bhagwan Mendhe, Vidya Madavi and Leela Hatibed. They showed no interest in starting the crematorium, alleged residents.

The four were brought here and formally arrested this (Thursday) morning. We produced them before a court, which remanded them in police custody till May 30,” Pimpri Chinchwad’s police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. On how Siddharth and his aides managed to travel to various places despite the prevailing Covid restrictions that mandate an e-pass for inter-district travel only for essential purposes, Krishna Prakash said, “It is not possible to check every vehicle on the highway. The police check suspicious vehicles. The suspects may have used transport vehicles to travel. We shall interrogate them. We are probing the case without any political pressure.” Siddharth was involved in a heated verbal exchange with Tanaji Pawar, a retired CRPF staffer working as a supervisor with a waste management firm in Nigdi, over the appointment of two of his men as drivers for the company’s garbage collection vehicles. The police said Sidhharth and his supporters had gone to the firm’s office on May 11 in search of Pawar and assaulted few employees there. The following day, he forced Pawar to visit the MLA’s office in Chinchwad for discussing the issue. The duo, the police said, had a heated argument, following which Siddharth and his men assaulted Pawar and the latter opened fire in self-defence from his licensed firearm outside the MLA’s office. No one was injured in the firing but Siddharth’s men allegedly thrashed Pawar and he had to be hospitalised, the police said. The Nigdi police registered an FIR related to the May 11 incident at the firm’s office and the Pimpri police registered separate FIRs — one against Siddharth and his 18 aides on the charge of attempt to kill Pawar and the other against Pawar for opening fire. The Pimpri case against Siddharth and his men was later transferred to the Nigdi police. The police chief said, “Siddharth had gone missing after the registration of the two FIRs. We conducted searches in Pimpri Chinchwad, Solapur and Satara districts, but he was not traceable. Assistant inspector Laxman Sonawane got an information that the suspects were hiding in Uran in Raigad district. Before our team reached there, they had fled. To divert the attention of the police, they pretended going towards New Panvel.” He said the police teams found that they were heading towards Ratnagiri district after reaching there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-mlas-son-3-aides-nabbed-from-ratnagiri/articleshow/83018018.cms||Mihir Tanksale

While senior party leaders are providing free oxygen concentrators, oximeters, nebulisers, glucometers and immunity boosters to Covid patients who cannot afford these equipment, others are distributing ration and food packets to daily wage labourers rendered jobless because of the curfew. Launched at the instance of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in April, when the former CM had asked the party cadres to reach out to the needy in their respective areas without violating the Covid curfew restrictions, the party leaders were supplying ration and medicines to the people free of cost. However, the drive gained momentum after the panchayat polls when SP chief asked the party winners to celebrate their victory by not taking out victory processions and instead help the needy. While state president of SP backward cell and MLC Rajpal Kashyap distributed foodgrains and fruits to the needy by organising camps on the IIM Road in Lucknow, SP candidate for Sarojininagar seat assembly elections in the 2017 polls Anurag Yadav handed over oxygen concentrator, dozens of oximeters, glucometers and nebulisers to KGMU for Covid-19 patients. Reports said MLC Udaiveer Singh held special camps in and around Firozabad district to distribute foodgrains, vegetables, fruits and medicines to the poor. Similar camps were held in Sitapur by MLC Anand Bhadauriya and in Unnao by MLC Sunil Singh Sajan.

Praveer Gupta, 30, a resident of the College Compound area in Palanpur, said his father got infected with Covid on April 22 and was admitted to Palanpur Civil Hospital for around five days. After being discharged, he had a severe and constant headache. On May 5, he was first admitted to a private hospital in Palanpur and was diagnosed with mucormycosis. From the Palanpur hospital, he was shifted to the Asarwa Civil Hospital in the city on May 14 and then to a private hospital in Naroda on May 16, where he was operated on. As doctors advised Gupta to arrange for liposomal amphotericin B injections, Gupta began inquiries with friends and relatives. Gupta said one of his friends, Arun Raval, a resident of Vastral, told him that one Jitu Bharwad could arrange for the injections but would charge a hefty sum. With the reference of a doctor based in Vatva, Gupta contacted Bharwad who told him to pay Rs 6 lakh for 50 injections, to which he agreed. On the instructions of Bharwad, Gupta went to Ankur Crossroads on May 23 to get the injections. Gupta said Bharwad had taken Rs 5.80 lakh from him and was to take Rs 20,000 later. When Gupta demanded the injections, Bharwad told him to wait a while, promising that he would return with the injections. Though Gupta waited there for around four hours, he did not return and calls to him went unanswered. After this, Gupta approached Naranpura police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust along with offences under the Essential Commodities Act against Bharwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-seeking-mm-drug-cheated-of-rs-6l/articleshow/83018241.cms||---

The principals’ forum of SPPU has expressed its inability to prepare results with the software and other technicalities set up at the varsity. The SPPU stated that it would be faster if colleges made the results and distributed them among students. The college principals stated that due to Covid restrictions, a majority of the staff was working from home and in such a situation it was not possible to compile the results from home. The forum has sent a letter to the SPPU stating that the decision should be reviewed. The 2020-2021 academic year of SPPU ended on May 15 as per the SPPU time table. The teachers and principals of colleges were also not trained for compilation of results by the SPPU. The forum’s president Nandkumar Nikam said, “There are huge chances of errors in the results if the work is handed over to the colleges due to the lack of knowledge. This would also be harmful for the future of students if there were any errors created during the process.” The forum said the SPPU orders to ask colleges to compile the first year results came suddenly and no college was prepared. The colleges also found it difficult to train their staff regarding the result compilation. Nikam said, “We have requested the university to do the result compilation process as they have been doing till now just as they have been conducting for the second and third year students as it would also save a lot of time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-varsity-colleges-disagree-over-results/articleshow/83018062.cms||---

The Pune ZP said the construction was of poor quality and the roofs blew away due to faulty designs. The authorities have ordered that henceforth, CSR proposals will have to undergo technical clearance before constructing schools in the district. Authorities said the school management committee must ensure that the quality of construction offered by the CSR initiative is checked and senior engineers appointed with the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan scheme must visit the site and oversee the operations. Chief executive officer of Pune ZP Ayush Prasad said, “Schools lost their roofs during cyclone Tauktae. The quality of construction in CSR initiatives must undergo quality checks so that such loss is avoided in future.” Construction material like steel, sand, bricks, cement and concrete should be sampled at government laboratories and the school must send a report to the block education officer. The school’s management, senior engineer and gram panchayat together must issue a completion certificate to the ZP and a technical sanction will be mandatory which will be issued by deputy engineer of the taluka to ensure the quality of work is under check.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/strict-quality-watch-on-csr-buildings/articleshow/83018060.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Pune||Pune: Students cite slow semester, want a 30% syllabus cut for all courses||PUNE: Savitribai Phule Pune University’s decision to cut 30% of the syllabus for just third year BSc students has not gone down well with pupils from the other branches. While the university’s administration maintains that other courses will be completed by May-end, many students said the ground realities were different. While the committees appointed by the university announced a 30% syllabus cut only for BSc third-year courses, there is no cut in the syllabus for technology, commerce and management faculties, while the humanities department has yet to decide. The officials said during their review meetings, the principals and other officials had shown confidence in completing the syllabus, hence there was no cut announced for the remaining courses. But, students said while some colleges started the classes for the second semester just last week, some started in January but have still not completed the syllabus due to their improper planning and laxity. A first-year MSc Chemistry student said her college started teaching second-semester subjects just last week and she expects the lectures will be rushed to complete the syllabus. “We are hoping that there will be a cut in the final exam syllabus. We are also studying whatever has been taught daily because these are not normal times where one can study at leisure. The college authorities have told us that the remaining practicals will be taught again once the college reopens,” the student said. However, even those students whose second semester started in January are not better off because the colleges have been slacking in conducting online lectures. “We used to have one or two lectures a day and sometimes none, depending upon what the teacher felt like. Due to this in the initial months, hardly one or two chapters were completed. Suddenly, we have been told to attend lectures from 8am to 5pm after which we have to write all the assignments. If the university was implementing a syllabus cuts, they should have done it for all courses,” an engineering student from Pimpri Chinchwad said. N S Umarani, pro-vice-chancellor did not respond to calls and messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-cite-slow-semester-want-a-30-syllabus-cut-for-all-courses/articleshow/83018091.cms||Ardhra Nair

BJP MP Sambhajiraje even met NCP chief Sharad Pawar and MNS president Raj Thackeray seeking support on the issue, causing much unease in some quarters in the party. The day also saw trading of charges between the BJP and the Congress on Maratha reservation. The Congress alleged that the Nagpur-based ‘Save Nation, Save Merit’ organisation, which is spearheading the agitation against Maratha reservation, had the tacit support of the RSS and BJP. The BJP said Congress politicians were working against the community. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the founder of ‘Save Nation, Save Merit’ was the East Vidarbha coordinator of the BJP. BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye called Sawant’s allegation baseless and said Congress and NCP were supporting the anti-Maratha movement. “Sawant must find out who are the donors of the organisation,” he said. BJP state chief Patil, brushing aside opposition taunts about Sambhajiraje meeting Pawar and asking him to take the initiative in the reservation matter after PM Modi allegedly refused to see him, said that if Raje would lead the reservation fight the party would support him. He said that the BJP would support anyone who would take up the issue. Sambhajiraje plans to meet CM Uddhav Thackeray and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday, and VBa leader Prakash Ambedkar on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-eggs-marathas-on-for-stir-as-its-mp-meets-pawar-raj/articleshow/83022335.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||PIL seeks transparency, free treatment||AHMEDABAD: A PIL in the Gujarat high court has sought directions to state authorities for effective management and proper response to black fungus disease, which has been recently declared an epidemic by the state government. Petitioners Maitree Muzumdar and Khush Vachhrajani have asserted that the state government has miscalculated and underreported statistics about mucormycosis patients. This has resulted in lesser allocation of medicines from the Centre and acute shortage of amphotericin B injections, which are vital to the treatment of the disease. Though healthcare is essentially a state subject, the disease was not made a notifiable one until the Centre made a request to do so, it stated. In the PIL filed through advocate Amit Panchal, the petitioners expressed concerns about costly treatment for black fungus disease and stated that it is unaffordable for low-income groups. The petitioners made various suggestions and sought HC directions to the government for proper and timely treatment and to make the process of distribution of medicines more transparent — an issue which the high court flagged in its order on Wednesday in the suo motu PIL on Covid-19. To make treatment for mucormycosis available to the poor, the PIL sought a scheme to be immediately rolled out for free treatment of economically weaker patients at private hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY scheme. Besides this, the PIL also requested for appointment of nodal officers to smoothen the process for poor patients and capping the price of injections, CT scan, and other requirement in private hospitals. The PIL has made elaborate suggestions for distribution of amphotericin B injections and urged the HC to direct the authorities to bring in more transparency in the process. On Wednesdsay, the HC requested the government to make its notification more specific and clear. The PIL seeks proper counting of cases, dissemination of information, and appointment of nodal officers by which the system could be made more accountable. “A mechanism to separately monitor mucormycosis deaths in the total death count is crucial and must be put out in the public domain clearly,” the PIL said, demanding a real-time public dashboard in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pil-seeks-transparency-free-treatment/articleshow/83018140.cms||---

The company’s biological therapy ZRC-3308 is a cocktail of two SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and it can emerge as one of the main treatments for mild Covid-19, the company said on Thursday. According to Zydus Cadila, the neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based treatments have received emergency use authorization in mild Covid-19 in the US, Europe and in India because they significantly reduced viral load in mild patients and their rate of hospitalization. Stating that Zydus is the only Indian company to have developed a neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based cocktail for the treatment of Covid-19, the Ahmedabad-based company added, “Zydus is currently seeking permission to initiate phase 1/3 human clinical trials from the DCGI.” “At this juncture, there is a critical need to explore safer and more efficacious treatments to combat Covid-19. It is important to look at different stages of the disease progression and look at options that can reduce patient’s suffering and discomfort,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, the flagship company of Zydus Cadila Group. “We believe that ZRC-3308 has the potential to address these concerns and provide a safe treatment,” Patel added.

---||Jaipur||Narco dealers’ smart tricks to fool cops fail||Jaipur: Lockdown has prompted narcotics to use innovative ways to give a slip to police and other probe agencies. From using a hollow CNG cylinder to conceal poppy husk and empty batteries of trucks to smuggle opium packets, smugglers are doing their bit to get away with the haul. Many of the arrested smugglers have also used stickers like police, JVNL, government duty, press and essential services on their cars to dodge police. However, the hoodwinking techniques were not enough to fool CID-CB wing of Rajasthan police, which made almost 20 seizures this year so far. Two days ago when CID-SB wing had arrested a smuggler with illegal possession of 512 kg of poppy husk, they were shocked to find out the way the narcotics was concealed. “It appeared as a normal truck with its back empty. However, they had covered the top of the truck with tarpaulin and concealed the sacks covered with double tarpaulin. Prima facie it appeared as a normal truck having its carrier empty and covered with tarpaulin. But when our checked it properely, it found 512 kg of poppy husk,” said Gaurav Srivastav, DIG, CID-CB on Tuesday. Senior officers of CID-CB said since in big hauls punishment is up to 20 years, smugglers don’t hesitate to run over police teams that stop them. “We had once caught a car which primarily appeared to be a CNG fitted car. After suspicious behaviour of the driver, we checked the cylinder and were surprised to see narcotics concealed inside the cylinder. In most of the cases, we depend on specific inputs which are developed by cultivating our sources in the region,” said Pushpendra Singh, DSP, CID-CB, who led almost 20 such operations this year. In trucks, where two batteries are kept, smugglers used one of them to conceal the narcotics and also in the driver’s cabin they made compartments. “They have thousands of tricks. Cracking a narcotics smuggling case is a herculean task and needs months to develop inputs. At many times our members stayed in villages for months to get specific inputs on smuggling,” said Suryaveer Singh, DSP, CID-CB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/narco-dealers-smart-tricks-to-fool-cops-fail/articleshow/83018211.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s target is 10 e-vehicles per 100 registrations by 2025||MUMBAI: At least 10% of all new vehicle registrations will be electric cars, bikes and other e-vehicles by 2025, states the new draft electric vehicle (EV) policy 2021.  It now awaits a final nod from the state cabinet. The state government has also proposed that from April, all new government vehicles will be electric across major cities listed under the draft policy. There is a plan to convert 15% of the current fleet of 18,000 MSRTC buses to electric. The state also intends to make four highways and Expressways fully ready for electric vehicles by 2025, including the under-construction Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, the Mumbai-Nashik highway and the Nashik-Pune highway. Disclosing some of the salient features of the new draft policy at a webinar on electric vehicle mobility on Thursday, state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said: “By 2025, city-wise targets of charging stations are proposed as 1,500 for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, 500 for Pune, 150 for Nagpur, 100 for Nashik, and 75 for Aurangabad. Unless we have enough charging stations or charging points or battery swapping facilities, the new technology adoption will still remain a challenge. The new draft policy addresses these issues.” The transport chief was speaking at a town hall webinar organised online by Climate Voices, a collective of three organisations named Purpose, Asar and Climate Trends, along with the Maharashtra Environment and Climate Change Department’s Majhi Vasundhara initiative. It was hosted by Waatavaran Foundation and WRI India Ross Centre for Sustainable Cities. “We plan to have at least one gigafactory for the manufacturing of advanced lithium-ion batteries to be set up in Maharashtra,” said additional chief secretary (transport) Ashish Kumar Singh. “Today, the state’s share of the country’s electric vehicle registrations is around 12% (32,000) but the size is still not large enough to excite manufacturers. We are keen to take advantage of the schemes by the Government of India, and we will soon become a leading manufacturer of EVs too.” The share of electric vehicles in new registrations across the state in 2025 is expected to be 10% for two-wheelers, 20% for three-wheelers, and 5% for four-wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtras-target-is-10-e-vehicles-per-100-registrations-by-2025/articleshow/83018206.cms||Somit Sen

This relief package is more than the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF0 norms and the state has approved a special package along the lines of the one that was given after cyclone Nisargmade landfall at Raigad last year. “As per NDRF norms, only Rs 72 crore compensation was due, but with the enhanced amount of compensation the state will be paying Rs 180 crore from its own kitty,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. The compensation eligible under NDRF norms is paid by the Centre while the rest will be borne by the state. Nearly 16,000 hectares of farmland was affected and over 10,000 structures damaged. Twenty people died in incidents related to the cyclone. “We’ve been complaining of the Centre’s step-motherly treatment to Maharashtra. Even during the cyclone, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Gujarat and announced Rs 1,000 crore compensation. Now, he visited Odisha. But what about Maharashtra? We have not got a single paisa,” said Wadettiwar. Compensation for horticultural land has been doubled to Rs 50,000, that for a fully damaged house is up from Rs 95,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-of-rs-252cr-special-package-for-cyclone-relief-70-is-from-state-govts-kitty/articleshow/83018222.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Lucknow||TMC to back farmers’ protest, will join dharna if they ‘allow’||Lucknow: The UP TMC will extend full support to farmers protesting against the farm laws. However, before joining their protest the TMC would seek permission from agitating farmers. Giving this information to TOI here on Thursday, UP TMC president Neeraj Rai said, “If farmers allow us to join them we will sit on dharna with them. We will not go there just to meet them and return.” He said that members of the state unit of Trinamool Congress along with a group of farmers would visit the protest site soon to show solidarity with protestors. The state TMC unit has started making inroads in UP keeping its eyes on 2024 general elections. UP assembly election due early next year is what the party sees as prelims to the general elections. Though the TMC’s state unit was set up in 2005, it got a renewed vigour only after its third win in West Bengal this month. The victory in West Bengal assembly elections for the third time where the BJP went full throttle has made the TMC stronger and a key opposition to the ruling BJP. In UP, it intends to make the farmers’ protest its poll plank. Since the presence of political leaders at the protest site has time and again brought allegations that it could be a politically driven protest the TMC will seek permission from the farmers first. The state unit of TMC has also launched a membership drive UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tmc-to-back-farmers-protest-will-join-dharna-if-they-allow/articleshow/83020419.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Nagpur||Now Wardha co to make mucor drug Ampho B too||Nagpur: After starting to make Remdesivir, now the Wardha-based Genetek Life Sciences has started manufacturing ‘Amphotericin B Emulsion’ injection used to treat mucormycosis. The company has priced the drug at Rs 1,200 against the present market price of Rs 7,000, thus bringing a big respite to the patients. The first 4,500 vials would be released on Monday. There is severe shortage of the lifesaving drug across the country due to a sudden spurt in the number of ‘black fungus’ patients. It is currently mostly being imported.Union minister Nitin Gadkari again played a key role in getting licence for the Wardha firm from State Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and also in helping it procure raw material for manufacturing it from Gujarat. On Thursday, the first batch was unveiled by Gadkari at his home on Wardha Road in presence of Genetek director Mahendra Kshirsagar and other officials.“As it was the minister's birthday, we decided to launch the drug on this day. Due to shortage of raw material, we will be producing 4,500 vials per day from Monday, but our capacity is 20,000 and we can take it to 30,000. We will be handing over the product to the Maharashtra government. It will be then distributed in Vidarbha on priority and then to the rest of the state, as it was with Remdesivir,” Kshirsagar said adding their next goal was to manufacture Covid-19 vaccine.The company started making efforts in this direction in the last couple of weeks after receiving a call from Gadkari, who told them to explore the possibility of manufacturing Amphotericin. “Luckily for us, one of the raw materials was available with us, as we produce over 150 products. Other material is procured from Europe, Gujarat and other places and there was a big waiting list of over four months. Due to the minister's efforts, we got priority,” Kshirsagar said, adding they didn't need to recruit new manpower or set up new machinery for making the product.Currently, only one company, Mylan, imports Amphotericin in India and that is why its price is so high. “Mylan also imports it from Gilead. Now, the Centre has granted licences to many companies and in 15-20 days, more quantity will be available. One more company would start making raw material too. We will be testing our product till Sunday. Since mucormycosis is not a contagious disease, we hope it could be brought under control soon with sufficient availability of Amphotericin, which is very effective,” Kshirsagar said. Where will vials go, asks HCHigh court here has asked Centre and state whether the ‘Amphotericin B Lipid Complex’ manufactured by Genetek Life Sciences would be exclusively made available for Maharashtra or go into the central pool. “We have been informed by amicus curiae that Wardha firm would be manufacturing 4,500 vials every day. But it’s not clear where those would be distributed,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-wardha-co-to-make-mucor-drug-ampho-b-too/articleshow/83016082.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On Thursday, Ahmedabad reported 375 fresh cases, its lowest daily tally since March 20. The city reported 401 cases on March 20 and on March 23 the day’s tally had passed 500 cases. The number of active cases in the city has also gone below 15,000 cases. At about 11am on Thursday, the city had 14,153 cases. The health department bulletin said the number of active cases would be close to 14,000 on Friday morning. Officials said that cases increasing from March 21 and hit the highest number of cases in a day on April 25, at 5,790 cases. This was the highest number of cases in a day since the pandemic began. The officials said that the number of new cases began to decline after April 25 and after 32 days the number has come below 400. This has been the lowest tally since March 20. Officials said the AMC had been rebuked by the high court over its handling of the Covid situation and has now managed to bring down the number within a month of the peak. Officials said that based on previous experiences, the AMC had taken a series of initiatives and a new strategy was implemented to address problem areas. Officials said that the surge of cases in in April and May saw most cases coming from the western part of the city. In the last fortnight, the number of tests conducted by private laboratories has also fallen considerably. Officials said that even with the fall in cases there has been no change in the pattern and western Ahmedabad continues to account for 65% of Covid cases. The 35% of the eastern part has the majority of cases coming from the South Zone, which consists of areas such as Maninagar, Danilimda, Behrampura, Vatva and Isanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-24-hour-tally-below-400/articleshow/83018231.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Lucknow||UP BJP scotches rumour of key Sangh-PM meet||LUCKNOW: The BJP leadership in Uttar Pradesh has raised serious doubts about the purported meeting between PM Narendra Modi and senior BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah and party national president JP Nadda with senior RSS functionary Dattatreya Hosabale to effect a cabinet reshuffle in the Yogi Adityanath government, besides setting the stage for a churning in state unit’s organisational structure. “PM Modi did not hold any meeting when chief ministers of Assam and Uttarakhand were recently changed. How is it possible that he attended any meeting on a probable rejig in the UP cabinet,” asked a top BJP leader on Thursday. “These speculations are misplaced and unfounded,” he said, adding the state BJP unit would have been alerted and kept in the loop for a feedback on the prevailing political situation in the state. “No such meeting took place,” he reiterated. Another senior BJP leader said, senior party leaders have been in touch with each other virtually in the wake of the pandemic and any such interaction would have been completely confidential. The BJP leader’s observation came after rumours of a ‘high profile meeting’ triggered political frenzy in the saffron camp that gained traction after Hosabale reached Lucknow and camped in the state capital for four days. The RSS leader is learnt to have taken feedback from key state-level Sangh functionaries on prevailing public perception on BJP in the wake of pandemic and post panchayat elections, which saw the Opposition putting up a formidable challenge. BJP insiders said, the development also sparked demands from the cadre to further elevate the status of deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya. One option doing the rounds was to move Maurya out of cabinet and be given charge of UP BJP chief, replacing incumbent Swatantra Dev Singh, given his credentials of a “strong” OBC face to take on the opposition in 2022 assembly elections. Speculations have also been rife that bureaucrat-turned-politician, Arvind Kumar Sharma, considered close to PM Modi, be included in the cabinet as deputy CM. As a matter of fact, Maurya was party state president when BJP stormed to power with a landslide victory in 2017 assembly elections. Considered close to Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Maurya was also roped in by the party to organise grassroots campaign during state elections in West Bengal where BJP, however, could not get desired results. Significantly, Swatantra Dev Singh, too happens to be an OBC and a strong organisational figure with an ear to the ground. Singh has been firmly in the saddle since July 2019 after BJP returned to power at the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-scotches-rumour-of-key-sangh-pm-meet/articleshow/83020447.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Extend vax to those below 18: HC to Centre, state||Nagpur: With the likelihood of a Covid-19 third wave in the country, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday directed the state and centre to extend the vaccination programme to those younger than 18 years of age.“We would like to know from the state government about steps taken and submit information before the next date of hearing. We would also request the centre to inform on extending the vaccination programme to below-18 population,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said.Reminding the state of their earlier orders, the judges said they had directed steps for dealing with the third wave. “The government has to prepare itself to deal with it. As a step towards such preparedness, more neonatal and paediatric wards would have to be created.”Expressing concern over Amphotericin-B’s limited production capacity, the bench stressed the need of the centre to take effective steps for increasing it and expediting raw material procurement. “Even if the Centre takes such steps, that will not be enough, unless more manufacturers come forward to produce it in India. We would, therefore, call upon the divisional commissioner of Nagpur and Amravati to explore the possibility of pharmaceutical companies operating within their respective jurisdictions, regarding their willingness to enter the field of Amphotericin-B production and report to this court,” the judges said.While hearing a suo motu PIL based on a TOI report, the justices directed the state to also start preparations for tackling white and yellow fungus.“We’ve already referred to the new standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the government in treating black fungus (mucormycosis). There are also reports that post Covid, patients are also getting afflicted with these diseases. So far, there’s no information about their detection in Maharashtra,” the judges said.The judges pointed out that there’s no SOP prescribed for treating these diseases and it is needed to stop their spread. “We’re of the view that the state would have to start preparing itself also for tackling these diseases. We, therefore, request it to submit latest information about them and also consider issuance of SOP for treating them,” the judges said.BoxIncrease Amphotericin allocation to Maharashtra: HC to centreAfter amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar and Nidhi Dayani pointed out that primary drug Amphotericin B Lipid Complex allocation was not in consonance with the number of Mucormycosis patients in Maharashtra, the bench directed the Centre to increase its quota in proportion to the active cases.“We find that the allocation done till May 24 isn’t in proportion to the active cases. We request the centre to make amends in the allocation and align it with the active cases. Bhandarkar informed that Maharashtra has about 20% of total active cases of mucormycosis in India. If this is true, we would expect the Centre to match the allocation with the requirement of the state in terms of its share in total cases in India,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/extend-vax-to-those-below-18-hc-to-centre-state/articleshow/83016104.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||With oxygen demand down to nearly half of April, Ngp starts supply to other dists||Nagpur: The district’s requirement of medical oxygen has reduced significantly in May. Unlike April, Nagpur has stopped taking oxygen from other states this month. On the other hand, the local production has increased to such an extent that Nagpur is now supplying oxygen to neighbouring districts of Vidarbha as well as adjacent states. “From peak demand of above 164 MT oxygen per day in April, the requirement has now declined to under 70 MT per day. On Thursday, we distributed 64MT oxygen to private and government hospitals in the city,” said FDA’s drug inspector Satish Chavan who is in-charge of oxygen supply. Nagpur now supplies oxygen to Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Nanded in Maharashtra and Chhindawara in Madhya Pradesh. While the supplies from Odisha and Bhilai have stopped, local companies are generating more than 200 MT oxygen now. Hospitals also confirmed that the requirement of medical oxygen has gone down significantly as compared to last month. “The oxygen requirement, which had gone up to 24,000 cubic metre on April 28 has reduced to 7,000 cubic metre on May 25 at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH),” said an official. The requirement is going down constantly as number of under-treatment Covid-19 patients has seen a significant drop. As on Thursday, Nagpur district had 9,072 patients under treatment. More than 6,300 of them are in home isolation. This means, more than 50% of the near 5,000 beds available in government and private Covid hospitals are vacant.But patients are not getting any benefit of the improved availability of oxygen. This is because in private hospitals patients are still paying the same price for O2 as they were during the peak of second wave. “Hospitals are getting oxygen at rates 3-4 times higher than the normal rates,” said Dr Anup Marar, convener of the Vidarbha Hospitals Association and added, “Suppliers are charging under the head of ‘Covid mitigating expenses’. We have reported this issue to the NMC but no decision has been taken on it. The requirement has gone down and we have stopped importing from other states. Then what is the point in charging additional rates?” Oxygen Surplus now - During peak of second wave on April 27, Nagpur’s O2 need was 165 MT - After exactly one month on May 27, it has dropped to 64MT - Surplus O2 from Nagpur is now being provided to other districts/stated - Nagpur supplies 20 MT O2 to Akola, 10 MT to Buldhana, 5MT to Amravati - Chhindwara (MP) gets 15 MT Oxygen from city, Nanded also gets 15 MT daily- O2 is also sent to Chandrapur and Wardha as per need||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-oxygen-demand-down-to-nearly-half-of-april-ngp-starts-supply-to-other-dists/articleshow/83016159.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The HC vacation bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Girish Kulkarni, during the virtual hearing of the PIL filed and argued in person by advocate Armin Wandrewala, said it agreed that people were lowering their masks amid the pandemic and spitting and putting others at risk of infection. On April 7, the HC had said that “it defies logic” how the BMC has been collecting Rs 200 as fine when the Act mandates Rs 1,200 and had directed the civic body and state to look at the suggestions given by Wandrewala and consider those they found acceptable. On Thursday, Wandrewala said the BMC has a provision for community service, one of her suggestions, which would prove to be a deterrent, but the state had said under the police powers, there is no such provision for an offender. The HC asked her to submit the suggestions accepted by the BMC and state by June 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-proactive-action-can-help-curb-spitting-menace/articleshow/83018233.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Kolkata||250km-long squall line formed by breakaway cloud mass floods Kolkata||KOLKATA: If Kolkata received moderate and sporadic showers during the cyclone on Wednesday, it was drenched by a surprise and unforeseen deluge a day after Yaas — now reduced to a depression — had travelled 400km away from the city. A breakaway cloud mass from the cyclone that had struck on Wednesday and wreaked havoc in Odisha and caused substantial damage in Bengal led to incessant rain in Kolkata on Thursday. The city received 74.9mm rain till 5pm, nearly three times that of 26.8mm that it had received on the cyclone day. The torrential downpour was preceded by a morning squall that saw wind speed reach a maximum 58km/hr. Even as Kolkatans and weathermen expected it to be a passing cloud, the rain got heavier and more consistent, eventually continuing till the evening and left several parts of the city flooded. College streatA strong westerly wind cut away a portion of the cyclone cloud mass and formed a north-south squall line that stretched across Jharkhand to Kolkata, said weathermen. It was fed and strengthened by a heavy moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal. “So, we had a long and narrow squall line from Kolkata that passed through Digha, Nadia, Murshidabad and Malda. This was definitely a part of the Yaas cloud mass which triggered more rain in Kolkata nearly 24 hours after it had hit land 290km from the city,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. He added that the length of the squall line was 250km. <p>Esplande<br></p>The sudden extreme weather took even the weathermen by surprise. A thunderstorm had been predicted due to the residual moisture of the cyclone. “We had expected a few spells of rain that would peter off towards evening. But not a consistent shower like the one we had. The strong westerly wind, that helped to form the squall line, had not been expected. It resulted in Kolkata receiving more rain than that on Wednesday when the cyclone had struck,” said Das. For Kolkatans, there will be no immediate respite from the wet weather. A thunderstorm has again been predicted due to the high moisture prevalence in the region. “If the temperature rises in the second half of the day, we may again have rain and wind on Friday,” said Das. Meanwhile, Yaas remained stationed over south Jharkhand as a depression. It moved slowly towards the north at a speed of 9 km/hr for six hours on Thursday. It is likely to weaken into a well-marked low pressure area early on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/250km-long-squall-line-formed-by-breakaway-cloud-mass-floods-city/articleshow/83016135.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Teens accuse mom’s live-in partner of rape, FIR lodged||UDAIPUR: Chittorgarh police on Wednesday booked a man for allegedly raping and molesting three minor daughters of his live-in partner for years. The girls, who are 10, 12 and 14 years old, narrated their plight to their mother. When the woman confronted the accused, instead of mending his ways, he thrashed her and continued sexual exploitation of the minors. Finding no way, the helpless mother approached the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and after expressing inability to look after them, she gave them to the state-aided shelter home in January. The girls have been living in the shelter home for the past four months and remained quiet and shy. At a counseling session recently, the eldest girl spoke about the ill treatment meted out by her mother's live-in partner. Upon encouragement by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), the 14-year old lodged a police complaint and the sadar police registered a case under Sections 354,376 of the IPC and 3,4,7&8 of the POCSO Act. DSP Manish Kumar said the case had been registered, medical examination of the two younger girls have been done and the accused would be nabbed soon. Chittorgarh CWC chairman Ramesh Chandra Dashora said he received a counseling report from shelter home Aasra Vikas Sansthan on May 11 wherein the officials said the three girls living in the home had been sexually abused by their mother's live-in partner. The CWC team met the minors and a female member held counseling with them. The girls told her that their biological father lived in Bhilwara and he was a habitual drinker. Their mother left their father around 10 years ago and entered into a live-in relationship with the accused in Chittorgarh's Kumbha Nagar. The eldest and second daughter lived with their father, while the youngest one went with the mother. The girls once overheard their biological father speaking to someone about selling them for Rs 60,000 each. They called their mother who took them with her. In Chittorgarh, the minors were sexually abused and molested by the mother’s live-in partner. The eldest girl said the accused touched her private parts, molested her and raped both younger girls several times in the last three years. Bhojraj Singh of the shelter home said the girls were quiet and introvert since they came here. “Our counselors continuously tried to make them speak to know if they were abused or ill treated and after five months, they mustered courage to reveal the truth,” Bhojraj told TOI. The CWC forwarded the counseling report to the sadar police station on May 21, which was kept pending for a week and finally on Wednesday night, the FIR was registered. The accused works as a homeguard and is a domestic help at a judicial officer’s home, sources said.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High tide-rain combo inundates low pockets||KOLKATA: Large areas of the city went under water on Thursday following spells of heavy downpour since early morning. The situation worsened between 2pm and 4pm when a high tide in the Hooghly that inundated several north, central and south Kolkata areas. KMC officials feel there is more misery in store as another high tide is expected on Friday. Residents of Kalighat, Chetla and Bhowanipore suffered the worst for the second consecutive day as heavy rain and tidal water from Tolly’s Nullah flooded these areas afresh. Tidal water entered the houses on Kalighat Road, Rakhal Das Auddy Road (Chetla), Harish Chatterjee Street and the Lock Gate slum (Chetla). Santosh Mandal, a resident of Rakhal Das Auddy Road, said he was forced to move to a shelter along with other family members as tidal water had flooded his rooms. “Today, I was preparing to go back home. But heavy spells of rain and the high tide made the situation worse. Now I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,” Mandal said. Besides expressing concern over several neighbourhoods along Tolly’s Nullah, a section of civic engineers was equally worried about some north and central Kolkata areas like Rabindra Sarani (Chitpore), Bagbazar, Kumartuli, Burrabazar, BBD Bag and Strand Road. According to a KMC sewerage and drainage department official, it would take much time for the storm water to recede from these areas as all lock gates along the Hooghly remained closed from 11.30am to 4pm due to the tide that rose to 17.5ft. Large areas of Behala, Mominpur, Kidderpore, Metiabruz, Garden Reach, Alipore, Ballygunge and parts of Tollygunge recorded heavy rainfall since Thursday morning. By 2pm, south Kolkata areas had received more rainfall than localities in the north. However, as the day progressed, areas like Maniktala, Belgachhia and Thanthania went under water. A section of Kolkata Police deputy commissioners has been asked to look after the rescue of residents living in low-lying areas. At the 74 shelters in north and Port areas, the police have taken up the primary job of providing food. A KMC sewerage and drainage department official said they were worried over another high tide that is expected on Friday afternoon. “If it rains tomorrow, the tide may pile more misery on those staying along Tolly’s Nullah for the third consecutive day,” the civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-tide-rain-combo-inundates-low-pockets/articleshow/83016167.cms||Saikat Ray

More than 150 houses and 50 shops were destroyed and several trees and electric poles were uprooted during the storm in the two districts. The tornado hit Ashokenagar around 4.30am and lasted a couple of minutes. According to locals, the storm, which had a diameter of nearly 200m, moved from north to south. Guma, Shaktinagar, Jirat and Khristanpara were the worst-hit places. According to administrative sources, the extent of damage is yet to be ascertained. “We heard thunder when the storm hit.

---||Delhi||49-year-old woman Delhi’s first patient of white fungus||NEW DELHI: The first case of white fungus in Delhi has been reported from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The patient is a 49-year old woman, who had suffered a Covid infection. She was admitted to the hospital for severe abdominal pain and constipation and examinations revealed intestinal perforations due to white fungus infection. The woman was operated upon and is recuperating. “The affliction caused by white fungus is milder than that by the black fungus, but correct diagnosis and timely treatment are important to optimise patient outcome,” said Professor Samiran Nundy, advisor, department of surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation. The woman was admitted to the hospital on May 13. Till only four weeks earlier, she had been receiving chemotherapy after breast removal due to cancer. She was also in respiratory distress. A CT scan showed free air and moderate amount of free fluid in the abdominal cavity, suggesting an intestinal perforation. Dr Anil Arora, chairman, Institute of Liver, Gastroenterology and Pancreaticobiliary Sciences, who was treating the patient, began by draining out a litre of bile-stained pus from the abdomen. The following day, she was operated on by a team led by Nundy. “Surgery revealed perforation in the lower end of the oesophagus,” disclosed Nundy. “A part of the small intestine had developed gangrene and sloughed off and she had multiple thinned-out patches in the wall of the colon with one small leak. We closed the perforations and resected the gangrenous segment in a difficult procedure lasting four hours and sent a piece of intestine for biopsy.” Arora revealed that the biopsy of the intestinal segment showed the presence of severe ulceration of the intestinal wall with resultant perforation and necrosis caused by invasive white fungus, scientifically called Candida pseudohyphae. “Her total Covid antibody levels were markedly elevated. Her blood as well as peritoneal fluid culture showed exuberant growth of the same Candida species,” said Arora. The woman was immediately given antifungal medications and showed remarkable improvement. “White fungus causing multifocal perforations in the oesophagus, small intestine and large intestine in Covid infection has not been reported in literature to the best of our knowledge” Arora said. The woman underwent another surgery after five days to fix a small leak from the anastomotic site and is now reported to be recovering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/49-year-old-woman-delhis-first-patient-of-white-fungus/articleshow/83018438.cms||---

Several activists told TOI that clearing of trees in Aarey Colony continued despite numerous complaints. “Several of us sent emails to Rathod, but there was no response. We only received two replies from the government saying our emails had been forwarded to the regional offices,” said activist Sushant Bali. Media coverage had prompted the dairy development department to write to the revenue and forest department to take over the newly declared 795 acres of forest land and stop the fires that were causing an embarrassment to the government. However, no action was initiated against Rathod, they alleged. After his arrest, Rs 3.5 crore and gold was confiscated from his official residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-despite-tree-cutting-fires-aarey-ceo-had-free-run/articleshow/83020575.cms||Clara Lewis

State’s chief wildlife warden V K Yadav said all batagur baska ponds — both for breeding and isolation — have been inundated by salt water. According to him, carcass of a full-grown river terrapin was also found in one of the isolation ponds in Jhingekhali camp. This is a major cause for concern since batagur baska, also known as northern river terrapin, is considered to be one of the five freshwater turtles among the world’s 50 most-threatened turtle species. But, Yadav said 35 hatchlings of this year were shifted to safer locations ahead of cyclone. “But one adult was found dead and four to five could be rescued. The conservation breeding project in the Indian Sunderbans now houses 200 river terrapins. A detailed stock-taking will be done once storm water recedes,” he said. Since 2009, Sunderban Tiger Reserve, with help from Turtle Survival Alliance, has been leading a revival project for the species through captive conservation breeding. Also, over 25km of nylon net fencing was damaged and 25 captive deer escaped through damaged fencing to the reserve forest area in Bakkhali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yaas-blow-to-turtle-conservation-hope/articleshow/83016231.cms||---

---||Delhi||Farmer unions deny Red Fort conspiracy||Bathinda: Farmer unions have rejected the conspiracy angle put in the Delhi Police detailed charge sheet about the January 26 violence and claimed they never wanted to go to the Red Fort but the cops had blocked all other routes. The farmers said the allegation that they wanted to occupy the Red Fort was “motivated by the central government’s agenda of defaming the farmers”. In the 3,224-page charge sheet filed in the Tis Hazari court on May 17, Delhi Police stated that the violence was pre-mediated and the farmers wanted to make the monument another protest site. The charge sheet names 16 people, including Deep Sidhu.Farm unionist Darshan Pal said: "The farmers never had the ill intention of playing with national pride or causing any damage to the national monuments. The farmers were on the prescribed route but the police put barricades to divert them to the outer ring road and towards the Red Fort." BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said: "Delhi police gave the protesters safe passage to the Red Fort to be able to defame the agitation, and now they float a theory that we wanted to occupy the monument." The farmer unionists also denied that the surge in tractor sales between November 2020 and January this year had anything to do with their agitation. They said it was linked to subsidising of the super-seeder machines for managing the crop residue. They said the tractor sales had increased in the other months as well and "no one buys a costly tractor to smash it through police barricades". A farmer unionist said: "Punjab farmers are not that rich. They take loan for these machines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmer-unions-deny-red-fort-conspiracy/articleshow/83018299.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Losses keep fish sellers away from markets; rate spike likely, feel vendors||KOLKATA: The supply of fish to retail markets received a jolt on Thursday. With vendors staying away, almost all retail fish markets saw demand far exceeding supply. Most vendors felt that fish prices were likely to rise with reports of large-scale devastation of fisheries in coastal Bengal. At Maniktala, only a handful of fish sellers came to the market and sold just rohu, small katla and bata. “This has remained the case since Wednesday. We had stocked up, but they are depleting,” said Tridib Chatterjee from Amherst Street. Tapan Das went to Sovabazar and returned with only rohu because only 2kg katla was available and rohu of the same size was a cheaper option. At Lake Market, less than half the vegetable and fish sellers opened their shops because of the weather. “We just got some magur and singi from local fish sellers. There is supply of rohu, but the big katla is not available,” said Ratan Jati, who owns two dalas each in Lake Market and Gariahat. Soumendra Bagchi, a retired professor, returned with a full rohu though he had gone to buy katla, bata and parshe. “No one had brought anything worth buying,” he said. At the Kasba market, most shops were closed and some fish sellers took orders over phone and delivered to homes. Howrah Wholesale Fish Market secretary Syed Maqsood Anwar said the crisis is not in the availability of fish but in fewer vendors from retail markets coming to the wholesale market to buy stock. “We have plenty of stock but sales to retailers have declined from 180 tonnes till a fortnight ago to 150 tonnes daily now. For instance, if 15 fish vendors used to come from Maniktala market before restrictions were enforced, only five come now. So there is fewer fish at the retail point and hence price is higher there. There has been no change in wholesale prices,” he said. At present, the wholesale market has good stock both of river fish and varieties bred in ponds. These include rohu, katla, bekti, pabda, aar, tangra, boal, chital and kajli. “Sea fish volumes have been low for some time. Also, curbs on fishing owing to Yaas have had an impact. But there is no real demand for sea fish now,” Anwar said. Fisheries minister Akhil Giri said, “The fishermen collectively lost fish and allied infrastructure worth over Rs 1,000 crore after fisheries were washed out. A few lakhs of fish were swept away. At prawn fisheries, the loss is estimated to be Rs 1,000 crore. There will be an impact on the retail markets with such huge losses being incurred by fishermen in East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/losses-keep-fish-sellers-away-from-mkts-rate-spike-likely-feel-vendors/articleshow/83016245.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Surat||Good Samaritans help villages fight coronavirus||Surat: Employees of the Community Health Centre (CHC) in Limzar village of Navsari were forced to daily travel over 80 kms to get two oxygen cylinders refilled at the city and then return back to look after the Covid patients. The Limzar CHC wasn’t the only facility that depended on this daily travel for getting its quota of oxygen, medicines and other medical necessities. This was the story of almost every CHC in other villages of south Gujarat. But things changed after the support provided by city-based NGO Prayas Team Environment (PTE). The NGO provided many villages with multiple cylinders along with medicines and medical accessories. PTE is just one of the many city-based NGOs and welfare groups that came to the help of village population who were facing difficult situations in the current pandemic. Now, the situation is improving in the rural areas but timely help from these groups saved many lives. These groups of young professionals have extensively worked during the second wave in the city and utilised their experience in villages. The patients requiring basic isolation facilities were quarantined at the CHCs.“Limzar has a population of around 4,000 but its CHC caters to many surrounding villages. Till now over 300 patients have been treated here,” said Darshan Desai, a volunteer of PTE. Similarly, a group of youths from the city travelled 422 km to Shedubhar in Amreli district to set-up an isolation centre in a village which has a population of 9,000. “The situation was worsening in the rural areas of Saurashtra hence we planned to develop an isolation centre to support the villagers. We set up a 20-bed isolation centre with 25 oxygen cylinders,” said Jatin Asodariya, a trustee in Ramkrupa Charitable Trust. The trust also runs health services in the Diamond City as well. An IT businessman Ganpath Dhameliya joined hands with his friends Dr Gautam Sihora and Kapil Lathiya in setting up an isolation centre at Gheti village in Bhavnagar. “We set up a 40-bed isolation centre and arranged oxygen cylinders from Alang,” said Dhameliya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/good-samaritans-help-villages-fight-coronavirus/articleshow/83014136.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Lucknow||CM announces paediatric ICUs in all CHCs of Siddharthnagar||GORAKHPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday appealed to people who have taken the Covid vaccine to encourage others to take the jab as well. Interacting with a senior citizen, who was being administered the vaccine during a visit to Siddharthnagar, the CM said he should also share his experience with others and motivate them to get inoculated. Later, the chief minister reviewed Covid care facilities at neighbouring Basti district. “Vaccination is the most effective shield against Covid-19 and my government is providing free vaccination,” the CM said, adding vaccinations for those in the 18-44 age-group would start in the Siddharthnagar district from June 1. The CM also announced setting up a paediatric ICU in every community health centre in all assembly constituencies in Siddharthnagar district to blunt a probable third wave which could make kids vulnerable to infection. During his visit to the district, the CM also interacted with members of the monitoring committee and ASHA members in Jogia Khas village. He directed the committee to ensure cleanliness in villages. “Monitoring committees have a huge responsibility in making villages pandemic-free. If anyone is displaying symptoms, they should be given medicine kits, and after a check-up the patient should be put in home isolation or moved to hospital or quarantine centres,” the CM said.He also appealed to people to get tested if they experienced symptoms like cold, fever or body ache and isolate themselves immediately, emphasising that those coming to villages from some other place must be quarantined immediately. To tackle the other disease prevalent in the area like encephalitis, the CM said the government is working on a plan to handle vector-borne diseases. In the past four years, he said, PICUs had been set up in medical colleges and mini PICUs in many CHCs. The facilities would help not just in controlling encephalitis, but also the third wave of Covid-19. During his visit to Basti district, the CM first reviewed arrangements at Covid command and control centre and gave directions to provide better facilities to patients. He then visited the Kaili Hospital where he inspected a 50-bed ward for children and enquired about oxygen availability. He was told that there was no shortage of oxygen in Basti division.He directed the committee to ensure cleanliness in villages. “Monitoring committees have a huge responsibility in making villages pandemic-free.

---||India||Twitter fear-mongering, seeking dubious sympathy, must cooperate with probe: Cops||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Thursday lashed out at Twitter Inc while referring to certain comments allegedly made by the latter regarding an ongoing inquiry into the toolkit controversy. Calling Twitter's conduct "obfuscatory, diversionary and tendentious", police said that the company was purporting to be both an investigating authority as well as an adjudicating judicial authority when it was neither. "There is one simple thing to do which it refuses to do. That is, cooperate with the law enforcement (agency) and reveal to the legal authority the information it has," said a statement released by police. "Twitter India’s subsidiary, TCIPL’s managing director, chose to adopt a path of evasiveness instead of cooperation. He stated in his response that he was merely a sales head, had no role whatsoever in any operations relating to content and, thereby, refused to join the inquiry. It is to be noted that TCIPL’s stance that its managing director is a mere sales head runs contrary to his very own previous press interviews wherein he elaborately discussed Twitter’s plan to devise methods to identify abusive/manipulative content," said police. Read AlsoTwitter alleges threat to free speech; it’s defying Indian laws, counters governmentTwitter on Thursday accused the government of "dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles", and alleged that it has been forced to "withhold" (block in India) portions of "legitimate free speech" on its platform over fears around the safety of its employees and threats"The above interview makes it clear that Twitter India’s convoluted stance is similar to a deer caught in the headlights. The contrived fear mongering by Twitter Inc is unfounded and misplaced. The managing director of TCIPL was merely served a notice, not as an accused but to participate in the inquiry as Twitter claims to have been acquainted with certain facts. Twitter Inc’s latest statements are devised to seek dubious sympathy when they themselves not only refuse to comply with the law of the land but also claim to be in possession of material evidence but refuse to share it with the legal authority duly recognised," said the statement. According to police, Twitter's statements were not only "mendacious" but designed to impede a lawful inquiry by a private enterprise. "Twitter Inc has taken upon itself, in the garb of terms of service, to adjudicate the truth or otherwise of documents in public space. Twitter Inc is purporting to be both an investigating authority as well as an adjudicating judicial authority. It has no legal sanction to be either. The only legal entity, so empowered by the duly laid down law, to investigate is the police and to adjudicate is the court," said the statement. "Since Twitter Inc claims to have material information (on the) basis (of) which it not only ‘investigated’ but arrived at a ‘conclusion’, it must share that information with the police. There should not be any confusion about this logical course," said the police. "Twitter, being a public platform, must lead by example in demonstrating transparency in its functioning which has a bearing on public discourse and should proactively bring clarity into what are subject matters of public domain. Since the matter has been put in public domain, it is important to set the record straight on the tendentious statements made," said police, clarifying why it was issuing a statement. Police said they had registered a preliminary inquiry at the instance of a complaint filed by a representative of the Indian National Congress. "Twitter Inc, while placing the cart before the horse, went ahead and declared that the toolkit was ‘Manipulated Media’. This clearly demonstrates that Twitter Inc. was acquainted with the facts of the case and it had material information which was germane to the inquiry by a duly recognized law-enforcement agency. Therefore, Twitter was asked, by way of multiple communications, to join the inquiry to provide the information it possesses," said Delhi Police. The purpose of Twitter being served a notice for participating in the inquiry, police said, was to allow the investigation to proceed and bring all relevant matters on record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-fear-mongering-seeking-dubious-sympathy-must-cooperate-with-probe-cops/articleshow/83023788.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

While it has reached out to the Union government to operationalize the integrated vaccine (IVC) park in Chengalpet expeditiously, it’s also lobbying for starting production at the refurbished Centre-owned Pasteur Institute in Coonoor. Officials, however, are not ready to put a number to the quantity of vaccines that can be produced as it depends on several factors. “Discussions are in a preliminary stage, but we know these units can start rolling out vaccines in five to six months once technology is made available. When that happens, it will narrow the demand-supply gap,” a senior official said. The Pasteur Institute, which has now applied to the Centre to restart manufacturing of DBT vaccines under the universal immunisation scheme, has a state-of-the-art assembly line with 5ml/vial filling capacity. “The lab has not been used for DBT production since 2008. We can delay DBT production for another year until the country has adequate stock of Covid vaccine. The state is planning to take the IVC park, which has a modern assembly line, on lease to start immediate production,” a senior official said. After preliminary assessment, state officials say the assembly lines of two labs can be used for production if vaccine bulk (purified antigens in inactivated virus) is available. “There are two steps involved in vaccine production,” an official said. First is the upstream process where the bulk is manufactured. The viral seed is grown in cell culture in the lab and then deactivated. The purified antigens are then separated in a special column in a process called column chromatography. This forms the bulk of the vaccine. “The labs need biosafety level three (BSL-3) to handle this,” he said. Instead, If the bulk is ready, these facilities can do a second step in vaccine production called the downstream process. In this process, a prescribed amount of stabilizer and an adjuvant (an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response in recipients) is added to the bulk for vaccine formulation. The formulation is then sent to the online filling stations for automated filling and packing of vials. “Since there is no live virus, this process does not need a BSL-3 lab. This is what we want units in TN to do,” said a senior official. The state has initiated preliminary talks with Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech to start production in Tamil Nadu. “Since they already have the bulk, we can offer the assembly lines we have for production. We are hoping that they will be able to use the resources to expand production,” the official said. BCG Lab, which is another facility currently being used to manufactures anti-TB vaccines for children, cannot be used since the lab’s 2ml filling units may not be suitable for the 5ml requirement of Covid vaccines, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/state-eyes-pasteur-institute-tn-park-to-ramp-up-vax-production/articleshow/83018308.cms||---

Interestinly the truck was loaded with boxes of Mangoes but the narcotics was concealed in special compartment. The team arrested five persons including the buyers and sellers of the haul. ADG CID-CB Ravi Prakash Meharda said their team had been getting regular inputs on rampant smuggling of the narcotics and through the recent arrests and seizures, an information network was also developed. “Every arrest does not only fetch us a person or some quantity of narcotics, it gives us valuable information on smugglers’ movements. After a specific input, we constituted a team and sent it to the area from where the truck was coming. Based on inputs, we stopped the vehicle and seized 565kg of cannnabis,” said Pushpendra Singh, DSP, CID-CB. He added that a special compartment measuring 4 x10x8 feet was made to conceal the narcotics. “This was our fifth seizure in the last one month,” said DSP Suryaveer Singh, who led the operation. “We have arrested three persons while two others who were purchasing the consignment have also been arrested from Sawai Madhopur,” Suryaveer added. The truck was loaded with boxes of Mangoes but had special compartment to conceal the narcotics.

It will restart vaccination for the age-group 18-44 from Friday. “The state has received Covaxin for the first time and distribution of vaccines has already started. The vaccines will reach far off districts by tomorrow (Friday). The vaccination will begin in these districts by Saturday. In the near-by districts and in Jaipur, vaccination will start from Friday,” said a senior health official. “Rajasthan is perhaps the first state to administer Covaxin free of cost to the age group 18-44. Each dose of Covaxin costs Rs 420 (including 5% GST) and per dose of Covishield costs Rs 315,” the official added. “We will receive Covishield vaccines in June (for 18-44 age group). However, we are trying our best to convince them to supply the vaccines in the next couple of days. We made the payment on Wednesday itself. We will receive another batch of Covaxin vaccines of 16 lakh doses in the month of June.” Health minister Raghu Sharma on Thursday said the central government had allocated a quota of 12.66 lakh doses of vaccines to Rajasthan for the month of June while the state needs about 7 crore doses for vaccinating the age group 18-44. “While Rs 59 crore has been paid to both the companies (Covishield and Covaxin) for the supply of vaccines, very little quantity is being supplied from these companies. This is the main reason for the slow vaccination process,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-gets-2-92l-doses-of-covaxin/articleshow/83018323.cms||---

Vipin Sharma, vice president of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ Association said that this was a welcome move for everyone and will benefit lakhs of teachers working in the government. However, for cooks-cum-helpers, Sharma termed it to be inadequate. “According to government grade pay, a cook must get at least Rs 12,800 per month. This minimal increase will not be beneficial for the cooks. Most of these cooks are women, working for the future of students while cooking food for them with love and affection. This should be further increased,” said Sharma. In announcement made for cooks-cum-helpers working in the mid -day meal programme in government schools. From April 1, 2021, they will receive increased amount of Rs 1,452 per month, earlier it was Rs 1,320.

---||Mumbai||Draw up policy for crematoriums to cut pollution, HC orders Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Take help of experts to draw up and put in action a uniform policy for crematoriums to reduce pollution from furnaces, especially in densely populated cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad, the Bombay high court directed the state government on Thursday. A vacation bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Girish Kulkarni passed the order while hearing, via videoconferencing, a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pune businessman Vikrat Latkar expressing concerns of air pollution in the vicinity of crematoriums given their use beyond capacity during the second wave of the Covid-19. The HC directed the government to nominate officials from the department of health and set up a committee to place on record the mechanism it intends to deploy in crematoriums across the state and to come with a final policy. In Pune, the HC directed immediate steps be taken. “Scientific processes are required to be utilised and installed especially in more populated cities,” said the bench. Counsel for the state pollution regulator, Sharmila Deshmukh, said crematoriums are not covered under the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) regime and agreed that its chairman could nominate experts to find technical mechanisms to arrest pollution at crematoriums. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), through its counsel Abhijit Kulkarni, submitted its reply filed by IAS officer Dr Kunal Khemnar (36) to the state that it had installed three air quality monitoring systems near Vaikunth crematorium area, its reports are online on the MPCB website and it has also done maintenance and cleaning of the chimneys at the crematorium regularly—the lastest on May 10. The PMC said it has already sought NEERI’s guidance to cut pollution and also submitted that it is not an adversarial litigation. The HC noted that earlier the Mumbai municipal corporation too, through its special counsel Anil Sakhare, had agreed to look into concerns of pollution near and due to crematoriums in the metropolis. Petitioner Latkar, through his lawyers Ajinkya Udane and Asim Sarode, claimed that the PMC never monitored the ambient air quality at the problem areas and was “not following directions given by the National Green Tribunal”. The petitioner’s case was that chimneys were not adequately installed and sought a joint site inspection with civic staff, which PMC’s counsel Kulkarni readily agreed. The HC will hear the matter next after four weeks, by which the state and BMC are to file their replies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-draw-up-policy-for-crematoriums-to-cut-pollution-hc-orders-state/articleshow/83020684.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Surat||South Gujarat women mango farmers turn cyclone into rainmaker||SURAT: Cyclone Tauktae came marauding down the coastline, plundering the mango orchards clean and ravaging farmers’ seasonal income. But a few like Bela Patel, a mango orchard owner in Abrama village of Navsari, knew how to rise above the tides. She saw an opportunity amid the calamity, even as her fallen mangoes of Rajapuri and desi varieties did not find takers in the Kesar-filled local APMC market. Instead of counting losses, she decided to make value addition to the huge stock of damaged mangoes and mint money — much more than what she could have earned in the APMC market. Along with four other women from Abrama and Boriyach villages, Bela embarked on her successful trip. “We used to make pickles and marmalades for our home, so we thought of making in large quantities using the fallen mangoes and sell in local markets or among friends and family members,” said Bhavnita Patel, one of the five women from the group, who made sliced mango pickles using Rajapuri mangoes. “We would have got Rs 200 to Rs 300 for 20 kilograms of fallen mangoes, but now through our quick thinking, we are selling one kilogram of pickle for Rs 200 to Rs 250,” said Bela, who has already sold off four types of pickles. While Bhavnita and Bela made pickles and dry mango powder using mangoes of their orchard, another group member, Jagruti Patel, bought additional mangoes from other farmers to sell the mango products on a larger scale. “Using the desi type of mangoes, I made spiced pickles, while from other mangoes I made marmalade and dry mango powder. Some of the mangoes had ripened so I have bottled mango juice too for sale,” said Jagruti, who will also make use of dried seeds for mouth fresheners. “Where I was thinking I will be facing a huge loss, here I am earning more than what I would have by selling good quality mangoes,” said Jagruti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/women-mango-farmers-turn-cyclone-into-rainmaker/articleshow/83014174.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Power supply snapped to avert electrocution||KOLKATA: A reserve force of 2,500 technicians and workmen that CESC had mobilised to tackle disruption caused by cyclone Yaas came in handy a day later on Thursday when rise in water level owing to the bore tide and incessant rain required electricity supply to be switched off in various localities in Kolkata, Budge Budge-Maheshtala, Howrah and Hooghly. According to CESC officials, supply to 40,000 households was suspended during the day to prevent electrocution accidents from inundated electricity boxes and meter lines. “Our system is normal. No major fault has been reported. But we have had to switch off supply in various pockets as a safety measure. The situation is being monitored on a real time basis and as water levels recede, supplies are being restored,” CESC vice-president (distribution) Avijit Ghosh said. Electricity supply to homes in Kalighat and Chetla were switched off around 2pm, when the high tide flooded the neighbourhoods. After 3.30pm, supply to many more areas were disconnected as a downpour led to waterlogging. Among the areas affected were Alimuddin Street, College Street, Amherst Street, Bowbazar, Taltala and Suhrawardy Avenue in central Kolkata, Tangra and Convent Lane in east Kolkata, Kidderpore, Ekbalpore, Mominpur, Garden Reach, Paharpur, Watgunge and Metiabruz in south Kolkata. In Howrah, power was switched off to households on Belilious Road and at Howrah Maidan as well as in far-off areas, like Bauria and Sankrail. In addition, households in Konnagar, Hindmotor and Telenipara were also affected. CESC said it had sent across messages to consumers, informing them of the reason for the power outage. In households, where the tide led to the shutdown, the message was sent in advance. In other areas, the message was sent after power was switched off. In addition to the manpower that was kept ready, what helped in reducing disruption were preventive measures prior to Cyclone Yaas’s landfall on Wednesday. Since Sunday, KMC teams had surveyed localities that had overhead wires and cut branches that appeared susceptible to breaking in the storm and disrupting power lines. Some trees that were found leaning dangerously were also axed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/power-supply-snapped-to-avert-electrocution/articleshow/83018348.cms||---

Medical and health department figures estimate nearly 5.32 crore people above 18 years in all age group categories will be administered the vaccines. Till May 26, the department administered first dose to 1,30,23,248 people including healthcare and frontline workers. With approximately 4 crore residents still waiting, vaccinating all beneficiaries appears to be a distant dream. There are approximately 3.5 crore people in the 18-44 age category, 1.22 crore in 45- 59 age category and 86.84 lakh in above 60 category. Out of total 1,30,23,248 residents in all categories, there are 31,89,162 beneficiaries who have received the second dose. An official source said, “Not only 76 % people are staring to receive their first shot, close to 1 crore are waiting for the second shot.

However, during the pandemic, even that took a hit and it was almost impossible to meet ends. Had it not been for danseuse Manjari Chaturvedi, Taj wouldn’t have been able to brave the crisis. Over the past year, Manjari, an exponent of Lucknow gharana known worldwide for her Sufi kathak and Courtesan Project, has been extending help to over 150 artists like Taj and their families in UP, Punjab and Rajasthan. So far, she has managed to collect over Rs 25 lakh, which is being disbursed as monthly support of Rs 3,000-5,000 each to distressed families in Kakori, Barabanki, Sitapur, Badaun, Khairabad, Jhansi, Fatehpur Sikri, Lucknow, Delhi and Jaipur, among others, so that they don’t go hungry. “Musicians and artists across the country, especially in small towns, have suffered a lot at the hands of the pandemic and its implications. These singers and accompanists earned mainly from live concerts and performances and those have come to a halt,” said Manjari. She added that most such artists have dedicated their lives to music and are unskilled so they can’t take up any other work. “Many of them had made distress calls and shared that they were not even able to manage two meals a day,” she further said. Terming artisans a living legacy of society, Manjari said that in the absence of any government initiatives, she took the step to support them through her organisation Sufi Kathak Foundation. Mobilising her network of friends and supporters, she also posted appeals on social media besides contacting corporate houses and other potential contributors. She also connects donors to artisans in case they want to extend help directly. In the devastating second wave though, said Manjari, contributions have slowed down while needs of artists have increased because of illnesses and suffering. She said that the government, especially the culture department, can channelize its funds to support such families. “The ministry and state departments have funds which will eventually lapse as events are activities cannot be organised. The money may be used to keep these artists alive,” she urged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-kathak-exponent-helps-artists-brave-pandemic-heat/articleshow/83020653.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The bench of Justice Rameshwar Vyas and Justice Vijay Bishnoi asked the collector to personally monitor the situation and make sure that ration is made available to them immediately. The court also directed the central government to furnish a factual report regarding the availability of vaccines to the state government for persons who do not have prescribed identity cards. The case would be heard again on Friday. The matter came up for consideration on additional submissions on behalf of Pakistan minority migrants staying in Jodhpur wherein it was told that these migrants have been living in India either on short term or long term visa. Though some of the eligible persons have been granted citizenship, but matters regarding others is pending consideration. The petitioners’ counsel, Sajjan Singh Rathore, said in the submissions, the grievances raised on behalf of the Pakistan migrants was that in the second wave, the state government has imposed strict lockdown and migrant petitioners living in various camps in Jodhpur have no arrangements to fulfill their basic needs like food, water and primary medical health facility. “During the first lockdown, some of the social organisations and NGOs distributed ration kits, but during the present second wave, due to strict restrictions, ration and other essential items have not reached the migrants. Also, in the absence of Aadhaar card and other documents, eligible minority migrants were deprived of vaccination, which is very essential for every human being,” Rathore said. Having gone through the submissions, the court said while the process of vaccination of persons who do not have prescribed identity cards has already been detailed out by the Centre, now it is for the state and district administration to chalk out a plan for vaccinating the migrants. The issue regarding non-availability of ration for the minority migrants is serious one and no person residing in the state can be allowed to starve due to non-availability of food, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-seeks-report-on-ration-for-pak-migrants-availability-of-jabs/articleshow/83018349.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Discuss options for plastic with stake holders: CS||Jaipur: Chief secretary Niranjan Arya said officials should initiate discussion with affected groups over Centre’s proposal to ban the single-use plastic. They should explore other options in its place. Arya said that it is necessary to ban single-use plastic from environmental point of view. The state already has banned several plastic products. Its use has been strictly prohibited in government offices since 2019. He said that as per the draft notification of the central government, it is proposed to be banned from January 1, 2022. It is necessary to consider all aspects for better implementation. He directed the officials to discuss the impact of the ban with groups of plastic producers and consumers. He said that there is a need to restrict the use of unnecessary wrapping and packing films mounted on cards and packets, but where plastic use is necessary, other options must be explored. Principal secretary of forest and environment department, Shreya Guha, spoke of the provisions of the draft notification issued by the Centre on March 11, 2020. She said that the central government has proposed a ban on single-use plastics in two phases. Under this, the manufacture, import, storage, distribution, sale and use of all single-use plastic items will be prohibited under the regulations. She said that first from January 2022 some plastic items like plastic flags, balloons and candy sticks and then from July 2022 a ban on plates, cups, glasses, cutlery items like forks, spoons, wrapping, packing films, invitation cards, cigarette packets is proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/discuss-options-for-plastic-with-stake-holders-cs/articleshow/83018352.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur’s RUHS treated 20,000 patients so far, more than Delhi’s AIIMS||JAIPUR: The 500-bed Rajasthan University for Health Sciences (RUHS) hospital, which gradually upgraded itself to 1,200 beds in less than a year and became the largest dedicated Covid-19 facility in the state, has provided treatment to 20,000 coronavirus patients, so far. This is much higher than Covid patients treated at Delhi’s AIIMS, which is close to 16,000. The government hospital was inaugurated by chief minister Ashok Gehlot around March last year, but before it began to function, Covid came knocking. It started with 500 beds, but as the pandemic spread, it increased the number of beds to treat more patients. Now, it has a capacity of 1,200 beds. For the expected third Covid wave, a 100-bed ICU has been sanctioned for the hospital. Major upgradation began in RUHS after September, when the state government gave administrative control of the hospital to Sawai Man Singh Medical College.“At the time when we took over RUHS hospital, a major portion of the building was lying unused. We raised the capacity of the hospital to 1,200 beds and kept it flexible to treat 1,400-1,500 patients. Since Covid patients also require ICU facilities, we developed a world class ICU with 200 beds. We created oxygen lines in the hospital, created unique emergency unit, introduced wheelchairs enabled with oxygen to ensure that a patient is put on support within a minute of his arrival to the hospital. It has now emerged as the one of the country’s most prestigious hospital,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. It became a hope for patients across the country as some were airlifted from Bangalore and also from Gujarat and brought to the hospital. “We have treated 20,000 Covid patients, so far. Out of these, around 10-15% patients admitted were from other states such as Gujarat, Delhi, UP, Haryana and MP,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS hospital. “When the cases were constantly increasing, we created a triage area in the hospital where we segregated patients according to the severity of their symptoms – severe, moderate and mild – and provided them treatment accordingly. When cases were constantly increasing, we created more space to accommodate more beyond our capacity. There was a day when 1,362 patients were undergoing treatment indoors and 484 patients provided treatment at day care,” Singh said. The government deployed a large fleet of healthcare staff, including 200 doctors, 350 nursing and paramedical staff and 300 contractual staff, to take care of patients. Also, three units of medicine department were shifted from SMS Hospital to RUHS. The hospital has now a state-of-art laboratory with facilities to conduct all diagnostic tests, including checking inflammatory markers and cytokine storm. Amid fears of a third wave, the hospital is upgrading and expanding its facilities. Four oxygen generation plants will come up at the hospital along with a 100-bed ICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/citys-ruhs-treated-20k-patientsso-far-more-than-delhis-aiims/articleshow/83018371.cms||---

Police have registered a case against two persons alleged to be behind the illegal construction, and initiated a probe into the matter. In every district, the social welfare officer is the custodian of the waqf property. Taking cognizance of complaints about a partially constructed building used as a mosque on waqf land, a team comprising the social welfare officer and sub divisional magistrate along with a heavy posse of police personnel reached the spot to demolish the structure. After an initial objection, the locals, who had gathered at the spot in large numbers, agreed to demolish the structure. The incident happened on Sunday. Archna Sonkar, district welfare officer, said, “The building was being illegally constructed on wakf property and they had no legal papers related to the mosque. After talks with the locals, they demolished the construction. Action is being taken accordingly.” The nephew of the building’s caretaker, Kazi Nabil, alleged the administration had not given any prior notice. He said, “I was out of the city when the incident happened. We have all the related papers of the land. Why has the administration taken action when it is a matter of the Waqf Board?” The “mosque” was built five months ago and namaz was being offered in it, Nabil added. Meanwhile, police have registered a case in the matter against two persons behind the construction under IPC section 427 (punishment for criminal trespass) and provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Rakesh Singh, deputy superintendent of police, Khatauli, said, “A case under various sections has been registered in the matter and action will be taken accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/locals-pull-down-illegal-structure-on-waqf-land-used-as-mosque-in-mngr/articleshow/83014192.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Delhi||Clip showing Sushil Kumar beating up wrestler surfaces||NEW DELHI: In mounting trouble for arrested wrestler Sushil Kumar, a video has surfaced allegedly showing him assaulting another wrestler Sagar Dhankad at Chhatrasal Stadium on the night of May 4. Dhankad, who is seen lying on the ground in the video, died later. In the video, the two-time Olympic medallist can be seen holding a stick/baseball bat. There are a dozen others in the frame too. The video was shot by Kumar’s associate Prince, who has also been arrested. Kumar allegedly wanted to circulate the video in the wrestling circle, apart from rival gangs, to “send a message across” and prove his dominance. Prince had shared the video with a few of his friends. Police have also stumbled upon another picture that shows Kumar with gangster Kala Jathedi’s brother. The photo shared on Facebook was dated December 18, 2018 with the caption “bhaichara @pehalwanji” and corroborates police’s theory that Kumar was closely associated with the Jathedi gang for over three years. Kumar is currently in police custody for six days. On Wednesday, he was taken to Chhatrasal Stadium to recreate the crime scene. His friends and he had thrashed Dhankad and his two friends and all three had to be hospitalised. Dhankar later died of his injuries. The wrestler allegedly committed the murder with the backing of jailed gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali. Jathedi, who is currently based in Dubai, has a reward of Rs 7 lakh on him. He had been grabbing disputed properties in Delhi. Kumar allegedly joined hands with him a while ago and landed a flat in M2-Block of northwest Delhi’s Model Town, which was at the centre of the entire controversy. This flat was used to shelter criminals belonging to the Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi gang and many crime plots had been hatched there, said an officer.

---||Chennai||Baby bust: Chennai couples behind closed doors play it safe||CHENNAI: As the pandemic scare locked the city down and pushed people behind closed doors, many thought it may lead to a baby boom. But Chennai, as usual, has upended expectations to record its biggest slump in births — nearly 42% drop in April 2021 compared to the same period last year. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), as per its website, issued 4,094 birth certificates in April 2021. It was 7,030 in April 2020. The civic agency responsible for registering births in the city issues certificates within 21 days of birth based on data sent by hospitals (nearly 99% births in the city are institutional births). The registry showed a 25% decline in March 2021 and 30% decline in February 2021 compared to the previous year’s data for the corresponding period. The fall in birth rate, according to doctors and population experts, is probably due to a combination of factors including fear of frequent hospital visits, losing jobs due to the pandemic and unstable financial future. “That’s not what we thought initially,” said Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) vice president Dr Ramani Devi. “We were expecting a baby boom because couples were going to stay at home most of the time,” she said. In fact, in early 2020, when the country was under lockdown, many gynaecologists stopped advocating treatments for infertility.  “We advised them to postpone pregnancy as we didn’t know the impact of Covid on pregnancy. We also thought abortions and maternal deaths may go up,” she said. Patients seemed to have taken the advice seriously. Market data showed a 15% increase in the sale of condoms at retail pharmacy stores in 2021.  Chennai Chemists and Druggists’ Association president S A Ramesh said it was difficult to arrive at exact sales figure as condoms were available at supermarkets and online sites apart from pharmacies. But studies by private e-commerce sites such as Dunzo reported a surge in condom orders in Chennai. “Couples had a lot of time during the lockdown to plan or postpone pregnancies. They were never at home for so long ever,” said senior paediatrician Dr Balasubramanian of Kanchi Kamakoti Child Trust Hospital.  But they were anxious too. “They were worried when they saw so many infections and deaths around them. In addition, many feared financial issues with job cuts and pay cuts,” said Kauvery Hospital consultant Dr C S Sabeeha. The number of deliveries in her hospital has come down from 14 a month to just eight, she added. The Chennai trend is akin to what has been reported by major cities in the US, China, Spain and Japan over the past three months.  Population scientist K Ajeesh Kumar, an expert in demography, however, warns that it could be too early to call the trend a baby bust.  “It is not possible to collect quality data during the pandemic. So, we must wait for two years to know the trend,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/baby-bust-couples-behind-closed-doors-play-it-safe/articleshow/83018373.cms||Ram Sundaram

A death audit of the deceased, aged between 30 and 40, is being conducted and the report is expected on Friday. As many as 41 other black fungus patients are currently undergoing treatment in the two wards of the hospital. The treatment of patients has suffered due to inadequate supply of medicines from the Centre, said sources. One of the three deceased patients has not been confirmed for black fungus as he was brought to the hospital in a very critical condition and died immediately after being admitted to the ward. While one of them was a confirmed black fungus case, the other is a suspected black fungus patient, said Dr Rajkumar Jain, associate professor, ENT, surgery, Kota Medical College. While two of the three were referred from Jhalawar, the third patient belonged to Kota, he added. All the black fungus patients in the two wards are from Kota, Bundi, Jhalawar and Baran districts of the Hadauti region and most of them have been operated upon, Jain said, admitting that the hospital was facing severe shortage of medicines. The Centre has not provided adequate supply of medicines for mucormycosis, however, a demand for the same has been sent and supply is expected in the next few days, said Dr Naveen Saxena, superintendent, MBS Hospital. A team of doctors is conducting 3-4 surgeries every day. But they face a huge problem as most of the patients had undergone surgeries and treatment earlier at private hospitals. They have been brought to this hospital after they failed to get proper medicines, Dr Saxena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/black-fungus-claims-3-lives-in-kota-in-24-hrs/articleshow/83018393.cms||---

Local police traced the man in the video and identified him as Subodh, a resident of Pahasu road area in Khurja. “His counselling is being done to discourage him from taking any extreme step,” a police officer said “Nobody cares. Everybody is after money. Where should I get money from? I am not a thief or a gangster. I can only work but you guys have not spared me inasmuch as that I can’t concentrate on my work. You guys are killing me by the second. I am going mad,” the distraught man purportedly said in the video. Police believe that the man, who is jobless at present, shot the video to put pressure on his wife, a private bank employee who has pressed dowry harassment charges against him. “His wife has registered a case of dowry harassment against Subodh. During the primary investigation, it came to the fore that the video threatening suicide was made by him to put pressure on his wife,” said Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-threatens-to-end-life-in-video-police-say-ploy-to-harass-wife-who-accused-him-in-dowry-case/articleshow/83014180.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Covid claims lives of 63 doctors so far, says medic body||JAIPUR: At least 63 doctors have died of Covid in Rajasthan till date. While the first wave claimed the lives of 22 doctors, the second snatched the lives of another 41. Private doctors have been demanding a relief of Rs 50 lakh for the deceased just as it is given to kin of government doctors dying of Covid. “This year, 41 doctors have met with untimely death and that too in a very short period of time. Last year, we lost 22 doctors,” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS), adding that this year doctors who died were mostly young and vaccinated. Kapoor said, “We request the government to provide suitable financial aid to these corona warriors’ families and also give them recognition as Covid martyrs. When the government can include ration dealers and accredited journalists for the compensation of Rs 50 lakh due to Covid death, why not private doctors and paramedics?” Indian Medical Association (Jaipur branch) president Dr Tarun Patni, too, demanded compensation for the private doctors dying of Covid. “Each doctor who is treating Covid or not should be given compensation in case of Covid death,” said Dr Patni. However, health department officials said there was a confusion on compensation issue. “Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting Covid, there is a provision of compensation of Rs 50 lakh for private hospital staff as well,”said a senior health department official. In the state, 88 claims for compensation have been received by the health department. Out of those, 14 have been granted Rs 50 lakh, 48 are under process and rest of them have been rejected, the health department official said. Among those 14, who received the claims, are not only the doctors, but nurses, anganwadi workers and other corona warriors. 85 persons die, 3,454 test positive Times News Network JAIPUR: The state reported 85 Covid deaths and 3,454 others tested positive for the virus on Thursday, taking the casualty count to 8,103 and overall tally to 9,31,200.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Only 40% pay electricity charges during lockdown||JAIPUR: Only 40% people in the city have paid their electricity bills in May due to the ongoing pandemic. This has become a difficulty for Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (JVVNL) to pay back the electricity generators. As the state government purchases electricity from the generators, if there is any delay in payment, government has to pay interest ranging from 12% to 18% depending on the deal with the said company. Superintendent engineer of JVVNL, S K Rajput said, “Only 40% people have deposited their bills due to lockdown or else in normal times, the figure goes up to 85%. Many commercial enterprises are shut and people are also waiting for this to over to finally deposit the bill. We expect that by May 31, this will reach up to 50%.” JVVNL is not able to send workers to people’s home for meter reading, hence, only average bill of the month is sent. The average bill can be lower than the usual consumption of electricity. The last date of depositing the bill will be mentioned on the bill itself. Rajput said that this will be adjusted next time when original bill is sent with meter reading by the department workers. “Although, due to pandemic, the government has ordered not to disconnect any electricity connection till May 31,” said Rajput. Kundan Lal Pathani, a businessman in Jaipur, said the department has sent him average bill just the same as last month. “Usually, we get a bill of Rs 27,000, but due to lockdown shops were not open so the bill should come lower than that. But the department has sent us similar bill and now claiming to adjust it once original bill is received after lockdown. We are also facing penalty due to this, but what is the point in paying now. We will pay when the original bill is received.” However, there is one solution to it - if people want to get original bill anyhow – send the meter reading photograph with your K.No. to WhatsApp number: 9413375901, provided by the department. Through this, the department will go through your reading and will send you the original bill that people can deposit online or through JVVNL app. At present, over 9,300 Jaipur residents have deposited the bills through this process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/only-40-pay-electricity-charges-during-lockdown/articleshow/83018390.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Elusive snow leopard spotted 7,000 ft below habitat, second year in row||DEHRADUN: The snow leopard is an elusive animal, partial to broken terrain and rugged cliffs high up in the mountains — above the tree line at 18,000 feet. But last year in April, it was seen as low as 10,000 feet in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. And this year, it has been spotted, for the first time, in the Valley of Flowers at an altitude of 11,400 feet in the Garhwal Himalayas. Pugmarks of the snow leopard were believed to have been seen in the alpine valley before but this time conservators got camera trap images. In fact, forest authorities had been scanning the valley for poachers and hunters when they chanced upon the image of a lone snow leopard in the lower reaches of the valley. “It is confirmed that the snow leopard is present in the Valley of Flowers … Under the Snow Leopard Population Assessment of India project, we had been monitoring all zones of Uttarakhand between 3000 metres (9,800 feet) and 5,500 metres (18,000 feet), which includes Valley of Flowers,” said S Sathyakumar, senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun. He has been helping Uttarakhand and Ladakh in conducting the country’s first snow leopard census. So, why are snow leopards descending to the lower reaches? Experts put it down to two reasons. “Sighting of the snow leopard at a low altitude is primarily because of the reduced human footprint since the pandemic broke out,” said Amit Kanwar, director of the Valley of Flowers National Park. “The changed weather pattern also has a role to play in it. We had extended snowfall here in the valley, which makes the environment amenable to the snow cat.” Uttarakhand has received unusually high rain and snow this year — it snowed until the second week of May in Kedarnath and Badrinath, and Mukteshwar received the highest rainfall in 105 years this month. The other surprising thing scientists observed was that the snow leopard was seen sharing space with the common leopard. “The camera trap images show a common leopard was present at the place the snow leopard was seen on another day. It means common leopards are moving higher up and snow leopards are wandering down, and they are sharing territory,” said Kanwar. The reason for this, which could also be why snow leopards may have descended to lower altitudes, is movement of prey. “Predators follow their prey. Snow leopards prey on blue sheep. During snowfall, blue sheep may have migrated downwards and the snow leopards may have followed. The common leopard, likewise, must have followed its prey upwards. In March and April, the climate requirements for both may have overlapped and so did their territory,” said Sathyakumar. The IUCN has categorised the snow leopard as a ‘vulnerable’ species. Under The Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the snow leopard is under Schedule I, which gives it the highest level of protection. Uttarakhand has over 85 snow leopards, according to a rough estimate by the WII, and the countrywide number is estimated to be 450-500 but the first official census is under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/elusive-snow-leopard-spotted-7k-ft-below-habitat-2nd-yr-in-row/articleshow/83014236.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government to move SC for global vaccine tender||JAIPUR: The Ashok Gehlot government, which had to stop its vaccination drive on Thursday due to non-availability of jabs, has decided to appeal to the Supreme Court to direct the Centre to issue global tenders for purchasing foreign-made Covid vaccines. Earlier, sensing an imminent shortage, the government had tried to purchase vaccines from other countries. However, the initiative did not materialise. Left with no alternative, it has now decided to appeal to the Supreme Court. The state government has allocated Rs 3,000 crore for vaccinating people between 18 to 44 years. “We have facilities to store huge stocks as well as trained staff, but unfortunately vaccines are not available. We have given Rs 47 crore to Serum Institute of India and Rs 12 crore to Bharat Biotech in advance. SII has supplied some doses, which we have already used. But Bharat Biotech has not supplied any vaccines yet. Today, we do not have any vaccines, due to which we were forced to stop vaccinations,” said state health minister Raghu Sharma. Later in the day, the state received two lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. “We have 3.25 crore people in the 18-44 age group, for which we require seven crore doses. At this same pace, vaccination will continue for years,” Sharma said. “The state government has decided to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court, appealing it to give direction to the Centre to issue global tenders for procuring vaccines. The state government will bear the cost. External affairs ministry is under the Centre, which can establish better coordination with ambassadors of countries from where vaccines can be procured,” the minister said, adding that several other states have already approached the Supreme Court on the same issue. “State governments usually do not issue global tenders, but we had no other option. Nine companies participated in it. The (foreign) company producing Covishield also participated, but the same vaccine is also being produced in India. Why should we buy it from the firm through global tendering at a higher price?” asked Sharma. Questioning different rates for the Centre and the state, the minister said, “The Centre is getting (Covaxin and Covishield) vaccine doses at Rs 150, but we are getting them at Rs 300 to Rs 400. The difference will go up by at least four times in case of foreign vaccines purchased through global tendering.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-move-sc-for-global-vax-tender/articleshow/83018411.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pvt hosps give jabs mainly via tie-ups with firms & hsg socs||City private hospitals are getting Covishield ranging from a few thousand to up to a lakh doses from SII. Civic data shows that private hospitals are administering 10,000 to 12,000 doses in the city every day now while public vaccination centres are giving around 15,000 to 22,000 doses.Hospitals such as Hinduja, Jaslok, Nanavati, Lilavati, Kokilaben, H N Reliance, Charni Road’s Mittal, Saifee and Masina, among others, are vaccinating both through CoWin and tie-ups. While Breach Candy, Criticare, Fortis and Wockhardt are mainly vaccinating through tie-ups at present, they also plan to open vaccination to all. Some public centres such as SevenHills have tied up with embassies. Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) has partnered with Lilavati and Dr Meena’s Multispeciality Hospital for vaccinating its employees.Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said at least 11 of the city’s major private hospitals have received vaccines from Serum Institute of India recently and more are in the pipeline. “Vaccination will gain momentum soon as more hospitals receive doses gradually, but we will keep the CoWin option open in Hinduja,” he said, adding the hospital has received nearly one lakh doses. Almost all hospitals have been approached by a dozen to almost 80-100 companies for vaccination. Some corporations are themselves procuring the vaccines and collaborating with hospitals only to administer the doses.Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group of Hospitals, said they will start vaccinating employees of Kotak, Yes Bank, IDBI and Motilal Oswal, among others, with Covishield doses that it expects to receive in batches of 10,000 to 15,000 by the end of the week. He says the group plans to keep at least 1,000 CoWin slots daily.Dr S Narayani, zonal director of Fortis Hospital, said they have been vaccinating societies from the neighbourhood and corporates but intend to open vaccination in the hospital this week. The group has directly sourced doses from Serum Institute. A Breach Candy hospital official said they, too, have got doses from Serum, which they are currently utilising for staff. It hasn’t opened slots on CoWin.Officials from Saifee Hospital said they had received a few thousand doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech and expect stocks from Serum this week. It is vaccinating around 200 through CoWin appointments and 500-600 through tie-ups daily.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said since private hospitals are procuring their own doses, they are free to administer in any manner. “They can choose how many slots they want to open on CoWin. The only requirement is vaccination through CoWin should be 100% through online registration,” he said. Hospitals have to submit an application to the local ward office which gives permission for the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pvt-hosps-give-jabs-mainly-via-tie-ups-with-firms-hsg-socs/articleshow/83000048.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dehradun administration gave permits to flatten 14 hillocks in six years||NAINITAL/DEHRADUN: In six years, the Dehradun district administration has given permission to flatten at least 14 hillocks in the Himalayan foothills between Dehradun and Mussoorie, which environmentalists said disregards concerns about its geological stability. The findings, in a report by the Dehradun municipal commissioner and Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) vice-chairperson, were placed before the Uttarakhand high court on Thursday. The high court has since May 3 been hearing a PIL by Dehradun-based activist Reenu Paul who contends that though the state’s bylaws, amended in 2015, prohibit construction wherever the natural slope is more than 30°, the rule is being flouted. The report, a copy of which is with TOI, was prepared and submitted on the direction of the high court. “The Doon Valley region had been declared an eco-sensitive zone in 1989. There is no sign of that now. The Mussoorie-Dehradun highway runs through an area that used to be a dense forest. That’s all gone. There’s heavy traffic, indiscriminate construction. Building laws, forest laws, roadside laws, highway laws — they’ve all been flouted,” said environmentalist and senior advocate Aalok Mehrotra. “Is it possible the authorities knew nothing about the establishments and the hill-cutting being illegal?” Besides the damage to ecology, the other concern is geological stability. Both Dehradun and Mussoorie lie in seismic zone IV, of high risk. Geologists have often warned that Uttarakhand is due for a major earthquake, much more intense than the Kangra quake of 1905. Hill-cutting makes the terrain more unstable. An example of what is at stake is a cluster of three slums that has come up on these hills, which is in danger because of the region’s instability. The petition states that a few years ago, an entire family from one of the slums had been killed when their house on a cliff caved in. However, the report said, these slums are “protected”. In 2018, the Uttarakhand high court had asked the government to clear all encroachment in three weeks. Because these slums were highly populated, the state government had decided to give them a reprieve and issued an ordinance protecting them from eviction for three years. That three-year deadline ends on July 27 this year. Noted Mussoorie historian Ganesh Saili said this has been a recurring problem. “All the way from Rajpur Road to Mussoorie, you can see violations of the UP Road Act, which does not allow construction of houses next to roads. But steep hills continue to be cut, making the area more vulnerable to earthquakes,” he added. For now, the report has said two teams at the level of the MDDA have been constituted — one, to identify buildings built before and after 2015 in the area, another, to seal and demolish those found in violation of guidelines. The Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology will, concurrently, conduct a detailed survey and prepare a report on landslide-prone areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-gave-permits-to-flatten-14-hillocks-in-6-years/articleshow/83014220.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Jaipur||BJP wardens level discrimination charges||Jaipur: JMC-Heritage BJP councillors have alleged that they were facing discrimination in getting their wards sanitised. They claimed sanitisation vehicles are sent three days after request but when Congress councilors make such requests, the vehicles reach the same day. Councillor Rajat Bishnoi alleged that this was an ongoing phenomenon in the corporation areas. “We have to wait for minimum three days before our request is accepted. But if you are a Congress councillor, then it is a cakewalk for you to get any work done because the board is controlled by Congress,” said Bishnoi. Another councillor Subhash Vyas alleged that the Congress board and its councillors were doing cheap politics in the corporation. “We have to shout our lungs out if we have to get any part of our ward sanitised. There is sheer discrimination and cheap politics in the area. If there are many people infected in any lane, we have to wait for many days, but for Congress councilor everything is just a call away. Even in development work, our wards are not preferred,” said Vyas. Refuting the claims made by the councillors, Ashish Kumar, sanitation in-charge in JMC-heritage said, “This is not true as we don’t even know who is a BJP or Congress councillor. For every individual request, immediate arrangement is made.” Councillor Kusum Sharma said there is discrimination even in the vaccination drive. “Last time when a vaccination camp was organised, BJP councilors were not informed. Even on the day of vaccination, Congress workers were given preferences instead of sanitation staff of corporation. This is a bad politics going on amidst pandemic,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-wardens-level-discrimination-charges/articleshow/83018408.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We have had 10 papers regarding Covid published in international journals while 15 more are in pipeline,” he added. Reacting to allegations made by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) that Ramdev had turned antagonistic towards IMA as well as allopathy after the doctors’ national body sought information under RTI about Patanjali’s Divya Swasari Coronil Kit in February this year, questioning its efficacy, Balkrishna said that Patanjali had cleared all the necessary scientific and administrative requirements before launching its drug. “Ever since Patanjali came up with Coronil, there had been repetitive attempts by allopathy doctors to suppress our medicines even though we have earned our licence to manufacture this drug only after submission of relevant evidences and clinical data to all the stakeholders.” He added that he is extending an invitation to allopathy doctors, scientists and other experts to have an open discussion on the subject with Patanjali’s team of scientists and Ayurveda doctors at a time and place of their choice. “Science is science. Just because the work has been done by someone who professes faith in Indian culture and tradition and is clad in an ascetic’s clothes, it cannot be denied or underestimated. If anyone feels that we are wrong, we are open to discuss and debate on our research works.” Conveying gratitude towards doctors who laid down their lives in the line of duty while treating Covid patients, Balkrishna said, “We are thankful to each and every doctor — irrespective of whichever treatment modality they practice— who worked towards saving human lives during this crisis.” On questions being raised on how Ramdev can comment on treatment modalities even though he doesn’t hold any medical degree including in Ayurveda, Balkrishna said, “His work defines who he is and that is the best answer for those who are questioning his credentials. He has pioneered an organisation that has around 500 top-level scientists doing research on diseases and their cures. Today, Patanjali is giving free consultation across its 2500 clinics and has cured over 5 crore patients. All this has been done under the vision and guidance of Swami Ramdev.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/drdo-covid-drug-based-on-patanjali-research-says-ramdev-associate-balkrishna/articleshow/83014261.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Most challenging experience, say heroes of Navy’s rescue operation||MUMBAI: “It was the most difficult rescue operation of our lives. We had to ensure the survivors did not panic as it would have made the rescue process more difficult. However, at least three exhausted and traumatised survivors lost their grip on the net and fell into the water again. We jumped into the waters to bring them near the net so that they could be pulled up,” recalled Petty officer Anil Singh, one of the divers who participated in the Indian Navy’s search and rescue operation for the survivors of the vessels that went adrift and capsized during Cyclone Tauktae. TOI on Thursday spoke to the teams of divers, helicopter pilots and others who were part of a massive rescue operation launched after four vessels went adrift in the high seas. The operation by various rescue ships ranged from 36 hours to 142 hours between May 17 and May 23 before the Navy handed over the SAR to the Coast Guard on May 24. Amit, a marine commando, said, “We have sailed in rough seas earlier, but nothing could compare with this experience. Even retrieving bodies was difficult due to the huge waves.” Another diver, Kirtisagar Baral, said he dived from a height of 15 feet into the rough seas as Cyclone Tauktae unleashed its fury. Baral’s team rescued five survivors and recovered 16 bodies. Several members of the rescue team said anxiety levels among their own families were high too. “Our family members were watching the news on TV and getting worried, but we couldn’t even talk to them as the rescue operation was our priority,” said E Satish Chowdary, a part of the rescue team. An engineer on board one of the rescue vessels, Vishwakant said besides the choppy seas, another problem they encountered was the garbage which they had to constantly filter from the engines to ensure maximum speed levels. Lieutenant commander Raghvendra Dixit, one of the two pilots of a Sea King helicopter of INS Shikra, said stationing the helicopter in one position was a challenge. “We went to Gal Constructor and rescued 25 people. There was no visibility and wind speed was very high,” said Dixit. The Navy warships’ mess was converted into a hall and the crew handed over clothes and blankets to the survivors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-most-challenging-experience-say-heroes-of-navys-rescue-operation/articleshow/83022666.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Arun Chaudhary, who was recently caught on camera chasing a BJP supporter with a pistol in hand and was booked under attempt to murder charge, joined the ruling party in presence of senior leaders. Chaudhary is the husband of a recently-elected district panchayat member in Meerut. Justifying Chaudhary’s induction into the party, Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal said, “These are all politically-motivated cases. There was no injury or assault but an FIR was registered. We have investigated his (Chaudhary’s) background before inducting him. He does not have a criminal record.” Based on the complaint of the victim, Indrajeet, an FIR under section 307 (attempt to murder) and 352 (assault) was registered against Chaudhary and his aide Ishu at Inchauli police station in the district. The alleged incident took place on May 10. Chaudhary had been hiding since the case was filed. “We already had a non-bailable warrant against him from the court,” said Keshav Kumar, Meerut’s superintendent of police (rural).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/wanted-in-attempt-to-murder-case-husband-of-district-panchayat-member-joins-bjp/articleshow/83014259.cms||Piyush.Rai

School education department minister Bratya Basu, along with the heads of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the West Bengal Council of Higher secondary Education, will give out the details. Given the pandemic and the quick spread of the virus, all safety guidelines would be maintained during the board exams, said the CM, adding the duration of the exams had been curtailed to 90 minutes instead of the usual three hours. “The students will appear only in major subjects,” Banerjee added. She said candidates would be allowed to appear for the exams from their home centres as that would be convenient for the students and they would not have to commute far by public vehicles to other schools. “The HS exams are being held in the last week of July as they will subsequently take admission to higher education institutes at various colleges and universities and some will even go abroad. They will need to produce the mark sheets for admissions. Class XII students also have to compete with others in national and international entrance exams. Hence, priority has been given to HS students and their boards exams will be held before the Class X boards,” Banerjee said. Question papers, which have already been prepared, will remain unchanged. Students will be able to get extra choices while answering the questions. “We do not want to stress out students in such a pandemic situation,” assured Banerjee. “Rather, students should be relaxed when taking the tests.” Tests on seven compulsory subjects in Madhyamik and 15 in HS will be conducted. “More than 12 lakh candidates will sit for the Class X boards and around 8.5 lakh students for HS exams. The evaluation of additional subject papers will be done internally by schools and scorecards will be prepared for the tests,” said the CM. The question paper collection and distribution will be done through the local police stations. If police stations are located far away, other government buildings will be used to store question papers. For Madhyamik, the answer scripts will be collected from schools and stored in the same location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/madhyamik-in-2nd-week-of-aug-hs-in-july-end-week/articleshow/83018447.cms||Somdatta Basu

The accused, Gyanesh Kumar Sharma and Prakash Mishra, residents of Naubasta area, were travelling in a black SUV with words ‘High Court' embossed on the registration plate, when they were stopped at Chunniganj locality and arrested on a tip-off. Besides, amphotericin injections, Rs 1.8lakh in cash and five mobile phones were seized. Earlier, the Kanpur police had tracked down a huge consignment of fake Remdesivir drug, which is key to treating Covid-19. Police confirmed to TOI late Thursday that NSA will be slapped on the accused. “We are trying to ascertain how many fake Liposomal Amphotericin B injections have been sold. The accused have disclosed names of conduits, Pankaj Agarwal of Prayagraj, Madhuram Bajpai of Yashoda Nagar and Shubham Tiwari of Kidwai Nagar, who are peddling fake black fungus injections and making fast buck,” said Gwaltoli police outpost in charge Surendra Kumar. An FIR was lodged under five sections of IPC against the arrested duo. A police team has swung into action to nab those from whom the duo purchased the fake vials. Raids have been launched in Prayagraj and cops are trying the smash the network dealing in fake black fungus drug, which is in high demand after a spurt in cases. Liposomal Amphotericin-B is used to treat mucormycosis or black fungus, which damages nasal track, eyes, sinuses and sometimes the brain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/68-vials-of-fake-black-fungus-drug-seized-from-suv-in-kanpur-2-arrested/articleshow/83020773.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

There could be endless other reasons behind the failure of his kidneys, and it is not correct to attribute kidney failure after taking our medicines for only three days.” Balkrishna added that “allopathy doctors have used the world as their ‘guinea pigs’ and conducted trials on the masses and simply targeting Ayurveda for vested interests is not good”. “Is there any account of how many patients have died after taking drugs like Remdesivir, and how many patients have turned critical and died after taking allopathic medicines in the past? Why are these questions left unanswered in case of allopathic treatment?” Balkrishna asked. Meanwhile, Dr Khanna said that IMA had asked a team from Patanjali to have a face to face debate with them. “We will answer 25 of their questions but they will also have to answer five of our questions,” he said. adding that he has also written to both Ramdev and Balkrishna, asking them to show the proofs of their educational qualifications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/simply-targeting-ayurveda-for-vested-interests-not-good-balkrishna/articleshow/83014280.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Over 2,000 MBBS graduates to serve Maharashtra public healthcare this year||MUMBAI: More than 2,000 MBBS graduates from the class of 2021 will join government hospitals and assist in the fight against the coronavirus. This year’s cohort will be the largest that will service the mandatory MBBS bond compared to the paltry 10% of graduates who opt to join the state’s public healthcare system each year. In addition, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) has served notices to those who have not serviced their bond in the past three years and expects them to join too. The rapid influx of additional staffers would hopefully ease the pressure of the current residents who have been working tirelessly through the two waves of the pandemic. Data from the DMER shows that over 2,100 of the 2,479 MBBS graduates have applied to serve in public hospitals and healthcare centres for a year and merely 38 have opted to pay the charges of Rs 10 lakh and not serve the bond. With the PG-NEET being pushed till beyond August-end, those from the class of 2020, who are currently in-service, would complete their bond and then take the postgraduate entrance test. “We have also served notices to those who have not serviced their MBBS bond in the past three years and hope to press more doctors in the system,” said Dr T P Lahane, DMER head. “Under the Pandemic Act, the government has said that action will be taken against those who do not service the bond. Also, with the PG-NEET being pushed to August, students now have a window to service the bond and cut at least a portion of their year-long bond.” Interestingly, graduates who clock the bond tenure partially, can choose to complete the same after postgraduation, if they take the PG- NEET and secure a seat. Former DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said the number of interns pressed into duty was “impressive”. “Merely 10% of graduates service the bond and another 10%-12% pay the bond charges of Rs 10 lakh.” From the class of 2018, of the 2,214 students, 278 served the bond and 239 paid the fee. But many graduates from this batch, who would have taken two attempts of the PG-NEET but not secured a seat, would now have to complete their bond. Students from 2019, 2020 and 2021 batches who have not yet signed up for the service would also be brought into the fold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-2000-mbbs-graduates-to-serve-maharashtra-state-public-healthcare-this-year/articleshow/83020889.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Dehradun||How Uttarakhand locals are helping Nepalese amid pandemic||PITHORAGARH: Covid patients and those suffering from post-Covid complications in Nepal are reaching out to friends in India living in border towns to get help in procuring treatment and medicines. In one such incident, Sarita Panthi, a Covid-positive patient from Kanchanpur in Nepal, was helped by her Facebook friend in India, Randeep Pokhria, a resident of Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar district. Panthi needed some medicines for her treatment which were not easily available in Nepal. She reached the border of Banbasa on May 25, where Pokhria was waiting for her with an ambulance organised with the help of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. “Sarita had been down with fever for some days. She had received both doses of Covid vaccine a month ago but still tested positive for it. I asked her to come to the Indian checkpoint at Banbasa from where our ambulance got her to Khatima. She came here wearing a PPE kit and was treated for a few hours at a private hospital, she also purchased some essential medicines. Then she was dropped back at the border,” said Pokhria. In a video message, Panthi thanked Pokhria, who she met for the first time in Khatima, for going out of his way to provide her timely help. She also thanked the doctors and the ambulance driver for their support. In another incident, Sanjay Agarwal, a resident of Banbasa, was approached by two Nepalese -- Vikram Chand from Chandani and Naresh Agarwal form Mahendra Nagar in Nepal – for help in procuring antiviral drug, Favibluz 400mg, and medicine for cough and cold. “They sent me their doctor’s prescription on Whatsapp and I purchased the medicine here. Then I went to the Indian checkpoint and handed over the medicines to a family member of theirs who was waiting at the border,” told Agarwal. A few months ago, 15-year-old Rekha Dhami was admitted to a hospital in Dhangadhi, Nepal and needed intravenous immunoglobulin for her Covid treatment. But since IVIG was not available in their town, they approached their friend Harish Chand, living in Tanakpur, Champawat district, for help. Chand promptly procured the prescribed 70 mg of IVIG from Moradabad and handed it over to Dhami’s parents at the Indo-Nepal border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/people-in-ukhand-help-covid-patients-in-nepal-cross-the-border-and-get-treatment/meds-in-india/articleshow/83014295.cms||Prem Punetha

Police said the girl had gone out of her house early in the morning when the accused dragged her into his shop and raped her. An FIR was registered under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and appropriate sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, said police, adding that the accused was absconding and multiple teams were deployed to nab him. Police said the crime took on a communal turn as the accused belonged to another community, and thus, a police force was deployed in the village to ensure peace. The girl was sent for a medical examination and police recorded her statement. In his complaint, the girl’s elder brother alleged that when the family found the girl missing from the house, they started searching for her and heard her screaming coming from a shop locked from inside. When they knocked at the door repeatedly, the accused fled the spot and they found the girl lying semiconscious inside the shop, alleged the brother, adding that his sister told the family that she was raped. Circle officer Desh Deepak Singh, who is probing the case, told TOI, “The girl is a minor, who studies in a school, while the accused is around 25-year-old and runs a furniture shop. I have inspected the spot in the presence of the girl’s family. We have gathered evidence from the village and multiple teams have been deployed to nab the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dalit-girl-15-raped-inside-furniture-shop-in-moradabad/articleshow/83011960.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||District receives 20,000 Covishield and 6,200 Covaxin doses||Pune: The district on Thursday received around 20,000 Covishield and 6,200 Covaxin doses. The resupply, officials said, will provide a temporary boost to coverage in the region. Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Pune district was sent 6,900 Covaxin doses of which 4,200 were allotted to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The PCMC has already run out of that stock. About Thursday's resupply, Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, "Out of the 20,000 Covishield doses, the Pune rural administration was given 10,000 doses. The PMC got 7,000 and the PCMC received about 3,000 doses." From the Covaxin batch, Deshmukh said Pune rural and PMC received 2,500 doses each and the PCMC was given 1,200 doses. He added that the district is likely to receive another batch of doses this weekend, from the state government. For Friday (May 28), the PMC said it will operate around 15 sites in Pune city (offering second doses of Covaxin) and 103 sites (offering both first and second doses of Covishield). In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC chief Rajesh Patil said they could not plan a Covaxin drive for Friday because the resupply landed late on Thursday evening. Patil said only Covishield drives will be held in PCMC limits on Friday — across 65 centres. "On Saturday, we will offer second doses of Covaxin," he said. According to CoWIN data, nearly 24,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated against Covid in the district on Thursday. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid-19 and former director-general of Health Services (Maharashtra), said vaccination coverage in Maharashtra has been impacted due to irregular supply of vaccines from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-receives-20000-covishield-and-6200-covaxin-doses/articleshow/83018457.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A red-faced police department invoked the stringent Gangster Act against Sanjay Singh just a week after the results for the panchayat polls were announced. An award of Rs 20,000 was also announced on any information leading to the arrest of Sanjay. But, again, with local police on his trail, Sanjay appeared in Niwad Khaas village and took the oath for the post of village panchayat, taking everyone by surprise. The case was then taken over the UP Police’s Special Task Force (STF), which finally nabbed him on Wednesday. Sanjay was earlier arrested in February with the consignment of spirit worth Rs 50 lakh, but was soon granted bail. Sanjay used to operate with another notorious criminal Bunty Saini. Moradabad’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Prabhakahr Chaudhary also ordered a probe into the role of local police in Moradabad’s Bhagatpur area in the entire matter. In-charge of STF Bareilly unit, Ajay Pal Singh, said, “Sanjay works closely with gangster Bunty Saini. They deal in manufacturing, packaging and supply of spurious liquor. They prepare liquor using spirit and package them in bottles of branded liquor and sell them in shops.” “Bunty was arrested on May 25. During interrogation, he told us that his close aide Sanjay has taken oath as a village head. So, we gathered more information and arrested Sanjay from an auto stand in Majhola area of Moradabad. We have submitted our report to senior officials and they have assured us of an inquiry in this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/notorious-liquor-smuggler-contests-wins-panchayat-poll-in-ups-moradabad/articleshow/83012073.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Pune||Just 8% of 45+ population fully vaccinated in Maharashtra, 34% have got 1st dose||Maharashtra has fully vaccinated barely 7.6% of its 3.9 crore 45+ citizens, shows data compiled till May 26 by the public health department. The first dose has been given to 34% of this population. A shortage of vaccine has hampered the drive, and the state still has nearly 2.5 crore people in the age group who are yet to receive a shot. Vaccination in two categories — over 60 and 45+ (with underlying conditions) — began on March 1. The drive was opened to all over 45 on April 1. Also, full coverage for healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), which should have been total by now, is still far from the target, said the state family welfare bureau recently. Nearly 1.4 lakh Covishield recipients among HCWs and over 23,000 Covaxin recipients are still to get their second doses till May 23. About 79% have got their first shots. Among FLWs, 92% have got the first jab, but 89,000 are still awaiting the second dose till May 23. The bureau has instructed districts to complete second doses for all healthcare and frontline workers as soon as possible, apart from finishing second doses for the 45+ on priority. This should be followed by diverting remaining doses to improve first-dose coverage among the 45+, the advisory said. Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid control, said, “If 60% of the vulnerable population is fully vaccinated by July-end, along with strict checks on potential super-spreading events, Maharashtra should be better equipped to handle a third wave. An ideal situation would have been simultaneous vaccination coverage of at least 80% in the 45-plus group, 60% of the 18-44 age group, along with public health measures to best tackle another surge.” Experts said vaccine shortages started to show by mid-April and then the government increased the gap between Covishield shots to 12-16 weeks, slowing the drive. “In hierarchical preference, we first need to vaccinate the 60-plus population and then those above 45, apart from focusing on vulnerable groups. Globally, the standard practice during the peak of the pandemic was to finish first-dose coverage in a large population as early as possible. In Maharashtra, by now, first-dosage coverage of the 45-plus group should ideally have been at 70%,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. He said a large supply of vaccines may land within the next three-four months, and 70% of the vaccination process in vulnerable districts should be completed in the three months that follow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-just-8-of-45-popn-fully-vaccinated-in-state-34-have-got-1st-dose/articleshow/83029728.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||Delhi LG notifies black fungus as ‘dangerous epidemic disease’||NEW DELHI: With black fungus (mucormycosis) cases on the rise in the national capital, it has been declared a notified disease under Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. As part of a notification issued on Thursday, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal issued regulations, citing that the city is threatened by the outbreak of the dangerous epidemic disease among immune-compromised patients, especially Covid-19 patients being treated with steroids, and that ordinary provisions of law are insufficient to deal with it. Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations, 2021 will remain valid for one year and all government and private healthcare facilities will have to follow the guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management of mucormycosis issued by the Centre, Indian Council of Medical Research and Delhi government. The healthcare facilities will also have to report every suspected or confirmed case to the health department. As per the new regulations, no person, institution or organisation will be allowed to spread any information or material for management of the fungal infection without prior permission from Delhi government’s health department. In each of the 11 districts of Delhi, a committee under the chairmanship of the chief district medical officer will be constituted, which will have specialists of internal medicine, ophthalmology, ENT and an epidemiologist as members to review any violation by any person or organisation. A notice will be served by the district magistrate if disobeying is proved and the reply will be reviewed by the district committee. Black fungus has already been declared a notifiable disease by many other states. The rise in its count in many parts of the country, including Delhi-NCR, has led to a spike in the demand of Amphortericin B, a key drug for its treatment. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday that the number of black fungus cases had increased to 620 in Delhi even though the medicine needed to treat the rare infection was not available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-notifies-black-fungus-as-dangerous-epidemic-disease/articleshow/83018595.cms||---

The civic body is now left with seven offers from its global bid, all for Russia’s Sputnik V or the Sputnik Light vaccines. Soon after the BMC announced the Czech firm had expressed interest, Pfizer on Tuesday made it clear it would deal only with central governments and hadn’t authorised anyone to import or market the vaccine in India. “If someone has bid, we will evaluate it as per merits of the case,” municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal responded the next day. In fact, the BMC extended the bid till June 1 as it was yet to scrutinise all the proposals it had received. But officials had indicated at problems with the Czech company’s offer as it had asked for 100% advance payment, which the BMC couldn’t make as per the tender terms. Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu told TOI that the company had withdrawn its offer by email. “Verifying all details and checking if the bidders can actually supply the required amount is important. We are setting up video calls with all bidders one by one. Also the mode of payment will have to be laid out. Usually in such a scenario, payment will be made in an escrow account till the stocks are delivered,” said Velrasu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-czech-firm-withdraws-pfizer-vax-offer/articleshow/83018546.cms||---

Of 2.6 lakh tests done in the last 24 hours, 21,273 came positive, a rate of 8.1%, which indicates a significant decline over a month – the rate was 23.6% on April 27. In a presentation by the health department to the state cabinet, it was revealed that the daily positivity has been in single digits since May 22 (9.3%) and continues to gradually drop further. Test positivity in Mumbai has been below 5% for seven of the last eight days. As daily test positivity rates could change due to fluctuations in the number of tests done, public health specialists calculate the positivity rate over a week. If it rate stays below 5% for two weeks, the World Health Organisation recommends that it is safe to tweak lockdown rules. “We have asked districts that have a higher positivity than the state average to conduct focused tests and not inflated the testing numbers by conducting random tests to lower the positivity rate,” said an official. While Mumbai has conducted over 35,000 tests on some days in April, daily tests have been dropping amid lockdown-like restrictions, said BMC officials. “However, despite relatively fewer tests, city’s positivity rate is below 5% on most days,” said an official. On May 23, it was 6.1%; on other days last week it was 4.28-4.9%. National positivity rate too has dropped from 21.25% on May 2 to 18.17% on May 17 and 10.93% on May 27. On Thursday, 1,258 cases were registered in Mumbai; daily cases have been below 1,500 since May 16 when 1,535 cases were logged. The city registered fewer deaths at 36 on Thursday, taking the overall toll to 14,720 so far. The state's addition on Thursday was the lowest in 72 days since March 16 (17,864). With this, total caseload in the state touched 56.7 lakh and with the addition of 425 fatalities and 459 ‘old’ deaths, state's cumulative death toll has touched 92,225. Case fatality rate of the state is on the rise. According to data from the health department, CFR in the month of May has touched 1.76% up from 0.77% in April and 0.38% in March. The recovery rate of the state touched 93% on Thursday and the doubling rate rose to 147 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-positivity-drops-to-single-digit-mumbai-logs-1258-cases/articleshow/83018589.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Jaipur||HC notice to Rajasthan government over squatters on Sikar Rd and Amanishah Nalla||JAIPUR: The high court on Thursday issued notice to the UDH department and JDA on a petition seeking removal of encroachment from Sikar Road and Amanishah Nalla. The division bench of Justice Sabina and Justice M K Vyas issued the order on a PIL. On behalf of the petitioner, advocate Vimal Chaudhary and Yogesh Taylor told the court that the James residential colony in Vidhyadhar Nagar is not being regularised by the JDA and the licence of liquor shops operating illegally are not being revoked by the excise department. They also pointed out that illegal encroachment on the Amanishah Nalla is increasing in this area. Due to the illegal encroachment on the roads by shop owners, the width of the 200-feet link road to Sikar road has been reduced to hardly 100-feet in certain areas. Despite repeated complaints to the department, no action was being taken to address the issue. CHO recruitment: HC seeks response for not filling all postsThe high court has sought replies from the principal secretary, medical and health, NHM mission director and health director for not filling all posts of community health officers (CHO) recruitment 2020 and keeping 457 posts vacant. Justice SP Sharma gave the direction on a petition of Gyarsi Lal Verma. Laxmikant Sharma, counsel for the petitioner said that on August 31, 2020, the Medical Department had issued advertisement for the recruitment of 6,310 posts of CHO on contract. The petitioner also participated in this recruitment and got the documents verified on the release of the results. But the name of the applicant was not included in the final merit list released by the department. When asked, the department said that he got less marks than the cut-off, so he was not included in the selection list. But the department did not even inform the applicant of the marks he obtained. Challenging it in the high court, he said that 457 posts are still lying vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-to-govt-over-squatters-on-sikar-rd-and-amanishah-nalla/articleshow/83018557.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: 21-year-old sarpanch helps bring Covid count down to zero in Solapur village||KOLHAPUR: While many rural areas across the state are being ravaged by an increasing number of Covid cases, in Ghatane — a village with population of 1,500 in Solapur district — the number of cases has been brought down to zero under the leadership of one of Maharashtra’s youngest sarpanchs. When Ruturaj Deshmukh, a 21-year-old science graduate, got his panel elected in January this year and became the village sarpanch, had no idea about the challenges he was going to face in the coming months. In April, death of two residents — a father-son duo — rattled the villagers. It was later confirmed that they both had contracted the Covid infection. Till then, there had been no Covid case in this tiny village that does not even have a primary health centre (PHC). The local residents had to go to the PHC at Narkhed, around 10km away, or to the tehsil place of Mohol, around 20 km away, which had the nearest Covid care centre. When the deaths took place, the villagers started leaving Ghatane to reside in the small huts in their farms. “We asked them not to run away from the problem. Without waiting for anyone’s assistance, we started rapid antigen testing. We covered almost 60% of the residents and found few of them to be Covid positive. After that, we conducted contact tracing. We rushed those testing positive to the Mohol-based CCC. So far, 14 have tested positive and two have succumbed to Covid. However, the last active patient was cured and discharged a couple of days ago,” said Deshmukh. Now, few of the villagers who were staying in their farm huts, have returned. Deshmukh said the battle has not been won yet. “We have distributed Covid safety kits to each house. We have provided masks, sanitisers and soaps in these kits. Also, pulse oximeters and digital thermometers have been given to families with elderly members. So far, we could vaccinate around 70% of the citizens above the age of 45 years. We held vaccination camps. The vaccination process has currently slowed down due to shortage of vaccines. We can say the battle will be won only after we vaccinate every individual in the village,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/21-year-old-sarpanch-helps-bring-covid-count-down-to-zero-in-solapur-village/articleshow/83012274.cms||---
---||Goa||New Mapusa civic body chief chants devpt mantra||Saligao: Shubhangi Vaigankar who took over as the chairperson of the newly elected Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) on Thursday didn’t miss out on any opportunity to chant the development mantra. Vaigankar and Chandrashekhar Benkar were declared unopposed as the new MMC chairperson and vice-chairperson respectively at a special meeting on Thursday. Vaigankar said that whatever decisions she had to take lately were all aimed at the overall development of Mapusa. In the April 23 polls, she had been supported by the Mhapsekarancho Ekvott, a combination of opposition parties whose panel did relatively well, but was far from getting the magic figure of 11 in the 20-member council. On how she felt on now being part of BJP, which she had spoken against during the run-up to the municipal polls, Vaigankar first parried the question, but later said such things happen in politics and at all levels. Stating that she got elected on her own merit, and that she and her husband have been involved in social work for long, Vaigankar said she is willing to do whatever is needed for the development of Mapusa The post of MMC chairperson was reserved for a woman this year. Accordingly, on Wednesday, Vaigankar and Benkar, in the presence of Mapusa MLA Joshua De Souza submitted their nomination forms before chief officer Clen Madeira. As no other nomination papers were received for the two posts, presiding officer Ravishankar Nipanikar declared them as the new chairperson and vice-chairperson. Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza said five councillors have joined the BJP panel and their strength stands at 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-mapusa-civic-body-chief-chants-devpt-mantra/articleshow/83018771.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Health department fails to release vax wastage data, cites bad weather||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government’s department of health, medical education and family welfare failed to publish vaccination wastage data citing inclement weather in many districts, which has been caused by cyclone Yaas. “Vaccination wastage data is being collected manually from each and every session site to avoid any mistake. Due to inclement weather in many districts, the work has slowed down and we are unable to make it public,” Siddharth Tripathy, the nodal officer for IEC wing, told journalists. Tripathy said the differences in data between the Centre and the state arose owing to the mistakes made at the vaccination sites by the data operators. On Tuesday night, the Centre claimed that Jharkhand had wasted 37.3% of all its Covid-19 vaccines. A day later, CM Hemant Soren termed the Centre’s data incorrect and claimed wastage was approximately 4.63%. The department said wastage is even lower. According to the wastage status uploaded by the Centre on the Co-WIN portal, Sahibganj wasted 98.4% of all its doses while Chatra (66.9%) and Simdega (54.1%) were the other two districts which wasted vaccines most in the state. Ranchi had a wastage rate of 8.3% while Hazaribag had over 12%. Meanwhile, Soren on Thursday urged the corporate houses to purchase Covid-19 vaccines for the state’s beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years under their respective corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes. Terming vaccination as one of the important tools to stop the pandemic, Soren said his government is committed to providing free vaccines to everyone in the state irrespective of their caste, creed and religion. “It is the need of the hour that the government and the corporate sector come together for public health. Therefore, I appeal to all corporate houses operational in Jharkhand to ensure awareness and bear the cost of vaccinating the communities, especially within the age group of 18-44 years, residing within their CSR command areas,” Soren wrote, assuring logistics support to the entities. It was not known what the prominent corporate houses and public sector units functional across Jharkhand thought of Soren’s proposal. But many houses remained sceptical about the exercise considering the delay in procurement of vials from the vaccine makers and its transportation. Corporate houses and PSUs have been supporting the state government by donating oxygen concentrators, ventilators, medical cylinders, opening their own hospitals for the public and distributing dry ration in the state’s hinterlands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-fails-to-release-vax-wastage-data-cites-bad-weather/articleshow/83017670.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: Yaas Cyclone pours water on Covid fight, disrupts life||JAMSHEDPUR: Two rivers — Kharkai and Subernarekha — passing through East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts swelled up on Thursday following intermittent rains since Wednesday owing to cyclone Yaas, which has turned into a deep depression. East Singhbhum authorities have intensified rescue and relief operations in areas along the river belt to safeguard residents. Kharkai river was flowing at 132.87 metre, above the danger level of 129 metre, and Subernarekha at 120.18 metre, just a meter short of the danger level of 121.50 metre, on Thursday. Authorities said that the rains also led to inundation and flooding in the low-lying areas. Over 300 houses in Jugsalai, Bagbera, Sonari, Kadma, Mango and Sidhgora in the urban circle are estimated to have suffered flooding. Similarly, reports from different blocks of Ghatshila subdivision confirmed that water gushed into scores of houses in Baharagora, Chakulia, Musaboni and Dhalbhumgarh, among other places. “Shifting of people from the affected areas to the nearest shelter homes is underway and continuous appeal through miking is being done,” East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar said. Notably, 17,000 people have been evacuated to the temporary shelters in the district. The DC also informed that restoration of the electricity and water supply is going on at pace in the district. The NDRF teams have been deployed in the rescue of the people from flooded areas. At a few places in Kadma and Jugsalai, boats were pressed into service to rescue people from flooded houses. “At Gwala basti in Kadma, 35 houses were completely inundated but several families were not willing to shift to safer places as they were unwilling to leave their belongings behind,” said Arup, a social worker, who is helping supply drinking water, food and medicine to affected families. The district administration has suspended the Covid vaccination drive till the next order. Earlier, the drive was stopped for two days in anticipation of cyclone Yaas. In the adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district, the authorities have warned people that heavy rains and gusty winds will continue on Thursday, so the latter should not take the risk of venturing out of their houses. DC Arava Rajkamal said the administration was on alert mode and officials were keeping an eye on the weather conditions. Meanwhile, there was no report of loss of life or any major damage to property from any area in the Kolhan division till the filing of this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/yaas-pours-water-on-cov-fight-disrupts-life/articleshow/83017850.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Reduce Covid beds by 20%, Jharkhand govt tells hospitals||RANCHI: After the dip in the number of new Covid cases in Jharkhand, the state health department has decided to reduce the number of beds reserved at hospitals by 20%. A directive in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh and asked all government as well as private hospitals to put a cap on the number of beds in their Covid wards at 50% of their total capacity. Earlier, the hospitals were asked to keep 70% of their total beds for Covid patients. According to state health department records, a total of 33,652 people have recovered from the virus last week. The active case tally on May 13 was 48,468 which came down to 14,196 on May 26. A total of 620 people succumbed to the virus during the period and 33,652 people recovered. The positivity rate, too, came down substantially during the period. It was 7.7% on May 13 and it stood at about 2.3% on May 26. Speaking to TOI, executives of healthcare facilities in the city said after the Covid beds became vacant, they have already started reducing the beds reserved for such patients. Rims public relations officer Dr D K Sinha said, “We have received the health department directive and it is being implemented. Our super speciality departments, including cardiology, urology and oncology, have been relieved of Covid-19 duties. Moreover, we are also planning to relieve some more wards so that non-Covid patients can be admitted.” Private hospitals have also started reducing the reserved beds for Covid-19 patients and said there were no takers for oxygen-supported beds as the patient inflow has reduced. “Earlier we had a total of 189 beds for Covid-19 patients and we have reduced it to 90 after the directive. As the patient inflow is less, we will be using the unoccupied beds for people with post-Covid-19 complications or non-Covid patients,” Medica hospital, Ranchi, general manager Anil Kumar said. Chief administrative officer of Orchid medical centre, Dr P K Gupta, said, “The 20% reduction will be done in oxygen-supported beds as we had increased those after the state government directive. It is a matter of relief for non-Covid patients as we were not able to provide them beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/reduce-cov-beds-by-20-govt-tells-hosps/articleshow/83017760.cms||---
---||Vadodara||After lull, vaccination gains momentum in Vadodara||VADODARA: After the initial hiccups, Covid-19 vaccination seems to be gaining momentum in the city with around 20,000 persons taking jabs every day. This includes more than 18,000 in the 18-44 years category whose vaccination had sparked a row. Overcoming the earlier problems regarding availability of slots for vaccination and alleged shortage of doses, things have gradually fallen in place. Officials said hat nearly half the adult population eligible for the vaccine have already taken at least the first dose. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had initially started vaccination for the 18-45 years age group with 38 session sites. This has now been increased to 100 sites, of which 30 also cater to other categories. The number of available slots for 18-44 years’ age group stands at 20,000 each day. While the slots are completely booked every day, the highest number of doses administered stood at 18,965 on Thursday. Many persons book the slots, but do not turn up for vaccination. VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that there was no shortage of doses and slots were also available. “More than per cent of those who book slots come for vaccination which is a good number,” he said. Patel said that based on the electoral rolls, the number of adults eligible for vaccination in the city stood at 13 to 14 lakhs. Put of this population 5.97 lakh have already taken the first dose and 1.74 lakh have taken both the doses. If the vaccination continues at this rate, all eligible persons will have at least one dose of the vaccine in around 1.5months. However, officials said that their experience so far suggested that the vaccination slowed down later despite availability of doses. “There is hesitancy or even negligence and a situation emerges where vaccinators have nothing to do for long hours. The present rush is also because of the massive second wave of Covid-19. The sense of urgency may be missing later,” an official said. Patel pointed out that around 15 private hospitals in the city also have permission for vaccination. But they have not been able to procure vaccines so far. Even they may be able to obtain these at a later stage and vaccinate many.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/after-lull-vaccination-gains-momentum-in-vadodara/articleshow/83012847.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Ranchi||Four die in Jharkhand as Yaas Cyclone leaves a trail of destruction||RANCHI: As many as four people, including two minors, died in different parts of Jharkhand as Cyclone Yaas, which entered the state as a deep depression on Thursday morning, left behind a trail of death, deluge and darkness and advanced towards Bihar at midnight. A father and son duo in Ranchi’s HEC colony died in their sleep after the wall of their collapse after incessant rain early on Thursday. The deceased are identified as Shakar Varma, 25, and his 11-month-old son Rishabh. Another minor, eight-year-old Pallavi Kumari, a Class II student of Madangundi government middle school in Koderma, died when a wall near her house collapsed and she came under the debris around 2pm. One more person, Vinod Yadav, a milkman died after he was struck by lightning on Wednesday evening in Bokoro’s Gomia block. Confirming the deaths, state disaster management department secretary, Amitabh Kaushal, said all four families of the deceased would be compensated under provisions of the Disaster Management Act. “Though the death due to lightning is not included in the central list of disasters, the Jharkhand government has a separate provision for such calamity and the victim’s family are compensated with Rs 4 lakh ex gratia,” he said. Meanwhile, several dozen kuchcha houses collapsed, while make-shift shops and bridges were swept away as rivers continue to flow over the danger mark. Blackouts were also reported from several places after the power infrastructure was hit by the storm. In the Kolhan division, 17,000 people were evacuated to safer places preventing loss of life. Water from the cyclonic rain and overflowing rivers and drains entered houses in low-lying areas near Subarnarekha and Kharkai in East Singhbhum. There reports of damage to even pucca houses in some parts of the state. In Bokaro, roof springs fell of the BSL quarters. A newly-built bridge over Kanchi river under Tamar block of Ranchi district that connects Bundu-Rahe and Ichagarh was swept away. The bridge was constructed three years ago and was awaiting inauguration after the approach roads were being built. In Khunti, a huge tree fell over the power cables, resulting in a complete power cut in the district. Though the disaster management department is yet to ascertain the value of loss to property across the state, it is estimated that the power infrastructure suffered the maximum damage. Prabhat Kumar Srivastava, the general manager of JBVNL, Ranchi, said, “At least 60 electric poles and 15 transformers were damaged over the past 24 hours. Most of the damage was reported from Khunti, Torpa, Ratu, Brambey, Kanke, Nagri, Tatisilwai, Angara, Silli, Lodhma and Tetri among others. The damage was suffered after trees and large branches fell on overhead power distribution lines. Repair work and restoration of normal power supply have been undertaken on war-footing.” Most rivers in the state, including Tajna in Khunti, Subarnarekha in Ranchi, Safi in Chainpur block of Gumla and Bhairvi near Rajrappa temple in Ramgarh, are flowing in full spate. The overflowing Safi river swept away a road diversion while the Bhairvi river destroyed makeshift shops selling puja items and eateries near the Rajrappa temple. In a record of sorts, the Ranchi office of the IMD said Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Daltonganj broke all previous records of rainfall in one day during the month of May. Meanwhile, Chaibasa received extremely heavy rainfall and recorded 207.8 mm, as predicted, Ranchi recorded 151 mm breaking the record of May 17, 1990, when 72mm rainfall was reported in one day in May. Similarly, Jamshedpur reported 108.1mm rainfall which was higher than the previous record of 104mm recorded on May 27, 2017. Daltonganj also recorded 47.3mm rainfall to break the record of 42.3mm reported on May 7, 2014. Other areas of high rainfall included Mandar block of Ranchi which recorded 182mm followed by Chakradharpur block of West Singhbhum with 133.6mm and Torpa block in Khunti recording 116mm rainfall. The rain caused by Yaas pushed the monthly rainfall of the state by over 800% than normal as 17 out of 24 districts reported excess rainfall. Director in charge of Ranchi IMD, Abhishek Anand, said the deep depression that entered Jharkhand through West Singhbhum on Wednesday midnight weakened into a depression after shedding moisture. “It is very likely to weaken further into a well-marked low-pressure zone by Friday as it enters Bihar. The direction of the system is mostly northwards now,” he said. “Under the influence of the well-marked low-pressure system, parts of northern Jharkhand may continue to receive rainfall along with southern districts of Bihar,” he added.

---||Ranchi||Yaas Cyclone: Bad weather stalls vax, testing drive in 7 districts, footfall minimal in others||RANCHI: Cyclone Yaas, which turned into a deep depression after entering Jharkhand, stalled the Covid-19 vaccination and testing drive in at least seven districts — East Singbhum, West Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Latehar, Chatra, Khunti and Lohardaga — on Thursday, said officials of the health department. Siddharth Tripathy, the nodal officer for the health department’s IEC wing, said, “In other districts, testing sites and vaccination centres remained open but there was minimal footfall.” Owing to the inclement weather, the Ranchi administration on Thursday stalled its scheduled launch of the mobile Covid-19 vaccination programme. Health minister Banna Gupta was due to flag off the vans. The health department also said Jharkhand has reported 27 confirmed cases of Mucormycosis (black fungus) and nine fatalities so far. Apart from that, 36 people are suspected to have been affected by the disease. “As on Wednesday, we had 1,957 vials of Amphotericin and 160 vials have been received. We are expecting a fresh consignment of the medicines from the Centre very soon,” Tripathy said. Meanwhile, the ongoing Covid-19 screening exercise in rural areas of Jharkhand has shown a high prevalence of diabetes, high blood pressure and tuberculosis among suspected Covid-19 patients. Around 9.42 lakh families living in rural Jharkhand have been screened so far in the drive which kicked off on May 25. Of around 43.5 lakh people who were screened, the department claimed to have conducted rapid antigen tests (RAT) on 29,174 people after they showed signs of Covid-19. Of the total people tested, 748 people were found to be positive for Covid-19. Seven such Covid-19 patients were shifted to nearby Covid-19 care centres after their health parameters deteriorated. Parallel screening of the people who were tested through RAT kits revealed that 3,309 of them had tuberculosis, while 24,512 people had diabetes. Around 25,519 people were found to have high blood pressure. “The ongoing drive will continue till June 5. Our target is to screen 52 lakh families living in the rural areas in this drive,” Tripathy said. However, the ongoing drive is expected to slow down in the next couple of days owing to the heavy rains being caused by Yaas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bad-weather-stalls-vax-testing-drive-in-7-dists-footfall-minimal-in-others/articleshow/83017641.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Both Ghanashyam and Damodar were in the race for the top post. While Ghanashyam had staked claim on the basis of his seniority – he has won the civic polls for the third time – Damodar had expected Kamat to reward him with the post for his long-time loyalty. Speaking to reporters, Ghanashyam “condemned” Kamat’s decision of ceding the chairperson’s post to GFP.

---||India||Covid vaccines in short supply world over, says Centre||NEW DELHI: Vaccines are in limited supply globally and manufacturers have given preference to countries of their origin just as has been the case in India, the government said on Thursday responding to criticism that it has not done enough to source anti-Covid shots from abroad. “Companies have their own priorities, game-plans and compulsions in allocating finite stocks. They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine-makers have done unhesitatingly for us. As soon as Pfizer indicated vaccine availability, the government and the company are working together for the earliest possible import of the vaccine," a detailed press release explaining the vaccine situation said. In a separate media interaction, NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul said, "US-made vaccines went in a big way to US and that was taken by them (vaccine manufacturers) as a priority... Now that vaccine requirement for their country of origin has been met to a large extent, their production capacities are rising and they are confident of the market and success of vaccines, there will be vaccines that will be available for others to take. But clearly the countries of origin have been an important priority for producers of vaccines." The Centre defended its new vaccine policy and asserted that those calling for “more vaccines” were well aware of supply constraints. The provision for states to procure vaccines was in response to an explicit demand by several states and leaders. "It is pointed out that health is a state subject and the liberalised vaccine policy was a result of the incessant requests being made by states to give states more power." The government said the very fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what the states were being told from day one—that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice. The statement was issued by Dr Paul, who also heads the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), with the title "Myths and Facts" and said it sought to set right "distorted statements, half truths and blatant lies.” Countering the allegation that the Centre has abdicated its responsibility to the states, Paul said, “The fact is that the central government is doing all the heavy-lifting, from funding vaccine manufacturers to giving them quick approvals to ramping up production to bringing foreign vaccines to India. The vaccine procured by the Centre is supplied wholly to the states for free administration to people.” “All this is very much in the knowledge of the states. The government has merely enabled states to try procuring vaccines on their own, on their explicit requests,” he added. “The states very well knew the production capacity in the country and what the difficulties are in procuring vaccines directly from abroad. In fact, the government ran the entire vaccine programme from January to April & it was quite well-administrated compared to the situation in May,” Dr Paul said. “But states, who had not even achieved good coverage of healthcare and frontline workers in three months wanted to open up the process of vaccination and wanted more decentralisation,” he added. Speaking on vaccine allocations, he said, “The Centre is allotting enough vaccines to the states in a transparent manner as per agreed guidelines. In fact, states are also being informed in advance of the vaccine availability. Vaccine availability is going to increase in the near future and much more supply would be possible.” In the non-government channel, states are getting 25% of doses and private hospitals 25% doses as well. “However the hiccups and issues faced by the people in the administration of these 25% doses by the states leave a lot to be desired. The behaviour of some of our leaders, who in spite of full knowledge of the facts on vaccine supply, appear on TV daily and create panic among the people is very unfortunate,” Dr Paul added. As far as allegations that the Central government is not doing enough to ramp up domestic production of vaccines, he said, “The government is playing the role of an effective facilitator to enable more companies to produce vaccines from early 2020. The estimate of production of over 200 crore doses by our vaccine industry by the end of 2021 is the result of such efforts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccines-in-short-supply-world-over-says-centre/articleshow/83023880.cms||---

Illegally extracted laterite stones were also seized from the site. It is learnt stone extraction was being carried out on a large scale in the village, disturbing the environment. A complaint was lodged with the department of mines. Gawas said the police have been directed to patrol the area twice a day to keep vigil on any illegal operations as there are several dormant mines in the village which can be excavated by miscreants. He said necessary action will be initiated against the person or persons operating any illegal laterite quarries in Sattari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/raid-on-illegal-stone-quarry-at-pissurlem/articleshow/83019101.cms||---
---||Goa||Frenzied road digging at Colva has locals worried about their safety||COLVA: Hectic digging work is on in Colva in a bid to lay a sewerage pipeline just before the onset of the monsoon. The frenzied pace of work is to meet the June-end deadline set by the high court of Bombay at Goa for completion of laying of the 3.4km sewerage line and filing of a compliance report. Public works department assistant engineer Armstrong Fernandes said that there is also a clause in the contract of the Sewerage Corporation that mandates the soling of roads to be completed before the commencement of the monsoon. Earlier this year, while hearing a public interest litigation, the court had directed the government to complete the sewerage treatment plant and make it operational by June so there is no discharge of untreated sewage into the Colva creek. The pace of work, however, has locals worried about their safety. The order of the high court is being misconstrued, said pancha Pio Furtado. “People’s lives cannot be put at risk because of misinterpretation of the court’s order. Let the Sewerage Corporation and the tourism director inform the court that work has been stalled because of the rains,” he said. The roads leading to the sewage treatment plant were initially dug to construct sewage chambers. They were later packed with just mud and rubble. Now, with road excavation work being undertaken while the monsoon is just round the bend, it is anybody’s guess whether soling of the roads will be undertaken in time, Furtado said. When asked whether he has written to the panchayat to issue a notice to the contractor to do up the excavated road in his area, pancha Domingoes Rodrigues said no, but added that he has requested the person operating the excavator to immediately fill up the area after the pipes are laid. Colva panchayat secretary Rajendra Naik said he too has not yet issued any notice to the contractor, but would do so in the near future. Calls to the Sewerage Corporation work in-charge Bushan, however, remained unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/frenzied-road-digging-at-colva-has-locals-worried-about-their-safety/articleshow/83019199.cms||---

Strong winds blew off the roof causing damage of around Rs 40-50 lakh. Walls, furniture, garden, copier machine, computer peripherals besides benches, tables, books etc. were damaged. School authorities informed that the deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, in whose constituency the school is located, took stock of the damage and apprised the chief minister Pramod Sawant of the the damages the school has suffered in the cyclone. Later, Sawant too visited the school. The blown off material of the roof was seen scattered around in the bushes almost 200m away from the school premises, as per the account of an eyewitness. The school is situated about 2 kms from the coast, on a rocky tract, and is exposed to winds sans any green cover. School headmaster submitted a report of the damage caused to the structure to the higher-ups.

The estimated cost of the new building is Rs 2.4 crore. The ZAO building has been in a precarious state for several years, posing a serious risk to the staff and visitors. As the deteriorated structure was declared unsafe, three years ago, the office was temporarily shifted to another smaller, congested building in the vicinity. Sattari zonal agricultural officer Vishwanath Gawas told TOI that the dilapidated building is set to be demolished, and a new structure will be constructed at the site. “A proposal for a new ZAO building has been approved by Kavlekar and the agriculture department. A tender has also been issued in this regard. The new building will be constructed on completion of the tender approval process,” Gawas said. Speaking to TOI, Ranjit Rane, a farmer from Sattari, said that since Sattari is considered one of the foremost talukas in the state in farming, the new and spacious ZAO building is needed. He said that the authorities concerned should start the reconstruction work as soon as possible on priority basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-agro-zonal-office-to-get-new-building-kavlekar-gives-go-ahead/articleshow/83019533.cms||---

But, residents of the state capital, who have been under variety of restrictions — lockdown, night curfew, weekend curfew, early closure of shops, only a cluster of shops operating two days a week to a specific area put under lockdown after declaring it “containment zone” — contend that the scope of word “essentials” need to be broadened to allow people carry on with their lives without much hassles during the complete or partial lockdown. “Essentials now mean much more than vegetables, milk, medicines and grocery. You need to have your PC in order because a lot of people are working from home, you need to keep your mobile in order so that you are in touch with people during the lockdown, whether you go anywhere or not, you have to keep your vehicle in order and particularly when you are not using it, maintenance of the vehicle becomes all the more important”, said Pankaj Sharma, a computer professional at Bengaluru, who is working from his home in Bhopal for over a year. “I am waiting for the Unlock so that I am able to buy a slipper more than anything else”, said Kamlesh Singh, a contractor. “At least, the administration can allow small kiosks of cobblers, so as to allow people to get their footwears repaired,” he said. “We need a broomstics. Whenever I go out, my wife tells me to look out for a broom as the old one has lost shape and is not cleaning the floor properly. My daughter tells me to get her favourite pack of snacks, which she has not had for such a long time. They may not be essential goods, but anything becomes essential, when you need them”, said Rishi Shrivastava, a sales executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-prolonged-corona-curfew-unlocks-list-of-essentials/articleshow/83023950.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Choksi’s lawyer in Dominica was said to have claimed that he had been abducted from Antigua by men who sounded Indian and brought to Dominica where he was allegedly beaten up. The purported defence assumes significance because of Antigua and Barbuda’s stand that it would revoke Choksi’s status as its citizen for illegally leaving the country when it was engaged with India over the latter’s insistence to get the fugitive back. Recalling that there was an Interpol red alert for Choksi, Dominica’s home ministry said it was in touch with Antigua and Barbuda to ascertain facts about Choksi. While being silent on India’s effort to get him back, Dominica said it would make “possible arrangements” for his repatriation to Antigua after ascertaining facts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/choksi-illegally-enters-dominica-india-in-touch-to-bring-him-back/articleshow/83023956.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Government staff a worried lot as offices unlock from June||BHOPAL: With the unlock process set to start in the state from June 1, the government employees are once again worried for their safety. The government offices are presently running with the strength of 10%, barring the offices that come under the most urgent services category. The state secretariat buildings have been bearing a deserted look ever since the corona curfew came into force, However, they would once again get crowded, as the government is expected to call its employees with 50% strength after unlock, though a final decision is yet to be made. The secretariat employees feel that the strength of government employees in offices should not be increased in one go. Besides, the corona guidelines should be strictly followed in every office that mainly depends on the department head. Sudhir Nayak, president of the Mantralayin Karmachari Sangh said, in few departments close to 90% of the staff have got corona positive so far. The employees should be called to the office only in case of urgent work and otherwise should be allowed to work from home. The officials and department heads should follow the government unlock guidelines and it should not remain only on papers. Last year a meeting of employees union was called before unlocking offices, but the government did not hold any discussion with employees this time so far, he said, adding in the second corona wave, 200 secretariat employees have got positive while seven lost their lives. The employees are also worried about the central airconditioning system in the two state secretariat Vallabh Bhawan buildings. The employees union demanded the government to shut the air-conditioning system and look for alternatives otherwise it may lead to spread of coronavirus in the secretariat from where all top IAS officials and employees run the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-government-staff-a-worried-lot-as-offices-unlock-from-june/articleshow/83023962.cms||---
---||Nagpur||'Complete failure': Maharashtra lifts liquor ban in Chandrapur district||CHANDRAPUR: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Thursday lifted the long debated liquor ban in Chandrapur district. Minister for relief and rehabilitation, disaster management and guardian minister of Chandrapur, Vijay Wadettiwar, told media in Mumbai that the state cabinet decided to lift the ban “because it was a complete failure”. Following the initiative taken by then finance and forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, the previous BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis had imposed the liquor ban in Chandrapur district on April 1, 2015. Fadnavis, now leader of oppositon in the assembly, termed the MVA government’s decision as unfortunate and one that will leave a long-term impact. “This also shows MVA government has different priorities when it should be focusing on Covid situation in the state,” he said. Wadettiwar said the cabinet took the decision based on findings of a committee headed by retired former principal secretary Ramanath Jha, formed in January this year. The committee had submitted its report on March 9 this year. “The committee had found that illegal, spurious liquor sale had become rampant in the district after the ban. The crime rate in Chandrapur had also shot up. Offences were registered against over 4,000 women who were found directly involved in liquor-related crimes. Cases also came up against around 320 children in related offences,” he said. A district-level committee formed in 2020 after Wadettiwar’s appointment as Chandrapur guardian minister had sought opinion of people’s representatives, organizations and individuals over the ban. Out of the over 2.6 lakh representations received by the committee, over 2.43 lakh had favoured lifting the ban as against over 25,000 who favoured its continuation. Both the committees favoured lifting of ban after evaluating its social, financial, health and criminal impact. The ban had led to fall in revenue from Chandrapur district, impacted business, tourism and industries, as per the committees. Around 44,000 offences were registered, illegal liquor worth Rs115 crore seized and over 47,000 persons were arrested for liquor smuggling and related crimes between April 2015 and December-end 2020. As per the Jha committee, the state government lost revenue of Rs2,570 crore, including Rs1,606 rore in excise duty and Rs 964 crore in sales tax, during the five years. A senior police officer was killed and many other cops were assaulted by liquor mafia during the probhibition period. Slamming the MVA government for lifting the ban, Sudhir Mungantiwar said only an anti-people government can take such decision during a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic. “Instead of providing better treatment facility to patients, the government was focused on liquor throughout the year and even waived off liquor licence fee of Rs450 crores in the budget,” he said. The former state finance minister also objected to the reason given that illegal liquor sale was behind revocation of prohibition. “But liquor is similarly sold in Wardha, which is a dry district. Government has now openly admitted its failure in controlling illegal liquor sale,” he said. Activist Paromita Goswami, who had led the agitation to demand prohibition in the district, termed it as “illogical, unwarranted and anti-people decision”. “At time when WHO is suggesting controlling use of alcohol and abusive substances during the pandemic and people are facing livelihood issues, government has lifted the ban on liquor as if it is an essential commodity. What was the urgency?” she said. MP Balu Dhanorkar, who had openly opposed prohibition, said it led to huge loss of revenue. “Tourism in Chandrapur was losing its sheen despite having global tourist attraction like Tadoba. Industrial labourers too suffered due to consumption of spurious liquor,” he said while welcoming the decision to lift the ban. Chandrapur MLA Kishor Jorgewar said prohibition had led to rampant sale of illegal liquor, increased crime and narcotics sale, and caused heavy revenue loss for government. Dhananjay Bapat, owner of a popular resort in Tadoba, claimed that the move will definitely help in boosting tourism. “Resorts aren’t allowed to provide liquor, but tourists having permit can enjoy liquor brought by them in their rooms. Lifting the ban would help in bringing more tourists to Tadoba,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-lifts-chanda-liquor-ban-due-to-its-complete-failure/articleshow/83017669.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Veggies pinch pockets as fresh curbs hit supply||BHOPAL: Vegetable sellers in the state capital have been forced to procure directly from the farm, after administration and police clamped down on temporary selling on the outskirts of the city. As a result, vegetable prices have shot up and consumers are feeling the pinch. Main vegetable hub, Sabzi Mandi at Karond has been under lockdown since corona-curfew came into force in April. There was some respite, as few kilometres away on the Damkheda highway, vegetable produce was being sold. In the last few days, police and administration have clamped down deeming the temporary market as violation of the lockdown. “The only option which remains is getting the vegetables directly from the fields. Surprisingly, the farmers are selling their product at a much higher cost, compared to selling price in Mandi or highway. They realise the opportunity to make more money. Secondly, even if they withhold their produce, the spoilage is limited, as compared to the marketplace, where they have to sell the produce and damage to unsold vegetables is much higher,” said Golu, a wholesale supplier of fruits and vegetables. The hunt to get vegetables lasts for hours. For a shopkeeper in New Market it is a minimum travel of 60 km. “We leave home in wee hours of the morning. It takes about four to five hours to reach our shop. There is no defined area to get the vegetable, it is almost a hunt and hope of getting lucky,” said a shopkeeper. On Thursday morning, vehicle loaded with vegetables were turning away on various check posts. It took almost two hours to navigate alternate routes to reach the destination, he added. Consumers are already bearing the brunt of the newer restrictions. Price of a crate of tomato has doubled to Rs 400. Limited vegetables are on offer. Price of longer lasting foods like potato has almost doubled. Cauliflower and other green vegetables are also in short supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-veggies-pinch-pockets-as-fresh-curbs-hit-supply/articleshow/83023982.cms||---
---||Vadodara||MIS seen in newborns of nCov-infected women||Vadodara: Joy of motherhood for Vaishali Shah (name changed) a new mother soon transformed into bigger worry as her newborn appeared to be lethargic and didn’t make much movement. Diagnosis revealed that the infant was suffering from multiple inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which doctors suspect that it may have been passed on by the mother who was Covid infected during pregnancy. Over last six to seven months, number of newborns suffering from MIS-C has increased significantly, said doctors. “We have had about 18 cases of newborns suffering from MIS-C in the past few months. In many of the cases, the mothers were found to be Covid positive during their pregnancy,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, professor and head of the department (HoD), paediatrics department, SSG. “Chances are that the women passed on the anti-bodies to the babies in the womb. Or it’s possible that the virus may have travelled from pregnant women to the baby resulting in development of anti-bodies. But it is having a severe effect on the newborns,” Aiyer told TOI. “Newborn babies are getting sick and suffering from respiratory diseases apart from hypertension. They are having high inflammatory markers. We are further probing the reasons behind such high number of MIS-C in infants,” Aiyer added. Dr Tushar Shah, a city-based paediatrician, too said that the MIS-C cases among newborns is on the rise. “We have had a few such cases in Kashiben Children’s Hospital. The total number such cases in the city may be above 30. It is possible that the pregnant mothers are passing on anti-bodies to the babies and it is resulting in MIS-C among the newborns,” Shah added. Doctors in Surat too have treated MIS-C among newborn babies in recent times. “Though rare, we have treated newborns with MIS-C in the city,” said Dr Snehal Desai, state secretary of National Neonatology Forum. Doctors said that neonates too develop high-grade fever, rashes and vomiting due to inflamed body parts including hearts, lungs, brain among others. “Parents should be vigil and consult the doctor immediately when their child has high-grade fever, redness in eyes or lips, body rashes and weakness,” Desai, a Surat-based doctor, said. He added that results are rewarding if treatment for MIS-C begins early.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Covid orphans presented with Rs 10 lakh bonds||VISAKHAPATNAM: It turned out to be an emotional time at the Kakinada Collectorate in East Godavari on Thursday as orphan children, whose parents had died due to Covid-19, were presented with a bond of Rs 10 lakh each. This was the first set of bonds that were handed over to such children after chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had announced the scheme. East Godavari collector Muralidhar Reddy handed over the bonds to an 11-year-old girl named Saranya from Thimmapuram village in Kakinada Rural Mandal and to the caregivers of two children from Gokavaram. The second wave has caused many deaths in the state and left many children vulnerable - especially those kids who lost their parents. Therefore, the chief minister had directed officials to make a fixed deposit of Rs 10 lakh for such children. The officials were instructed to carve out a financial package with nationalized banks and that this amount will be kept in a fixed deposit until the child turns 25. The chief minister had also asked the officials to work on providing the best interest amount that the child/guardian can receive every month. Muralidhar Reddy said that the interest amount can be withdrawn every three months after accrual and can be used for their education and basic amenities. He also urged people to inform the Integrated Child Developments Services (ICDS) officials about such children in their areas so that they also may be given such support. Officials said that Saranya’s father V Babji (a lorry driver) and her mother Kumari died while undergoing treatment in Kakinada Government Hospital on May 18 and May 21 respectively. She is currently under the care of her paternal grandparents. Similarly Harish (7) and Sasi (2) from Kolamuru lost their parents P Rajesh (who worked as a painter) and Rani two weeks ago. They are currently under the care of their aunt and uncle who live in Gokavaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-orphans-presented-with-rs-10l-bonds/articleshow/83015470.cms||---

Currently, the active caseload of Covid-19 stands at 24.2 lakh, after a reduction of 35% from 37.4 lakh active cases recorded on May 9. While an average of more than 20 lakh tests are being conducted daily for last nine days, the average weekly positivity has dropped over the last three weeks from 21.5% during April 29-May 5 to 10.4% during May 20-26.   Though the improvement is significant, a positivity rate of more than 10% is a cause of concern and efforts are needed to ensure that it falls below 5% and that high caseload states like Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu remain on a declining path of infections even after lockdowns are eased. Coronavirus pandemic live updates“It is reassuring that we are on the downswing of the second wave but we have achieved this significant change because of restrictions in many states. We do hope and believe that it will be sustained if restrictions open up systematically as the time comes,” said Dr V K Paul, member health in Niti Aayog. “Daily cases have not breached the 300,000-mark since May 17, ” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry said. Daily case positivity has been below 10% for last three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-35-dip-in-active-cases-as-24-states-see-2nd-wave-ebbing/articleshow/83024001.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Vijayawada||Hanuman birthplace debate at an impasse||VIJAYAWADA: The impasse over the birthplace of Lord Hanuman continues. A meeting between the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams pundit committee, which has declared Tirumala as the birthplace, and Sri Hanumad Janmabhoomi Theertha Kshetra Trust was held in Tirupati on Thursday, but there was no headway despite over three hours of deliberations. Govindananda Saraswati Swami, founder of the trust, stuck with his stance and refuted TTD’s claims that Anjanadri hillock in Tirumala was the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. The seer said there is no clarity in TTD’s claims and pointed out that while they conclude that the monkey god was born in Anjanadri, they are sticking to three different birthdates which isn’t conclusive at all. “You can form a committee and within four months time declare that this (Anjanadri) is the birthplace. You need to consult other stakeholders like the Chinna Jeeyar Swami, the Shankaracharya,” Govindananda said. In the evening, TTD’s pundit committee addressed a press meet refuting Govindananda’s claims that Hanuman was born at Anjanahalli on the banks of river Pampa near Hampi in Karnataka. “The swamiji could not prove his point beyond reasonable doubt, while we have cited the puranas and epical evidences to strengthen our claims,” National Sanskrit University vice-chancellor V Muralidhara Sharma, who heads the TTD committee, said. The debate ended with moderator Kuppa Viswanatha Sharma declaring the findings of TTD commitee as “concrete”, while stating that the arguments of the Hampi seer “lacked substance and proper evidence”. His conclusion was, however, rejected by the seer, who said he would take up the issue with other spiritual leaders. “It is crystal clear in the Ramayana as far as the birthplace of Hanuman is concerned. It’s mentioned Kishkinda multiple times and that still stands,” Govindananda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hanuman-birthplace-debate-at-an-impasse/articleshow/83015542.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Weather officials said the heatwave-like conditions will prevail in some parts of the state for the next three-four days due to the effect of cyclone Yaas, which made landfall on north coast of Odisha on Wednesday. S Stella, IMD director for Andhra Pradesh, said the cyclone has sapped moisture from the atmosphere which led to the rise in day-time temperatures in the eastern part of the country. Tuni town in East Godavari district and Jangamaheswarapuram in West Godavari recorded the state’s highest temperature of 41.4 degrees, while it was 48.8 degrees in Vizag city, which was nearly 7 degrees above normal. The city has been experiencing hot and humid weather for the last two days after the rains triggered by the cyclone helped cool down the temperatures till May 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cyclone-yaas-effect-heatwave-like-conditions-in-many-parts-of-state/articleshow/83015636.cms||Nalla.Babu

The officials of school education and women and child welfare departments have made proposals for strong foundational education for pre-primary and primary students as discussed in an earlier meeting. Special focus has been laid on children of age three to eight years who have good brain development. The new proposals also focus on effective utilisation of teachers and providing best education to pre-primary and primary students. YSR Sampoorna Poshana will be implemented as in these foundational schools. The proposals include setting up of foundational schools for pre-primary stages 1 and 2, preparatory and classes 1 and 2. Anganwadi centres will be merged with local primary schools, thus forming foundational schools. In course of the meeting, the chief minister said that he is on a quest to provide quality education to poor students. The CM further said that the government is planning to set up a junior college in every mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-govt-mulls-setting-up-foundational-schools/articleshow/83015672.cms||---

It was only the second time in May that more than 25 lakh shots were provided in one day. April 26 had seen 31 lakh doses being given. After reaching a peak of 41.6 lakh doses on April 6, numbers had fallen for the first three weeks of May to under 16.3 lakh a day and the daily average in the third week was barely over 13 lakh. In the current week, however, three of the four days have seen the 20-lakh mark being breached. Thursday’s push was driven by Andhra Pradesh, which provided over 5.6 lakh shots till 9pm, almost certainly a record for any single state in one day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-28-5l-most-daily-jabs-given-since-april-26/articleshow/83024017.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Village pools in funds for Covid care centre||RAJAHMUNDRY: Gollala Mamidada village of Pedapudi mandal last year had the dubious distinction of recording the first Covid-19 death in East Godavari. A year later, the determined villagers turned things around by setting up a Covid care centre - the first of its kind in the state - in the village with their own funds. The villagers had not only seen the devastating effect of Covid-19 in the first wave but also saw how people were dying due to lack of oxygen facilities in the second wave. Around 500 people in the village were affected by coronavirus in the first wave and despite taking all precautions nearly 200 people were infected in the second wave this year. The caseload decreased this time around but there were 35 casualties as most of them died due to lack of oxygen. This made the villagers to ponder on how to save the lives of the people of not only their village but also surrounding villages. The villagers then took a decision to pool in money and set up a Covid care centre in the village to meet the needs of the people. The villagers planned to convert the rural hospital which was set up in 1966 into a Covid care centre by arranging 30 oxygen beds. The rural hospital had only 18 beds and the villagers built a temporary shed and arranged another 12 beds. They came forward and donated money for the cause and even started a WhatsApp group ‘Mana Oorollu- Mana Gramam’ which means ‘our villagers and our village’ so as to facilitate discussion on setting up the centre. Some of those who donated a handsome amount were Nallamilli Satti Reddy’s family which donated an ambulance worth Rs 8 lakh, Mallidi Srinivasa Reddy, Sabbella Ramalakshmanulu and Chinta Dorababu donated Rs 5 lakh each. The dream became a reality on Thursday when the centre was inaugurated by district collector Muralidhar Reddy and Anaparthi MLA Satti Suryanarayana Reddy. “We wish that villagers across the state take these people as a role model and do their bit to save the lives of people. I am very proud to say that this centre has come up in my constituency and the collector has extended his full support to it,” Suryanarayana Reddy said. Muralidhar Reddy praised the villagers for their stupendous effort and said others should emulate them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/village-pools-in-funds-for-covid-care-centre/articleshow/83015728.cms||Siva G

The airport has overcome procedural delays and is ready for airspace management. Once these facilities are operational, movement of flights will cross 100 from the existing 76 on most days. At present, movement of flights has come down to 14 in view of the Covid-19 situation. The airport has got all clearances including security, safety and naval clearances and international publication of the new facilities, giving ample space to enhance flight movements through new slots. “Airportside infrastructure is ready, terminal building expansion would be completed in a month and cityside infrastructure, that is, car parking area has veen extended to accommodate passengers of new flights. We have got all clearances. We have to fix the date for operations,” airport director Raj Kishore told TOI. Operational planning and coordination with Navy and Airport Authority of India (AAI), besides a joint meeting and trials, are required for commencement. The new parking bays and taxi track have been pending since 2016. Construction has been completed at an an estimated cost of Rs 30 crore. So far, Vizag airport has been disadvantaged by its lack of slots for new flight movements. The airport has Narava hill to one side that restricts landings and take off. “If we have arrival on one side and departure on the other, we can save time. But it is not possible here. Runway occupancy time is high due to one-side operation,” the airport director said. Presently, the airport has N3 and N4 parking bays that are perpendicular while, now the third (N5) has been constructed in an L-shape. “With the new parking bays and taxi track, we can get a chance for two arrivals and two departures in an hour,” Raj Kishore said. “This means we can get 48 additional movements in a day, giving slots to more flights and also night parking. Efficiency of the airfield can be enhanced and slots can be reviewed and enhanced. So new flights can be introduced. Presently, the airport is handling 2.75 million passengers,” Raj Kishore added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/six-new-parking-bays-at-vizag-airport/articleshow/83015832.cms||Siva G

---||Nagpur||NMC ignores but citizens replace damaged manhole covers on their own||Nagpur: When people’s representatives, civic agencies and administration turn the proverbial Nelson’s eye to people’s problems, citizens get down to action. This is what citizens in a west Nagpur locality, along with NGO Janhit, did recently.They covered as many as 15 open manholes cement concrete slabs in Surendragarh at their own initiative and cost. “The aim was to ensure safety of people, especially children, in the coming monsoon season,” said activist and local resident Abhijit Jha. “Sewer line covers had remained broken for years here. The same situation is in the vicinity of Manavseva Nagar and Govinda Gaurkhede complex,” said Jha.According to residents, the damaged manholes in their locality had created accident-prone spots. After repeated complaints to corporators and NMC’s Dharampeth zone to cover them went unheeded for two years, residents collected funds to repair them.Initially, the residents replaced 15 broken manholes. “If NMC still does nothing, we will replace all other damaged manholes by collecting funds from citizens,” said Jha.The residents met Jha and discussed the issue. Along with Janhit, residents launched a drive to collect donations to replace the damaged manhole covers. Jha’s civil engineering degree came in handy. “I designed the manhole covers in such a way that they will last long,” he claimed.“There are around 60 manhole covers that need replacement before the onset of monsoon,” said Janhit member and resident Pravin Bairagi. Satish Mishra, a resident of Surendragarh, said, “We failed to get NMC to act in two years.”The residents claim that they also wanted to teach a lesson to the inactive local corporators whom they elected to address their concerns, in the coming NMC elections. The area is represented by BJP corporators Mayatai Inwate, Vikram Gwalbanshi, Congress corporators Darshani Dhawad and Harish Gwalbanshi. “They are inactive. They ignore the problems citing NMC’s poor finances. We have made up our mind to teach them a lesson in the coming municipal elections,” said Shailesh Bansod, a resident of Manavseva Nagar. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-ignores-but-citizens-replace-damaged-manhole-covers-on-their-own/articleshow/83018056.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The resolution, described by Israel as an attempt to “whitewash crimes committed by the terror organisation Hamas”, was adopted with 24 countries voting in favour and 9 against it. India was among the 14 countries that abstained. The Israel foreign ministry immediately said it was not going to cooperate with the probe. Speaking at the special session on the issue, India welcomed the recently announced ceasefire and called on all parties to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that aggravate tensions and refrain from any further attempts to unilaterally change the existing status-quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. “We remain concerned about the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif/Temple Mount and other Palestinian territories, and about the possible eviction process in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, an area which is part of an arrangement facilitated by the UN,” said the government in its statement. India said it remained firmly convinced that dialogue was the only viable option that can effectively address the issues confronting the region and its people. “Recent developments have once again underscored the need for immediate resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine, aimed at realising the establishment of two States living side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders,’ said Indian permanent representative I M Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-skips-unhrc-vote-on-israel-probe/articleshow/83024044.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Pan shops closed, cigs being routed through grocers||Nagpur: Pan shops closed due to lockdown have pulled down cigarette and beedi sales by nearly 30%, claim dealers and manufacturers. They also accept they have found new outlets to vend the product. The dealers have found grocery stores as the new avenue of vending cigarettes. Sources in tobacco business said salesmen whoused to bringing items like chips and some food items to pan shops are now being tapped by dealers to supply cigarettes to grocery shops. They already have contacts in grocery business. Grocery shops are allowed to open from 7am to 11am which has helped in continuing the sale. However, closure of pan shops has meant the business is substantially down, said dealers. Rishab Lalwani of M/s R K Traders, dealers in tobacco products, said they had kept outlet open as there was no notification ordering shut down. They have been selling other products, apart from tobacco also. “Sales have come down drastically. Earlier we used to easily sell one carton in a day, now it takes a week,” said Lalwani. Beedi makers also claimed to be going through a tough phase. Rasik Patel of Gondia’s Vidarbha Tobacco Products Pvt Ltd which makes the Sher Chhap beedis said the sales were down 50% in rural areas. In cities too, they are reduced by 25% to 30%. The movement of beedis is hampered as it is not an essential commodity. Anil Vadera, a tendu leaves contractor at Gondia, said impact of lockdown on beedi sales is seen on leaf trade too. Beedis are rolled in tendu leaves. The plucking season begins in May and continues till the month’s end. The demand has gradually declined since 2017 and has now taken a major hit due to Covid, he said. “Our firm’s orders have come down to 1.30 lakh bags at present as against 2 lakh in 2017. Beedi manufactures are already having last year’s surplus leaves due to which the supplies which normally go in October will be sent in December,” he said. A source in the forest department though said the tendu auction has been at three year high in the region. Out of 231 units of forest area put up for auction, only 47 remained unsold. In the previous year, 135 units were unsold and the year before 77 units did not find takers. Sources said even the yield of leaves has gone down, due to which higher number units have been auctioned. The low demand from beedi industry continues. A raw tobacco trader said the business continues to run smoothly. “A majority of the tobacco supplies comes from Gujarat. Traders are paying GST and picking the consignment on daily basis. Of course, there is a reduction around 25% due to the lockdown,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pan-shops-closed-cigs-being-routed-through-grocers/articleshow/83018217.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||942/1,114 cases, 75/80 mucor deaths in div are from Ngp||Nagpur: Around 85% (942) of the total number of mucormycosis cases and 94% (75) of the deaths in Nagpur division are from Nagpur district as per data released on Thursday. Barring Gadchiroli, the disease has entered the other five districts of the division. On Thursday, mucormycosis claimed the lives of four people in Nagpur district, 19 new patients were admitted and 14 discharged after recovery. Black fungus (mucormycosis) cases touched 1,114 cases on Thursday with 80 deaths — largely among Covid recovered patients — in Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Wardha. With Nagpur being the worst hit, district collector Ravindra Thakare on Thursday kicked off a comprehensive campaign in 13 talukas. 26 nodal officers have been appointed to supervise the awareness campaigns. They will also coordinate with health workers and do liaising work to step up the vaccination drive, fine-tune preparation before the projected third wave and also manage response towards fungal diseases. Thakare was accompanied by MP Krupal Tumane, zilla parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar and others while sending the nodal officers to different talukas. “Our aim is to reach the rural population before the onset of monsoon and capacity building of the existing doctors outside urban areas,” Thakare said in a video release. On the occasion, IMA representative Dr Prakash Deo stressed on a five-point mantra to fight the Covid third wave and mucormycosis. “This will include door-to-door survey by health workers, collection of data, details of the patient, co-morbidity and conducting RT-PCR or antigen tests,” he said. Dr Prashant Nikhade, president of the district mucormycosis task force, said the numbers of patients in OPD are on the decline. “Hopefully, there would be no overload of cases which can create a backlog or waiting list. In mucormycosis, we cannot afford delays in treatment as the disease spreads fast,” he said, adding that the standard operating procedure (SOP) to treat mucormycosis is yet to be prepared. “If the government manages to provide us ample Amphotericin B, we can save many lives,” said Dr Nikhade. Dr Girish Bhutada, president of the dental association, said the doctors are racking their brains with various measures to overcome the shortage of Amphotericin B and still continue with the debridement (treating the wound) surgeries. “We feel that Covid patients who had fallen ill during the spike or towards the end may take another fortnight to get the fungal attack if at all it affects any of them. We anticipate another lot to return for treatment in some time,” said Dr Bhutada, adding that awareness among doctors have already helped in reducing the number of mucormycosis cases. Dr Ramakrishna Shenoi, professor and head of the oral and maxillofacial surgery in VSPM dental college, also said with Covid cases dwindling coming down, “mucormycosis too may decline with time”. According to yet another Covid task force member, who said on the condition of anonymity, under-dose of Amphotericin B may lead to the fungus becoming a resistant variety in the coming days making the treatment “impossible”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/942/1114-cases-75/80-mucor-deaths-in-div-are-from-ngp/articleshow/83018225.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||In US, Jaishankar alleges plot to taint PM Modi government||NEW YORK: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said that there is “a political effort” to depict the current government in India in a certain way and that there is a difference between the political imagery that has been “concocted” and the actual governance record. During a conversation with former US national security advisor General HR McMaster in a session on ‘India: Opportunities and challenges for a strategic partnership’, presented by the Hoover Institution, Jaishankar also said that India is going through “a very stressful time” right now because of the pandemic. “We are actually giving free food to as many as 800 million people. We’ve put money into the bank accounts of 400 million people. This is what this government did,” he said. “Now, if you are feeding more than two and a half times the population of the US and you are funding more than the population of the US and you’re doing this pretty much anonymously. We’re not asking anything more. There is no criteria of discrimination,” the foreign minister said. “So I think when you come down to real governance judgments, you find that there is a difference between the political imagery that has been concocted and actually the governance record out there. So I think you should take it for what it is, which is really politics at play. I certainly see that very much as part of a political effort to depict our current government in a certain way,” he added. “We Indians are extremely confident about our democracy… India is a deeply pluralistic society,” the minister said. Jaishankar was responding to a question by McMaster on some “Hindutva policies” that could undermine the secular nature of Indian democracy, how he sees internal Indian politics evolving during the trauma of the pandemic and are India’s friends “right to be concerned about some of these recent trends”. “I think what you are seeing in India is the deepening of democracy, a much broader representation in politics and in leadership positions and in civil society of people,” he said. Jaishankar travelled to Washington on Wednesday where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Antony Blinken. It is the first visit by a senior Indian minister to the US after President Joe Biden assumed office in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-us-jaishankar-alleges-plot-to-taint-pm-modi-government/articleshow/83024081.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Pulmonary rehab centre coming up at Amravati||Nagpur: While Covid-19 pandemic is playing havoc in the state, especially during the second wave that began from Vidarbha in February 2021, it has adversely affected reporting of tuberculosis cases too. TB reporting, which was constantly rising in the last 5 years, came down by 30% in 2020-21 due to the pandemic outbreak. This year, a full-fledged pulmonary rehabilitation centre (PRC) will be started at Amravati’s Government TB Hospital which will benefit not only TB patients but also patients who have recovered from Covid-19 and having post-Covid lung issues. “Maharashtra’s TB programme undertook several pivotal measures to ensure availability of TB care for all those who needed it. Over 8 crore people were screened for TB in the state,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, family welfare, directorate of health services, Maharashtra, at a virtual media briefing organized by the state TB office. State TB officer Dr RS Adkekar said the drop in reporting TB cases was due to Covid-19 conditions. “Several hospitals were converted into Covid-19 facilities, which affected passive surveillance. Routine surveillance also declined as health department manpower was diverted to Covid-19 duties. Moreover, diagnostics facilities like x-ray facilities, CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) and TrueNat were diverted for Covid-19 tests. Still, Maharashtra’s TB programme has been a frontrunner in implementing innovative strategies to control and eradicate TB,” said Dr Adkekar. State TB officials were confident that the targets set for 2025 will be achieved despite loss of time and resources during the pandemic year. Goals like 80% reduction in TB incidence (reduction from 217 per lakh in 2015 to 44 per lakh in 2025), 90% reduction in TB mortality (from 32 per lakh to 3 per lakh), and 0% patient having catastrophic expenditure due to TB have been kept intact and the administration was confident to achieve these goals. BOX Very few cases of Covid-TB connect in Maha Sharing interesting data, state TB officer Dr RS Adkekar said 25% of the 19,02,718 Covid-19 patients reported between October 30, 2020 and April 30, 2021 were screened for TB in Maharashtra. Out of them, only 5,264 (0.27%) were diagnosed with TB. On the other hand, 57% of total reported TB cases (1,03,522) in the state were screened for Covid-19, and only 571 of them were diagnosed with Covid-19. This means, only 1% of TB patients had Covid-19 infection and less than 0.30% of Covid-19 patients had TB. This is eventually good news as both the diseases, with different treatment lines, can be treated separately. Need For The PRC People are developing symptoms of lung conditions like cough, breathlessness, lung fatigue after recovering from Covid They will get physiotherapy, breathing exercises including yoga, dietary guidance, psychiatric counselling and medication Facilities like test on spirometer and respirometer will be available for post-Covid as well as TB patients in Vidarbha||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pulmonary-rehab-centre-coming-up-at-amravati/articleshow/83018292.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Delhi||Delhi: Stephanian, 18, who aided patients, dies of Covid||NEW DELHI: A first-year history honours student hailed by his classmates and teachers as “bright” and “an allrounder”, and who was part of St Stephen’s College’s efforts in helping Covid-19 patients find hospital beds and precious oxygen, fell to the virus on Tuesday. Satyam Jha (18), who had passed out of Kolkata’s St Xavier’s Collegiate School with 99% in his Class XII board exams and wanted to become a civil servant, lost his life in Rajasthan’s Kota. He was in the town with his mother and elder brother, who is preparing for his medical entrance examination. Stephen’s pays tribute to fallen studentJha, a native of Howrah’s Bally, was actively involved with the college’s Covid resource team, helping out patients. John Varghese, St Stephen’s principal, paid a tribute to Jha in an article titled “Pandemic to Panacea” that was uploaded on the college website. Students held a candlelight vigil at the college residence in his memory. “Satyam was admitted to a hospital with a lung infection. When the family didn’t like the facility, they shifted him to another hospital. He condition worsened, but he was not put on the ventilator. His last rites were performed there itself,” said a family acquaintance. Varghese’s article read, “The pandemic has brought the world to its knees. The second wave has been heartless in its ruthless rampaging through our country exposing our hollow claims of being prepared, of being one of the largest producers of pharmaceutical products in the world, of even being a civilization that places value on the higher things in life. But if life itself is gone, then whither all these claims? They are merely a futile breath of air. A mere posturing, signifying nothing. The claims of belligerent and blind leaders who are immune to the suffering and death of simple people also show that we are veering off dangerously to becoming a cruel and insensitive race.” Anuscha Thomas, a second-year history (Hons) student and executive member of Social Service League of the college, said, “We are very sad to hear about him. He was an active member of our Covid resource team.” Another senior, Ananyo, whom Jha was very close to, was informed of his death by his brother. Speaking to TOI, he said, “From the very first day at the fresher’s party in November, Satyam and I got along well as we shared the same ideology. He had been selected to the council of Gandhi Ambedkar study circle, a society of the college. When he didn’t respond to my messages, I called him and came to know that he was in the hospital. He last called me on May 19 and told me that after he was discharged, he would become active in the study circle. I asked him to take rest.” Jha was also elected to the Student Federation of India organising committee of the college. Malay Neerav, a teacher, said, “It’s most shocking and unbelievable. He showed unmatched excellence and promise as a student and an all-rounder. This is so heartbreaking. I was mentoring him.

While the government’s rebuttal was in the context of the NYT report, it sought to make a broader point that many of estimates of “under reported” deaths in India were based on assumptions lacking evidence. The report was “totally baseless and absolutely false” as estimations by the publication are not backed by any evidence and are incorrect, it said. Niti Aayog member (health) Dr V K Paul said the report is based on “distorted estimates” that consider the government’s sero-survey findings for determining the infection spread but select an arbitrary number to calculate mortality rate for that incidence of infection. In detailed comments, he said the problem arises when a certain number is thrown in as mortality. “As per our estimates, infection fatality is 0.05% (calculated on findings of sero survey) and case fatality rate is 1.15% (based on reported cases). When somebody attaches a number without thinking or understanding…they (NYT) are taking 0.3% IFR (infection fatality rate) which is six times of 0.05% and (also) 0.6% is 12 times. On what basis? No basis at all,” Dr Paul said. The government’s annoyance was palpable, as Dr Paul and health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal questioned the basis of the report’s estimate. “The (NYT) estimates have been done ad hoc and without any basis; there are two parts — quoted cases is what percentage of viral infections. Because this virus infects a large number of people only some people get symptoms. This is well-known. There is a universe where infection is not known — if it is to be ascertained, every day or every week the entire population needs to be tested…saying that the infection is 10-15 times of reported, it doesn’t bother,” Dr Paul said. He pointed out that infection in US cities too is also shown to be several times more than reported cases. Infection fatality is the percentage of deaths out of the total number of people infected, whereas case fatality rate refers to the percentage of death based on reported cases. Asserting that there is no question of concealing Covidrelated deaths, the government said India has a robust system for registration of deaths. “The question does not arise that Covid-related deaths are getting concealed because since the beginning, our efforts have been that all cases and deaths are reported in a transparent manner,” Agarwal said. The report titled “Just how big could India’s true Covid toll be” estimated 600,000 deaths due to the infection in the country in a conservative scenario, 1.6 million estimated deaths in a more likely scenario and 4.2 million estimated deaths in a worse scenario. Dismissing the estimates as assumptions, Dr Paul said the report should not have been published. “On what basis this group pulls out infection mortality rate of 0.3% in one scenario and 0.15% another scenario and 0.6% in another scenario?”, Dr Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nyt-report-on-india-covid-toll-absolutely-false-says-government/articleshow/83024111.cms||---

The municipality had floated tenders for the work but nobody approached,” Kaskar said. adding that the tender will be floated again and labourers will be brought to help complete the work. Earlier, presiding officer Rajendra Gawas declared Kaskar as chairperson and Shraddha Mahale Shetye as deputy chairperson of MMC. On Wednesday itself their nominations were received by Gawas. Kaskar is the nominee of urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik. Kaskar thanked the three MLAs of Mormugao, Vasco and Dabolim for their support and also chief minister Pramod Sawant while assuring to work for development. On Thursday the civic body administered oath to 25 councillors which was earlier postponed by the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) after two of it’s councillors tested positive for Covid and had to be hospitalized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pre-monsoon-work-a-priority-new-mormugao-civic-body-chief/articleshow/83018528.cms||---
---||Goa||‘BJP govt not supporting our efforts to tackle pandemic’||MARGAO: Soon after being declared chairperson of Margao Municipal Council (MMC), Lyndon Pereira of Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Thursday trained his guns at the BJP government, accusing it of not being supportive enough towards the Margao municipality’s efforts in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. Referring to MMC’s proposal of setting up two Covid centres in the city – an idea mooted by GFP - Pereira said that the proposal has been grounded due to lack of support from the state government. “The BJP government is not supporting us. We need doctors and nurses for operating Covid care centres. Had the government supported us, we could have opened the centres,” Pereira said while speaking to reporters. He further said that he would follow up once more with the government on the proposal. He said that while the government supported similar initiatives in the neighbouring villages of Colva and Benaulim, it cold-shouldered the Margao municipality’s proposal. “Margao is a commercial city and we have the highest number of Covid positive cases here. What’s the use of having a government if we don’t receive its support?” Pereira said. Earlier, Pereira was declared elected as chairperson of the Margao civic body at the special meeting held on Thursday. Dipali Sawal who got elected on Margao MLA Digambar Kamat’s Model Margao panel was elected as the vice-chairperson. Both were elected unopposed as BJP preferred not to contest the two top civic posts. Srinet Kotwale, senior scale officer of the Goa Civil Service who was the presiding officer for the elections, administered the oath of office to the new councillors in the presence of chief officer Agnelo Fernandes. GFP and Kamat had formed a pre-poll alliance which went on to win 17 of the 25 seats of the council. The BJP-fielded panel won 7 seats, while an independent won in one ward. Pereira said his priorities as the new MMC chairperson included speeding up the clean-up of the Sonsoddo garbage dump, setting up a multi-level parking project in Margao and streamlining the administrative section of the municipality.  “I will endeavor to provide people-friendly governance without corruption,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-govt-not-supporting-our-efforts-to-tackle-pandemic/articleshow/83018598.cms||---

It happened three weeks ago, when doctors attending to Rajesh Pujara, a resident of Ahmedabad battling severe Covid-induced lung infection, informed his younger brother Dhiraj that there was little chance of his survival. In fact, doctors gave the 49-year-old patient barely 48 hours of life. But Dhiraj was determined to save his brother at any cost. “I began inquiring in hospitals offering better medical treatment in other metro cities. A private hospital in Chennai agreed to treat Rajesh after three of their doctors examined him. But he was in critical condition and I needed to decide quickly. I, therefore, decided to hire a chartered air ambulance to take Rajesh immediately to Chennai from Ahmedabad,” the businessman told TOI. “In face of death, money wasn’t a concern and I was prepared to spend everything to save my brother. We couldn’t hire a chartered flight from Ahmedabad and had to get one so from Delhi, which reached Ahmedabad on May 7 while Rajesh was brought to airport through a green corridor that was enabled with special permission from the authorities,” said Dhiraj, who doled out Rs 21 lakh for a one-way flight for Rajesh and three medical staff. “Rajesh was admitted to Fortis Hospital in Chennai, where he responded well to the treatment and defeated Covid. His lung infection too is on decline,” said Dhiraj, adding that his elder sibling may, however, need a lung replacement and was kept under observation in the hospital. On April 17, Rajesh, a resident of Science City in Ahmedabad and father of two children, was detected with Covid and he was under home treatment but his condition deteriorated within five days, following which he was taken to a private hospital in the city. Palanpur-based Dhiraj rushed to his brother’s aid after learning about his serious condition. Dhiraj recalled the worst times when his brother was shifted to another private hospital and kept on a ventilator as his oxygen levels dipped and his health kept deteriorating further. “My brother’s condition is much better now and we are all relieved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-charters-flight-to-save-critically-ill-bro/articleshow/83015344.cms||Tushar Tere

Vice-chancellor (VC) of DSPMU S N Munda said the university is short of around 200 teaching staff at present. “There are 30 departments in the university. According to norms, each department must have a professor, two associate professors and six lecturers. There is no professor in the university. The university has around 55 regular teachers at present. Many departments have merely one or two lecturers,” he said. Furthermore, there are no demonstrators, who generally used to become lecturers after promotion, in the university. Under the circumstances, the university is depending a lot on the contractual and the guest faculty for running the traditional courses including Hindi, English, Mathematics, Botany and Political Science. It may be mentioned here that the university is also running various vocational courses, including BBA and MBA, where classes are being conducted by contractual teachers and visiting faculty members. Munda said that although the courses are self-financing, the university has requested the government to regularise the teachers who are taking classes for several years now. DSPMU has also been raising demand for appointment of the permanent Grade III and IV staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dspmu-short-of-around-200-teaching-staff-vc/articleshow/83017453.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Two held in Ramgarh in separate cases of rape||RAMGARH: Two persons, including a minor, were arrested in two different cases of rape of minor girls in the district on Wednesday. In the first instance, a 45-year-old man was arrested by Mandu police for allegedly raping a 5-year-old at his house during the cyclonic storm. Later, he washed the blood-stained clothes of the girl, who is his neighbour, and sent her home after asking her to hide the clothes. However, the girl fell unconscious after going home and her parents learnt about the rape when they took her to the hospital. The parents filed a written complaint with the Mandu police station after which the police arrested the rapist, identified as Mahesh Mahto. Ramgarh SDPO Kishore Kumar Rajak said, “We arrested the culprit soon after getting the written complaint.” In another incident, police sent a 15-year-old boy was arrested and sent to a juvenile home after a 14-year-old girl from the West Bokaro police station area filed a complaint saying she was raped by the boy during a marriage ceremony at his home. Rajak said they took custody of the boy and sent him to the juvenile home.

---||Kolkata||Cyclone Yaas: West Bengal government to give Rs 1,000 crore as ‘duare relief’ in direct bank transfers||KOLKATA: Cyclone Yaas has caused damages of around Rs 15,000 crore in Bengal, according to initial estimates, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday, while announcing a package of Rs 1,000 crore in immediate relief in the form of a scheme named Duare Tran (doorstep relief). Under this scheme, state officials will camp between June 3 and 18 at panchayats and blocks across the state to receive claims from affected people. After scrutinising the applications between June 19 and June 30, the relief is supposed to be sent across to beneficiaries’ bank accounts between July 1 and July 8 through direct bank transfers. Banerjee, however, cautioned officials to base estimates on field surveys once the water recedes in the next couple of days. With high tides persisting along coastal Bengal and localised tornado formations reported in Shantipur and Asokenagar even on Thursday, embankments collapsing along the Bidyadhari river, and two reported deaths in Murshidabad due to lightning, the full impact of the cyclone is still not over. Initial ground reports, according to chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadyay in a high-level disaster management meeting at Nabanna chaired by the CM, indicated three lakh homes have been destroyed and 1.6 lakh hectares of agricultural land have gone under water. These two factors alone accounted for a third of the total initial losses. The chief minister has also ordered an inquiry by the finance department as to why bridges, roads and embankments made in the immediate aftermath of the Amphan devastation — just a year back — seem to have collapsed. She said all further finance approvals to the state irrigation department would be withheld and a task force, headed by the chief secretary, would vet the proposals. They will also map the projects that had received funding in the aftermath of Amphan. Banerjee also told irrigation secretary Naveen Prakash that private contractors engaged for the works should either compensate the state or must repair the broken bridges at their own expense, highlighting the three-year clause in which such contractors are held responsible for project upkeep. She also wanted to know why the proposed 5 crore mangrove-plantation programme in the Sunderbans after Amphan never took off. “Money cannot be wasted,” the CM said. The irrigation, environment, and forest departments were helmed by Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee, both of whom defected to BJP on the eve of the assembly polls. Across the Bengal coastline, the scale of devastation was evident. Reports of hutments washed away, roads broken, river and seabeds eroded and hundreds of villages still under water, with some persons still untraceable, came in on Thursday from South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore. In some zones, locals and district administration claimed the impact was much more than that during Amphan or Aila at those places. Even as the sinking islands of Mousuni and Ghoramara were further eroded, with several families rendered homeless, thousands of hutments and farmlands at Patharpratima, Rangabelia, Pakhirala and Lahiripur in South 24 Parganas were damaged. At North 24 Parganas, rising water levels continued to wreak havoc at Sandeshkhali, Hingalgunj and Dhamakhali, while at East Midnapore, prawn and fish cultivation bheris were damaged as two lakh more people had to be rescued from multiple blocks at Ramnagar 1 and 2, Khejuri, Nandigram, Haldia, Nandakumar and Mahisadal. The continued rain further complicated matters as the ground floors of several flood centres — where the rescued people were sheltered — were inundated. Banerjee said Duare Tran, modelled on the highly successful Duare Sarkar scheme, would reach out to everyone, irrespective of political affiliation, religion or caste. She said an effort would be made to help those who needed it the most. “It is time to start relief immediately,” she said. “The actual damage can be ascertained only after the field survey.” She asked public health engineering secretary Ajit Bardhan to arrange for drinking water to the affected villages, so that waterborne diseases do not occur and to supply water pouches. She also instructed health secretary N S Nigam to hold talks with the Indian Medical Association to send teams of doctors to the cyclone-affected villages in the 30 to 35 blocks. The chief minister did not immediately say whether the state would make any demand from the Centre, but remarked that the Rs 37,000-crore initial assessment for Amphan, and the part assessment of Rs 7,000 crore, was never paid by them. “The disaster funds released (by the Centre) as advance are the state’s allocated funds,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yaas-state-to-give-rs-1000cr-as-duare-relief-in-direct-bank-transfers/articleshow/83020634.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Turncoats’ departments face West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's ire||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday posed some tough questions on the state irrigation department’s role, repeatedly asking how embankments and bridges built after Amphan could give way within a year and how constructions along Digha seaside collapsed within a year. Suvendu Adhikari, incidentally, helmed the irrigation department in Banerj-ee’s second cabinet and Rajib Banerjee had held it before that. Both Suvendu and Rajib are now in BJP. The CM asked for all further allocations to the department to be vetted by a chief secretary-led task force. The environment and forest departments, once held by Suvendu and Rajib, too were questioned. The CM sought to know why “big talk” on planting 5 crore mangroves in the Sunderbans was not implemented and why her suggestions on afforestation to stop riverbank erosion were never heeded. Banerjee’s posers, senior Trinamool Congress leaders felt, showed the two former ministers’ role was still firmly under the CM’s scanner. Her announcement of direct bank transfer of Yaas relief to beneficiaries was highlighted by the party as an example of transparency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/turncoats-depts-face-mamatas-ire/articleshow/83018389.cms||---
---||Ranchi||HC pulls up state over delay in procuring CT scan machine for Rims||Ranchi: The Jharkhand high court on Thursday pulled up the state government for lack of seriousness towards procuring a CT scan machine for installation at Rims. The court observed that there seems to be no seriousness among the state authorities and “they are busy holding meetings while people are dying”. A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation online on the lack of basic infrastructure and equipment in the autonomous hospital while treating patients amid the pandemic. The bench had earlier directed Rims and the government to ensure that all procedures for the purchase of a CT scan machine and its installation is completed immediately. The court was dissatisfied with the action taken by the state and the hospital authorities and expressed its displeasure. During the proceedings, the court ordered the Rims director to hold meetings with the government immediately and ensure that the machine is procured. The bench also advised that all procedures for installation of the machine be completed so that it can be put to use as soon as it is received in the hospital. In another matter related to the black marketing of Remdesivir and other medicines used for the treatment of Covid-19, the high court summoned the additional director general of police and the CID to appear virtually before the division bench to explain the progress made in the case. The bench has been monitoring the investigation done by the police, which busted the racket of black marketing of crucial drugs used for the treatment of patients down with the virus. The judges in an oral observation said the investigation so far only seems to be targeted at the small fry involved while the big fish have been left out. The court directed the ADG (CID) to come up with the details of the investigation done so far next week when the case will be heard again. Meanwhile, advocate general Rajeev Ranjan informed the court that steps have been taken for the installation of oxygen tanks in the sadar hospital and the Itki Sanatorium in the capital city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-state-over-delay-in-procuring-ct-scan-machine-for-rims/articleshow/83017567.cms||---
---||Ranchi||No vaccine cocktail under any circumstance: District admin||RANCHI: Amid the ongoing debate over the viability of the Covid vaccine cocktail (taking doses of different vaccines currently in market, Covaxin and Covishield), the Ranchi district administration on Thursday issued an advisory to all its vaccinators and beneficiaries to be extra vigilant towards it. The Union health ministry has not allowed the mixing of vaccines and studies are going on around the world to find out if different doses of the vaccines available so far can be administered safely without side effects. Deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan stressed that beneficiaries must take their second dose of the vaccine of the same brand which they took in the first shot. Currently, two vaccines, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, are used widely. “We are once again appealing to people to be careful and be aware while taking the vaccines to ensure that they take both doses of the same vaccine. People are advised not to mix their doses under any circumstances in the interest of greater impact of the drug in the fight against Covid-19. Also, one must adhere to the time gap suggested for Covishield and Covaxin between the first and the second doses. Vaccinators and those manning the vaccination centres must ensure proper scrutiny of the beneficiaries before giving the doses,” Ranjan appealed in an official advisory released by the district administration. The ICMR’s directive said for Covishield, a gap of 12-16 weeks is recommended between the two doses whereas, for Covaxin, it is 4-6 weeks. However, there have been several instances in other states where people resorted to a vaccine cocktail (taking two different doses) in many places which are emerging as a concern. District administration officials said no such incident has come to light so far in Ranchi but it can’t be ruled out amid the ongoing vaccine shortage. “We are coming across instances where people, mainly youths, are asking for a second dose of a different brand after the drug shortage. Officially, there has been no case as yet where two different doses were given, but it requires proper scrutiny,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-vaccine-cocktail-under-any-circumstance-district-admin/articleshow/83017582.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Kolkata||Narada: Calcutta High Court to hear recall plea today||Kolkata: A five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court will on Friday hear the plea to recall the stay on interim bail granted by the special CBI court to the four arrested in the Narada sting case. Counsels of the accused now under house arrest — ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, MLA Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee — on Thursday moved the recall application before the five-judge bench against the division bench order staying the bail the night it was granted. The CBI counsel, on the other hand, invoked special powers of the high court, arguing that the entire proceedings in the special CBI court on May 17 were “vitiated”. “Today we are seeing political leaders indulging in orchestrated attempts. If this mobocracy is not checked by constitutional courts of the country, then tomorrow if a gangster is arrested, his supporters will also mob the CBI office,” said CBI counsel and solicitor general Tushar Mehta. He submitted that he was not “casting aspersions” on the special CBI court judge. The larger bench asked Mehta why he was invoking HC’s special powers unless he could substantiate that the alleged mobocracy had any effect on the judge. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel for the accused, submitted that the CBI counsel’s “opening submissions” made it clear that he wanted the court to go into everything other than bail. Counsels Singhvi and Kalyan Banerjee pleaded that liberty was of priority, and the recall application should be heard first before hearing larger issues raised by Mehta. The CBI had moved the Supreme Court against the recall application but withdrew the plea during hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/narada-hc-to-hear-recall-plea-today/articleshow/83018260.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Ranchi||Inclusion of Das’s name in ‘horse-trading’ case put BJP in tight spot||Ranchi: A day after the Hemant Soren government gave its nod to include former chief minister Raghubar Das as an accused in the 2016 “horse-trading” case in the Rajya Sabha polls, BJP termed the move as “vindictive politics”. The saffron camp is also finding itself in a tight spot as its legislative party leader, Babulal Marandi, who was the chief of the now-defunct JVM-P, had launched the tirade against Das for “horse-trading” just after the 2016 polls, in which both BJP candidates — Mahesh Poddar and Mukthar Abbas Naqvi — had won. After the 2019 assembly election, Marandi returned to BJP’s fold by merging his party. Police had reportedly made Das an accused under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, in addition to former ADG of special branch Anurag Gupta and Das’s political adviser Ajay Kumar — against whom the probe is already underway. While Marandi strategically chose to refrain from making any comments over the developments, BJP fielded its state president Deepak Prakash to launch a counterattack against the government’s move. “The way the Hemant Soren government acted against Das clearly reflects vendetta. The case is four-year-old and successive probes had yielded no results. During our government, we had given free hand to the investigators. After the Soren government came to power in 2019, they, too, couldn’t establish any wrongdoing. Hence, to harass Das, they have now decided to wrongly include Das’s name,” he said, adding that it won’t stand in a court of law. “The Prevention of Corruption Act can be invoked when any crime has been committed and not on the basis of assumptions or apprehensions. In the 2016 RS polls, no horse-trading or wrongdoing took place as the original complainant, Nirmala Devi (ex-Congress MLA from Barkagaon), had voted in favour of her own party candidate,” said Prakash, issuing a veiled threat to the current regime. “One should understand that no party or government remains in power for eternity,” he added. Raghubar Das, too, in a statement on Wednesday said he is not afraid of any probe but warned the bureaucrats/officials, who are currently “acting as puppets” of the government to prepare to pay after the next assembly elections. “Those who are acting at the behest of the government to frame me under false cases should know that things change soon. If anyone is thinking that by doing so, they will lead a happy life after their retirement in 2024 (next election), needs to be cautious,” he warned. Notably, none of the party seniors made any comment on the record on Marandi’s stance. “When our party president made the statement, where is the need for Marandi’s comments?” asked one. “Marandiji is in BJP now not JVM-P,” added another justifying his silence over the issue. On social media, too, Marandi, remained busy tweeting against the Soren government on other issues but refrained to comment on the subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/inclusion-of-dass-name-in-horse-trading-case-put-bjp-in-tight-spot/articleshow/83017495.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Body floats, trees turn homes as cyclone & tide deal double blow||KOLKATA: Huts washed away, roads broken, riverbanks eroded, villages flooded and people dead or missing — scenes of devastation and helplessness spanned from North and South 24 Parganas to East Midnapore a day after Cyclone Yaas made landfall in neighbouring Odisha. Many say the impact has been way worse than Amphan last year. The tide gnawed at the sinking islands of Mousuni and Ghoramara, rendering several families homeless. Farmlands were severely damaged in Patharpratima, Rangabelia, Pakhirala and Lahiripur — all in South 24 Parganas. In North 24 Parganas, the rising water wreaked havoc in Sandeshkhali, Hingalgunj and Dhamakhali. Many prawn and fish farms were damaged in East Midnapore, where 2 lakh people had to be rescued from Ramnagar blocks 1 and 2, Khejuri, Nandigram, Haldia, Nandakumar and Mahisadal. No let-up in rainfall even inundated flood relief centres. Residents of Raipara in Ghoramara woke up to find a 65-year-old man — who made a living as a bahurupi — dead in water beside a tree. A few villagers were reported missing. Sunderbans SP Bhaskar Mukherjee said: “The deceased has been identified as Brindaban Jana. We have sent his body for post-mortem to ascertain the cause of death. A young girl is missing.” Ghoramara — the poster island of sinking Sunderbans — is among the worst affected, with inundation forcing people to take shelter on roofs and trees. “We have never seen such devastation. Several houses on the edge of the coast have been washed away and the island has sunken further,” said Bidhan Das, a professor and local resident. Sunderbans development minister Bankim Hazra, who visited Ghoramara, said several people were rescued on Thursday. He estimated 62,000 damaged houses in Kakdwip and Sagar. At Mousuni — a prominent tourism hub — villagers spent the night and the day under polythene pitched like tents on the solitary concrete road. “Our homes, farms and betel vines are all gone,” rued Monirul Islam, whose nature camp couldn’t withstand the double impact of Yaas and the spring tide. Gosaba is grappling with over 200km of embankment damage. Around 26km has been washed away and another 50km has suffered serious breach. “We rescued 1 lakh people on Thursday from Rangabelia, Pakhiralay, Gosaba, Dulki, Kumirmari, Satjelia, Chhotomollakhali and Lahiripur. Once the waters recede, we will have a clearer picture of the devastation,” said Gosaba BDO Sourav Mitra. In East Midnapore district, over 2 lakh people were rescued amid torrential rain between Wednesday afternoon and Thursday evening. Rising water marooned several villages in all the 25 blocks. “There have been large-scale damage to concrete embankments between Old and New Digha. Over 2,000 seaside stalls have been hit and 10 lakh people directly affected in the district. We have had to rescue 5 lakh,” said DM Purnendu Maji. The Digha Shankarpur Development Authority held an emergency meeting with state fisheries minister Akhil Giri and irrigation minister Soumen Mahapatra. “We will try to reconstruct this tourism circuit in a month,” Giri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/body-floats-trees-turn-homes-as-cyclone-tide-deal-double-blow/articleshow/83018450.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

I was not allowed to take up the work when I was a cabinet minister,” he said. Adhikari accused the Trinamool government of frittering away public money. “They think that a dole of Rs 500-1,000 can end people’s troubles, but that will never happen,” he said. Adhikari also claimed that “the government dole” wasn’t “visible” in his constituency. “The CM said the state had spent Rs 1,400 crore. We are yet to find beneficiaries. I have been travelling across Nandigram, but didn’t see anyone from the administration.” State BJP president Dilip Ghosh urged the Centre to opt for direct benefit transfer (DBT) to offer immediate relief to cyclone victims in East Midnapore, Howrah and parts of South 24 Parganas. “ A detailed list can be maintained at panchayat or district offices,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/only-dole-wont-do-repairs-key-suvendu/articleshow/83018529.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||PM Narendra Modi -CM Mamata Banerjee review meet today at Kalaikunda on Yaas destruction||Kolkata/Midnapore: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Mamata Banerjee will meet at the Kalaikunda Air Force Base in West Midnapore on Friday afternoon for a “review meeting” over damage due to Cyclone Yaas. Banerjee, who was originally scheduled to fly out to Hingalgunj and Sagar Islands before reaching Digha on Friday evening, said she will shorten her visit timelines to meet the PM in Kalaikunda between 2.15 pm and 2.30 pm. “This will be a meeting between the Prime Minister and the chief minister,” Banerjee said, when asked by reporters whether she would like to inform the PM on the extent of damages due to Cyclone Yaas and seek help from the Centre. “How can I tell you even before I have spoken to the PM? Do not ask me to name a child even before birth?” the CM said. “The PM will be visiting three places in Odisha, including Balasore and Jaleswar. He will take the Digha (coastal) route to reach Kalaikunda. I will meet him there. He is expected to fly out from Kalaikunda,” she said. Banerjee said she will reach Hingalgunj on Friday and meet the North 24 Parganas district magistrate and police superintendent briefly before leaving for Sagar Islands. The CM is likely to be accompanied by state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. “The meetings will be very brief due to time constraints. After meeting the PM, I will reach Digha for a meeting. I will return (to Kolkata) on Saturday after an aerial survey of Digha (coastal belts), Khejuri and Nandigram that I had planned before. With the PM itinerary now, I will be going to four places. Given the inclement weather, the meetings will be very short,” she said. In the backdrop of the high-octane Bengal elections, the PM-CM meeting in-person last took place at Victoria Memorial on January 23 for Netaji’s birth centenary celebrations. The incident had its fair share of controversy with Banerjee protesting political slogans at a function to pay tribute to Netaji — among Bengal’s most revered icons — and refused to speak. The CM, however, attended several virtual meetings with the PM, the last a week back, on Covid, which she dubbed as “super flop” where none of the CMs could speak. An SPG team has already arrived in Midnapore for advance security liasoning. The team is based out of the IIT-Kharagpur campus. A 50-member proximate security team by the state’s VIP security wing is undergoing RT-PCR tests at Midnapore Medical College Hospital. A 30-car convoy is being kept ready and all drivers are undergoing tests. “We have been asked to conduct the tests and provide reports by today itself,” MMCH principal Panchanan Kundu said. West Midnapore DM Rashmi Kamal visited the Kalaikunda air force base with top officials and held meetings with senior defence officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pm-didi-review-meet-today-at-kalaikunda-on-yaas-destruction/articleshow/83018738.cms||Sujoy Khanra

It advised them to allow relaxations in lockdown curbs currently in force in many states/ UTs only in a graded manner. Home secretary Ajay Bhalla in a letter to the state chief secretaries and UT administrators asked them to continue to be cautious as the number of active cases was still very high. Urging the states to continue compliance with the strategy — containment measures in areas with positivity rate of 10% or more and where over 60% of the ICU beds are occupied — Bhalla said necessary directions may be issued for taking required measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/continue-curbs-till-june-30-centre-to-states/articleshow/83024172.cms||---

The MoU was signed by Dr Bhimaraya Metri (Director, IIM-Nagpur) and S Glory Swarupa (Director-General, Ni-MSME), with Shri Vaibhav Dange (advisor, National Highways Authority of India, and member, IIM-N Board of Governors), as well as faculty and staff of both institutions in attendance. The MoU paves way for collaboration in the areas of training, research, consulting and outreach in the domain of management, MSME development, skill development and entrepreneurship, by way of short-term education and training programmes, faculty development programmes, infrastructure sharing and the development of a campus of IIM-Nagpur in Hyderabad. S Glory Swarupa said, “The collaboration between IIM-Nagpur and Ni-MSME, Hyderabad comes at the right time when the entire world as well as India is going through an unprecedented pandemic and lockdown. This disruption has impacted the MSME very deeply and threatened the life and livelihood of majority of the population in the country.” “This collaboration will deal with long-term executive training, education and research so that to help the next generation of entrepreneurs who would show the light to the human race on sustainable enterprises development, management and growth in the post Covid-19 era. This collaboration will also help the entrepreneurs at Hyderabad as well as the entire nation with easy access of knowledge from pioneer institutions such as IIM-Nagpur with a specific focus on the MSME sector,” the director-general of Ni-MSME said. Dr Bhimaraya Metri said IIM-Nagpur is well known for its deep corporate relations across various sectors and cutting-edge programmes at postgraduate, MBA and PhD levels. “To realise the true potential, bright young minds of India choose to discover the central point of central India – IIM Nagpur. IIM Nagpur has ‘IIM Nagpur Foundation for Entrepreneurial Development (InFED)’. This new innovation space acts as an experiential learning lab to unlock the limitless potential of early stage start-up companies, as well as to drive agriculture and MSME growth across India, and Vidarbha region in particular,” said Metri. “We are looking forward to working with Ni-MSME Hyderabad to develop the Transformational Entrepreneurial Strategy that shall enable MSMEs to respond to disruptions in time, and facilitate them to build winning competencies and pole-vaulting to growth through innovations. IIM Nagpur with Ni-MSME will start a new era, opening up new vistas of opportunities to contribute to the practical application of entrepreneurial competencies and knowledge to build entrepreneurial minds,” said Metri. Metri further said that they seek to be a trusted adviser to MSMEs, helping them steer away from dated, off-the-shelf models to develop bespoke innovative solutions to grand business challenges of today and tomorrow. Vaibhav Dange congratulated both the institutes and related how the MSME sector is crucial for the growth of the economy. He mentioned that as the second largest employer in the country, MSMEs are key to the goal of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’, while also ensuring equal growth for the entire population. Dange added that micro and small enterprises stepped up during the pandemic to seek opportunity and bridge the gaps that we faced as a nation. He expressed hope that IIM-Nagpur and Ni-MSME Hyderabad would together explore ways to reduce import dependency of MSMEs in the coming years, thus enabling the removal of bottlenecks to the development of micro, small and medium enterprises in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/iim-nagpur-signs-mou-with-ni-msme-hyderabad/articleshow/83037631.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The party is calling people over phone asking to give an estimate of Covid deaths in their village or neighbourhood in the last two months. They are being asked to give a figure on the basis of three options laid out and also the option of saying “don’t know”. AICC data analytics head Praveen Chakravarty called it “crowdsourcing of estimates or information”. Sources said the survey is being done in around 80 districts across Bihar, UP, MP and Haryana, all governed by NDA. Chakravarty said asking a large number of people about rough estimates in the area of their residence results in an average that is good enough to provide the big picture. “It is a scientific technique,” Chakravarty said. While the government is providing Covid death toll, the figures are a source of controversy. Congress’s Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Thursday: “ ‘Positivity’ is a PR stunt to hide the actual number of corona deaths that the PM’s actions have caused”. AICC is also conducting surveys on the people’s attitude towards Covid vaccines and on immediate needs — food, hospitals, income, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-to-take-crowdsourcing-path-to-estimate-covid-deaths/articleshow/83024197.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Amid the gloom and lockdown, the reserve has recorded an overwhelming growth in population of big cats. Images of 41 tiger cubs have been captured inside the reserve in the past few months. Forest officials have counted the newborns and those aged up to 12 months. “While the figures are something to cheer, it is also a matter of concern since this tiger reserve had exceeded its carrying capacity long ago. The boom in population would only increase territorial conflicts,” they said. “Bandhavgarh has exceeded its carrying capacity, resulting in more infighting. Older tigers are moving out of Bandhavgarh in search of new habitats, and the migration can’t be stopped,” said an officer, adding that the only option is to expand the reserve area. At least 25 tigers that moved out of protected areas have fallen prey to electric traps laid by poachers and villagers. Often, tigers are electrocuted by traps set by hunters. Despite the rising toll — 47 in four years, including 13 in 2018 and 17 in 2019 — Madhya Pradesh has clawed back to the top spot as a “Tiger State”. Tiger movement was recorded in 1,432 forest beats across the state in the initial phase of the app-based All India Tiger Assessment 2018. Madhya Pradesh was declared “Tiger State” of India, having pipped Karnataka by just two tigers — 526 to 524 — in the All India Tiger Estimation Report 2018 announced by PM Narendra Modi in 2019. MP was first declared a “Tiger State” in 1995 when it harboured nearly 20% of India’s tiger population and nearly 10% of the world’s, but now the scene has changed. Experts caution that with most reserves in MP reaching saturation limit, more tigers will fall to infighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-covid-bandhavgarh-sees-a-big-cat-boom/articleshow/83024218.cms||P Naveen

NCP president Sharad Pawar met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday evening, giving rise to speculation about tensions within the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance. “I don’t know what transpired in the meeting. But there is no question of instability in the government. New issues do crop up.... what is the connection between them and the government’s stability,” Patil said. On the Maratha quota issue, he said PM Modi should “take a decision in Parliament”. “State BJP functionaries must pursue the matter with their central leadership,” he said when asked about the future of the quota which has been struck down by the Supreme Court. On lifting the current lockdown-like restrictions in the state on account of coronavirus pandemic, Patil said the issue of restrictions and Covid-19 numbers is discussed in the cabinet meeting every week. “Any decision will be taken only after discussions,” he said when asked if the restrictions will be eased after June 1||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uddhav-pawar-meet-amid-buzz-of-mva-rift/articleshow/83024237.cms||---

Amid the gloom and lockdown, the reserve has recorded an overwhelming growth in population of big cats. Images of 41 tiger cubs have been captured inside the reserve in the past few months. Forest officials have counted the newborns and those aged up to 12 months. “BTR management had more time to focus on the conservation of wildlife during the lockdown,” say officers. “While the figures are certainly enthusiastic, but it is also a matter of concern since this tiger reserve had exceeded its carrying capacity long ago. The boom in population would only increase territorial conflicts,” they say. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve and National Park, is one of the most popular national parks in India with a large population of tigers. Declared a national park in 1968, it attracts large number of tourists. Birth of new cubs in BTR is in line with the country's focus on increasing tiger population. “Bandhavgarh has exceeded its carrying capacity, resulting in more infighting.

Chief Wildlife Warden V K Yadav said here most of the 40 protection camps of forest department in Sunderbans are inundated. A forest department report said there was report of tiger straying into Paikpara, Moipith, Nalgora beat and Raidighi range, since the cyclone Yaas hit coastal areas. Jharkhand had a major bridge on river Kanchi that connects Bundu with Tamar near Ranchi, collapsing as torrential rains saw the rivers in the tribal state in spate. “We are expecting a medium range flood in the river Baitarani which may affect three major districts like Bhadrak, Jajpur and Kendrapara”, special relief commissioner (SRC) P K Jena said. He said that the water level at Anandapur around 2pm was 39 metre against the danger level of 38.4 metre while it was 17.9 metre at Khuapada against the danger level of over 17.8 metre. As the water requires at least 6 hours to reach Akhuapada, it is expected that the water level will rise by Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tornadoes-to-bridge-collapses-yaas-wreaks-havoc-on-day-2-too/articleshow/83024248.cms||---
