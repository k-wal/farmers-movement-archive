Khonmoh is said to be part of a highly active terrorist corridor linked to Khrew and Tral in south Kashmir's Pulwama district. Besides the Al-Badr duo killed in the encounter — Wasim Bashir Pandit of Kakapora and Mudasir Ahmad Khanday of Bargam Awantipora — security forces had been tracking five other terrorists suspected to be moving about in Srinagar district. Another terrorist who had made Srinagar his base died in a gunfight with a joint team of the police, Army and CRPF at Kokernag in adjoining Anantnag district recently. "There is a vast network of overground workers in the district, of which many have either been arrested under the Public Safety Act or counselled and handed over to their families," the IGP said. "Inputs about the movement of foreign terrorists continue to pour in but, as of now, no such threat is seen." Kumar said the increased use of improvised explosive devices was still a challenge in the battle against terrorist outfits, but security forces were getting the hang of it. "We recently seized 10kg of explosives used to make IEDs in Shopian, followed by another seizure involving the Army. We are effectively dealing with the threat through timely detections."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-al-badr-terrorists-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/82720248.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “The Army provided relief to a nomad family stranded in Chhatroo sub-division of Kishtwar. The family was on its way from Kathua to Marwah valley (Navapachchi) in Kishtwar. An Army check post at Bhandarkut received a call for help from a goatherder (Bakkarwal) stating that one Basheer Ahmed, his wife, three children and their animals had got stranded in the snow and were without food. Following this, a rescue party of the Army immediately moved from Chingam post and located the family after a long trek of around 24 hours in poor weather conditions." The family was provided food, medicines and other essential items, Col Anand said. The defence spokesperson further added that the family thanked the Army for its help. The Bakkarwal of J&K move to pastures in higher reaches of the mountains in the summer season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/armymen-trek-for-24-hrs-to-help-family-stuck-in-snow/articleshow/82720472.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Jammu & Kashmir recorded 73 deaths in the last 24 hours, out of which 54 were reported from Jammu division. Addressing a press conference after visiting several covid care facilities in Jammu and Samba districts, the team advised intensifying testing in areas witnessing a huge surge in cases. The visiting team, comprising Dr Mahesh Waghmare, Dr Pranay Verma and Dr Navneet Sharma, also called for strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour in public places. “There is need to increase testing in such areas and the samples, as per the protocol, be sent to Delhi for genome study,” the team of doctors said, and assured that the results would be shared with the UT within a week. They further advised intensifying the surveillance of home isolated cases so that patients are shifted to hospitals well in time, when required. Efficient triage facility and framing of discharge policy were also emphasized for better patient management and adequate bed availability. Earlier, the team, after arriving here on Sunday, visited Government Medical College, Jammu, and had a threadbare discussion with the doctors, besides visiting isolation wards. On day two, the team visited Samba and inspected the containment and micro-containment zones, and met with surveillance teams working at the grassroots level. Later, they held a virtual meeting with IDSP teams of 10 districts of the Jammu division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-central-team-calls-for-genome-study-to-probe-high-death-rate-in-jammu/articleshow/82720674.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Pakistan terms Afghan President's claims baseless, irresponsible||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan conveyed its serious concerns on Monday to Afghanistan over the recent statements made by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani regarding Islamabad’s strong relationship with the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry said his country had made "a strong demarche with the ambassador of Afghanistan in Islamabad on the recent irresponsible statements and baseless allegations made by the Afghan leadership". Chaudhry said Pakistan has emphasised that groundless accusations erode trust and vitiate the environment and disregard the constructive role being played by Pakistan in facilitating the Afghan peace process. The Afghan side, he maintained, has been urged to effectively utilise available forums, like the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity, to address all bilateral issues. In a recent interview with a German publication, President Ghani had claimed that Pakistan operated an organised system of support for the Taliban. According to Ghani, the Taliban receive logistics in Pakistan, their finances are there and recruitment happens there. "The names of the various decision-making bodies of the Taliban are Quetta Shura, Miramshah Shura and Peshawar Shura — named after the Pakistani cities where they are located. There is a deep relationship with the state," Ghani had said. Asked whether he still believed in a peace process, the Afghan president said: "Peace will primarily be decided upon regionally, and I believe we are at a crucial moment of rethinking. It is first and foremost a matter of getting Pakistan on board. The US now plays only a minor role. The question of peace or hostility is now in Pakistani hands." In a trip to Kabul last week, Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, according to the army’s media wing, had assured the Afghan leadership of Islamabad’s support for an "inclusive power-sharing arrangement" and "elections as a right of Afghans to self-determination". Gen Bajwa was also accompanied by UK Chief of Defence Sir Nicholas Patrick Carter and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed. According to President Ghani, Gen Bajwa had assured him that the restoration of the emirate or dictatorship by the Taliban was not in anybody’s interest in the region, especially Pakistan. "However", he said, "some of the lower levels in the army still hold the opposite opinion in certain cases. It is primarily a question of political will." Ghani had expressed his apprehensions about Pakistan’s strong bond with the Taliban just days after the US and other international forces started withdrawing from Afghanistan. Since the beginning of the drawdown, which is set for completion by September 11, there has been a sudden spike in violence in Afghanistan. With the Afghan Taliban reluctant to join the peace process, the increased violence threatens more instability in Afghanistan, something that may have a spillover impact on its neighbours, specifically Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-terms-afghan-presidents-claims-baseless-irresponsible/articleshow/82720851.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The theme of the campaign of the UN Global Road Safety Week is based on the Stockholm Declaration of 2020 which called for low-speed streets based on studies from cities such as Graz in Austria, London; New York and Toronto which indicated that 30 kmph speed limits and zones yielded reductions in road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths. “Evidence shows that 30 kmph streets where people mix with traffic not only save lives, but also promote walking, cycling and a move towards zero-carbon mobility,” the WHO said. Different studies in India have found that there are more than 40 types of road users here and no segregation of traffic makes the Indian roads more prone to crashes. Speaking at the launch of the campaign, UN General Assembly president, Volkan Bozkir said, “Managing speed is among the most practical and efficient solutions to saving lives and with minimal cost.” He highlighted how during the pandemic pedestrians in urban centres have reclaimed the roads and he added that reducing speed of vehicles in urban centres not only saves lives but makes the cities more inviting and accessible to all. He said he is working with member states to prepare a high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly in 2022 for the effective implementation of the global plan Decade of Action. The member countries have agreed to reduce the road deaths by 50% by 2030. This goal can be achieved only when countries like India, China, Bangladesh and Mexico succeed to reduce fatalities. Every year, more than 13 lakh people die in road traffic crashes and at least one death out of every 10 killed in road crashes globally is reported from India. According to the WHO, excessive speed is at the core of the road traffic injury problem, with one in three deaths on the roads in high-income countries attributed to speed. It is estimated that 40-50% of people drive above the speed limit, with every 1 kmph increase in speed resulting in a 4-5% increase in fatal crashes. The risk of death and injury reduces considerably when speeds are lowered. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said low-speed streets are an important part of the vision for creating safe, healthy, green and livable cities. He added, “As the world recovers and rebuilds from COVID-19, let’s make safer roads for a safer world.” Zoleka Mandela, global ambassador for the Child Health Initiative and granddaughter of late South African President Nelson Mandela, said roads are for people and not for vehicles. “We want low speed; we want livable streets so that we can walk safely and our children can get to school unharmed. Streets have been built for traffic and not for people. As a mother I believe our children are a priority. Why aren’t we doing enough so that they can get to school safely?” She said in the name of development governments are investing on roads to speed up the traffic and people are paying with their lives. “Slow the traffic, help people to walk and cycle safely,” she urged policy makers. Zoleka lost her 13-year-old daughter, Zenani, in a road traffic crash in South Africa in 2010. Dr Etienne Krug, director of the Department of Social Determinants of Health at WHO said, “Low-speed streets are the heart of every community. I call on authorities to reduce urban speed limits to 30 kmph where pedestrians and cyclists mix with other traffic, as a step towards giving streets back to people and ensuring those streets are protective of health and the environment. Low-speed streets are streets for life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speed-kills-limit-vehicle-speed-to-30-kmph-where-people-live-walk-play-un-campaign/articleshow/82721148.cms||Dipak K Dash

The exam was to be held on February 28 but had to be cancelled. “We have arrested a Lt Col rank officer in the paper leak case but I won’t comment any further on the matter for now,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI. An Army officer from Delhi, who did not wish to be named, said, “The lieutenant colonel was the presiding officer of the panel that was in charge of the question paper printing at the Army Recruitment Office (ARO) in Secunderabad. According to the procedure, the ARO is required to form separate panels, comprising officers from Army units in the military area where the ARO is located, for printing and distribution of question papers. The Lt Col was not with the ARO but was from one of the Army units in Secunderabad.” He said, “An internal Army inquiry has prima facie established his link with the alleged leak.” Two Army majors are among the 10 suspects arrested earlier. A police officer associated with the investigation said the arrested Lt Col was being brought to Pune in connection with the FIR registered by the Wanowrie police. He will be produced before a special court on Tuesday for custodial remand. On May 14, the police had arrested a storekeeper, Prasad Veera Narnepati (41), from the central ordnance depot in New Delhi in relation to the paper leak case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lt-col-held-in-army-recruitment-exam-paper-leak-case/articleshow/82721735.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The delivery, doctors said, had been successful and his wife Soja was fine. Heart beating with joy, he had rushed to the hospital. The babies, twins, looked exactly alike. The young parents named them Joefred Varghese Gregory and Ralfred George Gregory. Having lived a life where they did almost everything together — both chose computer engineering, both had jobs in Hyderabad — they caught the deadly fever the same day, on April 24. Last week, after struggling with Covid, they died together, hours after one another. Raphael said he almost knew that if his sons had to make it, they would come home together. Or they wouldn’t. “Whatever happened to one, it happened to the other,” he said. “That’s how it was since their birth. I had told my wife after we got news that Jeofred had died that Ralfred won’t return home alone either. They died on May 13 and May 14, hours apart.” He said, “The twins had a lot of plans for us. They wanted to give us a better life. As teachers we have struggled much to bring up the children well and they wanted to give us back, everything from money to happiness. Before they died, they were planning to leave for Korea and then perhaps Germany for work. I don’t know why god punished us like this.” The Raphaels have a third son, the eldest one, Nelfred. Residents of Meerut’s Cantonment area, the family initially treated the brothers at home, thinking the fever would subside. But it didn’t. “We purchased an oximeter. When their oxygen level dropped to 90, doctors advised us to take them to hospital. We admitted them to a private one on May 1,” Gregory said. Their first report had confirmed the young men were Covid-positive. But after a few days, their second RT-PCR test report came negative. “Doctors were planning to move them from the Covid ward to the normal ICU. However, I requested the hospital to monitor their health for two more days in the Covid ward. Then, suddenly, on the evening of May 13, my wife got the call. Our world crashed.” Ralfred had made his last phone call to his mother. “He spoke from the hospital bed,” said Gregory, his voice shaking. “He told his mother that he was recovering and enquired about Joefred’s health. By then Joefred had died. So we made up a story. We told him we had to shift him to a hospital in Delhi. But Ralfred knew instinctively. He told his mother, ‘You are lying’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-twin-brothers-both-techies-die-together-after-24th-birthday/articleshow/82721903.cms||Piyush Rai

According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade data released on Monday, the 10.5% rate is the highest in the current series unveiled in April 2013. According to the methodology for comparison with various other series, it is the highest since 10.9% recorded in April 2010. Wholesale price index-based inflation had declined 1.6% in April 2020. The surge in WPI comes against the backdrop of a cooling in retail inflation, which slowed to a three-month low of 4.3% in April. The Reserve Bank of India relies on the retail inflation data for its decisions on interest rates. Inflation for primary food articles shot up to a six-month high of 4.9% in April compared to 3.2% in the previous month. Fruits, eggs, meat and fish prices rose in double digits while vegetable and price of pulses softened. Inflation in non-food articles soared to 15.6% in April while the fuel and power group rose an annual 21% during the month due to the hardening of global prices. Manufactured product prices rose 9% during April, higher than previous month’s 7.3%, which economists said was the result of the return of pricing power and the impact of rising global commodity prices. Economists said the RBI is likely to continue with its pause on interest rates for now despite slowing growth. “We expect the headline WPI inflation to rise further to 13-13.5% in the current month before commencing a downtrend, whereas the core-WPI inflation may continue to rise over the next three prints to a peak of around 10.5%,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA. Core inflation is excluding food and fuel, which shot up to a series high of 8.4% in April. “The likely trajectory of the WPI inflation supports our view that there is no space for rate cuts to support the faltering growth momentum, even as we expect the monetary stance to remain accommodative. There is a growing divergence in terms of the global optimism related to the vaccine rollout, which is pushing up commodity prices, vs. the weaker domestic sentiment hit by the continuing impact of the second wave of covid-19 infections in India,” said Nayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wholesale-price-inflation-soars-to-11-yr-high-of-10-5-in-april/articleshow/82722227.cms||---

While a CCC at Raipur on the outskirts of Dehradun was found to have kept to itself details of 27 Covid patients who died between April 26 and May 16, 28 previously unrecorded deaths were reported from the military hospital in Roorkee, reports Ishita Mishra. The deaths took place over the last one year since the pandemic hit. At the JLN District Hospital in Rudrapur, too, data of 65 deaths was added only on Monday. The patients had died there between April 28 and May 7. Similarly, BHEL hospital in Haridwar has now disclosed 15 Covid deaths which took place between April 29 and May 12. As to why the deaths were not reported earlier, Dr HD Shakya, additional chief medical officer of Roorkee, told TOI, "When we enquired from the MH authorities, they told us that they were manually reporting the deaths to the health department but were not uploading details on the designated Covid portal as a result of which the deaths did not reflect in the total Covid fatality toll." Dr Anand Shukla, medical superintendent at Raipur CCC, told TOI that the delay in reporting death records happened as the data entry operator at the CCC wasn’t aware how to do the task and the official concerned went on leave. "We were continuously sharing data of deaths and treatment with district administration manually. It’s just that we failed to upload the same data on the designated portal," he added. A senior official at the CCC facility, which also has oxygen beds, told TOI that the centre was "swamped with patients" between April 25 and May 15 despite not having any critical care facility and was forced to admit many critical cases as well, which led to the deaths. "From administrative officials to ministers, we faced pressure from all quarters to admit patients who were critical even though the centre has no ICU beds," he added. Several hospitals across the state have now started reporting Covid deaths in bulk after the health department on Saturday issued a notice to the CCC at Baba Burfani Hospital in Haridwar for not reporting 65 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/135-fresh-undisclosed-deaths-in-uttarakhand-hospitals/articleshow/82722530.cms||Ishita Mishra

With some reports of scheduled shots for the 45+ age group being cancelled reported from Delhi, central officials said this might be due to sessions being reassigned and venues being changed. Instances of second shot appointments being cancelled were scattered with some beneficiaries reporting no change in schedules even as the CoWin portal is no longer permitting fresh scheduling of Covishield before a 12-week interval. The situation for those awaiting their second shots in neighbouring Gurgaon might also be challenging. Government facilities permit only walk-ins for 45-plus with numbered tokens given on a first come, first served basis. Since there are no appointments, all those who are due for the second shot may now need to wait for 12 weeks. Bookings in private hospitals are very limited even if these are honoured. The health ministry also said that the CoWin platform will be available in Hindi and 14 regional languages by next week. Further online or on-site appointments for the second dose of Covishield can be booked only with a gap of at least 84 days from the first dose. The Centre had on May 13 extended the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks based on the recommendations by the Covid working group. The dosing schedule for Covaxin remains unchanged and second dose can be taken 4-6 weeks after the first.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covishield-2nd-dose-appointments-cancelled-in-some-states/articleshow/82723122.cms||---

The barge was one of the three vessels and a drillship that went adrift after their moorings snapped in the ferocity of cyclone Tuktae, which pushed up wind speed to reach 150-180 km. INS Kochi and INS Kolkata of the Indian Navy, a tug boat of Afcons and one vessel of ONGC have rushed to the area for search and rescue, ONGC said in a statement. But the extremely rough sea, with 6-8 metre-high waves, is making the task difficult, people aware of the situation said. Besides Papaa 305, barge GAL Constructor is reported to be drifting at Colaba Point and reported to be taking in water in the engine room. Indian Coast Guard vessel ICG Samrat and Mumbai Port Trust vessel Water Lily are at the location for rescue and support. Another barge, Support Station-3, is drifting north-west from its mooring. It is reported to be clear of all operational installations of Mumbai High. The vessel is under control and there is no water ingress. ONGC has deployed two of its offshore support vessels for help. ONGC drill Ship Sagar Bhushan, which was deployed for exploration in western offshore, lost its anchors and started drifting north. Four ONGC charter hired vessels are at the location for rescue operations. Two ONGC multi-support vessels are also on their way, the company said. Coast Guard has diverted its vessel ICGS Shoor for rescue operations. The barges were deployed for exploration and drilling operations in western offshore. Reports suggest P305 did not have its own power mill since it was an accommodation platform. GAL Constructor is a drilling barge. Together the two barges are reported to have more than 400 personnel on board. Reports suggest Papaa 305 was the first to have sent out SOS. GAL Constructor was next. The Navy has kept another vessel, INS Talwar, on standby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/60-rescued-search-on-for-200-on-board-adrift-ongc-barge/articleshow/82724053.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Many claim that even a few minutes of work tires them out. They are unable to sleep much at night. Doctors told TOI that the trend of self-medication and approaching the doctor late after onset of symptoms is one of the reasons the post-Covid symptoms linger on for so long. “Time is the biggest healer, and one should think one has already won a battle and re-start living life in a positive manner,” advised Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate professor, department of medicine, AIIMS. “The flood of content in circulation on social media only adds to anxiety and sleeplessness. People who are recovering should form a social support group and seek help from counsellors or psychologists to channelise their thoughts.” Read AlsoComorbid list too limited, not able to get certificate, say those above 45Gurgaon: In the five days since vaccinations began for the 60-plus population and those above 45 with comorbidities, there has been a huge difference in their turnouts. Till Saturday, 11,375 people over the age of 60 had got their first jabs. In contrast, only 1,129 recipients between 45 and 59Asked why the symptoms were severe this time, as also the post-Covid recovery, Nischal said, “The disease is more severe now than last year, as are the symptoms. The virus is primarily a lung disease but it has the potential to affect the entire body because of the distribution of ACE2 receptors through which it gains entry into human cells. The dysregulation this causes takes time to stabilise.” Read AlsoPM Modi holds meeting with field officials from states, districts on Covid-19 managementPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday held a meeting with field officials from states and districts about their experience in handling the Covid-19 pandemic.Doctors told TOI that serious complications after recovery are only seen in 1-2% of the cases. In some individuals, its more psychological than medical, the result of being bombarded with negative news or information related to Covid. “People who recover from Covid need to have a positive approach to resuming life after having won the battle. Popping vitamins is not the only way to boost immunity, eating a protein-enriched diet, fruits and exercise also help. Yes, don’t exert yourself, take one day at a time. Recovery is like a scar and will heal gradually,” said Nischal. Read Also50% Covid deaths at Gurugram hospitals in this wave were of patients aged 21-40One in every two lives lost to Covid between April 1 and May 10 — coinciding with the fierce second wave of the pandemic — in the city was of a young person, in the 21-40 age group.Dr Amitabh Parti, director, internal medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, concurred and additionally advised breathing exercise to recovered patients. “Brain fog and lack of focus are also seen in some cases. Another issue is insomnia. If patients who are recovering are constantly surrounded by Covid-related talk or information, then the mind will be disturbed and a good night’s sleep isn’t possible,” said Parti. “It’s important to relax, keep your body hydrated and take time off social media and mobile phones.” Parti recommended conversations with family and friends, especially if the patient was alone. “Anxiety and depression are due to two reasons in the current circumstances,” said Parti. “Either the individual has suffered Covid or has lost a family member to the coronavirus.” Read AlsoHope or illusion?

All four got bail from a special CBI court in the evening, but the Calcutta high court stayed the order and sent them to jail. The arrests came 15 days after TMC returned to office for a third straight term with 213 seats in the 294-member assembly and a vote share of over 48%. TMC called the arrests the “most shameful example of vendetta politics” and questioned why the CBI was not arresting BJP leaders Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy. Mukherjee, Hakim, Mitra and Chatterjee were picked up one after the other, starting with the CBI knocking on Mitra’s door at 6.30am and ending with Mukherjee’s arrest at 9am. All four were taken to the CBI’s Kolkata headquarters at Nizam Palace, where Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee reached at 10.47am and stayed till 4.50pm with hundreds of TMC supporters camping outside. Raj Bhavan, too, bore the brunt of the anger on the streets as TMC supporters gathered outside its gates — chanting slogans against the Governor — prompting party seniors, led by MP Abhishek Banerjee, to appeal for restraint. The tension abated towards the evening after a special CBI court granted bail to all four in a virtual hearing, turning down a CBI plea for two-week judicial custody of the accused. Mukherjee, Hakim, Chatterjee — all of whom have been the city’s mayor — and Mitra figure in the charge sheet and are among the 13 accused in the Narada case that first surfaced ahead of the 2016 state assembly poll. A video sting purportedly showed several politicians and one police officer accepting money from a fictitious company. CBI counsel Dinesh Kumar also submitted charge sheets against the four arrested politicians and former Burdwan SP SMH Mirza (arrested earlier and now on bail) on Monday, pleading for judicial custody of the politicians as they were influential and could “tamper with evidence” and influence witnesses. But CBI special court judge Anupam Mukherjee asked Kumar about the need to arrest the four when the CBI had already submitted its charge sheet. Trinamool MP and senior advocate Kalyan Banerjee contested the CBI arrest plea, saying all four picked up on Monday were cooperating with the agency since 2017. Banerjee also cited a 2020 Supreme Court order in which it “did not take cognisance of sting operations”. Banerjee also argued that the CBI had sought sanction for prosecution in January 2021, which the state cabinet had rejected. “The Bengal poll results were declared on May 2, the CM took oath of office on May 5 but, on May 9, the Governor gave the sanction for prosecution when the CM was already in office. A Governor can never take an executive decision. The CBI charge sheet is based on this sanction, which itself is illegal,” said Banerjee. The court granted bail to all four after asking them to furnish a bond of Rs 50,000. The CBI sought the Calcutta high court’s intervention in the evening to continue the Narada probe in view of the “threats and intimidations” it had received during the day. But there was no confirmation till late on Monday about whether the agency had challenged the bail order in its HC appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-arrests-4-senior-tmc-netas-in-2014-bribery-case/articleshow/82724943.cms||---

The measure will enable sequencing of many more samples and allow enhanced spatial analysis. Currently, INSACOG has 10 labs across the country. According to the National Centre for Disease Control, the B.1.1.7 lineage (UK variant) was found predominant in samples collected in Punjab and Chandigarh between February-March. The minister congratulated defence scientists for launching the country’s first indigenous anti-Covid drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose or 2-DG (developed by DRDO in collaboration with INMAS and Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories), the ministry said. The minister informed that the drug can be a game-changer in the country’s response to the pandemic. The government also outlined its plans to ramp up testing capacities, particularly in rural areas which are now more susceptible to the virus. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said testing capacity is projected to increase to 45 lakh (RTPCR 18 lakh, RAT 27 lakh) per day, with deployment of mobile RT-PCR testing vans and amplification of RAT tests. Currrently, testing capacity is at 25 lakh samples (RTPCR 13 lakh, RAT 12 lakh). The new labs will enable sequencing of many more samples and allow enhanced spatial analysis. Currently, INSACOG has 10 labs across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/17-new-labs-soon-for-genome-sequencing/articleshow/82725042.cms||---

Brazil, the world’s third worst-hit country, has reported about 15.6 million cases so far. Comparison with previous data shows that India added the recent 5 million cases in a record 14 days. While the previous 5 million cases, when India crossed 20 million benchmark, were added in 15 days, it took 121 days to add the preceding 5 million cases that took India’s cumulative tally from 10 million to 15 million. Despite the grim landmark, Monday brought some respite as it was the second day in a row when cases didn’t breach the 3 lakh mark. The day’s death toll was also below 4,000. As of 11:00pm, 2.6 lakh cases and 3,719 deaths had been reported for the day. Apart from reporting a lower number of cases Monday also reported the steepest decline in active cases, which fell by about 1.5 lakh. However, active cases continue to remain above 3 million. State-wise analysis of the data shows that Karnataka leads the list with about 38,000 cases and is followed by Tamil Nadu which reported over 33,000 cases on Monday. The case count was 26,616 for Maharashtra and 21,402 for Kerala. Four other states reported between 10,000 to 20,000 cases and this included West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha. Uttar Pradesh’s case count fell below 10,000 mark while Delhi which was another epicenter of this wave of outbreak reported below 5,000 cases. Deaths have not witnessed that steep fall as cases as there are 12 states that reported over a hundred deaths on Monday. Maharashtra is leading the list with 516 deaths while Karnataka reported 476 fatalities. The national capital and Tamil Nadu both reported over 300 deaths and the toll was 285 for Uttar Pradesh. Other states to report over a hundred deaths were Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh.

We may have to multiply these efforts,” he added. The SJM said many Indian manufacturers had the capacity and expertise in production of essential medicines and vaccines, provided intellectual property rights hurdles were removed and technology transfer and trade secret issues resolved. “Patent protection is the major barrier to the generic production of these medicines. Many Indian companies are already making Remdesivir under voluntary licence. However, the quantity is not sufficient to meet the demand, and price is very high,” the SJM said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rss-arm-starts-campaign-for-universal-covid-19-vaccine-access/articleshow/82725704.cms||---
---||Business||WFA promotes tier-2 towns as talent hubs||MUMBAI: A year after several organisations adopted a ‘work from anywhere’ policy, tier-2 cities like Kochi, Guwahati, Jaipur, Indore and Mysore are said to have emerged as talent hubs. Last year, Axis Bank launched its ‘GIG-A-Opportunities’ programme to access new talent pools based not on geographic location, but skill. In the pilot project of 100 roles last fiscal, the bank hired both specialist freelancers and full-time employees in a work-from-anywhere format. Up to 60% of the hires were from across tier-2 towns. Axis Bank president & HR head Rajkamal Vempati, said, “These are all roles that are part of central teams and would have otherwise been based in Mumbai. The bank has found that talent both — in new age technology functions and traditional banking roles, such as audit — is available in cities like Jaipur, Lucknow and Indore where candidates have been selected over those based in large cities.” According to Talent500, there has been a 30-40% increase in demand for workforce in tier-2 cities within tech teams across sectors. Talent500 co-founder Vikram Ahuja said cities like Kochi, Guwahati, Jaipur and Indore are getting a lot of attention now because of good talent availability. “There’s talent that has gone back to these places and suddenly this notion that you need to be in Bengaluru or any other metro to live a certain lifestyle is no longer true,” said Ahuja. “Covid has made us all remote workers. In a post-pandemic world, remote won’t just be the new normal, but instead be a strategic advantage for companies as they build out their teams.” As companies look for good talent, location is no longer a priority. Chocolate major Mondelez India has also realised that there are a bunch of roles that can be done in a location-agnostic way. Last year, when Mondelez India hired a leader for one of its centres of expertise, the employee was based in Delhi. The agreement was that when offices reopen, this employee could come to Mumbai. It’s been a year now and the company says it’s working out well even if the employee operates from another location. Mondelez has identified a set of roles that it feels can actually operate from anywhere. There would, however, be roles that remain location-specific. But the numbers that are location-agnostic are surely on the rise. Mondelez India HR director Mahalakshmi R said, “We realise that despite jobs being located anywhere, and talent joining the organisation virtually, our attempt is to offer candidates the signature Mondelez experience when we onboard people online. This is to ensure we create a comfort level and a feeling of psychological safety at work.” Mondelez’s ‘FlexAble’ programme focuses on how leaders can inspire talent who might be working remotely. Meanwhile, there is already a good ecosystem of entrepreneurs and engineers in tier-2 towns, which is attracting talent. “Earlier, what used to happen is that companies would hire this talent and then ask them to relocate to a Mumbai or a Bengaluru. A lot of these people are now saying, ‘I’m living in Bhubaneswar or Kochi and my quality of life is great and my cost of living is one-third that of a Bengaluru, so I would like to work from here’. Realising this, companies are saying we will go where the talent exists and not expect them to relocate,” said Ahuja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wfa-promotes-tier-2-towns-as-talent-hubs/articleshow/82725715.cms||Namrata Singh

It clarified before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that the deadline for the policy to come into effect has not been extended, but accounts won’t be deleted immediately. “We are still trying to persuade consumers but if they don’t accept slowly, slowly these accounts will be deleted. There is no universal deadline for this,” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the company, said.In response, the Centre maintained that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp violates the Indian Information Technology (IT) law and rules, and sought directions to the social media platform to keep status quo intact. Appearing for Centre ASG Chetan Sharma, said that India has the largest number of users of WhatsApp in the world and there is an imminent need to maintain the status quo. He added that the government has written to Facebook CEO on the issue and a reply is awaited. However both WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook opposed any stay. It stressed that the policy doesn’t violate Indian law saying that any move to delete accounts will be on a case to case basis but there is no time limit for the same. The HC then posted the matter for detailed hearing on June 03. It is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the new privacy policy. It also issued notice to the Centre, Facebook and WhatsApp and sought their stand on one of the petitions by a lawyer who has claimed that the new policy violates users' right to privacy under the Constitution. When the matter was initially listed before a single judge, the Centre had said that WhatsApp was treating Indian users differently from Europeans over opting out of its new privacy policy which was a matter of concern for the government and it was looking into the issue. It had also said it was also a matter of concern that Indian users were being "unilaterally" subjected to the change in privacy policy by the instant messaging platform and that the government was looking into it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-privacy-policy-not-put-off-whatsapp-to-hc/articleshow/82725816.cms||Abhinav Garg

With commercial establishments reducing manpower to half, livelihoods of daily wagers has taken a hit for the second year in a row. But unlike in 2020 when political parties and people’s representatives distributed essential commodities, fruits and vegetables during the lockdown, little help is forthcoming this year. The state government’s decision to extend the curfew till the end of the month comes in the wake of the Covid-19 positivity rate in Andhra Pradesh touching 25 per cent. The government estimates that the move will help lower the number of Covid-19 cases. But for those working in the unorganised sector, the move brings with it its own set of difficulties. Many have lost their jobs and are struggling to feed their families. “I work as a salesman at a plumbing tools shop in One Town. As construction stopped, my owner decided to close the shop till the month-end. I lost my daily wage of Rs 300. My family is facing a severe financial crisis now,” said Jakka Ramana Rao, a resident of Madhuranagar. Many also expressed unhappiness with people’s representatives, starting from corporators to MLAs, who they viewed as confined to their homes and unavailable to the public. “Political parties and leaders made a beeline for our colonies to distribute essential commodities last year. Corporator candidates used food distribution to promote themselves. After completion of elections, no leader or public representative is now responding to our problems,” said M Lakshmi, a resident of Vambay Colony. The Left, meanwhile, has demanded the government supply essential commodities and food in urban slums. “This is the time when the rich should come forward to help the poor. Government should provide additional ration and financial aid to labourers who lost their livelihood due to the curfew,” said Donepudi Shankar, city secretary of CPI. For workers in the unorganised sector, the curfew has brought with it its own set of difficulties.

Authorities of the health wing have filed a complaint with the police. According to R Ankababu, station house officer (SHO) of Chilakalapudi police station, the immunisation wing of the District Medical and Health Office (DM&HO) sanctioned 1,000 doses of Covaxin for Narayanapuram urban PHC. ANMs at the centre had administered 300 doses of vaccine till Sunday and stored 700 doses in a freezer unit. On Monday, Dr Sanghamitra Amulya, medical officer at the centre, asked the nursing staff to count and verify the number of doses. It was then that staff found four vials of vaccine, equivalent to 40 doses, missing. The medical officer informed the DM&HO and raised a complaint at Chilakalapudi police station. A case has been registered and police questioned four ANMs and other staff at the centre. Meanwhile, in a joint operation, drug control administration officials and the vigilance and enforcement department in Vizag posed as customers and arrested two more persons for black marketing of Tocilizumab and Bevacizumab injections. The arrested were identified as Dadi Prasanna Kumar and S RamyaKrishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/four-vials-of-covaxin-go-missing-from-phc/articleshow/82717057.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Vigilance department cracks down on 50 hospitals fleecing Covid patients||VIJAYAWADA: Flying squads constituted by the vigilance and enforcement department have so far booked around 50 hospitals across the state predominantly for overcharging Covid-19 patients. Despite the government mandating that 50 per cent of the beds must be allotted under Aarogyasree scheme, most were found to neglecting the instructions. The V&E officials had received 500 complaints from the public, largely relating to overcharging at hospitals. Other complaints include black marketing of Remdesivir vials and denying treatment under the Aarogyasree scheme. While the lowest average charges for treatment stand at Rs 45,000 to Rs 60,000, the highest average stands at Rs 4 to Rs 4.5 lakh. A case in point would be a recent incident in Vijayawada in which one Y Ravi, a resident of Tadepalli, claimed that the hospital demanded Rs 2.5 lakh to discharge his cousin after the patient had recovered on May 10. Ravi informed vigilance officials that he had paid Rs 2 lakh as an advance on May 4 after doctors said the overall estimate was Rs 4 lakh. Based on the vigilance official’s complaint, a criminal case was registered against the hospital at Machavaram police station. Prior to that, on May 5, officials booked a private hospital in Piduguralla for allegedly collecting Rs 3.3 lakh from a patient for a five-day-long Covid-19 treatment. “Another FIR was booked against the same hospital for asking patients to bring their own Remdesivir vials,” a vigilance official said. Among the hospitals booked include Chaitra Hospital at Eluru, Asha Hospital at Anantapur, SR Hospital at Gopalapatnam in Visakhapatnam, Anil Neerukonda Hospital at Bheemli, Ramya Hospital at Visakhapatnam, Achuta Enclave and Sriram Hospital, both in Vijayawada, Viswas Hospital at Guntur, Dr Prasad Hospital at Pileru in Chittoor district. According to vigilance officials, they have ensured criminal cases were booked against 46 hospitals across the state till date, predominantly for overcharging and denying patients as eligible under the Aarogyasree scheme. K V Rajendranath Reddy, director-general, vigilance and enforcement, said they have arrested five persons for illegally selling Remdesivir vials in Nellore, Vijayawada and Vizag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vigilance-dept-cracks-down-on-50-hospitals-fleecing-covid-patients/articleshow/82717169.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

In the morning, complaints arose from various parts of the city about ambulances being unable to reach hospitals on time and having to be redirected due to unmanned blockades erected by the police as part of enforcing the lockdown. The ambulances rushing to medical college hospital and private hospitals from rural areas of the district ran into the blockade forcing drivers to reroute the vehicles. Soon the city police intervened and realigned the entry and exit points. The seven points in the city are Chengottukonam, Vettu Road in Kazhakkootam, Maruthoor in Mannanthala, Peroorkada-Vazhayila, Poojapura-Kundamankadavu, Nemom-Pallichal and Vizhinjam (Chappath). Emergency ambulances will be allowed to pass through the following points — Attinkuzhy, Pallithura, Vilayilkulam, Kakkamoola, Pappanamcode, Punnamoodu, Uchakada, Vellaikadavu, Nettayam, Keraladityapuram, Kizhakke Mukoola and Mangattukadavu. The city police have appealed to patients without serious ailments to make use of nearby hospitals. A route map was also published by the city police for vehicles headed to airport, railway station and major hospitals and for nurses, doctors and paramedical staff to travel in a smooth manner. The health personnel had raised objections to the unreasonable manner in which police erected barricades. Medical professionals have been asked to take a print out of their ID cards and paste it on the front glass for easy passage along the checking points. The police also issued numbers for emergency contact for route guidance regarding ambulances — 0471-2558731, 0471-2558732. The police levied a fine of Rs 1.4 lakh on the first day of triplelock down for various violations. Legal action was taken against 363 persons. A total of 64 persons faced action under Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-lay-out-green-corridor-for-ambulance/articleshow/82718700.cms||---

For, a census conducted on the world’s tallest flying bird in the state has revealed that its population may have gone up by about 20 per cent in a decade. Experts welcome the heartening news as the increase in population is despite dwindling wetlands and rapid urbanisation in the state. “In the two-day census that concluded on Sunday, we found out that the number of Sarus cranes have increased in the state. The last Sarus census was conducted by GEER Foundation in 2010 when the average count was 1,500. The census we conducted shows that the average population may be anywhere between 1,700 and 1,800,” said Dr Bakul Trivedi, secretary, Bird Conservation Society, Gujarat (BCSG) that conducted the census. “Sarus cranes usually stay in and around wetlands that are either getting encroached or fast disappearing. Despite their natural abodes reducing over the last few years, Sarus cranes have increased in numbers and it is an encouraging revelation for bird lovers,” Trivedi told TOI. The census conducted on May 15 and 16 revealed that about 80 per cent of the Sarus cranes were found in Ahmedabad, Anand and Kheda, while the others were spotted in Vadodara, Dahod, Navsari, Surat, Kutch and Saurashtra. “Summer count is important as Sarus usually congregate at wetlands during the day time and it becomes easy to spot them thereby giving better estimation of their numbers,” said Dr Anika Tere, principal investigator in the census. The BCSG has divided the state into five zones including north, central, south, Saurashtra and Kutch and volunteers were roped in to count the birds. “We will now prepare a detailed report about the census numbers, the abode of Sarus, our observations and suggestions. The report will be submitted to the forest department and the state government so that they can act on conservation of this bird,” Trivedi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sarus-crane-population-soars-by-20-in-gujarat/articleshow/82720635.cms||Tushar Tere

Srinivasan, who has been with the bank for over a decade, will complete his current term in September this year. Srinivasan said that the bank has sought RBI’s permission for a fresh term. On being asked if he is available for another term, “I am eligible and I am willing and so is the board,” he said. Last year, the central bank had approved the reappointment of Srinivasan as MD & CEO, for a year up to September 23, 2021. Last month, the RBI revised its norms to cap the tenure of the CEO of a bank at 12 years, which can be extended by the central bank to 15 years. It also placed an upper age limit of 70 for bank CEOs. This gives Srinivasan room for a 2- to 5-year extension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/federal-bank-seeks-to-extend-ceos-term-q4-net-profit-rises-59/articleshow/82720018.cms||Mayur Shetty

Reseacher Srinivas Kodali said: “You don’t exist for the authorities if you do not have Aadhaar. The Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory for every thing. Alternate ID cards should be taken for issue of vehicle passes.” He said the Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar card was clear that it could be used only for government subsidies and for tax collection. “The mandatory use of Aadhaar is avoidable and unnecessary,” he said. The researchers hvave also found that even for vaccination and remdesivir injections, Aadhaar has been made mandatory. The Unique Identification Authority of India recently said Aadhaar is mandatory for vaccines, hospitalisation and for medication. The UIDAI said: “There is a well-established mechanism for Aadhaar and it should be followed to ensure delivery of benefits and services in the absence of Aadhaar. If a resident does not possess Aadhaar, no one should be denied essential services as per the Aadhaar Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-question-use-of-aadhaar-for-passes/articleshow/82721033.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Going out? Carry sanitizer or cops may book you||AHMEDABAD: Sanitizers help you keep your hands free of germs and viruses. But carrying it around now may also help you to keep your record clean. Next time you leave the house, you may want to grab that bottle of sanitizer along with your mask. For, the police are now booking people who are out and about without a bottle of sanitizer. Though there is no rule specifying that people must carry sanitizer whenever they go out, Ahmedabad and Kheda district police have interpreted law their own way and booked people for not having sanitizer handy. In one case filed with Viramgam town police on Sunday, cops on patrol found that Ajit Pagi and Hariom Gupta, who sell panipuris for a living, were not carrying sanitizers. The two were booked for violating of Covid norms and for negligence that could lead to spread of the deadly coronavirus. In Sandhana village of Matar taluka in Kheda district, restaurant owner Abdulhalim Shelia was stopped on the road and booked on Sunday for not carrying a sanitizer. Though unlike Ahmedabad rural police, he was not booked for negligence. Instead, he was slapped with the charge of disobeying a notification which prohibits gatherings. Police sources said that cops usually book traders and businessmen for violation of Covid safety rules if they are not carrying sanitizers. “They are likely to spread infection due to the large number of people they meet every day,” sources added. A police officer said that such offences have been registered to ensure strict implementation of Covid-related protocol. However, when contacted, senior Gujarat police officers said that they were not aware of any such law under which people can be booked for not carrying sanitizers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/going-out-carry-sanitizer-or-cops-may-book-you/articleshow/82720571.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Lucknow||Military doctors lead Covid battle in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Akhilesh, 32, a businessman based in the national capital region (NCR), has recovered from Covid-19 infection and is set to be discharged in the next few days. Hailing from Lucknow, he returned to the city after his condition deteriorated due to coronavirus infection and his oxygen saturation level dipped below 70%. On May 10, he was admitted to the intensive care unit of Atal Bihari Vajpayee hospital, set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Talking to TOI, he said, “These warriors from the military in PPE kit, literally took me out from the clutches of coronavirus, the biggest enemy of humanity. Their dedication towards patient care is of highest level,” he said. The army has roped in medical staff from commands in various parts of the country. Some staff members, including surgeons, pulmonologists, anesthetists, physicians, pediatricians, resident doctors and nursing officers, have served in militancy-hit Jammu & Kashmir, bone-chilling cold in Kargil and even during India-China standoff in Doklam. Some health staff members posted in various regiments and units in south Indian states are also a part of the team at the DRDO hospital. There are 82 doctors from various fields of specialization, some still pursuing post-graduation, working in shifts to give medical care to patients, while 15 doctors have the responsibility for administration and operations. The hospital also has 42 nursing officers who are assisted by 104 paramedics and technicians. At least 60 others, including civilians, are working as support staff. With the help of over 300 staff, the hospital has successfully managed to discharge 107 patients ever since it started operations on May 5. Unfortunately, 120 patients lost their battle for life. Currently, there are 162 patients admitted to the makeshift hospital. “Of the total deaths, nearly one-third of the patients succumbed within hours or even minutes of admission in triage area. We found that patients who lost battle against Covid were earlier admitted to other hospitals for nearly two weeks and when their condition deteriorated, they were sent to our facility. It pained us to know that hospitals charged hefty fee from such patients,” said Brigadier Girish Chandra Gulati, the nodal officer of makeshift hospital. “Our staff members get drenched in sweat in PPE suit while working round the clock in shifts of over six hours each. They are making every possible effort to help Covid patients return home safely,” he added. According to officials at the hospital, a couple of on-duty staff also got exposed to infection but it didn’t affect the morale of these corona warriors. Major Gautami, the nursing officer who was recently infected with coronavirus, resumed duty in ICU right after the day she tested negative. “It’s all about team work. I have been in the military for nearly decades now and have gained experience in Covid duty. In these extraordinary circumstances, the contribution of every medical staff is important and I’m doing my part,” she said. Her team, comprising nearly a dozen members of paramedics and nursing assistance, has the responsibility of not only constantly checking parameters of patients, but also help patients clean them after they pass urine or stool. Similarly, Lt Col Priyanka Singh, a pulmonologist who has served in forward area, said: “Covid duty is demanding, it’s an extraordinary experience. Sometimes we feel breakdown but we buckle up again to help our colleagues and patients. I have 15-month-old kid and aged in-laws, so I have to maintain a balance between the hazardous nature of my work and family life.” Resident doctors like Squadron Leader Agrima Bhatia and her husband, Squadron Leader (resident surgeon) Swarup Prabhu, are among the few couples who are living apart in different states and active in Covid duty. “He is posted in a military-run makeshift Covid hospital in Ahmedabad. We hardly get time to interact, as I have a day shift here and he is on night shift. But we have no regrets as we joined military medical services to serve people,” she said. “It is a battle to save humanity. Like any other battlefield, it’s a game of patience and timely action. We will win it,” said group captain Dr Rohit Bavdekar, the second-in-command in the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/military-docs-lead-covid-battle-in-city/articleshow/82723388.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Patna||Patna: Contradictory affidavits on deaths in Buxar district irk Patna high court||PATNA: The Patna high court on Monday took exception to the contradictory affidavits filed by the chief secretary and Patna divisional commissioner on the number of deaths in Buxar. While the chief secretary affidavit mentioned only six deaths in Buxar since March 1, the commissioner submitted that altogether 789 cremations took place only at Chardham Ghat of Buxar in ten days from May 5 to 14. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing the PILs of Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh, observed that the facts revealed in the commissioner's affidavit were disturbing. If 789 cremations took place only at one ghat in ten days then what would be the position in the entire district and that, too, of people from all faiths. The bench orally directed advocate general Lalit Kishore to caution the officers or else it would amount to filing of false or incomplete affidavit. Refraining from making any comments over the contradictory affidavits, the court directed the state government to reply again before Thursday clarifying the number of deaths from Covid-19 and other reasons along with age groups in the district for hearing on Friday. It also pulled up the state government for not updating data on official website site recording the number of deaths and births. The commissioner’s affidavit also mentioned that 81 bodies were recovered from the Ganga in Buxar last week and they were later buried after DNA profiling and following other procedures. The bodies had come from upstream in Uttar Pradesh. In fact, the court had sought the state government’s reply on the recovery of bodies found floating in the Ganga in Buxar district. Amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli brought to light that either there is one or no government ambulance at all in several districts of Bihar having more than 10 lakh population. Citing his report before the high court, Mauli submitted that Araria is one such district with a population of more than 10 lakh but no government ambulance for needy patients. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar orally remarked that the state government can crowdfund from the rich in the state or use funds allocated to lawmakers for public benefit to purchase ambulances amid the pandemic. The court would conduct hearing on reports of Mauli and a technical committee formed on its order on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Centre’s additional solicitor general KN Singh submitted that Bihar’s daily quota for procuring liquid oxygen has been further increased to 400 metric tonnes from earlier 300 metric tonnes. To this, the court directed the health department principal secretary to reply in two days about the infrastructure to procure the allocated daily quota, its storage and transportation to end users and if the increased quota is sufficient or not. Singh also raised the issue of a large number of oxygen cylinders found lying in the garbage near the government hospital at Gardanibagh, as also reported in the media. Singh also submitted that a large number of oxygen cylinders had been already handed over to the state by the central government and more were on the way. The court also orally asked the advocate general to apprise what target the state government had set for vaccinating the younger people in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/contradictory-affidavits-on-buxar-deaths-irk-hc/articleshow/82717887.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In the same period, 11,216 patients recovered, bringing the active caseload down to 69,696. However, 96 deaths were reported on Monday and the youngest being a 20-day-old newborn at AIIMS-Patna. The child was born in a private hospital at Khagaul through normal delivery. Initially, he developed symptoms of jaundice, after which he was taken to Kurji Holy Family Hospital. “After a couple of days, he developed breathlessness and his Covid test came positive. Then, he was referred to AIIMS, where he died today. Our child was healthy when he was born,” said Vikas Kumar, the uncle of the deceased. However, Patna still recorded more than 1,000 single-day cases as 1189 people tested positive in the district on Monday. After Patna, Vaishali recorded maximum 371 cases, followed by Gaya (289), Samastipur (280), West Champaran (228), Madhubani (226), Nalanda (226), Begusarai (214) and Supaul (200).

---||Patna||Black fungus cases on rise, 22 at AIIMS-Patna||PATNA: Cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, caused by mucor, have been on the rise in Bihar as several people have been diagnosed with the rare back fungal infection after recovering from the Covid-19. As many as 22 patients of black fungus have been admitted to AIIMS-Patna, where a separate 20-bed ward for them has been opened on Monday. The remaining patients of mucormycosis are being treated in other wards of the hospital. A team of ophthalmologists, ENT specialists, neuro and plastic surgeons has been deputed in this ward. AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said 10 more patients with symptoms of black fungus have been given appointments for admission. “Two of the 22 patients had to undergo surgery as the black fungus had severely affected their nasal. Three patients are unconscious as the infection has travelled to their brain,” he said. “In some cases, surgery requires removal of all dead and infected tissues. It is important that people should contact the doctors on detecting early symptoms like pain in facial areas, redness in eyes, proptosis and nasal crusting. These symptoms can be treated with anti-fungal medication,” Dr Sanjeev said. “The AIIMS-P has received about 100 calls from people having symptoms of black fungus after recovering from Covid and also during their treatment at different private hospitals,” he said. Majority of the patients admitted to AIIMS-P are from Ara, Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Muzaffarpur and Begusarai among other places. Covid patients who are diabetic or have other comorbidities have a higher chance of catching this infection. High usage of steroids during the Covid treatment, prolonged hospitalisation in ICU and use of non-sterilised humidifier are some of the reasons behind the fungal infection. In severe cases, the infection could lead to loss of eyesight and even death in rare cases. Four mucormycosis patients are also undergoing treatment at Ruban Memorial Hospital and all have gone through the surgical removal of dead tissues. Dr Satyajeet Kumar Singh, consultant urologist, said the eyeballs of two patients were removed to stop the infection from travelling to the brain. “One patient, who is also a doctor from Bettiah Medical College, is in a critical condition due to late hospitalisation,” he said. Dr Pankaj Hans said the doctor from Bettiah has been operated for rhinocerebral mucormycosis. “He is having multiple comorbidities and still in a critical condition. He is not maintaining adequate saturation level even on ventilator support,” he told this newspaper. Ten patients are also admitted at IGIMS-Patna besides four suspected cases while one was discharged after recovery. “The state government has provided us liposomal amphotericin-B injection for the treatment of black fungus,” said its superintendent Dr Manish Mandal. Paras HMRI regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim said six more patients with black fungus have been admitted in the last 24 hours, taking their number to 10. “Two patients require surgery while the others can be treated with anti-fungal medication,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/black-fungus-cases-on-rise-22-under-treatment-at-aiims-p/articleshow/82717810.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Rajkot||Cyclone Tauktae pummels Gujarat; massive destruction in coastal Saurashtra||RAJKOT/SURAT/AHMEDABAD: Cyclone Tauktae barrelled dangerously into Covid-battered Gujarat after making a landfall near the Union territory of Diu late on Monday night, packing ferocious winds and pounding heavy rain, which were projected to wreak severe destruction in coastal districts of Saurashtra. The landfall began around 8:45pm and continued till late night with Tauktae surging further into the land, according to IMD’s specialized cyclone centre. Massive storm surge in the sea with waves as high as three metres inundated hundreds of coastal villages while electricity was snapped as strong winds flattened electricity poles in most parts of Amreli, Gir-Somnath and Diu. Junagadh, Gir-Somnath, Bhavnagar and Amreli were reeling under heavy rain and winds speeding up to 100 km per hour that started howling by Monday noon. The winds were accompanied by dust storms. The coastal highway near Kodinar town was littered with large number of coconut trees that collapsed due to gale, eyewitnesses said. In Una town alone, at least 200 trees and a mobile tower collapsed but there were no reports of deaths or injuries. There were reports of glasses in Diu hotels getting shattered late in the night. The situation late on Monday night suggested heavy damage in coastal towns of Una and Kodinar as well as Diu, which were continuously battered by extremely strong winds, huge tidal waves and heavy rain. Most areas were in pitch darkness due to power outage. The threat of wreckage also loomed as nearly 4,000 fishing boats were anchored close to each other in the coastal towns. A 38-year-old woman identified as Sharmishta Rawal died in Patan after an electricity pole that got uprooted due to strong winds fell on her. Rawal was sitting outside her house in Hari Society when the incident occurred. Ahmedabad city too witnessed rainfall that lasted for nearly 30 minutes. More rain is forecast for Tuesday. The impact of Tauktae was felt in north Gujarat, as far as 600 km away from landfall point near Diu, as several districts reeled under wet spell and squally weather. IMD said Tauktae, with an elliptical eye of around 42km diameter, is spewing winds gusting up to 150-160 kmph. Chief minister Vijay Rupani said close to two lakh people in 17 vulnerable districts were shifted to safer locations while 50 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 10 SDRF teams were stationed to minimize human losses. The Army, Navy and Air Force were also on the stand-by. “The maximum impact of the cyclone will be witnessed in Gir-Somnath, Amreli, Junagadh and Bhavnagar where wind speeds were touching 150 kmph. In Dwarka, Porbandar and Rajkot too, winds were gusting at 100 kmph,” he said. “People have been shifted to over 2,000 shelters with Covid-19 guidelines,” Pankaj Kumar, additional chief secretary, revenue, told reporters. Kumar said late in the night that there were neither casualties so far nor any major damage to property. He said that infrastructure will be hit hard due to the cyclone. Kumar said there were 629 incidents of electricity failure of which 440 were resolved. “Until now, 234 electricity poles have fallen so far,” he added.  More than one lakh policemen including 13,000 home guards, 30,000 Gram Rakshak Dal (GRD) jawans have been deployed in Saurashtra region, state DGP Ashish Bhatia said. All major airports across the state including those in Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara and Kandla remained shut in wake of the cyclone. Vadodara airport will remain closed till Tuesday. As many as 18 flights were cancelled at Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport on Monday. For the first time in at least a decade, the ‘great danger’ signal was hoisted at all ports and private jetties, which have already shut down operations. Over 100 ships were sent back to high seas for the fear of accidents.  Corporate and industrial houses in Gujarat are also taking various precautionary measures too minimize the impact of cyclone. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman MukeshAmbani was camping in Moti Khavdi in Jamnagar district where the company runs the world’s largest refinery with a huge petrochemicals project. Tauktae, which rapidly turned into an extremely severe storm, was the strongest to hit Gujarat, after 1998 when the Kandla cyclone left nearly 4,000 dead and inflicted huge damage to India’s busiest government-run port. IMD has predicted heavy to very heavy rains at a few places with isolated extremely heavy falls in 22 districts and UTs of Diu, Daman and Dadra & NagarHaveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tauktae-pummels-gujarat-massive-destruction-in-coastal-saurashtra/articleshow/82726958.cms||---

---||Delhi||New at-home norms put in place in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Days after the Centre issued revised guidelines for home isolation of mild/asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, Delhi government on Tuesday ordered their implementation in all districts. In a circular issued by directorate general of health services, the districts have been directed to ensure that every patient in home isolation has a pulse oximeter. “Records pertaining to the distribution of pulse oximeters are to be maintained by every district. The same is to be shared with the authorities concerned daily,” added the circular. The revised guidelines state that the decision to administer remdesivir or any other investigational therapy must be taken by a medical professional and administered only in a hospital setting. “Do not attempt to procure or administer remdesivir at home. Also, systemic oral steroids are not indicated in mild disease. If symptoms persist beyond seven days (persistent fever, worsening cough, etc) consult the treating doctor for treatment with low dose oral steroids. In case of falling oxygen saturation or shortness of breath, seek immediate consultation of the treating physician/surveillance team,” the guidelines mention. Patients aged over 60 and those with co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung, liver or kidney disease, cerebro-vascular disease, etc would only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation by the treating medical officer. Patients suffering from immunocompromised status (HIV, transplant recipients, cancer, etc) have not been recommended for home isolation. For those in home isolation, regular monitoring of health should be done by the caregivers or patient. “Immediate medical attention must be sought if serious signs or symptoms develop. These could include difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation (SpO2 <94% at room air), persistent pain or pressure in the chest and mental confusion,” said the circular. Such patients would stand discharged and isolation would end after at least 10 days have passed from onset of symptoms or from date of sampling for asymptomatic cases and no fever for three days. There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over. “Patients may perform warm water gargles or take steam inhalation twice a day. If fever is not controlled with the maximum dose of paracetamol 650mg four times a day, consult the doctor, who may consider advising other drugs like naproxen 250mg twice a day. Taking ivermectin tablet (200 mcg/kg) once a day on an empty stomach for 3-5 days should be considered. Budesonide via inhalers at a dose of 800 mcg twice daily for 5-7 days may be given if symptoms stay beyond five days,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-at-home-norms-put-in-place-in-city/articleshow/82753331.cms||---

While the trading will be in electronic receipts of gold, the delivery would be in physical form in various parts of India, the paper proposed. It also mooted trading in electronic gold receipts of various denominations of 1kg, 100gm, 50gm and, subject to conditions, for 5gm and 10gm. However, it proposed that physical delivery could be mandated only when an investor has accumulated gold receipts aggregating 50gm or more. On Monday, Sebi also came out with draft norms for vault managers, who would be be a key part of the proposed gold exchange and platform. Sebi said the proposed gold exchange, encompassing the entire ecosystem of trading and physical delivery of gold, is extremely necessary to create a vibrant gold ecosystem in India, which is commensurate with its large share of global gold consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-proposes-delivery-based-gold-exchange/articleshow/82719810.cms||---
---||Business||IDMA seeks patent waiver for Covid drugs||MUMBAI: Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA) has said waiving of patents may help overcome shortage of Covid drugs. However, a waiver may not be sufficient for increased and free availability of vaccines in the country. “What is more important is grant of voluntary licenses (VLs) by patent holders to domestic companies with sufficient expertise,” IDMA said. It added that Astra Zeneca and Serum Institute of India is a successful working model. Other vaccine developers need to come forward and similarly transfer technology to domestic companies against reasonable royalties, the industry body said. “In case of pharmaceutical products (including APIs), which are directly or indirectly used for Covid treatment, there is an urgent need for intellectual property (IP) rights to be waived at the global level to boost production and ensure there are no shortages. The recent shortage of Remdesivir in India is a wake-up call. Capacities of all medicines connected with this pandemic should be ramped up to ensure free availability at reasonable prices,” IDMA said. Further, WTO has also provided provision of compulsory licensing (CL) for tackling such an eventuality. “Our government should not feel shy in invoking this very thoughtful provision in the interest of humanity and our citizens. In view of the current suffering of humanity, urgent action needs to be taken by the world coming together to ensure free flow of technology till the virus is eradicated”, the statement said. Rival body Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers, which represents MNCs, also echoed the same views on the waiver recently, saying it may not help in increasing production of vaccines. This comes even as the US in a drastic turnaround recently supported a waiver of intellectual property on Covid-19 vaccines. While India and South Africa are engaged jointly at the World Trade Organisation for a patient waiver submitted in October last year for all Covid-19 medical tools. Recently, faced with crucial vaccine shortages and key Covid-19 drugs, there has been demand from patent and health activists to suspend patents on them, to improve their accessibility and affordability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idma-seeks-patent-waiver-for-covid-drugs/articleshow/82719903.cms||---
---||Business||Second Covid wave hit demand more than supply, says RBI||MUMBAI: The RBI has said the resurgence of Covid has dented but not debilitated economic activity in the first half of Q1FY22. The central bank added that the loss of momentum may not be as severe this time compared to Q1 of last fiscal. Pointing out that the second wave has overwhelmed India and the world, the RBI said that real economic indicators have moderated in April-May 2021. “The biggest toll of the second wave is in terms of a demand shock — loss of mobility, discretionary spending and employment, besides inventory accumulation, while aggregate supply is less impacted.” Coronavirus: Live updatesThe central bank, in its monthly ‘State of the Economy’ report, notes that the fourth-quarter results of 288 companies point to a distinct shift from previous quarters, with top line growth gaining prominence in a broad-based manner. These companies constitute half the market capitalisation in the stock markets. Meanwhile, State Bank of India (SBI) warned in a report that the increase in healthcare spends on account of Covid, rising fuel prices and online delivery of articles risks crowding out consumer spending. According to SBI group’s chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh, health expenditure, which currently constitutes 5% of overall inflation basket, may jump to at least 11% due to the pandemic. Consumers are likely to make up for this by cutting back on other items of discretionary consumption, he said. Besides health, rising fuel prices, which includes petrol and LPG, are bringing down spending capacity of Indians. He pointed out that the share of non-discretionary spend has risen to 59% in April from 52% in March. This is not good for the economy, he said. The RBI-published report’s positive comments come at a time when most forecasters are downgrading their growth targets for the economy. On Monday, Moody’s said that the resurgence of coronavirus will delay earnings recovery for Indian corporates but it also denied other demand factors that will compensate. “Movement restrictions and weaker consumer sentiment amid the second virus wave will hit housing and automobile sales as well as transportation-fuel demand temporarily. Still, rising consumer preference for remote working and personal mobility solutions will drive long-term demand for bigger homes and entry-level cars,” says Sweta Patodia, a Moody’s Analyst. “Demand for IT and telecommunication services will remain strong despite our expectation of a slowdown in economic activity over the next few months.” Similarly, strong global demand could boost exports from Indian steel-makers but cement consumption growth is expected to be lower than Moody’s previous forecast of 10-12%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/second-wave-hit-demand-more-than-supply-says-rbi/articleshow/82719472.cms||---

The index settled 1.7% higher at 49,581, close to its one month-high of 49,766. The sensex also reversed its two-session losing streak. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 245 points higher at 14,923. Trading on Tuesday is expected to be volatile, On one hand, foreign investors are continuing to remain net sellers in the Indian market, while on the other, a steady global market could support the bulls, market players said. In Monday’s session, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 2,256 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 1,948 crore. According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Nifty rebounded sharply as domestic Covid cases fell below the 3 lakh mark for the first time since mid-April. “Extended lockdowns by majority states has helped in curbing the cases. Sentiments turned buoyant that soon restrictions/curbs would be eased once cases decline further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-jumps-848-pts-over-drop-in-new-covid-cases/articleshow/82719522.cms||---

---||Business||Aditya Birla Capital awaits RBI report to take bank licence call||Mumbai: Aditya Birla Capital (AB Capital) is awaiting an RBI internal working group’s final recommendations before taking a call on pursuing a banking licence. AB Capital, which is the holding company for all financial services, will be listing its asset management company and the board will take a call on other value unlocking opportunities, CEO Ajay Srinivasan said. After reporting a net profit of Rs 1,127 crore (up 22%), Srinivasan said that the company has achieved scale due to its diversified platform that allows it to leverage customer relationships, brand value, talent and information technology across businesses. This enables the company to compete with banks, whose distribution power enables them to own the largest lending, mortgage, mutual fund and insurance business in India. In its draft recommendations, an internal panel of the central bank had suggested that the RBI allow corporate-owned NBFC to set up banks. “In lending, we are about Rs 60,000 crore, which is a reasonable size compared to a mid-sized bank. Our total assets under management are Rs 3.4 lakh crore. Both as a diversified entity and as individual businesses, we have performed better than any individual cohort and that is the value of the diversified platform that we have built,” said Srinivasan. According to Srinivasan, Aditya Birla Health Insurance is bringing in the largest number of new customers to the group, while the lending business is bringing in margin and profits. “Health insurance is so underpenetrated in India that there is tremendous scope. Similarly, there is a lot of potential to sell life protection and mutual funds are picking up in a big way in smaller towns,” said Srinivasan. He said that the technology platform is enabling the group to upsell and cross-sell products. “Analytics is enabling us to offer an increase in sum insured to customers against a single click. Similarly, we are getting 10,000 health insurance customers a day against a product offering to Vi (Vodafone Idea) customers,” he said. Besides giving a big boost to digital, the pandemic has opened new talent pools including access to gig workers. In lending, the group is targeting to add 125 additional branches in 12-18 months and to increase its net interest margin to 6.25%. The company has managed to retain its loan book despite Covid challenges as it has digitised processes enabling automated data extraction from unstructured documents and using analytics to make personalised offers. Customers can complete their KYC process as well as their purchase over WhatsApp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aditya-birla-capital-awaits-rbi-report-to-take-bank-licence-call/articleshow/82719614.cms||Mayur Shetty

In many households, no power meant no water, and many families skipped their bath. Seniors, too, lost connection with their loved ones, resulting in panic in a state that has India's highest percentage of senior citizens. In Mapusa, a senior citizen couple was cut off from the world and couldn’t contact their children. They also watched tragically as their effort and money went down the drain with the fish, chicken and meat they stocked up on for the lockdown getting spoiled. “Such a waste of food and money,” Jacinta Mascarenhas told TOI. “We will have to go out again, risking our lives during the pandemic,” she said, adding that this is the longest power outage she’s ever experienced. The power problems brought along water woes. “We couldn’t turn on our pump, so none of us had a bath or were able to wash any clothes. Power returned after 30 hours, but it was very low voltage, so we still couldn’t turn our pump on,” a Socorro resident said. Several youth working from home resorted to charging their phones in their vehicles. The power outage also hit those in home isolation, as doctors monitoring patients could not be reached as their phone batteries ran out of power. “I had to go to the city to get connected. On Sunday, it was a total cut off. I had no electricity or internet, and thus couldn't take any calls,” a doctor told TOI. Some fortunate citizens found they were not that fortunate after their inverters drained out. Pranav Parab said that his inverter drained out, and he suffered with no mobile network for close to 29 hours. “I charged my phone in my car,” he said. Porvorim resident Juino de Souza said that to let citizens go for two days without power supply indicated that the state is seriously lacking in disaster management. “Where are the disaster management teams? Disaster management means quick response,” he said. “You can’t sleep over a disaster. Electricity is a basic necessity, and citizens’ calls have fallen on deaf ears.” Others had more than just a power problem to battle. A family rehabilitated at a government primary school in Bicholim found that the school's tiles had blown off, and that water was seeping in. “There is water inside, and they are mopping it away,” said a social worker. “No electricity and water for two days. Their firewood got wet, so no food today either, as their gas is over. Both parents have disabilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-struggle-as-outage-grows-beyond-48-hrs/articleshow/82721022.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Participating in a meeting held through videoconferencing under the chairmanship of Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Monday, state education department’s additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said online classes are organized for schoolchildren from time to time during the ongoing pandemic, but a good number of them fail to take advantage of those classes owing to the lack of appropriate electronic devices. He said provision of dedicated electronic devices to these children would not only help them learn the lessons being taught but also minimize the digital divide. “The state government will submit a detailed proposal to this effect at the next meeting of the project approval board of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan for 2021-22,” he said. Kumar pointed out that in the light of the 73rd and 74th amendments in the Constitution, the state government has entrusted the Panchayati Raj institutions with the task of appointing and administering schoolteachers, but the role of panchayati raj institutions in the New Education Policy is not well defined. He urged the Centre to make it clear with respect to the devolution of power. He apprised the Union minister with the fact that Class X and XII board examinations were held in February and their results were published well on time. Under the enrolment drive launched in March this year, as many as 36 lakh children were admitted in different classes except Class I, VI and IX. Again, to compensate for the loss of learning due to closure of schools last year, a three-month catch up course was to be launched in the month of April, but the same could not happen owing to the second wave of Covid-19 infections. However, online classes are being held on Doordarshan and online App e-LOTS, the additional chief secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-urged-to-provide-e-devices-to-schoolkids/articleshow/82717716.cms||B K Mishra
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Curfew, restrictions hit coconut farmers’ prospects||VISAKHAPATNAM: Coconut farmers in the state have seen a sharp decline in demand for their produce as many eateries have shut down due to Covid-19 in various states. Usually summer sees a huge demand for tender coconuts but Covid-19 restrictions this year have hurt the farmers. “Though we have been harvesting coconuts and tender coconuts, we are finding it difficult to sell due to transport issues. Traders are not coming forward to buy. It is very difficult to preserve tender coconuts for a long time,” said B N Raju, a coconut farmer in Srikakulam district. Andhra Pradesh has been selling coconuts and tender coconuts to Telangana and various north Indian states. Local traders usually visit the farms to buy coconuts from farmers and transport the produce to Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Due to lockdown in some states and restrictions in a few others, locals traders have reduced procurement citing difficulties in transportation. Keeping in view the circumstances such as lockdown and restrictions, some traders are also paying a lower price for the produce. “Earlier they used to pay Rs 17,000 to Rs 20,000 per 1,000 coconuts. Now, they have reduced the price and procurement. We have been incurring losses and we don’t know how long it will continue,” said K Ramakrishna, a farmer. There used to be brisk demand for coconuts in Vizag, Vijayawada and other cities during the summer. In Vizag, 15,000 tender coconuts would be sold in a day. Now, this number has gone down to 5,000 and most of the tender coconut outlets have been closed. However, consumers say that some traders are selling low quality tender coconut citing shortage of supply and charging Rs 30 per tender coconut. “Tender coconut water is one of the essential items for Covid-19 patients and others during summer, said D Sudhakar, a resident of Vizag city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/curfew-restrictions-hit-coconut-farmers-prospects/articleshow/82717231.cms||Nalla.Babu

Addressing the virtual workshop on ‘Oxygen Production and Promotion Policy 2021’ organised by the BIA, he said his department has been working closely with the health department to meet the increased demand for oxygen due to the Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen at hospitals and the supply of liquid oxygen in the state. The minister appreciated the BIA initiative to supply free oxygen to individuals for emergency purposes.BIA president Ram Lal Khetan said the oxygen will be supplied to individuals only when they deposit the security money. “The money will be returned once they returned the oxygen cylinder. Right now, we have 150 oxygen cylinder, each has a capacity of 10 litres. We have procured 600 oxygen cylinders from an Ahmedabad supplier, however, 450 cylinders have been sent to different district for use,” he said. Brijesh Mehrotra, the additional chief secretary of the industries department highlighted the Oxygen Production and Promotion Policy and said that Bihar has become the first state in the country to come up with such a policy. “In Bihar, we have 20 operational units of liquefied medical oxygen (LMO) and one air separator unit. On April 15, we have supplied 15 metric tonnes of oxygen while up to 270 metric tonnes per day during peak time,” Mehrotra said adding that they are going to set up 10 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plant in different sub-divisional hospitals in the state with the help of BIADA. He said the health department have allocated the land at ten sub-divisional hospitals for the PSA oxygen generation plant and the work order has been given. “These plants will be ready before June-mid. We are also going to set up one air separator unit of 1,500 cylinders on a lease agreement. It will be operational by June-mid.,” Mehrotra said. Talking about the oxygen policy, the additional chief secretary said the state government would give incentives to high priority sector units, including LMO, medical oxygen generation, storage tank cylinder manufacturing, oxygen concentrators and auxiliary devices, and oxygen logistics units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shahnawaz-launches-oxygen-bank-of-bia-lauds-its-free-supply-initiative/articleshow/82717372.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Cyclone Tauktae: Partly cloudy skies, slight dip in temperature expected in Bihar||PATNA: Even as the extremely severe cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae' lashed parts of Maharashtra during the day and hit coastal Gujarat late in the evening on Monday, weathermen at the Patna Meteorological Centre said it was unlikely to have much impact on the weather in Bihar. Partly cloudy skies along with a slight dip in mercury are, however, expected in the next 24 hours. As per a special bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) at 5.30 pm on Monday, Tauktae was centred over east-central and the adjoining northeast Arabian Sea, 190 km west-northwest of Mumbai and 90 km southeast of Diu, moving towards Gujarat coast at a speed of 170-180 kmph gusting up to 200 kmph. The IMD stated in the bulletin that it was likely to cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Bhavnagar district between 8-11 pm with a maximum sustained wind speed of 155-165 kmph gusting up to 185 kmph. Sanjay Kumar, an official at the Patna Meteorological Centre, claimed that only the outer band of the cyclone may influence the weather in Bihar and eastern parts of the country. "After making landfall near Porbandar in Gujarat, Tauktae is expected to move north-eastward. Like any other cyclone, Tauktae will also start gradually weakening after landfall as moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea will gradually reduce as it will move over,” the official said. “Nevertheless, we expect partly cloudy skies along with a slight drop in temperature in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring region till Tuesday night," Sanjay told TOI on Monday evening. Cyclone Tauktae, the season’s first major storm, is likely to enter Rajasthan after making landfall over the Gujarat coast and private weather agencies have also claimed that its ruminants may affect Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well. It is likely to weaken from an extremely severe cyclonic storm to a severe cyclonic storm by Monday midnight and cyclonic storm by Tuesday morning and further into depression by Tuesday afternoon, by when wind speed is likely to come down to 35-45kmph. Meanwhile, surging mercury continues to raise discomfort level in the state. Gaya was the hottest place in Bihar on Monday with the maximum temperature recorded at 41.3 degrees C, while it stood at 40 degrees C at Patna. Weathermen have predicted that maximum temperature is likely to be in the range of 35-38 degrees C in north Bihar and 37-41 degrees C in south Bihar, with districts, including Buxar, Bhojpur, Gaya and Patna to be comparatively hotter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tauktae-impact-partly-cloudy-skies-slight-dip-in-temp-expected/articleshow/82717519.cms||Piyush Tripathi

He said CM Nitish Kumar should step down if he is unable to handle the problem, adding that people have lost faith in him and his government. “If we get the opportunity, we will show you how a government is run and how management is done,” said Tejashwi in a Facebook live. He attacked the ruling party leaders who had raised questioned his absence, saying, “Since the beginning, I have been saying that the government has failed, but people in the government are doing negative politics instead of correcting their mistakes." He further said, "Those in the power are now looking for me, which shows they have no faith in CM Nitish and the government. We know the fact about health infrastructure, but those who are blindfolded need to visit the hospitals and crematorium to find out about the reality of the lack of oxygen, beds, and uninstalled ventilators. They should go and see how dead bodies are being carried in a cart.” The younger Yadav scion said he will also be writing a letter to the CM to seek permission to visit and take the stock of the situation on the ground. He said if he goes to hospitals then FIR will be lodged against him for violating norms as done previously on many occasions. Tejashwi said he and his party leaders had been extending all possible help with their limited resources, be it procuring oxygen from foreign countries, arranging for beds, medicines, or setting up Covid care centres at a few places. He offered his party offices and bungalow allotted to him to be used for Covid patients. “But we cannot deploy doctors and nurses. This government got more than one year, still, they failed even in filling the vacant posts of healthcare workers.” He further attacked the government for taking money from the MLA fund saying it had left the legislators handicapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-slams-cm-on-covid-failure-asks-him-to-quit-if-he-cant-handle-crisis/articleshow/82717565.cms||Sheezan Nezami

There have been several cases across the state where both parents have succumbed to the virus, leaving their little kids staring at an uncertain future. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has taken a decision to help these children by depositing Rs 10 lakh each in their names and use the money and the accrued annual interest for their welfare and education. Directing officials to collect the data of children in the state who have become orphans due to Covid-19, he asked them to evolve a package and policy on this. “The money deposited in the name of the children should mature after 25 years. Consult banks and insurance companies to get the best rate of interest for the deposits so that the money can come to their aid every year. The interest amount should be paid to the child or their guardian every month,” the chief minister told officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/aps-covid-19-orphans-to-get-rs-10l-aid/articleshow/82716993.cms||Gopi Dara

He said the government will ready its own plants with a capacity of 300-400 metric tonnes (MT) over the next 45 days. Along with irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav, newly-elected Tirupati MP Dr Gurumurthy and Gudur legislator V Varaprasada Rao, Mekapati inaugurated an oxygen plant at Gudur in Nellore district on Monday. Speaking to the media, Mekapati said chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has set a target to construct oxygen plants of 1,000 MT capacity in the state to make AP self-reliant. He said new plants with a capacity of 300-400 MT would be readied in the first phase in the next 45 days. “The CM was firm that the state should not face a crisis with regard to oxygen supplies and depend on transportation from other states in future. We are going ahead with our own plants in all major public hospitals to see that there will not be any shortage of oxygen,” said Mekapati. The minister pointed out that the new policy would help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) rapidly launch production and supply operations. The government will grant incentives to manufacturers of oxygen concentrators, he said, adding that they would also grant additional subsidies to industries producing oxygen. Mekapati said two old plants in Nellore district have been revived with the help of the Indian Navy and put into service. The plant revived at Gudur can supply 440 cylinders per day, the minister said, while a new oxygen plant at Government General Hospital, Nellore would shortly be inaugurated. Mekapati said new technologies are being used to produce oxygen. A plant in MedTech Zone, Visakhapatnam, is producing oxygen from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The entire administration is working to provide the best care to patients and oxygen shortage will soon be overcome, he said. The minister inaugurated a makeshift Covid-19 treatment centre in German hangar in GGH, Nellore. He said 50 additional beds were created in tents to handle emergency cases. All 50 beds are provided with oxygen concentrators. An oxygen bus was also inaugurated in the GGH campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-to-formulate-oxygen-policy-soon-says-mekapati/articleshow/82716984.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||‘Health centres poorly equipped to handle critically-infected kids’||As the health experts and epidemiologists have warned that the third wave of Covid-19 would infect the children most, most parents and guardians are getting panicky. Well-known paediatrician and expert on viral infections, Dr Arun Shah, however, tells B K Mishra that there is no need to panic. Excerpts: When is the third wave of Covid expected to hit Bihar? There is no unanimous certainty regarding onset of the third wave in India. Many countries are already facing the third wave. As per statement of Dr Raghvan, the chief scientific adviser to PMO, the third wave is inevitable. According to epidemiologists, the third wave is likely to hit our state by November or December. However, I personally believe that the third wave of pandemic is not going to be as deadly as the second one as a large number of the population will develop immunity by that time either through natural infection or vaccination.Why is it expected to infect the children most? As the first wave of the pandemic affected a greater number of elderly people and people with comorbidities and the second wave the young and adults alike, only children remain to be infected by the virus now. This is so because immunity shall develop in a large section of the population due to infection and vaccination. However, children below 18 years are yet to be vaccinated.What should parents do to protect their children from this infection?Young parents must get both the doses of vaccine at the earliest to prevent their children from getting infected. Family members must adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour as many asymptomatic people are spreading the infection unknowingly. Besides, children should not be allowed to participate in outdoor activities.What should the government do?The government must accelerate the pace of vaccination so as to reach the largest number of susceptible people. The government must also ensure continued lockdown till there is a sharp fall in transmission rate and positivity must be below 10% to interrupt rapid transmission of infection. Are our health centres prepared well to meet this challenge?No, our healthcare facilities are poorly equipped to handle the serious and critically-infected children requiring non-invasive ventilation and ventilators. It is expected that if the third wave strikes children, the state shall require a large number of ICU beds and facilities for high-flow oxygen therapy/ventilator. Hence, a contingency plan must be made before the calamity strikes.What about vaccination of children?The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has already approved the second/third phase of trial of Covaxin in children below 18 years. If the trial shows safety and efficacy, the vaccine should be administered in children under emergency use authorisation in dosage and duration as per recommendations without delay.What would parents do in case of their children get infected with the virus? In case of suspected cases of Covid infection, the parents must isolate the child and follow the guidelines in consultation with their paediatrician. Every parent should know the red flag signs for immediate hospitalisation if children are being taken care of at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-centres-poorly-equipped-to-handle-critically-infected-kids/articleshow/82717267.cms||BK Mishra

Existing investors Temasek, Lone Pine Capital and Sunley House Capital also participated in the funding round. The latest round values the payments company at $3 billion. The transaction also enabled secondary transactions of around $100 million for its founder, employees and early shareholders. The company said that it has been ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) profitable for several years and did not need the entire capital that was raised. Pine Labs CEO B Amrish Rau told TOI that the funds would be used to scale business in the online space and also grow the credit and commerce needs of offline merchant partners. “We are going to reconfigure the offline systems for the online world. We also see a lot of opportunity in online payments in government, financial sector and in education,” said Rau. Pine Labs, which has been known for its point-of-sale (PoS) card terminal business, has entered into value-added space of pre-paid cards and loyalty programmes through its acquisitions of Qwikcilver and Fave. The company has also bid for setting up payment infrastructure in the country by leading investments into a ‘new umbrella entity’ that will rival National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Pine Labs serves more than 1.5 lakh merchants across Asia and the Middle East. The company’s recently launched its ‘buy now, pay later’ proposition in Malaysia and has ambitious plans to take its integrated ‘pay later’ instalment solution to newer markets in Southeast Asia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pine-labs-raises-280mn-eyes-online-growth/articleshow/82719704.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In fact, the state has recorded 38% decline in daily cases in the past seven days. However, the respite fails to reflect in the number of ICU and ventilator beds available for the patients across Covid hospitals in the state. According to the Covid dashboard of Gujarat maintained by the state health department, multiple districts including Chhota Udepur in central Gujarat, Narmada and Navsari in south Gujarat and Porbandar in Saurashtra region had no ventilator or ICU beds available as of Monday afternoon. While Ahmedabad city recorded 16% vacant beds out of 1,476 ICU and ventilator beds, the ratio was much lower in several other districts. In Morbi, 4 out of 45 ventilatory beds were occupied. In Kheda, only 10 out of 162 ICU/ventilator beds were vacant. In Botad, the number of ICU/ventilator beds was 7 out of which 3 were available. Experts say the second surge which saw higher lung involvement in patients pushed demand for ventilator and ICU beds. The spread of the virus in rural population only compounded the need for critical ICU care. Senior health officer of a district in north Gujarat told TOI on condition of anonymity that the patients are shifted up to Ahmedabad for want of critical care beds in several districts. “And it’s not just ventilators – several districts don’t have experienced staff to operate the machines, too. On the positive side, we have adequate oxygen beds now,” said the officer. Top sources in the state health department said that the state has received about 4,600 ventilators as part of the PM Cares initiative. “They are not only given to the government hospitals, but also loaned to private hospitals in parts of Gujarat. This time around, the requirement has increased manifold, and attempts are on to meet the rush,” said an official. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that it takes time for turnaround on ICU and ventilator beds. “When the patient is critical, he/she takes more time to recuperate. Thus, compared to oxygen beds, finding a critical care bed would always be difficult,” he said. Dr Hardik Shah, medical director of DHS Hospital, said that a patient on ICU or ventilator takes about five to ten days or more depending on the condition. “During this wave, we have seen more patients going on ventilators as the number of overall patients was much more compared to the last surge,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/icu-ventilator-availability-in-narmada-navsari-porbandar-0/articleshow/82720390.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Night cameras to keep vigil, violators to get text messages||KOLKATA: Beware of night vision cameras tracking vehicles out on the roads. Those venturing out between 9pm and 5am, assuming there will not be cops on the streets, may receive a message on their phones, seeking an explanation on why the vehicle was out on the road. Those who get the SMS will be asked to send an email within a certain period, along with relevant documents, to explain why he or she needed to defy the nigh restriction. “It is not always possible to have policemen posted everywhere at night. But citizens must not think there is no one to keep an eye other than at checkpoints. We will use CCTV cameras with night vision to track down vehicles violating restrictions. If the explanation provided by the vehicle owner is not satisfactory, we will slap charges under IPC section 188 and section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar, saying the system had borne “satisfactory” results last year when it was introduced. “The emphasis is on the special night restrictions. We are happy with the first night’s report card. We expect even more compliance from Monday. The markets, too, were better controlled than that on Sunday,” said a senior police officer at Lalbazar. Cops stepped up checks across the city. Kolkata Police on Sunday arrested 73 people for violating the enhanced restrictions, the arrest figure being merely 23 till noon. On Monday, till noon, the arrest figure was 138. Cops did not clarify if these figures included Trinamool workers protesting the arrest of their leaders in the morning. Those who ventured out said cops at nakas were stricter than on Sunday. “On Vidyasagar Setu on Sunday, several people on two- and four-wheelers were sent back home. On Monday, most were prosecuted, some for returning ‘late’ from markets after 10am in their vehicles,” said Saptarshi Paul, a staffer at Medical College and Hospital, who travels from Mandirbazar every day. The total number of prosecutions for not wearing masks was also higher than that on the past three days. There were 165 such prosecutions, compared to the 150-odd over three days. Traffic police, too, separately prosecuted 76 people and seized 40 vehicles till Monday noon. The divisional police prosecuted seven vehicles. So far since Sunday, 132 vehicles — several of them two-wheelers — have been seized in the city. Medical practitioners who travelled at night told TOI that except a few exceptions in central Kolkata, around Howrah bridge and parts of Bypass, the city spent the night at home. “We did find a couple of bikers racing on Howrah bridge. When I asked cops about them at a nearby naka, they said they carried valid passes,” said Satyam Dubey, a chemist who stays in Howrah but works at a shop on MG Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/night-cams-to-keep-vigil-violators-to-get-text-msgs/articleshow/82721126.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Tauktae pummels Gujarat; massive destruction in coastal Saurashtra||RAJKOT/SURAT/AHMEDABAD: Cyclone Tauktae barrelled dangerously into Covid-battered Gujarat after making a landfall near the Union territory of Diu late on Monday night, packing ferocious winds and pounding heavy rain, which were projected to wreak severe destruction in coastal districts of Saurashtra. The landfall began around 8:45pm and continued till late night with Tauktae surging further into the land, according to IMD’s specialized cyclone centre. Massive storm surge in the sea with waves as high as three metres inundated hundreds of coastal villages while electricity was snapped as strong winds flattened electricity poles in most parts of Amreli, Gir-Somnath and Diu. Junagadh, Gir-Somnath, Bhavnagar and Amreli were reeling under heavy rain and winds speeding up to 100 km per hour that started howling by Monday noon. The winds were accompanied by dust storms. The coastal highway near Kodinar town was littered with large number of coconut trees that collapsed due to gale, eyewitnesses said. In Una town alone, at least 200 trees and a mobile tower collapsed but there were no reports of deaths or injuries. There were reports of glasses in Diu hotels getting shattered late in the night. The situation late on Monday night suggested heavy damage in coastal towns of Una and Kodinar as well as Diu, which were continuously battered by extremely strong winds, huge tidal waves and heavy rain. Most areas were in pitch darkness due to power outage. The threat of wreckage also loomed as nearly 4,000 fishing boats were anchored close to each other in the coastal towns. A 38-year-old woman identified as Sharmishta Rawal died in Patan after an electricity pole that got uprooted due to strong winds fell on her. Rawal was sitting outside her house in Hari Society when the incident occurred. Ahmedabad city too witnessed rainfall that lasted for nearly 30 minutes. More rain is forecast for Tuesday. The impact of Tauktae was felt in north Gujarat, as far as 600 km away from landfall point near Diu, as several districts reeled under wet spell and squally weather. IMD said Tauktae, with an elliptical eye of around 42km diameter, is spewing winds gusting up to 150-160 kmph. Chief minister Vijay Rupani said close to two lakh people in 17 vulnerable districts were shifted to safer locations while 50 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and 10 SDRF teams were stationed to minimize human losses. The Army, Navy and Air Force were also on the stand-by. “The maximum impact of the cyclone will be witnessed in Gir-Somnath, Amreli, Junagadh and Bhavnagar where wind speeds were touching 150 kmph. In Dwarka, Porbandar and Rajkot too, winds were gusting at 100 kmph,” he said. “People have been shifted to over 2,000 shelters with Covid-19 guidelines,” Pankaj Kumar, additional chief secretary, revenue, told reporters. Kumar said late in the night that there were neither casualties so far nor any major damage to property. He said that infrastructure will be hit hard due to the cyclone. Kumar said there were 629 incidents of electricity failure of which 440 were resolved. “Until now, 234 electricity poles have fallen so far,” he added.  More than one lakh policemen including 13,000 home guards, 30,000 Gram Rakshak Dal (GRD) jawans have been deployed in Saurashtra region, state DGP Ashish Bhatia said. All major airports across the state including those in Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara and Kandla remained shut in wake of the cyclone. Vadodara airport will remain closed till Tuesday. As many as 18 flights were cancelled at Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport on Monday. For the first time in at least a decade, the ‘great danger’ signal was hoisted at all ports and private jetties, which have already shut down operations. Over 100 ships were sent back to high seas for the fear of accidents.  Corporate and industrial houses in Gujarat are also taking various precautionary measures too minimize the impact of cyclone. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman MukeshAmbani was camping in Moti Khavdi in Jamnagar district where the company runs the world’s largest refinery with a huge petrochemicals project. Tauktae, which rapidly turned into an extremely severe storm, was the strongest to hit Gujarat, after 1998 when the Kandla cyclone left nearly 4,000 dead and inflicted huge damage to India’s busiest government-run port. IMD has predicted heavy to very heavy rains at a few places with isolated extremely heavy falls in 22 districts and UTs of Diu, Daman and Dadra & NagarHaveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-pummels-gujarat-massive-destruction-in-coastal-saurashtra/articleshow/82720279.cms||---

Five ICUs are functional in the supervision of specialists for providing care to critical cases also. Civil surgeon S K Verma on Monday said, “Around 30 specialist doctors, trained paramedics and other health workers, keep a tab on vital parameters of Covid patients round-the-clock. The healthcare centre has sufficient stock of life saving drugs like antiviral injections, steroids, anti-coagulants, antibiotics, vitamin C and others. Besides, oxygen is generated at Maranga plant, on the outskirts of the town, and from there it is supplied to the DCHC, through Sai distributing agency.” All the vitals (SPO2, temperature, pulse, BP and RR) of patients are recorded in the Bead Head Ticket (BHT) in a gap of four-hour interval. “Around 30 doctors and six technicians have been provided training to operate the ventilators. At least 38 paramedics of the DCHC had undergone training at the Bihar State Health Society at Patna,” said Dr Verma, adding, “For the disposal of bodies, the DCHC follows Covid protocol. Special sacks (body bags) are used in disposing of Covid patient's body. We have mortuary vans also for carrying the deceased.” “Unclaimed bodies are disposed of under the supervision of circle officers (COs) or officials of Nagar Parishad level. The hospital has provided waiting space for Covid attendants and relatives also. The medical facility also makes arrangements for food to patients' kin,” he said. "Around 404 Covid patients had been admitted to this hospital, out of which 354 patients have recovered so far,” said the civil surgeon. Recalling the recovery of Corona patient Dr Ghulam Mustafa, who had superannuated just three months ago from the Purnia district hospital, Dr Verma, said, "It was a proud moment for us. Doctors of the DCHC did their best for the recovery of Dr Mustafa, who was co-morbid and his oxygen level had gone down alarmingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/purnia-covid-centre-boon-for-patients-from-peripheral-areas/articleshow/82717480.cms||---

Petrol was being sold at Rs 94.99/litre in Patna while the cost of diesel climbed to Rs88.64/lt on Monday. The oil marketing companies have increased petrol prices by Rs2.07 per litre since May 1. Similarly, the cost of diesel has increased by Rs2.5/litre this month. Ajay Kumar, manager of a petrol pump at Dak Bunglow Crossing, said the sales have fallen after the lockdown. “The fuel prices have been increasing after every day. We have not seen any fall in fuel prices since last year,” he said. Vijay Kumar, sales executive of a petrol station near Gandhi Maidan, said sales have been badly affected since the lockdown imposed in state on May 5. Rise in fuel prices has its cascading affect on other commodities. DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said the economy was in a dismal state due to last year’s lockdown and wrong policy of the Centre. “The government has increased taxes on fuels, including GST and VAT, leading to a rise in the prices even though the fuel rate at international market is $68 per barrel,” he said. He said the rise in fuel prices has started influencing the prices of other commodities as well. The demand of fuel prices is declining due to rise in prices and also due to the lockdown. Prabhat Kumar Singh, president of Bihar Petroleum Dealer’s Association (BPDA), said the government claimed that they increased the prices on the changes in international rates. “However, during Bengal elections, rates of petrol and diesel were not changed. Besides international prices, there is also some political agenda behind it. As far as its impact is concerned, we are seeing rise in prices of other commodities affecting large section of the society,” he said. He said adding that earlier, before June 2016, the prices were revised fortnightly only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/petrol-prices-up-by-rs2-in-last-17-days/articleshow/82717622.cms||Faryal Rumi

Members of his family alleged Asif was the victim of a mob lynching and that his kidnappers had forced him to say ‘Jai Shri Ram’. Police, however, said this was not a hate crime but an outcome of enmity between two groups of youths from the same village. So far, 14 people have been booked. Six of them were arrested on Monday. One of Asif’s cousins, who was accompanying him and was also attacked, said they knew the attackers and there indeed was “old enmity”. Asif and his two cousins – Rashid (30) and Wasif (31) – were in a car. They had started from their village, Khalilpur (Mewat), and headed to Sohna to get medicines. The trio was ambushed on their way back, after they had entered Mewat. “A group of youths intercepted their car near Jacopur and thrashed all three of them. Asif died while the two others sustained injuries. They abused Asif and his brothers and forced them to say Jai Shri Ram,” said Maktoob Khan, the deceased’s uncle.

The preparations for kharif season has begun and demand for fertilizers is going to increase as the sowing activities pick up. The sowing of seeds is carried out after few spells of monsoon rain. Except urea, the price of all other fertilizers has increased. The farmers are upset with the hike as, due to the pandemic, they are already left with little capital to buy seeds and fertilizers. Some are already resorting to buy less fertilizers which may impact the overall productivity. Jayant Patil, NCP state president and senior cabinet minister, blamed the central government for the hike. “We are going to agitate in every district. Already the lockdown and Covid pandemic has made lives of farmers miserable and hike in the fertilizer prices will make things worse,” he said. SSS leader Raju Shetti announced that on May 20 the farmers will protest by burning effigy of central government in their farms. “The central government is responsible for the hike since it has not given subsidy to the companies that have increased the prices to compensate for the increased manufacturing cost. If the farmers continue to use less fertilisers then productivity will come down and this will lead to mass starvation in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fertilizer-price-hike-ncp-sss-plan-agitation/articleshow/82716703.cms||---

The varsity’s teachers’ association (JNUTA) has criticised the move, stating that applicants should not be pressured at this point in the pandemic, when all universities are also on a break. The association said that the varsity had “misplaced priorities” in a statement on Monday. “The notice for registration has once again brought to fore the highly insensitive disposition of the administration towards both the faculty and students. At a time, when the country is ravaged by Covid cases and many central institutions like Delhi University have called for suspension of online teaching, JNU wants to stand out as the only institution to have not opted or allowed for any break between semesters for over a year and half during the pandemic,” JNUTA said. The teachers’ group added that with the passing of the circular, “the administration has not only failed to empathise with those personally affected by Covid, it has sought to shut its ears and eyes to create a situation of academic normalcy, where none exists.” JNUTA stated that many students and faculty members as well as their family members have been hospitalised due to Covid-19 in the last two weeks. JNUTA has asked for a vacation in the university and that the interim period should be used to set up Covid care facilities in anticipation of a third wave, while mitigating the current one. Despite requests, the JNU administration did not respond to the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teachers-slam-jnu-for-starting-registration-for-admissions/articleshow/82723446.cms||---

The CBI arrested four people on Monday. It was a long-awaited justice for me,” he said. Claiming that the footage of Adhikari receiving the money was captured by him during the sting operation and the clips were handed over to the CBI, Samuel said that law should be equal to all. “I had paid the money to Suvendu Adhikari. He was in his office. His name is not in the list. I had gone through forensic tests and given statements regarding that. He (Adhikari) received the money from me. Why is he being kept out of the loop? The investigation should be fair,” Samuel said. Suvendu could not be reached for comments. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “The law will take its own course.” “I went to the CBI and ED office in Kolkata more than 40 times. I told them that we have to wait since such cases drag on for long. It was my fight against corruption. The chargesheet was already ready for some time. Finally, they arrested four people.” After the tape was released, Samuel was first summoned by the Lok Sabha Ethics committee headed by BJP veteran L K Advani. He handed over visuals and documents to the committee members. “Nothing happened after that,” he said. In 2019, the CBI sought sanction to prosecute four parliamentarians of TMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/paid-suvendu-too-why-is-he-out-of-the-loop-asks-mathew-samuel/articleshow/82725842.cms||Rohit Khanna

Leader of auto rickshaw drivers’ union Nisar Ahmed Khan said the skyrocketing fuel prices have posed survival issues before his community members. “While outbreak of Covid-19 has already broken our backbone, the fuel price hike will surely prove the last nail in our coffins.

Justice Subramonium Prasad also declined to remove strong observations made by a sessions court while dismissing Kalra’s anticipatory bail plea, saying the Supreme Court has already laid down the law with regard to observations made by courts and their reporting by media organisations. The high court’s stand came while taking up further hearing of Kalra’s anticipatory bail plea that was listed for Tuesday. With his arrest, the petition became “infructuous”, his lawyer submitted but urged it to direct the trial court to decide his client’s bail plea expeditiously and expunge the observations made by the sessions court as due to his arrest, he could no longer challenge the order denying him anticipatory bail. Following his arrest by police, Kalra was remanded in three days’ police custody. A court on Monday said his custodial interrogation was required in connection with the alleged black marketing and hoarding of oxygen concentrators amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He was apprehended from Gurgaon on Sunday night and was formally arrested on Monday after being on the run for over a week since the seizure of 524 oxygen concentrators from Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants owned by him. He was apprehended two days after the high court on May 14 declined to grant him any interim protection from arrest while his plea for anticipatory bail was pending before it. The sessions court denied him anticipatory bail on May 13. On May 5, a case was registered against Kalra under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code. The FIR, also registered under Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act for black marketing of oxygen concentrators, prescribes maximum punishment for seven years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-early-hearing-of-kalras-bail-application/articleshow/82753414.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

UFERWAS president Rao VBJ Chelikani said they are also planning to tie up with Dr Reddy’s Labs and Apollo Health Care to administer vaccine doses to the general people. “At this moment, vaccination for people in this age group is not taken up as focus is only on giving second shot to people of 45 years and above. Given that youngsters also need to be protected along with their parents, we have decided to hold vaccination camps in various RWAs’ jurisdictions,” he told TOI. He said community halls maintained by RWAs have been identified. “We have conducted health camps at various places in the city. We will limit the people to just a hundred at each camp and carry out the vaccine drive,” he said. Apollo Health Care has sent a format as per which the vaccination drive in the residential colonies will be carried out, said UFERWAS general secretary BT Srinivasan. “Once the firms give the go-ahead, we will make the necessary arrangements. We are ready to pay for the vaccines as per the government fixed rates,” said Srinivasan. Soon after the Centre announced registration for vaccination for people above 18 years on CoWIN portal and Aarogya Setu app, several RWAs in Greater Hyderabad evinced interest in get the jab administered for residents but thanks to shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/housing-societies-to-take-up-vaccination-drive-for-18-44-grp/articleshow/82721177.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Kanpur||Row over cricketer Kuldeep Yadav getting jab at unscheduled location||KANPUR: A probe has been ordered with regard to flouting of Covid 19 vaccination protocol allegedly by Indian international cricketer Kuldeep Yadav, wherein he was accorded with a VIP treatment while receiving a jab on the lawns of the guest house of Kanpur Nagar Nigam instead of Govind Nagar’s Jageshwar hospital, where he had booked a slot for himself for the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The incident came to light after a photo of the cricketer, who’s a left arm Chinaman bowler, receiving a jab at the lawns of the guest house went viral on social media on Sunday. To recall, Kuldeep, who hails from the city, had also on May 15 posted a photo of himself from his Twitter handle getting vaccinated and urging everyone to get the jab in order to fight against the coronavirus pandemic. India and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) spinner, Kuldeep, received the first dose of Covid vaccine on May 15. District magistrate Alok Tiwari said, “None have been provided VIP treatment with regard to Covid vaccination in the district so far.” “However, a matter related to Indian cricketer’s vaccination has come to light and a probe has been ordered. The chief medical officer and city magistrate have been asked to initiate the probe and submit a report soon. Guilty person will face action,” DM said. As per operational guidelines drafted by the Centre and issued to the states, after receiving a jab, a person would be monitored and which will take up to 30 minutes wherein he/she will be kept under observation in a separate room. However, in the case of Kuldeep, it is yet to be ascertained whether any observation room was raised or not at the guest house, said a senior district official. A netizen said, “When PM Narendra Modi can visit AIIMS in Delhi and CM Yogi Adityanath can visit Lucknow’s Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil Hospital, then why the cricketer was given a VIP treatment for vaccine delivery. Everyone is equal and everyone’s life is important.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/row-over-cricketer-kuldeep-yadav-getting-jab-at-unscheduled-location/articleshow/82719268.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Allahabad||Now, 75% beds vacant in 20 Covid-19 hospitals in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: With the recovery rate steadily rising and nearing 95% in Sangam City, around 75% beds in the district’s Covid level 2 and level 3 hospitals have become vacant. Officials of the health department claimed there was only 25% occupancy in Covid level 2 and level 3 hospitals till now. After witnessing a fall in the number of patients, district health authorities have moved the proposal to convert some Covid dedicated hospitals into non-Covid categories. Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer, Dr. Rishi Sahai, told TOI: “We have around 2,800 beds capacity in 20 Covid dedicated hospitals in the district, including four government and 16 private, to treat Covid patients.” Since there has been a drastic decline in the number of Covid patients and subsequently the recovery rate has gone up steadily, the availability of Covid-19 beds in the district's Covid hospitals for the first time touched 75% in the second wave by Monday. Dr. Sahai added, “We have sought a list of patients from all 20 Covid dedicated hospitals and the hospital which has less patients would be converted into non-Covid category from Covid dedicated category.” The patients would be shifted to prominent Covid dedicated hospitals. Statistics showed that as on Monday, as many as 2,108 Covid beds in hospitals were vacant against the total of 2,800. “The numbers mean that today, more patients are being discharged than admitted in hospitals. As many as 75% of the total beds are now available and vacant in the city, as opposed to 50% last week,” he added. At SRN hospital which has the highest 550 beds capacity, around 200 patients are currently undergoing treatment. Similarly, there has been 15% to 20% occupancy in private Covid dedicated hospitals (level 2 category). On April 17, in Prayagraj district, Covid hit the peak of 2,456 cases in a 24-hour period, but on May 16, the number dipped to mere 174, registering around 95% decline in a month, bringing a major respite to administration, health officials, doctors and paramedics. Besides, for the past three consecutive days, the district reported less than 200 cases, recording 191 cases on May 14 and 165 on May 15 and 174 on May 16.

---||Allahabad||Consider producing Covid-19 vaccine yourself: HC to Uttar Pradesh Govt||PRAYAGRAJ: Considering the state of affairs of medical facilities in Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad high court on Monday suggested the government to think about the steps to produce Covid-19 vaccine while observing as to why a welfare state should not try to produce the vaccine itself. “This is the time if we fail to identify a Covid infected person at the earliest, we are definitely inviting a third wave,” the court added. “One cannot understand as to why the government of ours, which is a welfare state, is not trying to manufacture the vaccine itself on a large scale,” observed a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar while hearing a PIL on Covid care. The court also took strong exception to the fact that the dead body of a patient, Santosh Kumar, who had collapsed in the bathroom and died at district hospital, Meerut, was disposed of as an unidentified body. “If this is the state of affairs of treatment at medical college in a city like Meerut, then the entire medical system of the state pertaining to the smaller cities and villages can only be taken to be like a famous Hindi saying ‘Ram bharose’,” the court commented. The court further observed that it is a case of ‘high degree of carelessness’. “A patient is admitted to the hospital in an absolute care of doctors and paramedical staff and if the doctors and para medical staff adopt such casual approach and show carelessness in the performance of their duty, then it is a case of serious misconduct because it is something like playing with the lives of innocent people,” the court added and directed the additional chief secretary (Medical and Health), Uttar Pradesh to file an affidavit fixing responsibility in the matter and fixed May 22 as the next date of hearing. On the medical infrastructure of the state, the court observed, “In these few months we have realized that in the manner it (medical infrastructure) stands today, it is very delicate, fragile and debilitated.” In this backdrop, the court warned, “This is the time if we fail to identify a Covid infected person at the earliest, we are definitely inviting a third wave,” and suggested that facilities at all hospitals and nursing homes in the state must be improved. “In the state of Uttar Pradesh, we find that apart from various institutes like Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI) and the universities like the King George’s Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, we have five more medical colleges in Prayagraj, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Gorakhpur,” the court said. Further, “These Colleges should have enhanced facilities as are there with the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI) within a period of four months. Emergency laws should be applied for the acquisition of land for them. Funds should be provided to them forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an Institute of the standard of the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute. For this there should also be given a certain extent of autonomy.” The court directed the state government to come up with a definite report, by the next date of hearing, as to how this upgradation of medical colleges shall be done in four months’ time. On last date, the court had directed state government counsel to apprise it of how it is managing Covid hospitals, requirement of oxygen, beds and life saving drugs and gadgets in districts of Bahraich, Barabanki, Bijnor, Jaunpur and Shravasti. The court took example of district Bijnor as a test case to assess the overall health care system in smaller cities and rural areas of the state and after going through Covid testing data related to Bijnor, the bench expressed its dissatisfaction to the number of test conducted in Bijnor between march 31, 2021 to May 12 , 2021. The court directed the state government to immediately improve and increase the testing methods of the rural population and the population of small cities and towns and also provide sufficient health care infrastructure in such cities of state. After going through the details of the health infrastructure of five districts qua its population, the bench observed, “We have no hesitation in observing that health infrastructure is absolutely insufficient in city areas to meet the requirement of city population and the rural areas the Community Health Centres are virtually lacking in respect of life saving gadgets. In most of the districts, the Level-3 hospital facilities are not there.” The court then observed, “If we have to test 30% of the population i.e. almost 10 lacs in the rural areas of district Bijnor within three month’s time, then we will have to conduct 10,000 tests per day, but from the statement made by the district magistrate we do not see any such robust testing in near future in district Bijnor and condition in other four districts are also same. If this is the state of affairs of five districts, one can guess where we are leading people of this State to, i.e. third wave of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/consider-producing-covid-19-vaccine-yourself-hc-to-govt/articleshow/82719364.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur prescribes cow urine to prevent corona||BHOPAL: At a time when the world is battling Coronavirus infection and its second wave has led to devastation in India, controversial BJP MP from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur, said that ‘gaumutra’ (cow urine) can prevent Covid infection. She was speaking at a function while dedicating oxygen concentrators to the people in Bairagarh, a suburb near Bhopal on Sunday. Pragya said that consumption of desi gai gaumutra ark (urine concentrate of indigenous Indian cow variety) can cure lung infection. She said she took it regularly and that was the reason she did not had to take any medicine and did not catch Covid-19 infection. An accused in Malegon blast case, Pragya, also said that additional oxygen was not required if saplings of peepal (Ficus religiosa), tulsi (holy basil) and bargad (banyan) trees were planted. She also announced a campaign to plant one crore saplings in Bhopal. In 2019, Pragya has said mixture of gau mutra and other cow products cured her cancer. Criticising her opponents for terming her as ‘missing’, she said some people were maligning her. She said that such people were committing crime and should not be pardoned. Pragya said. “I was unwell and was serving the society from my bungalow in Bhopal.” Meanwhile, as the Congress dismissed Pragya’s statement, she found an ally in MP’s tourism minister Usha Thakur, who supported her statement. Thakur, an MLA from Indore, had recently raked a controversy when she said ‘yagna’ can ward off and check Covid-19 spread. She supported Pragya’s statement saying cow urine has great medicinal properties. The state Congress on Monday took a dig after Pragya Thakur’s claim that drinking cow-urine regularly has kept her away from Corona infection. PCC media cell vice-president Bhupendra Gupta said, “The BJP should take the advice of scientist MP Pragya Singh Thakur seriously. She says that cow urine prevents and cures Corona. She regularly consumes gaumutra and that is how she did not get the virus infection. She claimed to have even experimented the cow urine theory on many people.” Gupta said that taking the recommendation of the BJP MP from Bhopal seriously, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Shivraj Singh should start a “Gaumutra Peeth” and gaumutra wards in medical college hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pragya-prescribes-cow-urine-to-prevent-corona/articleshow/82718796.cms||---

However, those who already booked online appointments for the second dose of Covishield remained valid and got vaccination. Health officials said that beneficiaries are being advised to reschedule their appointment for later date beyond the 84th day from the date of first dose of vaccination. Pointedly, the Union government had on Thursday extended the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield vaccine to 12-16 weeks based on the recommendations made by the Covid Working Group and further communicated to states and UTs about the change. Similarly, the Co-WIN digital portal has also been reconfigured to reflect this extension of interval for two doses of Covishield. However, officials of the health department faced a tough situation at vaccination sites to pacify the recipients and make them aware about rescheduled plan for second dose of vaccination. “Most of the recipients were not aware about the change in the gap between two doses and subsequently CoWin digital portal not accept the second dose before 12-16 weeks, recipients were asked to reschedule their dates,” said additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer of (Prayagraj) Dr. Teerath Lal. He added, “Scores of recipients seeking second dose vaccination as per the earlier schedule, have arrived at vaccination sites but asked to come on rescheduled date for vaccination. However, recipients were spotted arguing with health workers assigned for vaccination claiming that they should be make aware about the rescheduling through SMS or other communication modes so that they should not face unwanted chaos and confusion on arrival. A recipient, R K Mishra, said: “I along with three of my family members arrived at the community health centre to get the second dose of Covishield but the data operator sitting at the gate of vaccination asked to check my vaccination card and advised to come 12-16 week later claiming that vaccination for second dose schedule has been rescheduled.” He added, “We travelled 40 km from our house to the vaccination centre but rescheduling plan has played spoilsport.” Ravi Kumar, another recipient, alleged that “Recipients should have been given prior information on their mobile through SMS about the rescheduling of dose. Hundreds of people who came at centres for the second dose of Covishield as per their earlier schedule return empty- handed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/chaos-prevails-at-centres-asvaccine-dose-rescheduled/articleshow/82719330.cms||---

Our teams have been patrolling Chatnaag, Phaphamau and Shringverpur ghats round the clock and keeping strict vigil,” said Singh. On being asked about burial of bodies on river banks, the IG said “Apart from the tradition of cremation, many sects in Hinduism believe in burial of the dead on banks of holy rivers for salvation.” “People from different parts of the state and neighbouring states like MP and Bihar often bring bodies for burial on the banks of Ganga at Shringverpur, Chatnaag and Phaphamau ghats as per their tradition,” he added. However, our teams counsel these people when they come and convince them to perform cremation, telling them that strong winds and waves carry away sand and the bodies of their loved ones lie exposed and are mutilated by animals, the IG added. “Our teams have also been assisting those who do not have funds for a proper funeral. People are sensitive and they heed on being told that the practice pollutes holy rivers,” he added. Asked about several buried bodies being spotted on the banks recently, the IG said sand covering the bodies, which were buried two to three months back, were blown away by strong winds and rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-covid-bodies-buried-on-banksour-teams-are-on-24x7-vigil-ig/articleshow/82719383.cms||---

According to the plan, 35 percent bed capacity will be increased in every Covid hospital. According to the health department sources, as soon as it got the green signal it would start to execute the plan. The district administration has identified as many as 25 hospitals in private and government sectors as Covid hospitals to counter the spread of the second wave due to which people were facing problems of beds There are around 2800 beds in 25 Covid hospitals. The main focus is on LLR hospital where at present there are around 425 beds. After the plan is executed, its capacity would be around 600 beds, said the sources. As oxygen self-dependency is another major issue, therefore, the administration is likely to ask hospitals having around 50 bed capacity to install oxygen plants in their premises. An oxygen plant was installed recently in UHM hospital and it will get one more in the next month. Thus the two plants would generate sufficient oxygen to cater the needs of the hospitals.  LLR hospital and Kashiram Trauma Centre too are being equipped with an oxygen plant. One would be raised from MLA funds while the other would be installed by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the sources added. The hospitals with number of beds are as under: GSVM medical college (425 beds), 7 Air Force Hospital (25 beds), Rama medical college (440 beds), MKCH Rama Devi (118 beds), Naraina medical college (300 beds), Regency (75 beds), SPM (77beds), GTB (60 beds), SIS (70 beds ), Priya (79 beds), Krishna Super Speciality hospital (123 beds), Family hospital (54 beds), Mariaampur (96 beds), KMC (82 beds), JL Rohatgi (102 beds), Apollo (75 beds), Madhuraj (138 beds), Chandni (145 beds), New Leelamani (48 beds), Medi Health (56 beds), Dwivedi hospital (30 beds), Fortune hospital (99 beds), Grace hospital (40 beds), Lifetron hospital 69 beds) and Kulwanti hospital 47 beds).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/plan-to-increase-around-1000-beds-in-covid-hospitals-in-the-city/articleshow/82719218.cms||Anant Sekhar Misra

The incident came to light after videos of the alleged incident went viral on social media showing Solanki and his supporters having an argument and misbehaving with the police personnel. The incident took place near Dalelpurwa police outpost when SP MLA quarrelled with the police after one of his supporters was made to pay Rs1,000 fine for not wearing a mask in public. Later, the police also fined the lawmaker Rs 1,000 for roaming without a mask. City police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun has taken cognizance of the videos of the MLA and his supporters misbehaving with cops. “The MLA will have to pay the Rs 1,000 fine while policemen including SI (trainee) Abhishek Sonker and SI Faheem Khan, who took the action, will be rewarded with a cash prize of Rs 1,000 for upholding the law,” Arun told TOI on Monday. Solanki, however, accused both the police personnel of misbehaving with him in public. “I have a video to support my claim, besides I will not only take up the matter with the city police commissioner, but also with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and also raise the issue in the Assembly soon,” said Solanki while talking to reporters. Meanwhile, supporters of SP MLA have now taken to social media to allege police high- handedness, condemning senior police officials for not initiating action against the cops for the same. The police Commissioner said police will impose the Rs 1,000 fine on every citizen who will be found roaming without a mask.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Veggie prices rise, market stocks dip as vendors trip on e-pass hurdle||KOLKATA: Supply lines of perishables were affected in markets across Kolkata as vendors tripped on the e-pass procedures and were unable to replenish depleting stocks on Monday. A sharp rise in transportation cost added to the problem, pushing up the prices of vegetables though the wholesale prices of commodities remained steady. Farmers, fearing loss owing to disruption in logistics, resorted to distress sale in the districts. Vendors, who managed e-passes, brought smaller quantities of vegetables, fearing unsold perishables due to the shorter three-hour window to sell. Cost of transportation has more than doubled with the average rate of carriage from Bhangar to Gariahat increasing from Rs 800 a week ago to Rs 2,000 on Monday. Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Koley Market, said, “Many traders, like me, faced huge trouble to get an e-pass. On Sunday as well as on Monday, I was stopped by cops at four places. They sought an e-pass, which I could not show. I could convince them about my plight but many failed to.” The markets of daily essentials on the second day was fraught with contradictions, as people kept thronging the shops to buy as much supplies as possible within three hours. Physical distancing norms were ignored across markets, but vendors were content with the sales. “With the Covid second wave and restrictions, we were worried about our business. Though we are incurring some losses, sales like these make us happy,” said Gaurav Dey, a vendor at Bhawanipore market. Higher transportation cost and lower quantity to retail markets led to a gap between the retail and wholesale prices. Dilip Kumar Mondal, a vegetable retailer at Gariahat market, said, “Vendors are bringing smaller quantities of vegetables so that they can sell them off within two hours and leave the market early. This is creating a demand-supply gap and pushing up the prices of some vegetables.” Most vegetables in the wholesale markets in the city remained below Rs 20 a kg. But they became almost double or more because of the restrictions and higher transportation cost. “Most goods transporters refused to ferry us to and fro, unless we showed them e-passes and paid them well,” said Gautam Rakshit, a retailer at Kidderpore market. Some of the customers said they had no choice but to buy meat and fish a day earlier. “We cook non-vegetarian food in our house only on Thursdays. Due to the lockdown, we bought and stocked from a day earlier,” said Barun Dhar, a customer at Barisha market. Footfalls were higher than usual at at grocery stores, too. “We have run out of some of our stocks because of the continuous rush. As these customers plan not to step out of home for a week, all essential goods are being bought and stocked,” a grocery shop owner at Behala said. But Kamal Dey, president West Bengal Vendors’ Association, said, “It is strange that both the producer (farmers) and the end users (consumers) are paying a high price —the former for yielding a bumper crop and latter for supply line issues.

The hospitals also admit Covid-19 patients. Fire safety in Covid hospitals have become a serious issue due to repeated incidents of fire in such hospitals that have even led to deaths of patients and staffers. The hospitals in Vadodara had been asked in the past to ensure that they have at least three trained persons who attend duties in rotation in ICU wards. Sources in the Vadodara fire brigade said that they had held training sessions for hospitals across the city. “They gave us a list of persons who would be the first respondents. When calls were made to check the reality, it came to light that none of them were on duty,” said in-charge chief fire officer Parth Brahmbhatt. Around 30 such hospitals have been issued notices and the list may only grow longer, said an official. The official added that calls were still being made to confirm if the first respondents were on duty. The hospitals where the respondents were found missing are mostly smaller hospitals or those where temporary arrangements have been made. Most large government and private hospitals had relevant staff on duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/30-hospitals-without-first-fire-respondents-get-notice/articleshow/82716700.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Sovan friend, family stand by his side||Kolkata: Amidst all the tension and uncertainties, it was a sort of family reunion for former Trinamool minister and BJP leader Sovan Chatterjee who had his friend Baisakhi Banerjee, his estranged wife and newly elected MLA Ratna Chatterjee and his son Saptarshi all by his side at Nizam Palace on Monday. While a teary-eyed Ratna left early, she askeed their son Saptarshi to be there. “The moment I learnt about his arrest, I couldn’t hold myself back and rushed to the CBI headquarters. We haven’t got separated yet. I don’t know what kind of emotions he still has for me and my children but we still have a space for him. Since he is in trouble today, my conscience told me that I should be beside him,” said Ratna Chatterjee, who has recently won the Behala East seat — which had elected his husband twice.  Asked if the two were planning a reconciliation, she said: “ Let’s see what destiny has in store for us.” While Ratna Chatterjee had reached Nizam Palace complex after the news got aired on TV, Sovan Chatterjee’s friend Baisakhi Banerjee — with whom he has been living at a Golpark flat for the past two and half years — said she had come with Chatterjee to Nizam Complex in the morning. “The CBI officials asked me not to come and had said they would drop him back home in half an hour. But I came along with him and stayed with him all through the day,” said Banerjee. Asked about Ratna Chatterjee’s visit, Banerjee said: “In the current situation Ratna Chatterjee and Baisakhi Banerjee are too insignificant to even talk about.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sovan-friend-family-stand-by-his-side/articleshow/82721187.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Lucknow||Medical infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh’s villages and towns is ‘Ram Bharose’, says HC||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad High Court on Monday said the medical infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh’s villages and towns is “Ram Bharose” (at the mercy of God), while taking serious exception to the disposal of the body of a patient, Santosh Kumar, as unidentified in Meerut district hospital. If this is the state of affairs of a medical college in a city like Meerut, then the healthcare system of the state, particularly in towns and villages can be likened to the famous Hindi saying — Ram Bharose, the court observed, adding it’s a case of ‘high degree carelessness’. “A patient is admitted to the hospital in absolute care of doctors and paramedical staff and if they adopt a casual approach, then it is a case of serious misconduct. They are playing with the lives of innocent people. In these few months, we have realized that the state’s medical infrastructure as it stands today, is very delicate, fragile and debilitated,” the court observed. Hearing a PIL on Covid care, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar directed additional chief secretary (medical and health), Uttar Pradesh to file an affidavit, fixing responsibility in the matter. The court fixed May 22 as the next date of hearing. The court also suggested to the government to take steps to produce vaccines on its own, while observing that “one cannot understand why the government of ours, which is a welfare state is not trying to manufacture vaccines by itself on a large scale”. Criticising the government for its failure to ramp up the medical infrastructure in the state, the court warned, “If we fail to identify a Covid-infected person at the earliest, we are definitely inviting a third wave.” The court suggested that facilities at all hospitals and nursing homes in the state must be improved. “In Uttar Pradesh, apart from Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI) and universities like King George’s Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, there are five other medical colleges, which should be equipped with modern facilities within four months. Emergency laws should be applied for land acquisition to upgrade medical infrastructure. Funds should be provided forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an institute at par with Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute,” the bench said. The court directed the state government to come up with a definitive report by the next hearing on ways to upgrade medical colleges within the deadline. The court then observed, “If we have to test 30% of Bijnor's population in three months, which is around 10 lakhs, we will have to conduct 10,000 tests per day. But going by the DM’s statement, we do not see any robust testing machinery in the near future in Bijnor or five other districts. If this is the state of affairs, one can guess where we are leading people when the third wave of the pandemic strikes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medical-infra-in-ups-villages-and-towns-is-ram-bharose-says-hc/articleshow/82723563.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Delhi||Crime branch seizes books, account registers of bizman||New Delhi: Delhi Police’s Crime Branch on Tuesday took arrested restaurateur Navneet Kalra to one of his offices in southeast Delhi’s Okhla and seized several books and registers pertaining to his accounts, a source said. During the day, Kalra was also taken to Dayal Opticals and Townhall restaurant in connection with the ongoing probe against him. Delhi Police is also in the process of sharing investigation-related documents with the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax seeking a probe in the money laundering aspect in the case, the source added. Kalra allegedly gave the account numbers of the optical shop to people asking them to transfer the money to book the oxygen concentrators. He allegedly charged them around Rs 70,000 and above in lieu of the poor-quality concentrators. Many concentrators were seized from Townhall pub. Police are now focusing on verifying allegations from people that Kalra did not return money or replace the concentrators even after complaints. A senior officer confirmed that if the reports of death of a few people were verified, section of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (304 IPC) could be invoked in the case. Police also clarified that some wounds sustained by Kalra were the result of him falling in the bathroom after he contracted Covid a few weeks ago. He was admitted to Medanta till days before the raids on his restaurant. The cops said he was using an Innova while on the run, which was going to be seized. Police are also looking into the source of the oxygen concentrators recovered from Kalra’s premises and the antecedents of the firm that exported them. In all, over 7,500 concentrators were imported by Kalra and associates. Kalra was arrested from the South district on Sunday night. The cops said he was arrested on a tip-off and aftermath of extensive surveillance. Kalra’s call records showed that he called up many serving government officials, including police officers, while on the run. The cops contacted them individually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crime-branch-seizes-books-account-registers-of-bizman/articleshow/82753467.cms||Raj Shekhar

During the heist, the robbers managed to decamp with a bag containing Rs 2 lakh. The fuel station is located two kilometers away from Patoda town. Police have registered a case of armed robbery against five suspects who threatened the fuel station staff with a sword and also threw chilly powder in their eyes before fleeing with the bag. The suspects, however, failed to notice another bag containing Rs 1 lakh kept in the office. The fuel station also does not have any closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera installed due to which it will be a daunting task for the police to nab the suspects. Assistant inspector Mahesh Andhale said Shradha Madhikar hailing from Pathardi bagged this fuel station under ex-serviceman’s quota. Sometime ago, Nitin Potre took the fuel station on rent and was operating it with the help of his nephews Prasad Diwte and Rajendra Ghuge. As per the complaint lodged, Diwte and Ghuge were sleeping in the cabin of the fuel station, when the suspects came in a four wheeler and started pelting stones. Before anyone could understand anything, they barged inside the cabin and threatened the duo with swords and other sharp edged weapons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/robbers-target-fuel-station-flee-with-rs-2l/articleshow/82716780.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||FPS likely to be open entire month||Hyderabad: With a view to checking the spread of coronavirus, the Centre has asked the state governments to consider the possibility of distributing rice and other essential commodities by keeping the fair price shops (FPS) open throughout the month. While the Telangana government has already taken a decision to extend the functioning of the FPS up to May 20 as distribution of rice was delayed by three days earlier this month, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to take a decision by issuing orders for month-long functioning of FPS in a day or two. Normally, FPS distribute essential commodities only for the first 15 days of the month and remain closed for the remaining 15 days of the month. During the second half of the month, FPS dealers make payments to buy rice from the government and make other arrangements for distribution of it from the first of every month. “To avoid long queues and also to facilitate social distance between the card holders, the central government wants the FPS to remain open throughout the month so that card holders can be given different dates,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fps-likely-to-be-open-entire-month/articleshow/82721209.cms||Roushan Ali

As not too many passengers were around, at both railway stations and the airport, they had to wait for a long time as the buses clubbed the timings of three to four flights or trains before leaving for the destinations.The first day, the skeletal bus services were restricted to ferry healthcare workers. Those, who could not wait in the queues at the stations and airports, availed of taxis but many complained about cabbies fleecing them. Taxi drivers, however, claimed they were charging double the fare as they feared of travelling back without any passenger owing to the restrictions. Saugata Barik, who has to take an early train to Tatanagar, paid Rs 1,500 from his Mayurbhanaj home to Howrah station. “It does not cost me more than Rs 150-170,” he said. Bakul Mitra found the prepaid cab booth functioning at Howrah station. “The cabby pleaded for some extra money. I gave him Rs 100 and he was happy,” she said. Some complained that app cab operators, too, asked for “extra”, much higher than usual. “App-cabs demanded Rs 400-600 above the fare. There’s no point arguing with them. Diesel prices have gone up. I was grateful I could catch my flight,” said Bipin Poddar, who had to travel to Mumbai for work. Taxi associations, like Online Cab Operators’ Guild, Bengal Taxi Association, Ola, Uber, App-Cab Operators and Drivers Union, continued their emergency services. “We ferried people with health emergencies, we supplied oxygen and took medicines to doorsteps. We also ferried Covid patients to hospitals,” said Sk Manu, a secretary of the app-cabs drivers’ union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wbtc-bus-services-for-stations-airport/articleshow/82721328.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Structures at Eatala’s hatchery under probe||Hyderabad: After concluding that former minister Eatala Rajender’s Jamuna Hatcheries has encroached upon 66 acres of assigned land in two villages in its preliminary enquiry report, the Medak district administration has started probing into unauthorised structures allegedly raised by the poultry firm on the controversial land. According to officials, owners of Jamuna Hatcheries forced two panchayats secretaries of Achampet and Hakimpet villages to sign on the draft layouts in 2018 and 2020 though they did not have powers to issue layouts and permit huge constructions. The statements of panchayat secretaries were recorded by tahsildars of Masaipet and Veldurthy mandals on Monday. Jamuna Hatcheries constructed a huge plant and sheds in Achampet and Hakimpet. While the main plant is located in Achampet, the feed plant operates out of Hakimpet village. Officials involved in the probe told TOI that Jamuna Hatcheries applied for a layout in 2018 with Achampet panchayat for raising the hatcheries building instead of approaching the director of town and country planning (DTCP) in 2018. “While the proposal was pending, the hatcheries allegedly took the signature of the secretary forcibly which is not valid,” officials said. The hatcheries management approached the DTCP for permission in survey No. 111 for constructing a feed plant in Hakimpet, but it failed to get a final permission as they needed to submit various applications for clearances from the TSPCB. Meanwhile, one panchayat secretary, who took charge last year, served showcause notices on the hatcheries in January 2021 for raising illegal sheds without obtaining permission and laying road on government land. “While the notice was issued in January, the hatcheries management replied on May 10 after a probe began claiming that they had taken an NOC. In Achampet, the hatcheries management added another survey No. 130 in the layout to raise bank loans,” a tahsildar involved in the probe said. Meanwhile, following the high court’s directions to follow the procedures, the district administration slapped notices on 75 farmers, including original assignees and also Jamuna Hatcheries, under Prohibition of Transfers (POT) Act covering about 100 acres of land on May 6. They were given 15 days’ time to reply. Some 130 farmers were served notices for taking up a comprehensive land survey around the controversial land to arrive at the extent of land encroachments by the firm belonging to the family members of Eatala. The survey will be taken up from May 26. The district collector asked district panchayat officer to submit his enquiry report soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/structures-at-eatalas-hatchery-under-probe/articleshow/82721247.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Lucknow||Buoyed by Bengal victory, TMC sets eyes on Uttar Pradesh polls||LUCKNOW: Buoyed by its triumph in West Bengal elections, Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress is readying for next year’s UP elections. TMC will re-launch itself in a new avatar in the state. A good show in the UP assembly elections will prep it up for 2024 general elections.  At present, TMC state unit has set three key roles for itself – enrolling new members, strengthening its structure in districts, and identifying issues that will become the party’s poll plank. With eyes set on focused areas, UP TMC will launch a membership drive from May 24. “This will be done keeping in view the Covid protocols. It would start from Lakhimpur Kheri which happens to be one of the most neglected regions in the terai belt of the state,” said state party president Neeraj Rai. After covering the terai belt, TMC would move on to Purvanchal and central UP. Western UP districts would be taken up later. “After the party’s performance in West Bengal many people are willing to join the TMC in the state,” said Rai. UP TMC is also deliberating on issues which would be core points of its election campaign. These issues would vary in every vidhan sabha constituency. “We have started talking to people and our office-bearers are making a list to finalise main issues. In West Bengal we took up issues of `jan manas’ (masses),” said the state party president. TMC has been active in UP since 2005, but its organization got a rejig after it became a national party in 2016-17. “This time we wish to contest on maximum seats as an individual and not as an alliance partner as has been in the past,” said Rai who is the first party president in UP after it became a national party. TMC may not have a core vote base in the state, but it is not shying away from finding its foothold in UP. The party has formed over 63 district units and the rest would be re-organised shortly. By October-November, the party also aims at taking out a ‘yatra’ in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/buoyed-by-bengal-victory-tmc-sets-eyes-on-up-polls/articleshow/82723596.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Hyderabad||WFH affected due to 16-hour power cuts||Hyderabad: Frequent and long power cuts have hindered operations for several professionals working from home in Ameenpur area. The rain on Sunday led to power outages, some as long as 16 hours, in several colonies. “I have not seen a day without power cut in the last six years. While the government boasts of 24 hour power supply, we have never witnessed it in Ameenpur. This area has been ignored by the government as it falls between Ameenpur and Bachupally,” said Nagarjuna Layam, resident of Empire Meadows in Ameenpur’s Ward 3. Even on Sunday, several areas such as Srivani Nagar, PNR Colony, Sai Anurag Colony, Verdiri Township among others had power disruption of around of six to 10 hours. Agitated over the power outages, many residents took to social media seeking restoration of the supply. “@TsspdclCorporat @KTRTRS @KTRoffice sir we have no power for last 16 hrs, all inverter are dead, no internet. Sir please help to get power back. It’s been very common now in Ameenpur municipality,” tweeted Gopu. TSSPDCL officials attributed the frequent power outages in the area to rains, winds and huge tree branches. “Feeders get tripped whenever a tree branch touches the power lines due to heavy winds or rains. This frequent tripping of feeders leads to power outages. Now, we are in the process of trimming the tree branches. The issue should be resolved by eveining on May 18,” said Patancheruvu division assistant engineer, Manikanta Kumar.  “I can understand that continuous monitoring of load conditions of 33KV feeders is not happening in Ameenpur. Otherwise this interruption of power issue could be avoided,” said Surendra Uplanchiwar, a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wfh-affected-due-to-16-hour-power-cuts/articleshow/82721251.cms||Preeti Biswas

Shipment of another 100 oxygen concentrators, 2,000 oximeters as well as 2,500 thermal sensors was delivered to the government on May 16 for distribution to hospitals and Covid care centres. Kundu, from Adelaide, said Haryanvis across Australia donated funds for these lifesaving machines on AHA’s call in a few days via community WhatsApp groups. “Our team is not only limited to providing medical equipment. As there was an acute shortage of wood for performing last rites of Covid victims, two truckloads of dry wood was provided in collaboration with an organisation working on ground,” he said. Satpal Chahal, AHA representative from Melbourne claimed that their organisation has set an ambitious target of raising at least $200,000 AUD as a part of this operation. Sewa Redhu, from Sydney said the equipment was being sent to various healthcare institutions in the state and NCR based on need and urgency under the aegis of nodal officers appointed by the government.

A panchanama of the damaged properties is being done by the local revenue officials,” said Vitthal Banote, head of the district disaster management cell. Several villages and bazaar towns in Bhor, Maval, Velhe, Mulshi, Khed, Ambegaon and Junnar experienced power disruption for eight to 10 hours, as many electrical poles fell due to the wind, said a district administration official. Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said, “We had provided first aid kids to all gram panchayats. As a precaution in the areas that were perceived vulnerable to the cyclone’s effect, we had moved all expecting women to hospitals. Earth movers were kept on standby for clearing roads and overhead tanks were kept filled with water. The aim was to ensure that water supply was not disrupted in case of a power failure.” In Pune city, overcast weather condition prevailed throughout the day and light rain was reported from some areas. The wind speed in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits was not that strong, said fire brigade officials. Prashant Ranpise, head of the Pune fire brigade department, said, “We received reports of only two tree getting uprooed. No untoward incident was reported. Our teams are on standby mode to handle any situation.” Power supply in areas such as Undri, Pisoli, Keshavnagar and Mudhwa was disrupted for a few hours due to fall of electrical poles. Similarly, localities such as Wakad, Hinjewadi, Charoli and Kiwale in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits also experienced power failure for a few hours in the afternoon. “Our teams restored the supply within a few hours till Monday evening,” said an official from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday had forecast moderate to light rainfall over the city on Monday. Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 3 mm and 0.8 mm rainfall. “Sunday’s very severe cyclonic storm, Tauktae, over the east-central Arabian sea continued its north-northwestward movement and intensified into an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm and lay centred over east-central Arabian sea. It further moved north-northwestward and lay centred over east-central Arabian sea near about 150 km west of Mumbai, 220 km south-southeast of Diu, 260 km southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) and 490 km east-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). The cyclone landfall process has begun over Gujarat coast around 8.30 pm on Monday,” an IMD official said. “Under the influence of the cyclone, the city is expected to get rainfall till May 19 with thunderstorms and lightning in the evening hours,” the met official said. The Army Southern Command has mobilised columns and Engineer Task Forces to the western coast as part of an exercise aimed at assisting the local civil administration in rescue and relief operations due to Tauktae. With the landfall of the extremely severe cyclonic storm forecast in coastal areas of Gujarat, Indian Army units and formations have prepared themselves with substantial teams along with elements of communication and engineer task forces to provide relief and all kind of assistance following Covid protocols. “Since the maximum impact is likely to be in Saurashtra, including the Union Territory of Diu, 10 integrated teams are poised to be employed for aid to civil authority in there.Ten teams have been launched to the Junagarh area in Gujarat. While others are ready to move on short notice of the state administration after analysis of situation as it builds up,” said the command authorities. The cyclonic storm didn’t see many effects at the Pune airport except, for one flight cancellation. An Air Asia flight, which was to come from Bengaluru to Pune and fly to Jaipur was cancelled. “Due to the adverse weather conditions as a result of the cyclonic storm Tauktae over the Arabian Sea, AirAsia India cancelled the Pune leg of its Bengaluru-Pune-Jaipur route. The airline will continue to operate the direct flight from Bengaluru-Jaipur. AirAsia India has notified all affected guests via email and SMS.

Doctors available on these numbers for tele-counselling are advised to keep a record of the people calling and medicines prescribed to them online so that any person or doctor attending the patients knows of their status. There is one helpline number for the headquarter and four others for each zone under SDMC. SDMC mayor Anamika Mithlesh said that the facility aims to help those who are in home isolation and unable to visit doctors. “During the tele-counselling, all queries related to coronavirus are being resolved and treatment is being discussed. Since people are in their homes due to the surge in cases, they are totally dependent on information available on social media and other platforms. But there is no surety that information gathered through these platforms is authentic. Helpline numbers have been issued with the motive to provide authentic information to people,” she said. Leader of house Narendra Chawla said the toll-free number—1800115676— is for all citizens living in SDMC areas. Separate helpline numbers are also functional at each zone of SDMC. Helpline number 9999019426 for west zone, 9999019340 for Najafgarh, 9999019745 for central zone and 9999019375 for south zone. “We are already receiving 10 to 15 calls per day on each number and we try to give authentic and accurate information to people. Many times people also call to know the time gap between different doses and which vaccine is available with the corporation,” he added. The services are open from 9am to 9pm. The east corporation had also released a list of 29 doctors for tele-counseling last month and these numbers are already receiving great response, said officials. Besides tele-counselling, the SDMC has also shared information related to lifting of biomedical waste, municipal solid waste, availability of beds at isolation centres, list of vaccination centres, etc, on its website. “There are separate helpline numbers given to access any of these services. In fact, we have given the details/numbers of staff engaged in each ward, who can be contacted for lifting waste if not attended on time,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-starts-helpline-for-at-home-patients/articleshow/82753549.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He then dialed the Karad police and Satara superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Bansal rushed to the spot with the BDDS team. Bansal told TOI: “Our team has defused the hand grenades as per the standard operating procedure. We are trying to trace the source. Given the rusting on the shell, we do not believe they were made recently. Prima facie, it may be from the ordnance factory in Khadki, Pune. We will contact the factory authorities and find out how the grenades ended up in the river. We are registering an FIR against unknown persons.” The youth had spread his net along the bridge at Tambve village, which is around 10 Km south of Karad city.

It happened in just 16 days,” the chief minister told the media here.He added, “UP is the state which has conducted most corona tests. As many as 4.5crore tests have been conducted.”“With the grace of god, the situation was brought under control. There was a requirement of 300 metric tons of oxygen in the first wave. It reached 1,000 metric tons in the second wave. Now 300 plants of oxygen are being installed across the state and in which six plants of oxygen will be installed in Muzaffarnagar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/some-forces-trying-to-break-the-morale-of-people-health-workers-says-cm-yogi/articleshow/82716926.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Chandigarh||Malana isolates itself from world, keeps coronavirus out of village||Manali: Malana village, which is known as the world’s oldest democracy, has succeeded in keeping the coronavirus out. Secluded naturally, as the village is perched on the far end of Parvati valley, the village is one of the largest in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu district with a population of about 2,350. However, it has always guarded its seclusion zealously and opened up to outsiders not too long ago. In these times of the pandemic, the villagers have once again fallen back into the old habit patterns and barred the entry of outsiders since last March. Paras Ram, a local, recalled, “When we heard of coronavirus last year, we were terrified and we started thinking about ways to protect ourselves. The first step we took was to ban the entry of outsiders. We guarded all the entry points to ensure not a single unknown person came. We also stopped unnecessary movement outside the village. We do not wear face masks or maintain physical distance inside the village. We still know that if the disease enters Malana, it will wreak havoc.” Malana has had its own judicial system and all works in the village are still done with the advice of Jamlu Devta. It was only about three decades ago that some officials had succeeded in convincing the residents to follow the national Constitution. The village then became notorious for producing Malana Cream, the world’s best and most expensive charas. A large number of tourists started visiting the village – some to know its culture and others for charas. Today, its economy is dependent on both tourism and charas. A majority of the residents are still illiterate, very few are high class pass out and less than a dozen have been to college. Being a popular tourist destination, the authorities were concerned about the spread of the virus in the village as the residents are social and stay together like one big family. They also refused to follow social distancing, use of face masks, and other safety protocols. Despite this, the villagers took some hard decisions which have resulted in not a single positive case in the village. “We have kept all guesthouses, homestays, and eateries closed since March last year. Tourists have not been allowed to enter Malana for over a year now. Those involved in tourism activities have been warned that they will be solely responsible if they allow in outsiders and if they bring disease to the village,” said former panchayat president of Manali, Bhagi Ram. Last year, the village had announced a fine of Rs 51,000 for violation of rules framed by locals to protect themselves from Covid-19. This year, they have not announced any cash penalty but made each resident responsible for the safety of others. Bhagi said some tourists had reached Malana but were not allowed to enter the village. “Some people have pitched camps outside the village. Tourists were asked to stay there. Some people from other villages like Jana had to visit our temple to perform religious ceremonies. They came and returned immediately. We know that if a single case enters Malana, the entire village will be infected as all of stay together like a family.” Meanwhile, Covid vaccination drive has failed in Malana village. While there is no beneficiary for vaccination for 18-44 age groups that will start from Monday, even 45+ persons are hesitating in getting the first dose. The health department is considering special awareness campaign in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/malana-isolates-itself-from-world-keeps-coronavirus-out-of-village/articleshow/82725980.cms||Suresh Sharma

Referring to the criticism of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal after his comment during a meeting with the Prime Minister was broadcast last month, Sisodia asked how to determine which meetings could be telecast live. No reaction to Sisodia’s remark was immediately available from the BJP-led Centre. Interacting with district magistrates at a meeting on Tuesday, Modi said they were free to innovate to suit their local requirements and asked them to share their feedback about any change in policy without any inhibition. “The statement of the Prime Minister in the meeting today was telecast live. In a previous meeting there was objection against CM Arvind Kejriwal’s live telecast that protocol was breached. Did protocol allow today’s live telecast? How would it be known which meeting is to be live telecast and which not,” Sisodia tweeted in Hindi. Kejriwal had shared live his comments during the interaction with Modi over Covid on April 23. Modi had chided Kejriwal for “breaking protocol”, and later the central government officials accused the AAP chief of “playing politics”. Delhi government had responded to the sharp reaction, claiming Kejriwal’s address was shared live because there had never been any written or verbal instruction that it was not allowed.

---||Nagpur||Delivered at home: Free, nutritious food for Covid-hit families||Nagpur: A couple came from Goa to Nagpur for the husband’s heart surgery. Unfortunately both turned Covid positive and had to be admitted in different hospitals. The tough times got tougher as local relatives didn't come forward to help.Miles away in Hyderabad, a husband, wife and son got positive and were put up at a quarantine centre. Two young daughters were left alone at home.With the deadly pandemic, many families are in dire straits. Coming to the rescue of such homes is Nagpur’s Seva Kitchen which is providing free-of-cost nutritious meals to families not just in Nagpur but also in Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. “The idea struck when my relatives turned positive and the family faced extreme hardships in managing meals. At that time, a thought came that so many households must be going through the same struggle,” said Khushroo Poacha, the man behind Seva Kitchen and a former Nagpur Heroes awardee.Ever since the second wave hit the region in February, the organization has been serving meals to positive patients and their family members. Till now, it has served over 100 families. “We try and reach out to senior citizens too who are Covid positive and are too weak to cook. In most cases, there is no house help,” added Poacha.The organization has identified vendors in other cities including Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore where the same initiative is being replicated. Finances for the same are being raised through an online campaign. “For patients, it is very important to have a healthy diet. Eating outside food is not advisable. We ensure that our meals are healthy and completely hygienic,” said Poacha.The organization is reportedly the first one in the region to have taken up such initiative. “We usually start providing the meals as soon as the patient turns positive. We continue it at least for a week and in some cases even more, depending on the condition of the patients,” added Poacha.Poacha shared a handwritten note by a young boy whose entire family had turned positive and his uncle was hospitalized. Due to financial constraints, they were struggling to arrange for daily meals for him. After learning about this, Seva Kitchen provided meals for 13 days. “We are fine only because of you. When someone would ask me if I have seen God, I would think of my parents and teachers. Now I see God in one more person and that is you. First time in my life someone has helped me without knowing me. Sir, right now our financial situation is not good and we can’t help your cause. But I will always be there with you when you need manpower,” the boy wrote to Poacha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delivered-at-home-free-nutritious-food-for-covid-hit-families/articleshow/82718903.cms||Manka Behl

In the aftermath, bodies floated at Apollo Bunder, Colaba, Mazgaon docks and other sea faces even as piles of planks, broken masts and other pieces of timber turned the harbour from Colaba to Sewri into one long graveyard of ships. Live updates: Cyclone TauktaeThe next one in 1948, again in November, left wreckage in its wake from cargoes carried by around 300 "country craft", littering fishing villages in Versova, Danda and Thana too. About 100 lives, chiefly crew and owners of ships and boats, were feared lost and a 1,000-ton Norwegian steamer called 'Marly'--which left Bombay for the Malabar coast--vanished. According to TOI reports, seven people were killed in the city on the day and a hundred injured. Read Also6.7 lakh homes, 40 Covid hospitals in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Raigad face power cutsGusty winds and heavy downpour due to the cyclone led to power outage in several parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which also includes Thane, Dombivali, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai, Pen and Panvel, as well as in R aigad. A total of 6.7 lakh consumers faced power tripping, 4 lakh of whom'Tauktae' is probably the closest Mumbai has come since to experiencing a severe storm, with wind speeds of up to 108 kmph near the Colaba seafront. Tauktae, experts say, was at its most intense at its closest to the Mumbai coast (distance of 120 km) before it propelled away towards Gujarat. An extreme weather event of this nature, so close to the city, portends a warning about the likely consequences of ignoring climate change, say experts. Read AlsoCyclone Tauktae: Storm most fierce when closest off Mumbai’s coastThe extremely severe cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae’ which come within a distance of 120 km off the Mumbai coast brought winds reaching up to 108 kmph on Monday afternoon.This is the third year in a row that cyclones in the Arabian Sea have menaced the west coast. Nisarga in 2020 even made landfall near Alibaug in Maharashtra while in 2019 Vayu moved parallel to the shoreline. Experts said the recent frequency of cyclones was a clear sign of temperatures rising in the Arabian Sea. These low-pressure systems are formed when warm, moist air rises up from the sea surface. Historically, waters off the western coast have experienced fewer storms than the Bay of Bengal, and typically weaker. "The rapid warming of the Arabian Sea is leading to not just more cyclones but also more extreme rain events... Due to these warm ocean conditions it is seen that the cyclone intensifies from a weak cyclone to an extremely severe cyclone rapidly. This rapid intensification also means we need to ensure our forecasting is accurate," said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Read AlsoMaharashtra: Seven dead, 9 hurt as ‘Tauktae’ leaves a trail of damage and disruptionSeven people died and nine were injured across Maharashtra as the extremely severe cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae’ came within a distance of just 120 km from the Mumbai coast on Monday.Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and a PhD student at the department of meteorology, University of Reading in UK, said a cyclone is not much of a menace if it dissipates over the sea itself. “However, if it comes so close to the coast like cyclone Tauktae did and Nisarga last year which made a landfall here, then it’s a massive threat. Also with it intensifying so rapidly, the authorities find very little time to evacuate those living along the coast. This is now seen to be happening frequently with the storms in the Arabian Sea," said Deoras.

---||Pune||Pune: Developer duped of Rs 45 lakh, firm’s former manager booked||PUNE: The city police are searching for a former manager of realty firm City Corporation Limited — developer of the Amanora Township in Hadapsar — on the charge of duping the firm of nearly Rs 45 lakh. As per a complaint lodged by Amanora vice-president Sunil Tarte, the suspect did this by diverting commission — received between 2011 and 2020 from banks for bringing in home loan customers — to his personal account. Tarte, in his FIR to the Hadapsar police, stated that the firm’s banking and finance manager, who was sacked on June 24 last year after the alleged fraud came to light, had forged documents and signatures of his superiors to inform 50-odd banks to transfer the commission amount, related to nearly 6,000 flats sold from 2011 to 2020, into his personal account. The matter came to light during an audit exercise, following which the firm then sacked the manager and submitted a complaint application to the police, who, after verification, finally registered an FIR. The former manager hails from Ahmednagar and is currently a resident of Kondhwa. “Our firm sold around 7,000 flats, but the manager accounted for only 1,000 flats and got the commission for the remaining 6,000 flats transferred from the banks to his personal account. After the fraud came to light, we gave him numerous opportunities to explain where the money had gone, but he did not visit our office. We then decided to terminate him from service. His whereabouts are not known. We decided to file a police complaint,” Tarte told TOI. “We are also conducting an internal inquiry to find out why the fraud did not come to light in the earlier audit reports since 2011, and what exactly had gone wrong. We will be taking corrective measures to prevent such incidents in future,” he added. “The audit conducted by the realty firm revealed that the commission amount received from the banks was not proportionate to the actual number of flats sold since 2011. We conducted a preliminary inquiry and collected several documents from the realty firm and the banks to verify the matter. Our inquiry established that the manager had given an authority letter, allegedly forging signature of his superiors, to the banks to transfer the commission amount into his personal account,” deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil said. Patil said, “The manager had transferred some portion of the commission amount into the realty firm’s bank account to show that all was going well in the firm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-developer-duped-of-rs-45-lakh-firms-former-manager-booked/articleshow/82721397.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Meerut||Meerut: Twins born together die together, days after their 24th birthday||MEERUT: Gregory Raymond Raphael remembers the day clearly. April 23, 1997. The delivery, doctors said, had been successful and his wife Soja was fine. Heart beating with joy, he had rushed to the hospital. The babies, twins, looked exactly alike. The young parents named them Joefred Varghese Gregory and Ralfred George Gregory. Having lived a life where they did almost everything together -- both chose computer engineering, both had jobs in Hyderabad -- they caught the deadly fever the same day, on April 24. Last week, after struggling with Covid, they died together, hours after one another. Raphael said he almost knew that if his sons had to make it, they would come home together. Or they wouldn't. “Whatever happened to one, it happened to the other," he said. "That's how it was since their birth. I had told my wife after we got news that Jeofred had died that Ralfred won't return home alone either. They died on May 13 and May 14, hours apart." He said, “The twins had a lot of plans for us. They wanted to give us a better life. As teachers we have struggled much to bring up the children well and they wanted to give us back, everything from money to happiness. Before they died, they were planning to leave for Korea and then perhaps Germany for work. I don’t know why god punished us like this.” The Raphaels have a third son, the eldest one, Nelfred. Residents of Meerut’s Cantonment area, the family initially treated the brothers at home, thinking the fever would subside. But it didn’t. “We purchased an oximeter. When their oxygen level dropped to 90, doctors advised us to take them to hospital. We admitted them to a private one on May 1,” Gregory said. Their first report had confirmed the young men were Covid-positive. But after a few days, their second RT-PCR test report came negative. “Doctors were planning to move them from the Covid ward to the normal ICU. However, I requested the hospital to monitor their health for two more days in the Covid ward. Then, suddenly, on the evening of May 13, my wife got the call. Our world crashed." Ralfred had made his last phone call to his mother. “He spoke from the hospital bed," said Gregory, his voice shaking. "He told his mother that he was recovering and enquired about Joefred’s health. By then Joefred had died. So we made up a story. We told him we had to shift him to a hospital in Delhi. But Ralfred knew instinctively. He told his mother, 'You are lying'."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/twins-born-together-die-together-days-after-their-24th-birthday/articleshow/82716941.cms||Piyush Rai

Mayor Nirmal Jain said that people unable to get slots on the app after registering themselves are trying their luck at walk-ins, which is getting difficult for staff to handle. Allowing 10-20% walk-ins will solve that issue to an extent. “Most centres for vaccination are in middle of residential areas, but the residents are unable to get slots online or are not tech-savvy enough,” said Jain. “We have been visited by the locals who request to arrange for their vaccination, but we are helpless. For health workers also it has become a herculean task to keep stopping people who visit the centres without booking slots. The mayor added that the corporation is perusing authorities in this regard regularly. “I think if a certain percentage of walk-ins would be allowed, things may become easier. Officials have been told to make a detailed proposal before sending it to Delhi Government,” he said. EDMC on Tuesday decided to increase the deadline for Covid compensation to family members of employees who lost their lives to the illness while performing duties. “We have given the anticipatory approval to extend the Covid compensation policy for the regular and contractual or outsourced employees till June 30. The dependents of the deceased employees will be getting compensation of Rs 10 lakh and medical reimbursement benefits,” said the standing committee chairman Satpal Singh. Jain further said that EDMC stands firmly with its employees in this difficult time and is ready to offer assistance in all possible manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-seeks-nod-for-walk-ins-for-18-44-vaccination/articleshow/82753624.cms||Vibha Sharma

Following the meeting, he told the reporters, “We want registration of FIRs against the manufacturers and suppliers for playing with the lives of the people. Our district received 150 ventilators, most of them were shared with leading private hospitals handling Covid-19 cases, but they were stunned at the sub-standard quality ventilators.”These ventilators were purchased by using money provided from PM Cares, “You never know how many people might have losttheir lives before the hospitals realised that they were sub-standard,” said Jaleel.The Government Medical College and Hospital’s, Aurangabad, record depicting the maintenance and repairing of the brand new ventilators, have gone viral on social media.When contacted, Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve said, “Supplying faulty ventilators poses a threat to the patients’ life and even causes death. There has to be appropriate legal action against those responsible.”He also questioned the people raising question over hospitals’ ability to operate the ventilators received under the PM Cares fund. Congress’ city district president Hisham Osmani said, “It is being claimed that these ventilators were manufactured under ‘Make in India’ initiative. If this is the quality of the products under this flagship programme, imagine the message, we are conveying about the quality of products being manufactured in India.”He demanded an independent probe followed by exemplary action against those responsible for causing the death of innumerable patients by supplying such poor quality ventilators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/file-fir-against-those-supplying-sub-standard-ventilators/articleshow/82714957.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But leading the queue was a man on his cycle, wearing a double mask diligently.In Noida, several recipients had come on bicycles and scooters to take the jabs in the drive-through vaccination session. Apart from DLF Mall, the city’s first such drive was held in Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik stadium in Greater Noida. Recipients above 45 years of age took their first shot at the two centres. After Gurgaon, Noida is the only other NCR city to hold a drive-in vaccination, which makes it easier for people to maintain social distance.On Monday, recipients had to furnish their Aadhaar cards for getting the shots. The vaccinations started around 9am and continued till 2pm at DLF Mall and 4pm at the Greater Noida stadium. Some people walked in for the vaccination, but were returned. “The idea to hold drive-in vaccinations was successful as we saw no adverse events. Also, when people are inside their vehicles, it creates a natural distance between them. We also asked the recipients to wait in the driveway in different zones for half an hour, in case they didn’t feel well,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunisation officer. There were 100 slots at each of the two sites for the first day, which, officials said, might be increased over the next few days. Amit Lakhotia, the CEO of Park+, the parking management company that organised the vaccination drive in Gurgaon as well, said what made the session in Noida different was the fact that many of the recipients came on two-wheelers and cycles. “We had organised the drive along with the administration in Gurgaon too. But unlike there, Noida had several recipients who came on bikes and cycles. In fact, the first person to come at DLF Mall was on a cycle. It is presumed that in a drive-through session, people will come in cars,” he added.According to Lakhotia, since Noida saw less crowd, it made social distancing much easier. He, however, said slots would be increased in the coming days since another lane in the driveway was empty and could be utilised for the sessions.In Ghaziabad, drive-through vaccinations will start from Friday at the World Square Mall in Mohan Nagar. “After much deliberation, we chose World Square Mall for the drive-through vaccination, which will start from Friday. We have ensured there is availability of ample parking space so that recipients do not face any problem in their cars,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate of Ghaziabad. “In the days to come, more sites will be opened up for the sessions. Recipients will not need to undergo the trouble of waiting in queue to get the shots,” Pandey added.For the drive-through vaccinations, the DM said, getting registered is a prerequisite. “People are required to come over at an allotted time and date,” he added. By next week, the Ghaziabad administration plans to increase the total number of centres to 74.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/at-noidas-1st-drive-in-vax-site-cycles-scooters-line-up-too/articleshow/82723718.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Delhi||As Covid cases dip, daily discharge exceeds admissions at Delhi hospitals||NEW DELHI: The steady decline in the number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate in Delhi is reflecting in the increasing number of vacant beds in hospitals. The trend can also be seen in another set of figures — admissions in hospitals and number of patients being discharged every day. Thursday saw the number of patients discharged from hospitals being slightly higher than the new admissions that day, a first since the fourth wave hit the city nearly two months ago. On Friday, the gap widened and Delhi’s hospitals saw 1,256 admissions even as 1,331 patients were discharged. Saturday saw the number of admissions dip further to 1,052, while the number of patients who were discharged that day increased to 1,379. On Sunday, the numbers were 952 and 1,079, respectively. According to Delhi government’s figures, the number of admissions and of patients getting discharged remained almost similar from April 1 to 6 but, from April 7, the gap started widening and, from April 10 onwards, the number of admissions saw a huge surge while the number of patients getting discharged didn’t grow at a similar pace, leading to high bed occupancy. The gulf between these two figures was the widest on April 15, when the number of admissions was close to 2,000, while only around 500 patients were discharged. With more people recovering every day, the number of active cases has dipped by 43.8% from the all-time high of 99,725 on April 29 to 56,049 on Monday. As a result, out of a total 27,000 Covid-19 beds in the capital, 11,880 beds, including 9,709 oxygen beds were vacant at 10.30 pm, as per the Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard. While the availability of ICU beds has also increased, with 911 out of 6,626 ICU beds being vacant, it is largely due to the addition of new facilities by the Delhi government as occupancy remains almost similar to the beginning of the month. The Delhi government’s LNJP hospital, the largest Covid facility in NCR, had 1,080 of its total 1,750 beds vacant at 9.39 pm on Monday, as per the Corona dashboard. “There are a lot of beds vacant now as the number of patients coming in is less. While we were getting 125 to 150 patients daily earlier, now we are getting 30 to 40 patients a day,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP hospital. “The number of patients coming to the hospital has come down as overall the positivity rate has decreased in Delhi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-cases-dip-daily-discharge-exceeds-admissions-at-hosps/articleshow/82721461.cms||Sidharatha Roy

They began increasing from third week of February which was beginning of second wave. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “Second wave is almost over for the district. Now, government should reopen economic activities but with a strategy to prevent further rise in cases. Chances of slight rise cannot be ruled out after opening of economic activities but can be always prevented by taking some measures.” Dr Shinde added now it was clear that what happens in other countries is reflected in India after two-three months. “It was seen in first as well as second wave. Proper system should be in place here if third wave begins in other countries,” he said. The district had witnessed record number of 1,81,749 cases in April and a test positivity rate (TPR) of 27.89%.

---||Aurangabad||Fadnavis: Keep ventilators free of politics||Aurangabad: Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said the ruling parties should not bring politics into the issue of ventilators supplied by the Centre. “The Centre has supplied around 5,000 ventilators to Maharashtra. Of them, 90% are functioning properly. Some of them have developed problems and teams of technicians have already been deployed to fix them. It is wrong to give the impression that all the ventilators are malfunctioning,” he said. Fadnavis, speaking to reporters during his official tour to Aurangabad, said he supports the demand for action against firms involved in the supply of problematic ventilators if found guilty. “There were no problems with the first lot of ventilators supplied by the Centre. Machines in the second lot were not stored properly at many places and were dumped for almost four months. That could have caused problems,” Fadnavis. Fadnavis, who held a Marathwada Covid review meeting, said the supply of drugs for the treatment of mucormycosis was to be boosted. “Black fungus infection was rare before the pandemic and the production of the drug was low. The Centre has contacted the drug firms to increase production now,” he said. Fadnavis inaugurated a Covid care centre started by local BJP MLA Atul Save. “Two of our MLAs from Aurangabad district have started Covid care centres and more will join in. By this, we do not mean that the government is lacking on its part,” he said. Earlier, Gangapur BJP MLA Prashant Bamb had started a Covid facility in his constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/fadnavis-keep-ventilators-free-of-politics/articleshow/82714977.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Active Covid-19 cases cross 24,000-mark||Coimbatore: The district continued to record a new high in daily fresh cases of Covid-19 with 3,264 people declared positive on Monday, taking the total number of cases to 1,18,804 cases.Though 1,244 people got discharged, the active number of cases crossed the 24,000-mark to 24,195.With the total number of cured people standing at 93,723, the recovery rate fell below 80% to 78.88%. The district also recorded 14 deaths due to the virus taking the toll to 886.The 14 deaths included a 35-year-old woman with diabetes and hypertension who got admitted at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital but died four days later and a 48-year-old woman with hypothyroidism after 17 days of hospitalization. The remaining victims were all over the age of 50.According to the media bulletin, 598 beds are available in hospitals in the district. Of them, eight are oxygen beds and 11 ICU beds. However, the situation on the ground did not seem to reflect it.On Monday evening, there were eight ambulances lined up outside the GH for a bed and even the oxy-bus inside with 12 patients was full.Of the 24,195 Covid-19 cases, almost 45% or 11,067 people were under home isolation.The department of health services has at least 13 taluks but not a single taluk hospital is under its control.Despite the grim situation, not even one of them accepts Covid-19 patients except Mettupalayam GH.Even Mettupalayam GH only admits patients at Hindusthan Hospital but not on their campus.Even well-equipped Madukkarai GH does not admit Covid-19 patients.Health department officials say many occupants of beds in GH and ESI, are those whose oxygen saturation levels are above 90 and need just two litres a minute and not 24x7.“These patients can easily be managed in taluk hospitals, which are prepared for surgery, and thus always have oxygen cylinders,” admitted a health services official.“We can prepare them to have around 20 to 30 beds each, handle only moderate patients and discharge them. Even if we divert 300 moderate oxygen requiring patients from the main GHs, they will be relieved,” he added.However, the standard response in taluk hospitals is that they don’t have a “Covid-19 ward” or “isolation facilities” or a separate set of staff for it.With only 8,718 samples collected on Sunday, the positivity rate reached an all-time grim high of 37.4%. As many as 674 people took the shot on Monday. However, in positive news, the district has 5,646 doses including 712 at ESI Hospital, 496 at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and 1,678 across primary health centres. There are 2,760 doses in the district storage unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/active-covid-19-cases-cross-24000-mark/articleshow/82721455.cms||---

The channel was pegged to diverting floodwater into river Gandak, and the work was being done without due permission from the Bihar water resources department (WRD). Now that the work has been stopped by the order of the Bihar WRD, a magistrate from the West Champaran district has been deployed to maintain vigil on the situation, Bihar water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said on Monday. According to Jha, the work on the channel will resume only after the flow of water through it is ascertained through the mathematical model, which will give an idea and estimate of the inundations and damage that the flowing water might cause. “The Bihar WRD will ensure that no damage is caused to the eastern embankment of the Gandak, and the security of the embankment will not be compromised,” he added. For the present, the work on the channel has been stopped as a follow-up step in consonance with the order of CM Nitish Kumar. Nitish had earlier asked the Bihar WRD to get the work on the channel inspected to find out if any transgressions had been made. Jha said a team of West Champaran district officials, along with engineers concerned from UP, inspected the site on Sunday. The team found that deviations had occurred in the execution of the work on the channel by the contractor concerned of the UP government and also no prior permission had been obtained from the Bihar WRD for it. The team also found that even as the work had been stayed by the Bihar government on April 30, the contractor kept executing it during night. The channel was being constructed in the Harpur panchayat of Thakraha block in West Champaran. As per the alignment plan, the channel was to be linked with the Rohua nullah near Mukona village in Harpur panchayat. Further, the channel was to start from Chandarpur retire bandh in Bhitaha block of West Champaran at a distance of 1.86km from it. The last point of the channel had to link with the Rohua nullah near Mukoma. Instead of that, the work was being done to link it with the nullah near Chichirwa village at the 6.5km point in Harpur panchayat, and a high land was being cut for the purpose, Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-stops-up-from-digging-channel-in-west-champaran/articleshow/82719075.cms||Abhay Singh

There are also hundreds of tribals here. Those who test positive for Covid-19 have to travel about 64 kilometres to Pollachi Government Hospital or 100 kilometres to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital,” he said. “The Valparai hospital neither has space or modern equipment to treatment Covid patients and as a result, most of the patients are referred to hospitals in Coimbatore or Pollachi.”The district administration should turn the Government Arts College, which is located in the heart of the town, to a Covid care centre, Arumugam said.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: PG medical seats set to rise as state promotes 406 teachers||MUMBAI: In a relief to postgraduate medical aspirants, the state government has finally approved the ad hoc promotions of 406 medical teachers after eight to 10 months that will help add seats. TOI had reported how the delay in approving these posts had held up sanction of 107 postgraduate medical seats by the National Medical Commission (NMC). With the decks cleared, the state government can now re-apply to NMC and get these seats sanctioned. After inspection of government and civic medical colleges, the NMC had reported deficiencies in their compliance report, following which these colleges did not get sanction to admit students for the academic year 2021-22. The main problem was the teacher-student ratio. The approval of these teachers — 124 professors and 282 associate professors — has come as a relief to medical aspirants. The demand had been pending for eight to 10 months due to administrative reasons. Representatives of Maharashtra State Medical Teachers’ Association have welcomed the move. The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences in a statement said the seats are not reduced, and the colleges will write to the NMC with the compliance report. An official added the admissions would not have been affected as NEET-PG has been postponed till August 31. PG seats in medical colleges are based on the number of faculty positions. The teacher-student ratio is 1:3 for a professor, 1:2 for an associate professor and 1:1 for a lecturer. Maharashtra does not follow time-bound promotions and for 20 years has been giving ad hoc promotions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pg-med-seats-set-to-rise-as-state-promotes-406-teachers/articleshow/82723971.cms||Yogita Rao

Farmers who harvest produce on Saturday are forced to sell it for low price at commission mandis or feed it to cattle as they can neither afford to stock it till Monday nor sell it on Sunday. Some of them harvest on Saturdays due to lack of awareness or due to factors like labour shortage,” she said. “If farmers face any issues in transporting produce to markets or in purchasing or transporting fertilizers and other required items, they can reach out to horticulture officials. We will also assist them if they want to bring skilled labourers from other districts,” the official said. “In view of Covid-19 pandemic, we have asked farmers to reach out to us through WhatsApp instead of visiting offices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/farmers-told-not-to-harvest-produce-on-saturdays/articleshow/82721506.cms||---

On Sunday, over 200 people were booked for organising, attending the procession and abusing and manhandling policemen. The community leader had died due to Covid. His supporters thronged the hospital and sought his body. The supporters made special arrangements for the procession and a truck was covered with the flowers and the photograph was put up on it. The procession started from Alkunte Chowk and went to Modi crematorium and the same was attended by over a thousand people. Earlier in the day, Solapur city police commissioner (CP) Ankush Shinde had said, “We have arrested 48 people so far, and the rest of the organisers will be arrested soon. They misbehaved with the police and did not heed to the orders. The process of identifying the suspects is going on.” Brother of the deceased leader Bugappa Sidram Mhetra is also among those booked by police and he is yet to be arrested. The suspects have been booked under sections 353, 188, 268, 269 and 270 of Indian Penal Code and sections of Disaster Management Act. Shinde said the Solapur Municipal Corporation (SMC) has been requested to take measures like imposing strict containment and screening of all residents of the localities through which the procession passed. “We have started barricading the localities from where the procession was carried out. There was not a single case of Covid when the procession was carried out, but the infection can spread since a large number of locals came in contact with each other and travelled to other localities as well. The civic officials have been asked to undertake mass screening of the locals and till screening is not completed the locals will be asked to remain in isolation,” Shinde said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/55-held-for-organising-funeral-procession-in-solapur/articleshow/82714995.cms||---

Each bus has 12 oxygen seats and patients can use them while waiting for oxygen beds.The buses, sponsored by city-based IT firm KGISL, have oxygen cylinders fitted behind each double seat. People can occupy the seat, put on mask and start breathing pure oxygen. Each bus has two trained staff nurses, who will help patients fit masks, switch on oxygen flow and monitor them. “Each cylinder has oxygen for six hours, after which nurses and GH staff will replace them,” said B Rajinikanth, who explored the concept of setting up such buses in Coimbatore. “The duct can be adjusted to provide two to five litres of oxygen a minute,” he said.Nine patients used the facility within half-an-hour of inauguration on Monday.The buses, maintained by the Entrepreneurs’ Organization and KGISL, will give preference for aged people, whose oxygen saturation levels is below 90. As the buses are parked on CMCH premises, duty doctors can check patients regularly.While KGISL arranged the vehicles, oxygen is provided by Seva Gases. Internal fabrication was done by Lifeline Gas. The initiative is likely to cost around Rs 5 lakh a month per bus for maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2-oxygen-buses-for-cmch-patients/articleshow/82721546.cms||---

The health workers will visit the patients at home every day and feed data in the app after measuring their temperature and oxygen level. These data will be monitored at the district level. If the oxygen level is below 94, the patient will be shifted to the nearby dedicated Covid health centre for proper treatment,” Nitish said. The CM said the app installed on the tablets assigned to health workers/ANM in the state would start providing information on the health status of home-isolated patients in their areas. This would also help the government to reach these patients and provide adequate medical services in time. This would also create a database through an easy and user-friendly process for helping the health department to monitor the health status of those patients. Secretary, department of information technology (DIT), Santosh Kumar Mall said the app was developed by the Bihar State Electronic Development Corporation (BELTRON) under the guidance of the department of health and the DIT to help the health workers in fight against Covid-19. The main aim of this app is to provide better facilities and proper monitoring of the home-isolated patients in the state. “The app was used on pilot basis in Supaul, Aurangabad, Bhagalpur, Gopalganj and Nalanda districts for the last five days. On the very first day of the trial, a patient with an oxygen level at 76 was located in Kishanpur block of Supaul. He was immediately shifted to a hospital by the district administration,” Mall said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-launches-app-to-monitor-covid-patients-at-home/articleshow/82719190.cms||---

The civic body, in a fresh order, said that all grocery, vegetable, egg, fish and mutton shops will remain closed till June 1. Civic chief Shankar Gore told TOI that the civic body was forced to order the closure of these shops in the Ahmednagar city as people were seen queuing up in front of the shops selling essential commodities without adhering to the Covid safety protocols over the past two days. “The daily number of Covid cases here has dropped significantly. If we allow these shops to function they way they have been functioning in the past couple of days, there could again be a spike,” added Gore. Moreover, the local police had written to the civic body suggesting that these shops should be closed due to the presence of a large number of people, the civic chief said The civic body had imposed 12 days of strict restrictions shutting all grocery shops and vegetable mandis from May 3 as Ahmednagar city had emerged as a Covid hotspot registering over 700-800 cases every day. However, of late, the daily number of positive cases in the city has plummeted below 200. The total number of active cases in Ahmednagar city is around 1700, including 200 who are critical. The Ahmednagar district police have asked people not to venture out of their homes unless there is an emergency. The police have warned that people found on roads without any reasonable purpose would be made to undergo rapid antigen testing and would be sent to Covid facilities if they test positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/strict-curbs-reimposed-in-ahmednagar/articleshow/82715076.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||Politicians have no business hoarding medicines, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday said political leaders have no business to hoard stocks of Covid-19 medicines that are already in shortage and they are expected to surrender these drugs. The high court said since it is projected that these medicines were procured for public charity and not for political gains, these leaders are expected to surrender their stocks to the director general of health services of Delhi government so that they can be used for the poor and needy at government hospitals. Delhi Police submitted that politicians, including BJP MP Gautam Gambhir, who were alleged to have been hoarding Covid-19 medicines, were voluntarily helping people in getting medical aid and no one has been defrauded. But the high court on Monday expressed dissatisfaction over the “vague and whitewashed inquiry” report. “Just because some political figures are involved, you will not investigate, we will not allow this,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, which was hearing a plea over allegations against politicians hoarding and distributing medicines, including Remdesivir, in the capital. Gambhir, in his statement given to the police that is part of the status report, said being a public representative, he is duty-bound to do whatever is possible within his means to support people and that any effort by any citizen towards relief for the common man should be welcomed in these testing times. He added that medicines were being distributed for free for public welfare and support. In the status report, police said the political leaders, including Gambhir, have been actually helping people in getting medical aid in the form of medicines, oxygen, etc, for free and no one has been defrauded. It said probe is being conducted on a day-to-day basis and the officials have examined Gambhir, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee Chaudhary president Anil Kumar, ex-Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma, BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana and AAP MLA Dilip Pandey. The others who have been inquired are vice-president Congress (Delhi) Ali Mehdi, block adhyaksh of Congress (Delhi) Ashok Baghel, ex-MP Bijnor Shahid Siddiqui and All India Youth Congress president Srinivas BV. The bench, which gave a week to the police to file a better status report, said the report must clearly mention how medicines, which were in huge shortage and sold at higher rates in the black market, were procured by some persons in large quantities. The court’s comments came after the petitioner alleged that Gambhir and others were distributing medicines, but weren’t disclosing the source. The high court said political leaders have no business to use the pandemic time for their personal benefits and expressed hope that medicines used for Covid treatment are not hoarded for “political gains”. “We hope and expect Delhi Police to conduct a proper investigation into the hoarding of medicines. Have you realised how many people have died due to lack of medicines because of hoarding”, the court questioned, demanding a detailed status report. “Just because some political figures are involved...is no reason to not investigate. Your force should stand up and investigate. You have a duty to the people, your force has to understand this. People all over are suffering” the high court remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-politicians-have-no-biz-hoarding-medicines/articleshow/82721563.cms||---

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath inspected one such centre at the Sector 45 community centre on Sunday. During his visit, the federation urged the CM for vaccination camps in residential sectors. The centres are equipped with oxygen cylinders, medicines used for Covid treatment, paramedic staff and doctors who are either attached to neighbouring hospitals or are residents, the federation said. “Some of these L1 isolation centres are operating in sectors 12, 19, 34, 48, 49, 50, 82, 93, 100, 119 and 122, as well as Century Apartments and Udyog Vihar, among others. They are of varying capacities ranging from two to 20 beds. We are getting the support of the Noida Authority in refilling of oxygen cylinders at Rs 500 per cylinder,” said Yogendra Sharma, president of the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA). According to KK Jain, the secretary-general of FONRWA, member RWAs and social organisations have pooled in resources and started these facilities to benefit residents seeking medical assistance in home isolation. “We have seen painful times in the last 15 days, during which we and many others have lost loved ones. Our member RWAs have done very important work by arranging food, oxygen cylinders, medicines, paramedics as well as doctors at these isolation centres. It’s the local RWAs who have stepped in at times of dire need for residents,” Jain said. The FONRWA president urged the CM to arrange for vaccination camps to be held in residential sectors so as to reach more residents, especially the elderly and those with comorbidities, as many haven’t been able to get slots for inoculation through the Co-WIN portal. “The CM has assured us of action as the matter is still under consideration. We are in talks with the chief medical officer and hope to find a solution to this soon, as drive-through vaccination drives are not feasible for the elderly and those with comorbid conditions,” Sharma said. Meanwhile, social organisations such as Challengers Group, a youth body, are providing medicines, oxygen concentrators and ambulance services to residents in villages as well as the economically weaker sections of society in urban areas. “We are trying our best, but it is like a drop in the ocean given the situation in villages, where testing and medical facilities are negligible,” said Prince Sharma, president of the group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/rwas-running-25-isolation-centres-in-noida-sectors/articleshow/82723794.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The devastating pandemic has killed many in the city and bodies are being cremated and buried in PPE kits. Many citizens from the Christian community also lost the battle to the deadly virus, but their families are not burying them now. Instead, they are adopting the Hindu tradition of cremating the bodies on ghats of the Ganga and taking the ashes in urns to the graveyard for entombment. Coffins are gone, funerals are mute. Since the beginning of the second wave, at least six bodies were cremated and ashes taken to the Christian graveyard at Chaukaghat for burial, Father Vijay Shantiraj, secretary of Banaras Christian Cemetery Board, told TOI on Monday. “The Christian population in Varanasi is over 3,000. Normally, one or two deaths are reported in the community per month, but more than 30 have died in the last 45 days when Covid cases started surging. The reason for many of these deaths could not be ascertained,” he said. “When someone dies in Christian community, prayers are held at home and later at church by keeping the body in a coffin before burial. However, nowadays, as precautionary measures we are ensuring that minimum persons come in contact with the body for safety and to prevent any likely spread of infection,” said Fr Shantiraj. “Some people got infected and died of Covid, and their families consulted us since they were not in favour of burying the body. We suggested that the bodies can be cremated and ashes can be buried,” he said. So far, six Christian families took bodies of their kin to CNG crematorium at Harishchandra Ghat directly from the hospital and cremated them. The ashes were collected and buried after prayers, Fr Shantiraj added. When the annual special prayers will be offered at the cemeteries on November 2, we will pray at these graves also, he said. “I don’t recall any instance before this in my life, when bodies were cremated and ashes buried,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pandemic-blurs-tradition-christianscremate-bodies-pray-and-bury-ashes/articleshow/82719199.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Dehradun||135 fresh undisclosed deaths in U'khand hospitals||Dehradun: Close on the heels of the Covid care centre (CCC) at Baba Burfani Hospital in Haridwar not disclosing 65 deaths, unrecorded fatalities in hospitals across Uttarakhand are now tumbling out -- from other cities like Roorkee, Dehradun, Rudrapur. While a CCC at Raipur on the outskirts of Dehradun was found to have kept to itself details of 27 Covid patients who died over a period of 20 days between April 26 and May 16, 28 previously unrecorded deaths were reported from the military hospital (MH) in Roorkee. The deaths took place at the MH over the last one year since the pandemic hit the state. At the JLN District Hospital in Rudrapur, too, data of 65 deaths were added only on Monday. The patients had died there between April 28 to May 7. Similarly, BHEL hospital in Haridwar has now disclosed 15 Covid deaths which took place between April 29 and May 12. As to why the deaths were not reported earlier, Dr HD Shakya, additional chief medical officer (ACM) of Roorkee, told TOI, “When we inquired from the MH authorities, they told us that they were manually reporting the deaths to the health department but were not uploading details on the designated Covid portal as a result of which the deaths did not reflect in the total Covid fatality toll.” Dr Anand Shukla, medical superintendent at the Raipur CCC, told TOI that the delay in reporting death records happened as the data entry operator at the CCC wasn’t aware how to do the task and the official concerned went on leave. “We were continuously sharing data of deaths and treatment with district administration manually. It’s just that we failed to upload the same data on the designated portal,” he added. A senior official at the CCC facility, which also has oxygen beds, told TOI that the centre was "swamped with patients" between April 25 to May 15 despite not having any critical care facility and was forced to admit many critical cases as well which lead to the deaths. “From administrative officials to ministers, we faced pressure from all quarters to admit patients who were critical even though the centre has no ICU beds,” he added. Several hospitals across the state have now started reporting Covid deaths in bulk after the health department on Saturday issued a notice to the CCC at Baba Burfani Hospital in Haridwar for not reporting 65 Covid deaths that took place at the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/135-fresh-undisclosed-deaths-in-ukhand-hospitals/articleshow/82717037.cms||Ishita Mishra

Few industries have jointly started to provide boarding and lodging facility at one place,” he said.The district authorities have imposed severe restrictions from May 12 to May 23 in Nashik in order to break the chain of coronavirus. Two separate delegations of trade and industries — Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA) and Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) — recently met Bhujbal, urging him to allow industry and trade to be functional. A delegation of MAACIA, led by its state president Santosh Mandlecha urged the guardian minister to allow trade and industries to operate as the positive cases of Covid-19 are dropping. The delegation informed Bhujbal about the issued being faced by them and demanded relief package for the traders.Nikhil Panchal, AIMA vice-president, said only 1% industries can provide stay and food facility to their workers. At this juncture, the closure of all industries will cause deep impact on their functioning.“As the Covid situation has improved in Nashik, we want the minister to ease out restrictions at the earliest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/call-on-easing-of-restrictions-following-review-after-4-days/articleshow/82715093.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Pune: Two booked on charge of threatening policemen||PUNE: The Khadak police have registered a case against two men for threatening police after they were stopped on Sunday for violating the Covid-19 restrictions on Shivaji Road. The duo had claimed that they were journalists with a local online portal in Pimpri Chinchwad, but the police found their claims to be false. The two booked men were travelling with three others in a car when their vehicle was stopped at Fadgate chowk. The police informed them that more than three persons are not allowed to travel in a car owing to the prevailing Covid-19 restrictions. However, the duo started arguing with the policemen and issued threats. When the police asked them to pay the fine, they raised slogans against them and also used their cell phones to shoot the incident. “All five travelling in the car are residents of Pimpri. Two of them, who argued with the police, claimed that they were journalists. We took their ID cards and other documents and a verification revealed that the same were bogus. They wanted to pressurise the policemen at the naka-bandi point to allow them to move ahead on the Shivaji road. They were heading to Kondhwa from Pimpri for some work.” Police have booked them under sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 270 (Whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. “We also invoked provisions of Official Secrets Act against them as they used their cell phones to take videos of the policemen at work,” Gade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-booked-on-charge-of-threatening-policemen/articleshow/82721598.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Just 826 get nod for priority jabs in 18-44 age category||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Barely 2% applications received from the age group 18-44 years, with co-morbidities, was approved for Covid-19 vaccination in the state on Monday. Numerous applicants failed to furnish sufficient documents and some even misused the platform by uploading blank documents and photos. Of the 50,000 applications received from priority groups in the age category, the health team verified around 45,000 documents of which only 826 were approved. 511 applicants were vaccinated on Monday and vaccine sessions for this age group could not be held in around five districts for want of sufficient numbers of beneficiaries. The team has to meet a target of 1.5 crore in this age group. The government had decided to prioritize the available dosage of vaccines for people with comorbidities in the age group 18-44 years. The health team spent the past three days processing and verifying each application to identify the applicants. “In many cases, we found Aadhaar cards, photos and even blank pages being uploaded. While some may have done out of ignorance, it seemed others were intentionally playful. Only a very few people actually uploaded the documents in prescribed format and got the necessary certificates from the hospitals. This has affected the progress and pace of the vaccination drive for the younger age group,” said a health department official. The department enlisted 20 comorbidities for determination of vaccination eligibility in the age group 18-44 years. A certificate in prescribed format also needs to be filled in by a registered medical practitioner to identify individuals with co-morbidities that enhance the risk of mortality. The guidelines clearly mandated that the information furnished, if found bogus, would be rejected. “We plan to intensify our awareness campaign for this age group. Even if they are not serious, the message has to be conveyed to such people on how important it is to cover this age group as quickly as possible, especially those who are immunocompromised. The second wave has been particularly severe on this age group, and wastage of time and resource over such an enormous number of erroneous applications is something we cannot afford,” an official said. The health team could administer just 132 vaccines to beneficiaries in the priority age group of 18-44 on Monday in the capital. The health department has also received requests from central and government departments, food delivery chains seeking priority for this age group for vaccination sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/just-826-get-nod-for-priority-jabs-in-18-44-age-category/articleshow/82719256.cms||Aswin J Kumar

One of these men, Pramod Bhaske (25) of Chakan, got these firearms from Akshay Patil — a criminal — with the intention of selling them. “Patil, who has 10 cases to his name, is on the run,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. He said Bhaske was arrested on a tip-off received by sub-inspector Vijay Jagdale of the Chakan police. “The police have recovered two pistols and four cartridges from him.

---||Delhi||Mad rush eases, care centres allow walk-ins||NEW DELHI: When the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhattarpur area restarted on April 26 with 150 oxygen beds, patients from not only the capital but as far away as Ghaziabad and Ballabhgarh also landed up at the facility as the number of Covid cases in the second wave was growing exponentially. The facility came as a ray of hope for those searching frantically for elusive beds back then, but the ‘admission protocol’ allowed only cases referred by district surveillance officials after assessment of details and eligibility. Walk-in patients were not being admitted. This resulted in chaos outside the facility on day one and some heated arguments too. Around 10 pm on Monday, there were 251 vacant oxygenated beds out of total 500 available at the facility, according to the Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard. Now, walk-in patients are welcome at the centre too, but the declining number of cases and a dip in positivity rate have resulted in easy availability of beds. “There are vacant beds at the centre now and walk-in admissions are also taking place. There is adequate availability of medical oxygen, medicines, etc,” said Vivek Pandey, spokesperson of Indo-Tibetan Border Police, which is managing the facility. Pandey, however, said that “the demand now is more for ICU beds for patients whose oxygen saturation levels have dipped below 85 or even 80% and many inquiry calls from such patients are received.” “Though only non-invasive treatment is provided at the facility, which has seen 886 patients getting discharged from more than 1,200 who have been admitted till date, equipment like BiPAP machines and others are available here. Many serious cases have also been treated here, including some cases where the patient’s oxygen saturation level had dipped to 50%,” he said. The fact that demand for ICU beds remains high is evident from the figures of bed occupancy in the city now, compared with 15 days ago. On May 2, the number of hospital beds occupied was 20,136, which came down to 15,542 on Monday, May 17 even though the total number of beds went up. On the other hand, while 5,134 ICU beds were occupied on May 2, the number of occupied ICU beds was 5,698 on May 17. There has been, however, a significant increase in the number of ICU beds since then – from 5,154 on May 2 to 6,575 on Monday. This includes the ICU bed facilities set up near LNJP and GTB hospitals, with 500 beds each. The other Covid Care Centres also remain largely vacant as demand for oxygenated beds has gone down in the city. Sant Nirankari Covid Care and Treatment Centre at Burari, for instance, has 1,044 beds but 908 of these were vacant on Monday evening. Similarly, 739 out of the 800 beds at the centre at Yamuna Sports Complex, 397 of the 460 beds at CWG complex centre, 171 out of the 250 beds at the centre at Gurdwara Rakab Ganj and 75 out of the 100 beds at Shehnai Banquet hall annexed to LNJP hospital are vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mad-rush-eases-care-centres-allow-walk-ins/articleshow/82721632.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Out of that, Rs 5 lakh should be used for Covid relief. An action plan should be made to make each councillor provide food items to the economically weaker section in their wards.”The suggestion was first made by councillor Sukhpreet Bansal. She said, “I think this is a good time to utilise the development fund. JMC-Greater recently provided Rs 1,000 to every family from financially weaker sections. Instead, if we can distribute dry ration amongst them, it will be helpful. As a councillor, we know every corner of our ward and people living in various areas. We will be able to reach out to people more efficiently.” Many Greater councillors have supported this suggestion looking at the wider benefit to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/greater-councillors-write-to-mayor-over-devpt-fund/articleshow/82721647.cms||---

She was then rushed to Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim. The tree crashed on the joint family home of Ghatwals, badly damaging the house as well and the loss is estimated at around Rs 20 lakh. The walls and the roof of nearly the entire house collapsed. Bicholim fire station officer Shripad Gawas rushed to the spot with his team on Monday morning and the team was working through the day to cut the tree and clear the debris. The work was on till late Monday night. Meanwhile, the four families residing in the house will be given shelter in a safer place, said Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit.

For, a census conducted on the world’s tallest flying bird in the state has revealed that its population may have gone up by about 20 per cent in a decade. Experts welcome the heartening news as the increase in population is despite dwindling wetlands and rapid urbanisation in the state. “In the two-day census that concluded on Sunday, we found out that the number of Sarus cranes have increased in the state. The last Sarus census was conducted by GEER Foundation in 2010 when the average count was 1,500. The census we conducted shows the average population may be anywhere between 1,700 and 1,800,” said Dr Bakul Trivedi, secretary, Bird Conservation Society, Gujarat that conducted the census. “Sarus cranes usually stay in and around wetlands that are either getting encroached or fast disappearing. Despite their natural abodes reducing over the last few years, Sarus cranes have increased in numbers and it is an encouraging revelation for bird lovers,” Trivedi told TOI. The census conducted on May 15 and 16 revealed that about 80 per cent of the Sarus cranes were found in Ahmedabad, Anand and Kheda, while the others were spotted in Vadodara, Dahod, Navsari, Surat, Kutch and Saurashtra. “Summer count is important as Sarus usually congregate at wetlands during the day time and it becomes easy to spot them thereby giving better estimation of their numbers,” said Dr Anika Tere, principal investigator in the census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sarus-crane-population-soars-20-in-10-years-in-gujarat/articleshow/82719265.cms||Tushar Tere

The machines will be delivered to ward councillors in two days along with hydroxychloroquine chemical for sanitisation. Currently, only fire tenders and 50 knapsack machines are used for sanitisation at JMC-Greater areas. According to the councillors and officials, they get hundreds of complaints from residents for sanitisation if any of their family members or neighbours are Covid positive. But the complaints come from different areas of the city and it is difficult to send big vehicles everywhere. The corporation has decided to give every councillor one machine along with the chemical so that small complaints can be resolved easily. Rashmi Kankariya, health official of JMC-Greater said, “We receive more than 100 complaints daily which we try to resolve. But it is not possible to do the work immediately as many times for just one house or lane sanitisation, we must send a fire tender or one person from Lal Kothi. It will become convenient for the public if one machine is available in each ward.” The machine will be purchased by JMC-Greater without tender process as it takes months to complete the process. The budget will be Rs 3 lakh and machines will be purchased within two days and delivered. Moreover, 20 litres of hydroxychloroquine chemical for sanitisation will be given to each councillor. JMC-Greater fire committee chairman Paras Jain, who had written to the commissioner earlier for providing the machines said, “I receive more than 300 complaints daily from people across corporation areas. We need the knapsack machines immediately so that for every complaint we don’t have to call civic officials. We will be able to solve the issue at our level in less time.” The machines will not be property of the councillors and they must return it to the JMC-Greater once the pandemic gets over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-greater-to-provide-one-knapsack-machine-to-every-ward-for-sanitisation/articleshow/82721665.cms||---

The Bharati Vidyapeeth police suspect all the deaths were by suicide. Jagannath Kalaskar, senior police inspector, Bharati Vidyapeeth police station, said, “Prima facie, it is suspected that the men were staying alone and were depressed.” “We took the bodies of these men to the Sassoon hospital, where the post-mortem is underway. We will register accidental death cases after receiving post-mortem reports from the hospital,” said senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. In the first case, a 35-year-old man was found hanging from a tree near the Katraj Zoological Park on Pune–Satara Road on Monday afternoon. Kalaskar said, “A few passers-by saw a man hanging from a tree near the Katraj Park and alerted the police. A police team brought him down and took him to Sassoon hospital. Police also checked his pockets to establish his identity, but we did not find any ID card on him. He is around 35 years’ old.” In another case, a 36-year-old man was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his rented flat in Katraj late on Monday afternoon. “He used to work as a driver of light commercial vehicles and cars. He was at home for the past one month without work. He was unmarried and stayed alone. The incident came to light when his friend went to his house to deliver a lunch box. We searched his flat but did not find a suicide note,” Kalaskar said. The third case took place at Sukhsagarnagar area of Katraj. “The man stayed in a rented flat and did odd jobs. He stayed alone. He did not answer calls from his friends, so they went to his flat to check on him. They found him hanging and called the police,” Kalaskar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-men-found-hanging-in-separate-incidents-at-katraj/articleshow/82721662.cms||---
---||Patna||Covid cases on decline but govt should not lower guard, says AIIMS-Patna director||PATNA: The second wave of the Covid 19 pandemic may be on the wane in the state, given the number of new cases falling and the rate of recovery rising. The decline shows a positive impact of the measures taken by the state government such as the lockdown, strengthening of the healthcare system and undertaking immunisation drive to cover a large part of the population. Children, though, still stand a high risk as there is no vaccination available for them so far. The medical fraternity, however, believes that the state should not lower its guard against viral infection. Instead, it needs to continue with the screening of the rural masses through testing and tracing of both Covid suspects and those non-Covid persons having other complications which could prove fatal, if went undiagnosed and untreated. "We have faced the worst in the country's history and now can heave a sigh of some relief with no scenes of the rush for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. However, the emergence of other problems such as black fungus, post-Covid ailments and cardiac troubles still keep the doctors on alert," said the national president-elect of the Indian Medical Association Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh. He also expressed concern over the non-immunisation of a large population of children which places them in the highest risk group. He said as some states like Bengal, Kerala and Maharashtra are still in the grip of a severe pandemic, all states needed to remain alert. "If the third wave strikes, our children could be the most affected and hence all schools should remain closed till the situation improves," said Sahjanand. The director of AIIMS-Patna, Dr PK Singh, said different demographic conditions have played a role in the rise and decline in the cases of viral infections. He said there is every possibility of a third wave that might strike with new symptoms. "Virus gets stronger by undergoing mutations and looks for new hosts to infect and survive and it warrants the need to be watchful," he further said. "It was the severity and higher rate of transmission that the second wave took the country off guard. If our children fell victim in the next wave it would require many changes in the management of the health facilities since children could not be kept in isolation and separate from their parents," added the AIIMS director. Dr Bimal Karak, former superintendent of PMCH, said the state needed to observe the trend of the Covid infection at least for a month before drawing any conclusion about the rise or decline of the second wave. He, however, feared the appearance of hundreds of cases of black fungus in Bihar and many other states where patients remained on oxygen support and were given steroids for a long time as a major challenge before the country in the coming few weeks. "There were only 22 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) last year but the figure jumped to over 5,000 in the country in patients of the second wave of the covid infection," said Karak. Several untreated black fungus cases in remote rural areas, having no specialists, may become fatal. "After attaining its peak, the second wave of Covid is now on the decline. However, one of the worst effects of this virus was triggering myocardial infarction (heart attack)," said Dr BP Singh, head of the cardiology department of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences ( IGIMS), Patna. "As the virus severely affected the immune system, about 40 to 50% of patients both in hospitals and under home isolation died due to heart attack," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-cases-on-decline-but-govt-should-not-lower-guard-experts/articleshow/82719290.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Lockdown-hit bizman turns burglar, held for six offences||HYDERABAD: Two burglars, who targeted only houses of businessmen from Rajasthan, were nabbed at LB Nagar Crossroads on Monday morning. Police recovered 186 grams of gold ornaments and other valuables, worth Rs 14.3 lakh, from their possession. The Rachakonda police claimed they were involved in five burglaries and an attempted break-in at an ATM kiosk. Police said Kishore Chowdhary, who had to shut his business due to lockdown, started doing glass fitting contract works in the city, but was not satisfied with his earnings.  He hatched a plan with one Arjun Singh, a carpenter, to commit burglaries. The two, who are natives of Rajasthan, reportedly decided to target only houses of businessmen from Rajasthan. “Kishore was aware that his four acquaintances had gone to Pali in Rajasthan to attend a marriage. Taking advantage of their absence, Kishore and Arjun targeted the houses late in the night and cut the maindoor lock with a hacksaw blade and grills with a cutter,” Central Crime Station (CCS), LB Nagar, police said. They said the duo stole a bike from Vanasthalipuram, changed its registration number and used it to commit other offences. Kishore gave some money to Arjun and kept the remaining money and stolen goods at his rented accommodation. CCS sleuths along with Chaitanyapuri police analysed CCTV footages and, with the help of technical support, apprehended the duo at LB Nagar X Roads around 9am on Monday.

Peacock, national bird of India, is listed under Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972 and draws the same sections and punishment which are imposed for poaching tigers and leopards. The birds were found dead on Sunday morning, but forest officials kept the matter under wraps for more than 24 hours. “Perhaps this may be due to the back-to-back poisoning incidents. On May 15, 10 blackbucks, including two pregnant animals, were poisoned in Taroda forest range under Buldhana forest division,” said Akola environment activist Sheikh Mohammed Sheikh Makbul. Deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Arjuna KR confirmed 18 birds were found dead in Barshitakli forest range after feeding on poisoned-laced wheat grain. The birds were found dead on a dry lake bed surrounded by forest from all sides. “Post mortem report also confirmed that the birds died due to poisoning. No arrests have been made till now and we are searching for the culprits, who may be habitual offenders,” said Arjuna. RFO SB Dange said, “We will catch the culprits soon. A preliminary offence report (POR) has been registered against unidentified men. This is the first such incident that has come to light.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/peacocks-peahens-among-18-birds-poisoned-in-akola/articleshow/82719271.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kochi||Notices to pvt hosps unable to allocate 50% Covid beds||Kochi: A majority of private hospitals have expressed their inability to reserve 50% of beds for Covid treatment. Upset with this, the local administration has started issuing show cause notices to several hospitals for violating the government order issued to cater to Covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization. Private hospital managements contend that many hospitals in Kerala are small and medium hospitals that don’t have the infrastructure, staff or facility to earmark separately for Covid patients. Many hospitals have only a single entry and exit point, making it difficult to ensure separate entrances for Covid and non-Covid patients, nor do they have separate laundry or elevator facilities. Another major concern is lack of adequate oxygen availability. Shortage of oxygen, even for a few hours, was reported from a few private hospitals in the state. Workload of healthcare workers has increased and there is an immense shortage of nursing staff both in Covid and non-Covid care. Besides, many hospitals don’t have enough stock of medicines to treat Covid patients. “The hospitals which are big and have separate blocks or buildings can easily keep aside 50% beds for Covid patients. But many hospitals don’t have such infrastructure facilities to admit Covid and non-Covid patients separately. Mixing Covid and non-Covid patients would be a greater disaster and community spread will be much more rampant than what it is now,” said Dr M I Sahadulla, chairman and managing director, KIMS Healthcare Group and president, Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter). “When it comes to Covid patients, it is not just about increasing or reserving beds. It is also about ensuring that Covid and non-Covid patients don’t come in contact so that hospitals don’t become a Covid super-spreader facility,” said However, government officials in the districts that are seeing a surge in cases are not impressed with these arguments. Upset with the private hospitals, they are now warning of stringent action against the hospitals under the Disaster Management Act. “All hospitals are willing to treat Covid patients. Some hospitals that have infrastructure and staff strength are willing to admit upto 70% Covid patients. But the government should also understand the limitations of many other hospitals and allow them to admit Covid patients depending on the facilities available there,” said Dr Gopikumar P, secretary, IMA, Kerala chapter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/notices-to-pvt-hosps-unable-to-allocate-50-covid-beds/articleshow/82719327.cms||Preetu Nair

Of the 392 deaths reported in Noida since March last year, 180 were added between May 1 and 16. According to government data, the first half of May accounted for 46% of the total number of deaths in the district. The figure accounts for only those deaths that were notified by hospitals as Covid fatalities. With 121 deaths, April saw 31% of the total deaths. In fact, the period between April 1 and May 16 accounts for 77% of the all Covid deaths in Noida. Between March 2020 and March 2021, the district recorded 91 fatalities. Similarly, in Ghaziabad, 74% of the total Covid deaths in the district were reported between April 1 and May 16. In the first 16 days of May, 169 deaths were recorded. The overall death toll in Ghaziabad is 375 and the fatalities recorded between May 1 and May 16 makes up 45% of that. From March 2020 to March 2021, the district reported 102 deaths. “The data is self-explanatory. It clearly shows the severity of the infection in April and the first half of May,” said an official in the Ghaziabad health department. “There are 14-15 days left for this month and the district is reporting deaths daily. If the trend continues, the death count for this month may go past the 200 mark,” the official added. Explaining the current trend, Brigadier Dr Rakesh Gupta (retd), director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, said: “ This time, we are noticing that for some patients, the condition is deteriorating suddenly. The oxygen saturation level drops suddenly after a few days of infection and then it becomes difficult to manage the patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/nearly-50-of-covid-deaths-in-noida-gzb-in-first-half-of-may/articleshow/82721689.cms||Snehil Sinha

The decision was taken after a student lost his father to Covid four days ago. In the last academic year, the school had waived 25% fees of all students because of the pandemic. School board member Damodar Goyal said, “To support a student who lost his earning parent to Covid, the school has decided to waive fees for three years so that the student’s family is not burdened with the additional trauma. These are difficult times and we don’t want to hamper the studies of any student due to fees. We had already waived 25% fees last year.” This is seen as a welcome step by the parents’ association. Sunil Yadav, spokesperson of All Rajasthan Parents Forum said, “This is positive news and a welcoming act. We appreciate such efforts by the SMS School and request others to come forward and help such students. Recently, we lost one of our friends whose child also studies in a private school. We will request the school authorities to give some relaxation to the student’s family.” This trend has also been seen in many smaller schools too in the city where students come from economically weaker section (EWS). According to School Shiksha Pariwar president Anil Sharma, many smaller schools where fees is collected in few thousands have already implemented this order. Many parents from EWS lost their jobs and businesses so schools are considering such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/school-to-forgo-fee-of-kids-who-lost-earning-parent-to-covid/articleshow/82721704.cms||---
---||Madurai||Resignation from post entails forfeiture of past service: HC||Madurai: Observing that resignation from a service or post entails forfeiture of past service, as per Rule 23(i) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978, the Madras high court has set aside the order of a single judge who had allowed a petition seeking to disperse the terminal benefits of a retired government teacher by taking into account his past service in the postal department.V Thangaraj was appointed as a postal assistant in 1983 and subsequently promoted as sub-post master. He resigned from the postal department in 1997 and joined as secondary grade teacher during the same year. He retired from service on superannuation in 2014.He had submitted representations to the authorities to consider his past service in the postal department along with the service rendered by him as a teacher and consequently, compute the pensionary benefits. Since his request was rejected, he filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that Thangaraj had resigned from the postal department and the order accepting the resignation clearly indicates that he is not entitled for any terminal benefits. The judges observed that Thangaraj cannot bring his case under Rule 26(9) of Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, which deals with what is commonly known in service jurisprudence as ‘technical resignation’. This resignation is acceptable in cases where the government servants apply for post in the same or other departments through proper channels and on selection, they are asked to resign the previous post for administrative reasons.The judges observed that in the case on hand, the postal department has not treated the resignation as a ‘technical formality’, but treated it as a normal resignation making it clear that Thangaraj is not entitled for any benefits.The judges said that the case would clearly fall within the ambit of Rule 23(i) of Tamil Nadu Pension Rules which states that resignation from a service or post entails forfeiture of past service. Hence, the judges allowed the appeal preferred by the state government and set aside the order of the single judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/resignation-from-post-entails-forfeiture-of-past-service-hc/articleshow/82719321.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Madurai||Shopkeepers told to vacate from Srirangam temple||Madurai: Observing that every endeavour should be made to protect the heritage value of temples and its properties, the Madras high court dismissed a batch of appeals and directed the shopkeepers to vacate their shops which were set up in a mandapam belonging to the Ranganatha Swamy temple at Srirangam in Trichy district before May 30. If they fail to do so, the authorities shall evict them and remove all the belongings and any structures erected by them and the cost of such eviction proceedings shall be recovered from the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers had filed a batch of petitions before the HC Madurai bench challenging the eviction notices issued by the temple authorities and the same was dismissed by the single judge in 2018. Challenging the order of the single judge, the shopkeepers have filed the present batch of appeals. The HR and CE department submitted that following the fire accident which occurred inside the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple in Madurai district in 2018, the government had taken a policy decision to vacate all the shops situated inside major temples in the state. Based on this, eviction notices were issued to the appellants. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the argument of the appellants that they are carrying on business away from the temple precincts cannot be countenanced. The judges observed that the space in which the appellants are carrying on their business is stated to be a mandapam and obviously there is heritage value attached to the same. Being part of the temple property, the authorities are bound to protect the same from any disfigurement or destruction. The mandapam, which was constructed several 100 years ago, was never intended to be put to use for commercial purposes. The judges said that though the appellants have filed an undertaking to vacate the premises by December 31, 2018, it is not clear as to how they were permitted to continue their possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shopkeepers-told-to-vacate-from-srirangam-temple/articleshow/82719336.cms||Kaushik Kannan

All the wholesale mandis in the district are closed for 12 days till May 23 due to severe restrictions imposed by the Nashik district administration. Nashik Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), the largest wholesale mandi of vegetables in Nashik, where around 500 tonne of vegetables are auctioned daily, has been closed for the past four to five days. As a result of which, the farmers are unable to sell their produce in the mandis, which has affected the supply of vegetables in retail markets in the city. Prices of vegetables like brinjal, okra, cauliflower, chilli, cucumber etc have increased from 15% to 40% during the last two to three days due to short of supply.“Earlier, supply was more as the Nashik APMC was functioning. But it is getting difficult to get vegetables, which has led to the marginal rise in vegetable prices in retail markets,” said Bapu Malode, a vegetable vendor. The retail prices of various vegetables have increased by Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg in the retail markets in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/prices-increase-in-nashik-due-to-vegetable-supply-shortage/articleshow/82715155.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

His daughter R Vimala submitted an application seeking compassionate appointment and the same was rejected by the authorities.Vimala filed a petition before HC Madurai bench but it was dismissed by the single judge observing that the rejection order does not call for interference and that grant of employment on compassionate ground is not a source of recruitment nor a bonanza.Challenging the order, Vimala filed the present appeal. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that on closer scrutiny of the facts and considering the circumstances which are prevailing even as on date, they are inclined to grant appropriate relief to the appellant.The judges said that it appears that the appellant has been requesting her step mother Kamala to grant ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) to her, so that her application for compassionate appointment can be processed. But Kamala refused to do so and dragged on the matter for about more than seven years.The judges said that the appellant had granted NOC for her step brother Muruganantham to apply for compassionate appointment in 2007 and the same was rejected by the authorities.In this factual background, the appellant had once again requested the authorities to consider her case by and the same was rejected in 2016. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madras-hc-consider-womans-plea-for-compassionate-appointment/articleshow/82719373.cms||---

Soon after the government imposed the lockdown on May 12, the migrant labour force employed with various projects, especially power, have started relocating. As a result, the projects are missing their deadlines, forcing the authorities to reschedule them for completion in 2022. “Of the total 6,500 labourers working with Yadadri Thermal Power Project (YTPP) at Damarcherla in Nalgonda district, 5,000 have left for their home states. Similarly, of about 2,500 workers in Manuguru Thermal Power Plant, only 300 to 400 are working now. These workers belong to Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand,” Telangana Genco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao told TOI on Monday. Officials said though the workers were not infected with Covid-19 and arrangements were made for their stay, they had decided to go back in view of the last year’s bitter experience. “The state government has also assured them of full support but were keen on going back,” Genco officials said. Genco commenced works on two major power plants apart from enhancing the capacity of units like KTPS to augment power generation capacity to meet the state’s requirements. Work on 4,000 MW capacity YTPP was launched in October 2017, but it missed the deadline last year due to Covid-19 and now again in the second wave. Though Manuguru plant works began in 2015, the fourth unit work is getting delayed due to workers’ exodus. Of the four units (270 MW each), three have been commissioned in the last two years. “Works on the two major thermal power projects got delayed mainly over getting environmental clearances, NGT cases and other mandatory permissions, a senior official of the project wing said. “Now with the first and second wave of Covid-19, works have been delayed further. After the lockdown is lifted, we are planning to reschedule the dates for completion and commissioning of the projects,” the official added. Apart from the workforce, arrival of turbines, motors, boilers and other equipment from various parts of the country was also hit by the second wave and lockdown in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and other states, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/migrants-leave-power-plants-trip-on-deadlines/articleshow/82723984.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||India||Led by Mamata & MLAs, hundreds Gherao CBI Zonal Headquarters||KOLKATA: “Arrest me too.” These three words from Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to CBI DIG Akhilesh Kumar at the agency’s 14th-floor office in Nizam Palace summed up the Trinamool’s response to the CBI arrest of three of its senior leaders, with the party pulling out all stops to portray it as “an act of vengeance after the humiliating assembly poll loss”. “Our stand is very clear: we have opposed the arrests and their legality as they have been effected without the assembly speaker’s permission,” Trinamool Congress leader and advocate Anindya Raut said, explaining the CM’s dare to the CBI. Word soon went out to the hundreds of Trinamool supporters outside, whose numbers swelled as word spread of Banerjee’s arrival at the CBI office at 10.47am. Anti-CBI and anti-BJP slogans rent the air and bricks flew in the direction of central forces guarding Nizam Palace. Monday’s drama started as early as 6.30am, when CBI officers walked into Kamarhati MLA Madan Mitra’s Bhowanipore home to bring him to Nizam Palace. Three other leaders — state cabinet ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee — were picked up over the next two-and-a-half hours as CBI officers initially said they were taking the politicians for “questioning”, which changed to “arrests” an hour later. Banerjee stepped into the CBI’s eastern zonal headquarters within minutes of the official “arrest” announcement. A posse of Trinamool leaders — Beliaghata MLA Paresh Pal, Kasba MLA and minister Javed Khan, Behala East MLA Ratna Chatterjee, Rashbehari MLA Debashis Kumar, Debra MLA Humayun Kabir, Chowringhee MLA Nayana Bandyopadhyay, Serampore MP Kalyan Banerjee, Kolkata South MP Mala Roy and Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen — arrived within an hour with aides and lawyers and camped in the visitors’ room on the 14th floor. State industries minister described the CBI arrest as “a desperate act of political vendetta”. “BJP waited for six years for this day. Bengal’s voters have rejected the party but it is so shameless that it refuses to accept people’s verdict and goes on playing these petty games,” he added. Banerjee first got medicines for Mukherjee, Hakim and Mitra and sent word to the 74-year-old Mukherjee not to remove his mask at any point during the interrogation. Outside, however, Covid-safety norms were tossed aside as angry Trinamool supporters converged to demand the “immediate release” of the Trinamool leaders. A few of the demonstrators set fire to tyres and pelted bricks and wooden planks at the CRPF personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/led-by-cm-mlas-hundreds-gherao-cbi-zonal-headquarters/articleshow/82726257.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

While the firemen were busy clearing debris and the linemen restoring the power supply till late Monday evening, power supply was not restored in many rural areas, besides some town areas. To add to the woes of the residents, taps in almost all areas in Bicholim taluka ran dry. Sources in the PWD stated that water supply was hit due to power failure and will be restored once the power supply is restored. Bicholim MLA and speaker Rajesh Patnekar visited affected areas to take stock of the losses. He said the government would extend financial help to those affected. Bicholim fire station office received altogether 60 calls including damages to houses due to tree falls, damages to power lines and poles, blocking of road access and other rescue calls. While the work of estimating the actual loss is in progress, a primary loss of around Rs 30 lakh has been estimated due to damage to houses due to falling of trees.  Many houses were damaged in areas like Sal, Surla, Gauthan, Chorao, Mayem, Usap, Narvem, Pilgao, Vathadev, Sakhali, Harvalem, Kudnem, Navelim, Nanora, Tikhazan, Harijan Wada, Bordem, Amona and surrounding areas. So far, damage to 25 houses has been reported. Bicholim PI Mahesh Gadekar along with his staff was also engaged in removing trees and obstacles on houses and roads.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had received 60 ventilators under PM Cares three-four weeks ago but without the necessary equipment for installation. All the ventilators received are lying idle as they are yet to be installed by the company concerned. The officials of the NMC’s health department said the civic administration has sent a fresh letter to the company, directing it to provide necessary spare parts and install the ventilators at the earliest. “We received the ventilators from the central government under PM Cares funds, but without the equipment like connectors and stabilisers, which are required for the installation,” said health officials.Of the 60 ventilators, 45 are to be installed at Bytco hospital of the civic body, while the remaining are to be installed at other hospitals. Bytco hospital has a total of 21 functional ventilators, while there are 15 ventilators at Zakir Hussain hospital. Last year too, the civic body had received a total of 56 ventilators from the Centre under the PM Cares, but 10 of them were defunct and could not be installed. It had taken almost three months for the repairs and installation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/60-pm-cares-ventilators-yet-to-be-installed-in-nashik-hospitals/articleshow/82715226.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kochi||FACT to provide oxygen to hospitals||Kochi: The Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) has ordered five PSA oxygen plants to augment the oxygen availability amid the acute pandemic crisis. The technology used in these plants is PSA (pressure swing adsorption), which generates oxygen from atmospheric air. FACT, a central public-sector undertaking under the administrative control of the department of fertilizers, has ordered four plants for Kerala and one for Uttar Pradesh, which is facing an acute shortage of medical oxygen. The oxygen plants for Kerala are planned based on the requirement from the Government of Kerala. Of these, two units are intended for hospitals in Ernakulam district, one for Kozhikode and one for Kannur.  With this, each of the government hospitals under the project will have a captive oxygen generation facility and will help in strengthening the public health system. The company also provided oxygen cylinders to Vadavukode-Puthercruz panchayat for upgrading their FLT for treatment of Covid patients. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fact-to-provide-oxygen-to-hospitals/articleshow/82719392.cms||---
---||Goa||Cyclone rain aids early mating of balloon frogs||Keri: Though the first rainfall brought by the cyclone created much upheaval in coastal Goa, it has aided early mating of the Indian balloon frog, leading to it laying numerous eggs in the state’s forested areas. The heavy downpour in the forests of the Western Ghats of Goa has helped the amphibians to breathe new life. In the forest of Sacorda, in the vicinity of the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary, the Indian balloon frog came out for breeding and attracted a female to mate with its vociferous call. The female has laid down numerous eggs during the same night. When these eggs are hatched, tad poles will emerge into the waterpool. “The Indian balloon frog spends the most of its time underground during the summer and winter seasons. When it rains heavily, the frog emerges out for breeding thereby attracting a female to mate. This narrow-mouthed frog is found in both forests and agricultural areas and has a round body with a small head and a short blunt snout,” wildlifer Ramesh Zarmekar said. The frog is known as the Indian balloon frog as its body takes the shape of a balloon when it feels threatened. Thus this makes it look much larger than it actually is, discouraging predators from attacking it. Generally, males call in chorus during the breeding season. During the rainy season, it relishes on insects. But during summer and winter, with large digging appendages of its feet, it burrows through the wet soil, where it can live for a long period without feeding. Vithoba Gawade, a wildlifer from Caranzol of Sattari, said, “During the rainy season these frogs come out for breeding but get killed on the roads. These frogs are the indicators of the health of the fragile ecosystem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyclone-rain-aids-early-mating-of-balloon-frogs/articleshow/82721870.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Hyderabad||Micronutrients increase IQ, reduce anaemia in children: NIN study||Hyderabad: Providing micronutrients to young children helped them gain intelligence quotient (IQ) by three to six points over a period of eight months, reveals a research study by city nutrition scientists. “Adding micronutrients led to gains in children’s language of about six points (equivalent to IQ points), in social-emotional development of about 4.5 points, and in inhibitory control of about three points,” Dr Sylvia Fernandez Rao, senior scientist, National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), said. Dr Sylvia was the lead investigator of Project Grow Smart, a study conducted by the NIN, Hyderabad, in collaboration with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA in Nalgonda district. The result of the study was published in the scientific publication, Journal of Nutrition. She said the study found that adding a multiple micronutrient powder to the first bites of the meal in Anganwadi centres resulted in a striking reduction in anaemia among three to six-year-old children. As part of the study, the selected Anganwadi centres were randomized into two groups - a group got micronutrients (which included iron, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin A and vitamin B2) or placebo group (only vitamin B6). The study revealed that after eight months, anaemia reduced from 46% to 10.1% among children who received the added micronutrient bites, compared to a 47% to 35.5% reduction among children without the added micronutrients (placebo group), with corresponding improvements in iron status. “These are significant gains. These gains in children’s health and neuro-behavioural development means that the children are better prepared to learn and to take advantage of opportunities in primary school and beyond, advancing human capital development,” she added. This can be a cost-effective way to improve the health and neuro-behavioural development of more than 2.5 crore preschool age children (3-6 years) that Anganwadi centres serve throughout the country, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/micronutrients-increase-iq-reduce-anaemia-in-children-nin-study/articleshow/82719391.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Seven dead, 9 hurt as ‘Tauktae’ leaves a trail of damage and disruption||MUMBAI: Seven people died and nine were injured across Maharashtra as the extremely severe cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae’ came within a distance of just 120 km from the Mumbai coast on Monday. As many as 12,500 people were evacuated from Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts, and over 2,500 structures were damaged. Raigad reported the highest count of 4 deaths and also the most damage and evacuations. As the storm raged, PM Narendra Modi spoke to CM Uddhav Thackeray on conditions in the state. The cyclonic storm was more severe than initially predicted and intensified rapidly, becoming stronger when it approached the Mumbai coast. It is perhaps the only “extremely severe cyclone” to have affected Mumbai in recent memory, with windspeeds reaching 108 km and the heaviest rain recorded in May in the city’s history. “In the next 24 hours, when the cyclone strikes Gujarat, some parts of Mumbai may continue to experience gusty winds along with rain,” said IMD’s Shubhangi Bhute. Experts said the storm had intensified rapidly from a “very severe cyclonic storm” to an “extremely severe cyclonic storm.” While the cyclonic storm led to tree-falls and transport disruptions in the city, Mumbai was perhaps spared more extensive damage on account of the lockdown. The BMC reported 479 incidents of trees and branches falling. Of these, 156 were reported in the island city, 78 in eastern suburbs and 245 in the western suburbs. Twenty-six incidents of house or slab collapse were reported, with eight people injured in three incidents in Chembur, Andheri and Borivli; 17 incidents of short circuit were reported. BMC officials said 20 locations saw major flooding across the city, including Mahalaxmi, Hindmata and Dadar TT in the island city, Andheri subway, Lokhandwala, Malad subway, Malwani and Oshiwara bus depot in the western suburbs and Ghatkopar and Chembur in the eastern suburbs. The cyclone forced Mumbai airport to suspend flights from 11 am to 10 pm. Seven flights were diverted, while airlines had cancelled 34 arrivals and 22 departures, said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd spokesperson at 8 pm. The Bandra-Worli sea link was shut, and the BMC kept citizens updated on route alterations via social media. Suburban services on Central Railway and Western Railway were hit due to strong winds which led to tree-falling on tracks, besides materials like banners and fibre sheets flying on railway lines. On CR, there was a tree fall incident on the Kalyan-bound slow corridor between Ghatkopar and Vikhroli. Sewri-Cotton Green reported a similar incident. WR services were disrupted on the fast corridor between Churchgate and Marine Lines. Harbour line services were suspended for one hour between CSMT and Wadala road due to waterlogging. A total of 109 BEST buses faced breakdowns due to torrential rain and waterlogging. A fisherman from Mahim Macchimar colony drowned, while 14 others got stuck deep in the Arabian Sea. Eight fishermen from Khar Danda were also reported missing. While BMC officials said that barring minor leakages, there was no major damage to any of its jumbo Covid centres evacuated ahead of the cyclone, power infrastructure in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg was impacted, and Covid hospitals there are running on back-up power. Palghar collector Dr Manek Gursal directed all retail petrol pumps to keep aside 2,000 litres of diesel and 500 litres of petrol daily for the next few days, to help operate generators in case of a power cut. Dedicated Covid hospitals and Covid care centres have been told to switch to generators to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to ventilators. Hospitals have been directed to procure the fuel from any retail petrol pump in the district. Though a decision on stocking up on diesel and petrol will be taken on Wednesday, pumps have been told not to sell the quota without orders from the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-7-dead-9-hurt-as-tauktae-leaves-a-trail-of-damage-and-disruption/articleshow/82721901.cms||---

Many relatives had been compelled to run pillar to post to arrange for the Amphotericin B family of drugs, which is in short supply.Thakare issued the letter on May 15 to drug distributors and stockists after patients’ kin started reaching the collector office with prescription issued by different doctors and hospitals for the injection. This is the second time relatives thronged the collector office for medicines in last one month. Before this, during Covid second wave peak, patients’ kin used to be a common sight at the collector office seeking and inquiring about Remdesivir and Tocilizumab.Last time, Thakare had to issue a video message to hospital administrations, doctors and drug distributors not to send relatives in search of Remdesivir to the doorsteps of chemists, distributors and stockists with prescriptions. This time, the collector had to issue a strict letter in view of the repeated harassment of relatives of patients.Thakare’s letter underlines the fact that Amphotericin B injection is not controlled or regulated by the collector office, but clarified that stockists and distributors have to ensure data of purchase and sale of the anti-fungal drug has to be relayed to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) twice daily. The collector has also strictly warned stockists and distributors against hoarding or black-marketing.In a follow up action, FDA too issued a similar caution to drug distributors and hospital managements, stating they must ensure relatives are not harassed due to shortage of Amphotericin B drug.Hetal Thakkar, secretary of Nagpur District Chemist and Druggist Association, said some of the retailers are unfortunately furnishing wrong information to relatives, who rush to the collector office believing the rumour. He also issued a message to his executive committee members through social media to alert their local members that the collector office or FDA are not distributing Amphotericin B and so no wrong information must be circulated.Sunil Balani of Jai Bole Medical Stores said a small quantity of Amphotericin B has come to the city, which is being sold to only bonafide customers with proper prescription from doctors or hospitals only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-warns-hosps-chemists-against-sending-patients-kin-in-search-of-ampho-b/articleshow/82719390.cms||Soumitra Bose

Four of his family members sustained injuries and were shifted to a private hospital in Hyderguda for treatment. The four injured are said to be stable. The victim, G Gowrinath, died on the spot. His twin brother Badrinath, 38, wife Veena Manasa, 33, and children Lokesh, 11, and Vignesh, 8, were rescued by firefighters from the first floor of the building. The incident is said to have occurred at around 3.45 am at a house which has a ground floor plus two floors. After receiving a call on 100, three fire tenders, one each from Assembly, Secunderabad, and Gowligudda fire stations, were pressed into service. A skylift fire tender was also rushed to the spot to assist in the rescue operation. “Within five minutes after receiving a call, a fire tender reached the spot. As it is a duplex building, the entire house was engulfed in fire. All the family members were hiding in a washroom on the first floor,” said K Chandrasekhar, station fire officer, Assembly. He said that it took them over an hour to douse the flames and to rescue all the family members. “All four were rescued using ladder and stairs,” he added. The fire officials said that an electric short-circuit could be the cause of the fire accident. However, a probe was ordered to know the exact reason for the accident. They said that the fire might have started on the ground floor and travelled upwards through the staircase inside. The body of Gowrinath was recovered and shifted to Osmania General Hospital morgue for autopsy. While Manasa and Badrinath are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Hyderguda, both Lokesh and Vignesh were shifted to a private children’s hospital from the hospital in Hyderguda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-charred-to-death-as-house-catches-fire/articleshow/82719395.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Create speciall paediatric infra to tackle ‘third wave’, hospitals told||Nagpur: The government and private medical colleges and hospitals, along with AIIMS, have been instructed to create special paediatric infrastructure for the anticipated third wave from July. A paediatric task force was also created which held its first meeting chaired by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar on Monday. It’s learnt, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), Daga Hospital, AIIMS, Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital have been asked to start putting in place a special paediatric infrastructure comprising high dependency unit (HDU) bed with separate oxygen supply facility, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with multiple ventilator support and neonatal care unit (NICU) in each of the institution at the earliest as ‘short-term goal’. Also, stress was given on more usage of tele-consultation for rural paediatric patients from a centralised facility. City’s top paediatricians would guide health workers at the remote places in the district on managing earlier or milder symptoms and early referrals. Concern was expressed over limited number of paediatricians. Training of staff nurses and other support staff was also discussed at length. Represented by respective deans and head of departments, the government hospitals and college along with the leading private practitioners like Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala, Dr Uday Bodhankar, Dr Satish Deopujari and others gave suggestions on ways to tackle the anticipated third wave. “In the earlier stage, the involvement of children was less than 2% but the current projection is 5% to 10 % of the age group between 0-18 years will be infected and have more symptoms than in the past. A few of them may slip into critical stage,” said an official source. GMCH, represented by dean Dr Sudhir Gupta and HoD Dr Dipty Jain, informed Kumar that a dedicated paediatric ward has already been created and the facilities would be ramped up. IGGMCH, represented by head of paediatric department Dr Chandrakant Bokade, informed about the plan of creating both PICU and NICU along with high dependency unit beds. AIIMS, represented by senior paediatric consultants, spoke on preparedness for creating a 200-bed facility along with NICU, PICU and high dependency unit beds with attached oxygen facility. Sources stated that there would be some long-term preparations too apart from creating special paediatric units, setting up oxygen supply and ventilators. “We are contemplating a major challenge in the months of August, September and October when viral infections and seasonal diseases may launch a multipronged attack on the health infrastructure,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/create-speciall-paediatric-infra-to-tackle-third-wave-hospitals-told/articleshow/82721824.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay devises way to reuse exhaled air for oxygen||MUMBAI: A team of alumni, students and professors from IIT-Bombay has come up with an innovative way to reuse exhaled air to enhance the life of oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 patients. The proposed method will help bring down the average use of over nine oxygen cylinders in a day for a critical patient to one or two, they said. The team has designed the prototype of a breathing device called ‘The reBreather’, which facilitates recirculation of exhaled breath by scrubbing out carbon dioxide and blending in fresh oxygen. It will also help minimise wastage of oxygen in the current system at a time when hospitals are facing an acute shortage. A healthy person breathes in 5 litre per minute of air, which corresponds to about 1 litre/ minute of oxygen being inhaled. Of this, approximately 0.25 litre/minute of oxygen is consumed. “Covid-19 patients in intensive care can be given up to 50 litre of oxygen per minute, with only 1-1.5 litre being really utilised. Consequently, around 90% of oxygen is lost to the atmosphere. The bottled oxygen could be used efficiently in a closed (or semi-closed) loop system, which we have demonstrated using the reBreather,” said professor Santosh Noronha from the chemical engineering department at IIT-Bombay. Releasing a lot of oxygen also results in the oxygen concentration going up in closed spaces, which could be a reason for the increased fire instances in Covid hospitals, said Noronha. The prototype has been designed with inputs from anaesthesiologists and intensivists but has been tested informally on healthy volunteers. The clinical trials in a controlled set-up are pending and are likely to take time. The institute has therefore released the design in open source to demonstrate the practicality of the science behind it. While designing the prototype cost the team around Rs 10,000, it can be significantly brought down in large-scale industrial deployment. The institute has now invited engineers and manufacturers to adopt, replicate or even modify the design for better scalability. The researchers used medical grade soda lime for carbon dioxide absorption in the reBreather and rely on its changing colour to see if the absorption capacity is exhausted. The appearance of the soda lime needs to be frequently monitored and needs to be replaced with fresh soda lime from time to time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-b-devises-way-to-reuse-exhaled-air-for-o2/articleshow/82724041.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kochi||Kerala: Tourist buses converted to ambulances||KOCHI: The bane of the tourism sector seems to have become a boon for the Covid control activities. Many tour operators in the state who had to keep their vehicles off the road for the past one year are converting their mini buses into ambulances. With the requirement for hospitalization of Covid patients increasing day by day, there has been a dearth of ambulances for shifting them to hospitals. “I have already converted my mini bus into an ambulance and now it is operating for Jagratha Samithi Ambunad, a volunteers’ group who work for shifting Covid patients in Kizhakkambalam panchayat, free of cost. The Samithi will cover the fuel bills,” said M A Abdul Nasser, proprietor of Blue Line Tours and Travels, Pukkattupady, Aluva. “Besides providing the ambulance, I also offer my service as a driver free of cost. It had been months since we could conduct services as the tourism sector faced back-to-back crises. The debt on account of non-payment of loans availed for buying the vehicles, their taxes, insurance, etc, are accumulating. Anyway, my vehicles are not plying. So, I decided to dedicate one of my vehicles for a noble cause,” he said. Travel operators in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram districts also are converting their vehicles into ambulances. “One of my mini buses was converted into an ambulance recently. We don’t demand any rental from those availing the service. If they are capable of paying the charges, they can do it and it will help me pay the fuel bill and driver’s wages,” said S Shajahan, owner, Taj Mahal Tours and Travels, Balaramapuram, Thiruvananthapuram. “It is under the aegis Karunaya Drivers Helpline, a charitable organization formed for helping tourists vehicles’ drivers in south India, that my vehicle conducts the charity. Many people in other parts of the state are planning to emulate our model,” he said. The only demand put forward by the tour operators is that the government should write off the road tax of their vehicles which conduct free services as ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tourist-buses-converted-to-ambulances/articleshow/82719410.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Amphoterecin B, which is primarily required to treat mucormycosis (or black fungus), in their respective districts.“An order has been issued by the commissioner asking us to monitor the distribution of the doses available in the market and medical shops. The doses should be equitably distributed only through the hospitals treating the patients,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said. The order mentioned that the number of mucormycosis cases was on the rise and there was a shortage of the required medicine. The government is buying the medicine for the hospitals that are treating such patients. However, there had been a demand from the district collectors for the making the drug available to the patients outside the government set up. The commissioner of health services issued an order on Monday in which it has asked the district collector to monitor the distribution. They must ensure that doses for a maximum of two days are given to every patient. This is to make sure that everyone's immediate need is fulfilled. But this should be done through the respective hospitals only. He has also told the collector that if the doses were available in adequate numbers in the government hospitals and there is a demand from private hospitals, then the drugs could be given to the private hospitals on full payment. In Nashik there are more than 74 confirmed mucormycosis cases. Three people have already succumbed to the fungal infection.North Maha to get 10,000 vials of the drug soonThe state government will be providing 10,000 vials of Inj Amphotericin B Lipid Complex 50mg that are administered to mucormycosis patients. Currently, the drug is not available in the market and the relatives of mucormycosis patients are frantically looking for the medicine. The injections will be delivered to the Nashik circle (division) comprising Nashik, Dhule, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon and Nandubar districts. The data on mucormycosis patients is being collected from all the five districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/collector-to-monitor-mucormycosis-drug/articleshow/82715255.cms||Abhilash Botekar

A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai further directed that the medical examination be carried out in the presence of a judicial officer to be chosen by the chief justice of Telangana high court. Raju had undergone bypass surgery in December 2020. "The chief secretary, Andhra Pradesh, is directed to carry out this order forthwith and ensure that petitioner Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju is taken to and reaches the Army Hospital, Secunderabad, Telangana, today itself," the bench ordered. Never before has the SC ordered a politician facing heat from a state government to be medically examined by Army doctors in the presence of a judicial officer. Andhra Pradesh government’s counsel Dushyant Dave and V Giri agreed for the MP’s independent medical examination at Army Hospital even though they vehemently opposed Raju's admission and treatment in Army Hospital. Raju was provided with Y category security by Delhi High Court last year when he had apprehended threat to his life from his own party following his open criticism of the CM as well as the handling of the Covid-19 crisis in Andhra Pradesh. Appearing for Raju, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the YSR Congress government was wreaking vengeance against the rebel MP for being critical of the government and the party chief by slapping sedition cases not only against him but also against TV channels which had aired his interview critical of the ruling dispensation. The channels have also moved the SC seeking quashing of the FIRs. Rohatgi sought interim bail for his client for treatment. Raju's other counsel, B Adinarayan Rao, told the bench that around 40 police personnel picked up Raju from Hyderabad on Friday and drove 300 km to Guntur. He said while Raju was in judicial custody, police had employed third degree methods causing many injuries, which was recorded by the trial court in its order directing medical examination by both a government and a private hospital. Rohatgi said sedition charge had no basis as Raju had never given any speech inciting violence or rebellion against the state. Given the no objection from the AP government for a neutral medical board examining the petitioner, Justices Saran and Gavai ordered that Raju "shall forthwith be taken to Army Hospital, Secunderabad, for medical examination. The Y category security, provided under orders of the Delhi HC, shall escort Raju only till the Army Hospital and need not be present at the time of medical examination." It said the head of Army Hospital shall constitute a three-member medical board to examine Raju in the presence of a judicial officer, nominated by the Telangana HC CJ, and the entire process should be videographed and submitted to the SC. It said Raju will remain admitted in Army Hospital for treatment under judicial custody till further orders. The SC asked Raju to bear the expenses of his treatment. The court sought responses of the Andhra Pradesh government in two days to Raju's petition seeking quashing of the "frivolous" FIR lodged to wreak political vengeance. It asked Raju to respond to the reply of AP government by Thursday and posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-orders-army-med-board-to-examine-rebel-ysrc-mp/articleshow/82724054.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Also, many paid a heavy price for fulfilling their cravings for roadside food and bad eating habits.TOI spoke to doctors on how to move into normal life. They said citizens must follow doctor’s advise on routine health check ups and exercise regularly, in addition to following Covid-appropriate behaviour.Sengupta Hospital director Dr Shantanu Sengupta said the best thing would be to start exercises with healthy nutrition. “What we have learnt from the second wave is that good health matters a lot. Three things we must follow in addition to mask, distancing and hand hygiene are: Exercise one hour a day, eat healthy food and heed doctor’s regular health advisory,” he said.AIIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Shrigiriwar said people must avoid visiting roadside food stalls and prefer hygienic places when things become normal. “If we put our mask down in public places, very soon the third wave will catch up on us,” he said.OCHRI director Dr Anup Marar said the second wave has taught us to keep our immunity strong and make do with limited resources. “Our lifestyles have been streamlined in a minimalistic manner. This self-discipline needs to be continued for our own good,” he said.Dr Sadashiv Bhole, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said people should not jump with enthusiasm if restrictions are reduced and remain behave responsibly. “Till the society is irresponsible, all the medical infrastructure won’t help us. The main reason for transmission was social functions. Marriage ceremonies and funeral restrictions must continue. During relaxations we have to avoid this if we don’t want a third wave,” he said.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said this pandemic is basically a global problem and it will not subside the way people think. “New variants will keep emerging. There would be pockets of epidemics. An epidemic may occur in one city this month and in another in a different month. Those visiting known epidemic pockets must be careful and avoid travelling to those hotspots. As of now, there are a lot of mutants in India and that is the reason many countries have issue travel advisories. Nagpur is probably affected with a virulent variant. Evolution of virus is a continuous process. It will lead to different type of manifestation, as seen in first and second waves. So any new symptom should be an alarm for us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-lockdown-work-towards-good-immunity-health-check-ups-avoid-travel-to-hotspots/articleshow/82719404.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The Malegaon corporation that has 31 centres had only seven vaccination sites operational. According to deputy collector Ganesh Misal, who is the incident commander for the vaccination programme in Nashik district, the vaccination centres have been cut down because they were low on stock. “At this point in time, vaccination is being administered only to those aged 45 years and above. Also, since there are lower number of vaccines available the health officials have decided to shut the vaccination centres,” he said. When asked about the availability of the fresh stock of vaccination, deputy director of Nashik PB Gandal said it would be made available soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/only-40-vax-centres-operational/articleshow/82715274.cms||---

---||Nagpur||2nd wave bidding goodbye: Not many in same family testing positive||NAGPUR: With the number of Covid cases going down, the rate of transmission and interactivity too has dropped to a large extent. Doctors and experts in laboratories and diagnostics centres said severity of the infection maybe the same, but since the number of new cases is low, the percentage of severe to critical patients is also less. Radiologists at HRCT scan centres said there is a dip of 30% in patients with score of above 8, while 30% don’t have any lung involvement now. The observation of treating doctors regarding moderate to severe patients correlates with that of the findings by CT scan centres, which show about 20% patients having a score of above 8. Similarly, Covid labs found that the number of entire families testing positive is down now. During March and April, the district saw families testing positive with more than one member needing hospitalization as the new mutant strain was considered more virulent. Dr Mohan Nerker, who is Covid unit in-charge of Seven Star Hospital, said it seems the virus has lost its potency or become less virulent. “Whatever patients are turning up have mild symptoms and getting treated on OPD basis. Serious patients are either being shifted from other hospitals or belong to other districts,” he said. Dr Nerker added another reason for reduced transmission could be the number of people already recovered or vaccinated. “Once a sizeable population develops herd immunity, the transmission of virus is stalled,” he explained. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said even now multiple members in families are getting infected, but because of lesser number of cases they are going unnoticed. “We are still seeing similar presentation and virulence of virus,” said Dr Tayade. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said in some areas, so far untouched by Covid, it may affect entire family, but in general not all are testing positive. “Though, severity rate is the same. Transmission and infectivity rate is low due to lockdown, awareness, immunization and herd immunity,” he added. Crescent Diagnostics lab director Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed observed that lesser number of households are witnessing infection among all family members. Metroscan director Dr Atul Dakhole said HRCT scan of 30% patients is normal and without changes in lungs. “Around 30% have score up to 8 and 20% above 8. In the last two months, over 50% patients had 8 and above score,” he added. Consultant radiologist Dr MA Bivji said there has been drastic drop in CT score, while the footfall has declined to January-February level. “Severe disease has not been seen in the last couple of days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-wave-waving-goodbye-not-many-in-same-family-testing-ve/articleshow/82719449.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Hisar, Rohtak and Jind districts emerged as hotspots between May 1 and May 15. This means that 26% of the total cases and 33% deaths were reported in the first fortnight. After the massive Covid surge, exacerbated by shortage of oxygen due to alleged miscalculation by officials, the Surakshit Haryana Mahamari alert is now being extended to the second week. Gurgaon retained its top position in terms of cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases and vaccinations, while remaining districts, including Faridabad, stood second both in terms of new cases and deaths. Announcing the lockdown, CM Manohar Lal Khattar expected a tally of 1.20 lakh active cases till May 15. However, till Saturday, the count had dipped below 1 lakh and during the the last week, the number of new cases was reported to be less than the preceding week. Covid surge in rural areas had mainly fuelled the numbers in the first week. Mysterious deaths allegedly caused by Covid were reported from rural belts of Hisar, Hansi, Sonipat, Rohtak and Bhiwani districts. The surge began from the third week of April and by May 1, Haryana’s overall count crossed five lakh. The number of active cases crossed 1 lakh with a record 125 deaths of the day taking the total to 4,341. Haryana’s overall tally has reached 5,01,566 cases, 3,94,709 recoveries and 1,02,516 active cases. On Saturday, May 15, Haryana’s overall count stood at 6,85,312 cases, 5,82,820 recoveries, 6,546 deaths and 95,946 active cases. On May 1, Haryana’s overall tally was 5,01,566 cases, 3,94,709 recoveries, 4,341 deaths and 1,02,516 active cases. On May 1, Hisar reported a surge of 897 cases and the district tally reached 30,652. Jind, Rohtak, Mahendergarh, Panipat, Karnal and Kurukshetra districts faced a similar situation. “Lockdown has really made an impact and we were able to control the situation to some extent. War against Covid is on and one more thing you will appreciate is that Haryana had been giving treatment to non-domiciled or those from other states, largely from New Delhi,’’ said health and home minister Anil Vij.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-covid-hotspots-emerged-in-haryana-over-first-fortnight-of-may/articleshow/82725663.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: Storm most fierce when closest off Mumbai’s coast||MUMBAI: The extremely severe cyclonic storm ‘Tauktae’ which come within a distance of 120 km off the Mumbai coast brought winds reaching up to 108 kmph on Monday afternoon. Weather department officials said the storm was strongest when it was closest to the city’s coast and thus brought heavy rain as well and gusty winds. The IMD had issued an ‘orange alert,’ meaning heavy to very heavy rainfall was likely over the entire Konkan coast, which proved to be right. Monday was also the wettest day recorded so far in May. Almost all areas across Mumbai and its suburbs reported heavy rain. As much as 214 mm of rainfall was reported in 12 hours from 8.30 am to 8.30 p.m. This beat the earlier high of 190.8 mm recorded on May 19, 2000. Colaba saw 202.6 mm of rainfall, and Santacruz 214.6 mm. The IMD classifies rainfall equal to or greater than 204.5 mm as ‘extremely heavy’. The heavy showers, accompanied by strong winds, led to low visibility in parts of the city. Some experts said the rapid intensification of the cyclone from a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ to an ‘extremely severe’ one was probably not expected. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist at IMD Mumbai, said that early on Monday, the cyclone was classified as extremely severe and that maximum windspeed recorded in Mumbai was at 2 pm, of 108 kmph. “Last year in August, the maximum wind speed was of 105 kmph during the monsoon, while on Monday it reached 108 kmph. On Monday the cyclone was also 120 kmph off the Mumbai coast. The entire Konkan belt has received heavy rain. In the next 24 hours, when the cyclone strikes Gujarat, in some places in Mumbai too, gusty winds may continue, along with rain,” Bhute said. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather Services Pvt Ltd, pointed out that the higher- intensity cyclone ensured that it would reach Gujarat faster than expected. “Earlier, this was expected to happen on May 18,” said Palwat. Earlier, the storm was expected to cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around Tuesday afternoon or evening. At 11.56 pm on Monday, the centre of cyclone “lay overland about 20kms east-northeast of Diu” and “the landfall process will continue for the next 2 hrs,” the weather department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-storm-most-fierce-when-closest-off-citys-coast/articleshow/82721961.cms||Richa Pinto

The baby girl was left at the shelter soon after her birth. The boy’s governess at the shelter was found infected with the virus. “After finding out about this, I wrote to the district collector to provide separate nursing staff for the infants and I received a reply that the needful had been done. Both the children are undergoing treatment and recovering. We will monitor the situation. I have also told them that no outside staff should be allowed inside the shelters,” said Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. Three other children at the shelter also tested positive. Less than a week back, the commission had issued guidelines to all the district collectors about precautionary measures to prepare for the anticipated third Covid wave which might affect children. This includes not only strengthening the existing infrastructure but also setting up of dedicated Covid centres/wards for children, the start of which has been done in Nagaur. According to the guidelines, the district administration needs to ensure all children hospitals/wards have adequate facilities like ventilators, oxygen cylinders and medical staff. Authorities have been instructed to take stock of the situation at various children shelters and find out if they have thermometers and oxymeters. In these centres, the rooms, toilets and kitchen areas have to be sanitised regularly. Pocket sanitisers also need to be provided to all children apart from ensuring that their hands are washed before eating meals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-intervenes-after-2-infants-found-ve-in-nagaur/articleshow/82721934.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

As a result of Cyclone Tauktae the state received nearly 89% rainfall within two days. “There are 14 days to end the summer rain season this year. But the state has already received over 138% excess rainfall and some districts received over 200% excess rainfall due to the effect of Cyclone Tauktae. There will be a chance to get rainfall before the southwest monsoon season,” said Cholayil. “The overheating of the Arabian Sea caused climate change and it was the main reason for the repeated cyclones. Several years ago, there were no cyclones formed in the Arabian Sea. But for the last several years the number of cyclones has largely increased. In the 2000-2021 period, over 35 cyclones were formed in the Arabian Sea. In 2019 alone, five cyclones were formed,” he added. “Earlier, considered the safest place in the country the repeated cyclones will cause more threat to Kerala in future. The farming calendar is also affected due to the unexpected rainfall,” Cholayil said. “The excess rainfall is due to the effect of Cyclone Tauktae. There are chances of more cyclones. The state will have to make more arrangements to manage the situation. The repeated cyclones will cause the water levels in dams to rise before the monsoon season. We need to change the dam management system too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-received-138-excess-summer-rains/articleshow/82719464.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Antony Raju of Janadhipathya Kerala Congress and Ahammad Devarkovil of INL will become the ministers in the first term. Then they will give way to KB Ganesh Kumar of Kerala Congress (B) and Ramachandran Kadannappally of Cong (S). “LDF took a decision to ensure representation for most constituents as people from diverse sectors gave a huge support to LDF this election. This will be the first time almost all constituents secured representation in the government,” said LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan. However, he did not explain the reason for omitting LJD, which has one MLA, from the cabinet. LJD became the only constituent without representation in the government.

---||Kochi||INL’s long wait rewarded||Kozhikode: The ministerial berth for Indian National League (INL) comes as recognition for the party’s 27-year association with the LDF, including the near-quarter century ‘waiting period’ the breakaway faction of IUML had to face to get inducted into LDF. INL’s lone first-time MLA Ahammad Devarkovil will become a minister in the second Pinarayi Vijayan ministry. It marks the second time in which a breakaway faction of IUML is being inducted to the ministry after All India Muslim League got representation in E K Nayanar’s ministry in 1980. The party remained loyal to LDF though many leaders like P M A Salam and N A Nellikunnu left it and returned to IUML. INL was formed in 1994 by former IUML national president Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait in protest against the party’s association with Congress after the Babri Masjid demolition. The party is said to have dropped the idea of having the word Muslim in its name following the advice from CPM leaders and chose the name Indian National League. Its leaders had said that they used to discuss party formation matters with the then CPM general secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet in New Delhi. The party offered unconditional support to LDF in Guruvayur assembly byelection of 1994 (necessitated following the resignation of PM Aboobacker from IUML to be part of INL) in which LDF-backed independent P T Kunhu Muhammed won the seat. While sitting MLAs U A Beeran and P M Aboobacker resigned their posts to be with INL in 1994, the party had to wait for wait till 2006 to have an MLA with the election of P M A Salam from Kozhikode South. The association with INL helped LDF to reach out to minorities and overcome the image that CPM, Left were untouchable for Muslims. INL state general secretary Kasim Irikkur said that the decision to make INL part of LDF government was a milestone moment. “This is a gesture of recognition for the support LDF received in this election from minorities and other marginalized sections. It sends the signal that minorities can firmly align with LDF as a true secular platform and that it is ready to accommodate all their aspirations,” he said. Kasim said the party had in its own way served as a link between LDF and minorities. “Till our formation, IUML and Congress were spreading anti-Communism especially among Muslim minorities and our association helped change that to a big extent,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/inls-long-wait-rewarded/articleshow/82717414.cms||---

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the function would be conducted in a low-key manner in the wake of the prevailing situation in the state. He said that the Central Stadium has a capacity to accommodate 50,000 people, but the admission would be for one-hundredth of this number. He added that the same function was conducted in the presence of 40,000 people in the same venue in 2016. He said that 500 is not a big number as there are already 140 MLAs and 29 MPs who are unavoidable for such a function as it is the parliamentary party that decides who all are to be sworn in. He said that the other pillars of the democracy, including the executive, judiciary and the media, also could not be excluded. The entry to the function will be restricted through passes. In addition, the entry to the stadium will be only for those who have RT-PCR/TRUNAT/RT LAMP negative results that have been obtained within 48 hours prior to the event or on the production of the final certificate of Covid vaccination. Testing for Covid-19 will also be arranged at the venue. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/500-people-to-attend-swearing-in-ceremony/articleshow/82717454.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The radar helps to issue warnings 2-3 hours prior to severe weather events and can also detect the cumulonimbus cloud, which had brought Mumbai record rain on July 26, 2005. A scientist at IMD said, “There is a technical issue, and it will be sorted out in a short while. Engineers are working on it.” During the rainy season in the past, there have been prolonged periods when the radar, installed at Colaba, has been non-functional. Once, in 2016, it had been non- functional for over a fortnight. At that time, IMD officials had said some modules which had gone bad had to be airlifted from Chennai .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doppler-radar-non-functional-imd-says-technical-issue/articleshow/82722015.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Cap prices of CT scan, PPE kits & blood tests: HC to Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: Seeking to know why the government has exempted CT scan, blood tests and PPE kits from the purview of GOs on price capping issued last year, the Telangana high court on Monday directed the state to issue a fresh GO by including these tests in the capping list and also to constitute a three-member IAS committee to monitor the functioning of private hospitals. The judges also told the government to attend to the grievances of people being allegedly fleeced by private hospitals. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy issued a slew of directions after hearing a batch of public interest petitions on Covid-19. Agreeing with the contentions raised by advocates Pratap Narayan Sanghi and NS Arjun Kumar, the judges impleaded the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority as a respondent to the case as it will have a significant role in capping the prices in the sector. The judges said the GOs issued in 2020 will have to be amended as there was no demand for CT scan, etc. then, asking the government to take the current second wave conditions into account. The judges wondered whether the Covid-19 treatment kits being distributed by the government to people contain steroids. “Do not give them as their usage is now fraught with new problems like black fungus,” they said. The judges took note of the recent death of a pregnant woman from Medchal who died on account of denial of admission by government and private hospitals and directed the government to ensure that no hospital would henceforth insist on an RT-PCR negative report for admitting a pregnant woman. “The unfortunate death of the woman was due to the negligence of doctors and also the state government which learned no lesson despite a similar death of a woman last year,” said Chikkudu Prabhakar, counsel for one of the petitioners. The judges also asked the government to constitute an experts committee under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act. “Your next affidavit should contain all these details along with the measures you are taking to face the impending third wave,” they said before adjourning the case to June 1. Senior counsel L Ravi Chander contradicted the public health director’s figures on bed availability shown on the state portal. “As many as 6,000 beds which are shown on this portal claiming that they are available for Covid-19 patients can be straightaway deleted because they belong to 390 private hospitals which are not Covid-designated hospitals,” he said and called the bed availability figures shown by the health department as ‘fudged figures’. Advocate Gorantla Pujitha urged the judges to involve the women and child welfare department to oversee the adoption of children which is now happening online in view of the pandemic. “This may lead to a concealed child trafficking,” she contended. The judges said there was a need to keep a strict vigil on adoption and directed the government to involve the women and child welfare department. The judges appreciated the efforts of police in implementing the lockdown in a strict manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-govt-cap-prices-of-ct-scan-ppe-kits-blood-tests/articleshow/82724134.cms||---
---||Mumbai||3 warships, Coast Guard sail to save 410 stranded on 2 barges off Mumbai coast||MUMBAI: The Navy dispatched three warships—INS Kochi, INS Kolkata and later INS Talwar—to rescue as many as 410 people on board two barges after the boats got stranded in the rough weather in the Arabian Sea on Monday afternoon as cyclone Tautkae came within 120km off the city’s coast. Three Coast Guard ships, including Samrat from Mumbai, too sailed towards the two boats late on Monday. Around 60 personnel from a barge, all employed on oil rigs, had been rescued till 11pm, said Commander Mehul Karnik, Navy PRO. “The rescue operations will continue throughout the night,” he said. The barges had gone adrift off Mumbai coast after the cyclone intensified, officials said. “On receipt of a request for assistance for barge P305 adrift off Heera Oil Fields in the Bombay High area with 273 personnel on board, INS Kochi was sailed with despatch for search and rescue (SAR) assistance,” a Navy source said. He further said several other ships have been readied for ‘HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief) tasking’ in the wake of ‘Tauktae’ that has wreaked havoc along the west coast of India. P305, when stranded, was around 36 nautical miles (NM) or approximately 70 km from Mumbai. “In response to another SOS received from Barge GAL Constructor with 137 people on board about 8NM from Mumbai, INS Kolkata has been sailed with despatch to render assistance,” said a Navy source. Those rescued were being shifted to the Navy warships, said the spokesperson. Any adrift barge can be risky for other ships in the sea during cyclonic winds, and it may even be dangerous for the oil installations or rigs that are 70 km south-west of Mumbai. The spokesperson said, “The ships have started the rescue operations. The sea condition is very rough, with high swell and winds making the rescue efforts very difficult. Efforts are going on.” “INS Kolkata had been diverted to attend to the situation of barge P305 in support of INS Kochi,” he added. Two Coast Guard ships have been diverted to P305 while another ship has been sent to Gal Constructor to participate in the rescue operations. The rescue operation from P305 may take a long time as there are more personnel in it. The rough weather may also prolong operations, officials said. Gal Constructor had an emergency towing vessel (ETV). It has been adrift off Colaba Point due to engine trouble. The vessel was approached by an emergency towing vessel ‘Water Lily’ to render assistance. In a separate effort, INS Kolkata rescued two survivors from the life raft of vessel Vara Prabha and then joined INS Kochi for rescuing the P305 crew. These rescue efforts are to be augmented by Indian Navy aircraft and helicopters and weather permitting, “at first light on May 18, and the rescue efforts will be continued through the day,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-warships-coast-guard-sail-to-save-410-stranded-on-2-barges-off-mumbai-coast/articleshow/82724118.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Nagpur||2nd vax dose pushed back 4 weeks for 49k healthcare workers||Nagpur: Around 49,390 healthcare workers (HCWs) from 11 districts of Vidarbha have not taken second dose of Covid-19 vaccine despite completion of the earlier maximum interval of eight weeks from first dose. Now, they will have to wait for another few weeks due to revision in gap to minimum 12 weeks and maximum 16 weeks.The government had rolled out vaccine for HCWs— doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians and other staff working in government and private hospitals — on January 16. At that time, second dose of Covishield as well as Covaxin was suggested after 28 days from first dose.As per data of state’s public health department (PHD), 1,76,794 HCWs took first dose by March 21. The government on March 22 increased interval between two doses of Covishield to 6-8 weeks. The gap of 56 days was completed for these HCWs on May 16.As per PHD data, 1,27,404 (72.06%) HCWs had taken the second dose by May 16. Thus, 49,390 HCWs are pending for second dose.Majority of HCWs had taken Covishield. On May 13, the government increased interval between two doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks.NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Government has also made changes in Co-Win application. Now, whether it is HCWs or frontline workers (FLWs) or other citizens, they will become eligible for second dose of Covishield only after 12 weeks of first dose.”Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar said, “It is painful to hear 49,390 HCWs did not take their second dose within prescribed maximum limit. Many HCWs, especially contractual employees, did not take vaccine as vaccination was interrupted in private hospitals from May 1. Eligible HCWs should have availed the opportunity when they were given first preference. Many HCWs were waiting as they were wary of queues at government centers and also aware that maximum gap between two doses is helpful.”The government had started inoculation of FLWs from February 5. By March 21, 1,24,972 FLWs had taken the jab. As on May 16, 1,25,748 had taken second dose, which is more than those that had taken first dose on March 21. This means all availed second dose well before maximum interval.The government had commenced vaccination of 60+ and 45+ with comorbidities on March 1. In this category, 1,75,804 citizens had taken first dose by March 21 of which 1,73,650 availed second dose by May 16. Only 2,154 beneficiaries are yet to take second dose. Some had contracted the disease in second wave, and will become eligible for second dose after 40-45 days from day of testing positive.With implementation of new interval between two doses of Covishield, number of vaccinations has dropped to a great extent in the city. After receiving doses, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had resumed second dose on May 13 and 14,519 took the jab. The number of beneficiaries declined to 9,548 on May 14 with implementation of new guidelines.Then, the civic body resumed first dose of 45+ people to see rise in numbers to 14,468 on May 15. Number declined to 5,697 on May 16 and 4,888 on May 17.NMC on Monday announced starting of inoculation of 45+ at two Drive-In Vaccination Centres. Earlier, only above 60 years were allowed but few from 45-59 years age group had availed it. NMC also announced continuation of inoculation on Tuesday. The government is likely to deliver fresh stock of doses on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-vax-dose-pushed-back-4-weeks-for-49k-healthcare-workers/articleshow/82719506.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kochi||A cabinet handpicked by Pinarayi gets ready||Thiruvananthapuram: The thumping public mandate in the recent assembly election has given Pinarayi Vijayan the luxury to pick and choose his cabinet colleagues both from within CPM and minor allies of LDF. According to the scheme of things in CPM, K K Shailaja would be the only sitting minister who finds a place in the new cabinet. A long list of probable ministerial candidates from CPM had been doing the rounds and when journalists enquired about his picks for the cabinet, a typical response from the CM was: ‘You just keep on guessing’. According to LDF leaders, Vijayan would take a final call on who should be given which portfolio. The bilateral discussions with LDF allies were carried out by Vijayan and politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. However, there are a set of names that are almost certain to be included in the cabinet for obvious reasons. The most probable in the list are state committee members Shailaja, M V Govindan, P Rajeeve, K Radhakrishnan, V N Vasavan, Saji Cherian and K N Balagopal. Others likely to be picked up for the remaining five cabinet positions include Nemom MLA V Sivankutty, Aranmula MLA Veena George, Alappuzha MLA P P Chitharanjan, Beypore MLA Mohammed Riyas, Koyilandy MLA K Jameela and Ponnani MLA P Nandakumar. Considering Malabar politics, the possibility of Vijayan choosing his close confidante K T Jaleel as the speaker can’t be ruled out. There is also the possibility that Vijayan may choose a woman as the speaker. Despite being one of the most eligible candidates, it has to be seen whether Vijayan would include his son-in-law Riyas in the cabinet. Sources said Balagopal, Rajeeve, Saji Cherian, Vasavan, M B Rajesh and M V Govindan are sure to find a place in the cabinet given their stature and seniority. CPI will have new faces in its four cabinet berths. Cherthala MLA P Prasad and Ollur MLA K Rajan are almost certain to be considered. Chadayamangalam MLA J Chinchurani, Punalur MLA P S Supal, Nadapuram MLA E K Vijayan are being considered for the remaining two cabinet berths. Adoor MLA Chittayam Gopakumar is most-likely to be considered for the deputy speaker’s post. Roshy Augustine would be the only minister from KC(M). The ministerial candidates of NCP and Janata Dal (S) would be declared on Tuesday. Elathur MLA A K Saseendran and Kuttanad MLA Thomas K Thomas are the NCP MLAs. Former ministers K Krishnan Kutty and Mathew T Thomas are the JD (S) MLAs. Each of the parties would get one cabinet berth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-cabinet-handpicked-by-pinarayi-gets-ready/articleshow/82717500.cms||B S Anilkumar

In the Morva Hadaf taluka, drills were held at treatment facilities in Morva and Mora to ensure timely switch over of power was done. In Dahod, the civil hospital had power backup. However, arrangements of generators had to be made for 30 other treatment facilities in the district. Out of the five private Covid treatment facilities in Dahod, three now have generators while the two others have inverters. Officials said that hospitals have been asked to ensure that they had 18 hours of power backup. In the Mahisagar district too, power backup had been arranged for all 14 Covid care facilities. Teams have been kept ready to deal with any power and water supply disruption to hospitals. Similar arrangements had been made for the Chhota Udepur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/power-backup-arranged-in-covid-facilities/articleshow/82717529.cms||---

In the post-K M Mani era, the party is set to see a major leadership change with Roshy Augustine, who won from Idukki, set to become the lone minister of the party. The parliamentary meeting of the party had selected Roshy as the parliamentary party leader. The defeat of party chairman Jose K Mani in Pala has come as big blow for him and in the new scenario Roshy is set to become the new power centre in the party. Jose K Mani had tried till the last minute to get two minister post for the party, which was rejected by the chief minister and the party has been offered the chief whip post. The party leadership, especially Jose K Mani, has restrained himself from making any public statements about the displeasure over this. Kottayam and Pala are closely linked to the power politics of the KC (M) ever since the party was formed. The residence of Mani in Pala and the party headquarters in Kottayam town were the places which had witnessed major political developments. Whenever the party was in the government there were ministers from the district. K M Mani, C F Thomas and K Narayanakurup, who hailed from Kottayam district had been ministers in various UDF governments. When the party sided with the LDF government in 1980, Mani was a minister in the Nayanar cabinet. Though Roshy, who is set to become the minister hails from Ramapuram in Pala, he is representing Idukki constituency. He will be keen to widen his support base in the constituency in the capacity of a minister and he is likely to spend more time there whenever he is not in Thiruvananthapuram. Now, since Roshy is the lone minister and the Parliamentary party leader, the equations within the party is set to change. Going by history of the Kerala Congress, when the second leader of the party becomes a power centre, it usually leads to a split in the party. Party leaders and Church usually centres on the power centre. The days ahead after the government formation will determine whether KC(M) is set to witness a tussle for power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-kcm-min-from-kottayam-dist-may-lead-to-a-power-shift/articleshow/82717539.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The government notification on night curfew and other restrictions was to expire on May 18, Tuesday. “The entire government machinery is presently engaged in tackling Cyclone Tauktae, which has made landfall on the Saurashtra coast. It has been decided to continue with the restrictions and night curfew until 6am on Friday,” the CM said. All essential services — fruits and vegetables, milk, medicines, groceries, opticians and eateries — will continue to remain open along with industries, factories and construction activities, a government statement released on Monday night said. Despite representations from trade and commerce bodies seeking relaxations in the restrictions, the government had last week extended the limited lockdown for another week. Sources said the government could consider granting some relaxations for both commercial activities as well as the timings of night curfew, which presently is from 8pm to 6am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curbs-extended-till-friday-morning/articleshow/82719540.cms||---

Papalkar has managed to keep all the children under his care free of Covid, even as the virus is playing havoc all around them in Amravati district. Octogenarian Shankar Baba lives with the challenged residents in a 25-acre campus in the heart of the Amravati district, the place where the second wave of Covid-19 is believed to have originated in early February. Despite nearly three months of strict restrictions, the virus is still playing havoc in the district, with more than 83,000 cases and 1,250 deaths. Instances have been reported in this district where 70% population of villages tested positive at a go. In such a scenario, Shankar Baba and his 123 special children have managed to stay uninfected and healthy for almost 14 months since the pandemic outbreak in March 2020. They stay together and take care of each other, which is the ideal model of this home for mentally challenged, disabled, and orphans, named after Padmashri Prabhakarrao Vaidya, an educationist from Vidarbha. “Girls sleep together in a 20x70 ft dormitory, and boys in a smaller 20x30 ft hall. They don’t wear masks but wash hands multiple times a day. Physical distancing is not possible here because many of them need assistance to complete their daily chores,” said Shankar Baba. “The day the first lockdown was announced, I closed all three entry points of this estate. No outsider is allowed to enter. Teams of government doctors who visit this place for general health check-ups of inmates have to undergo strict sanitization before they enter,” Shankar Baba explains. According to him, the secret that has protected these inmates from the deadly virus is forestation done by them over the last 30 years. “We started living here in the 1990s. My children have planted more than 15,000 trees of 200 varieties, and lovingly nurtured them. More than 5,000 of the trees are of neem (Indian lilac). They are protecting us from viruses,” he said. The inmates eat tender leaves of neem daily in the morning while they burn some dry leaves in the evening and spread their smoke all around the house. Shankar Baba claims this remedy is enough to keep Covid away. “Why just Covid? No one of them experienced fever, diarrhea, or accidental fall during this one year. Keeping away from visitors and the neem therapy made them healthier, and more confident than ever,” he said. As per present laws, mentally and physically disabled persons have to leave the orphanage or school once they turn 18. “Some disabled and mentally challenged people need assistance and security for a lifetime. We have developed an ideal model for it. The older residents help youngsters here. Normal inmates cook food for all, serve them, feed those who need feeding, and also clean those who need it,” he said. The institution gets food grains from Amravati’s Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal (HVPM) and Shegaon’s Sant Gajanan Maharaj Temple Trust. District administration of Amravati, district civil surgeon Dr Shyamsundar Nikam and district collector Shailesh Naval are always helpful for all medical assistance to the inmates. “I have a message for the government of India. Stop deforestation immediately. Ban timber mills for the next 5 years. Let nature heal itself. There will be no virus, no shortage of oxygen ever,” Shankar Baba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/123-in-home-for-disabled-kept-safe-from-covid-with-wazzar-model/articleshow/82719526.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The decision was taken in a review meeting chaired by UT administrator V P Singh Badnore. UT adviser Manoj Parida said after extensive discussions in various forums and with medical experts, it was decided that the restrictions already imposed under the curfew will remain in force for another week, so that the gain of plateauing the caseload due to the lockdown is not lost. Earlier, UT was contemplating to apply odd-even system in opening of shops and allowing non-essential shops for some specific period of the day. However, all these options were ruled out. It was decided that deputy commissioner Mandip Brar will meet representatives of various traders, market and industry associations to solicit their views and suggestions regarding relief that could be provided to them due to the loss suffered during the shutdown. Badnore appealed to landlords of small residential houses to voluntarily reduce rents for the lockdown period to give relief to tenants who have lost their income and prevent their migration. More vaccines in Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT said additional vaccines have been received for administering to eligible beneficiaries in both above 18 and above 45 categories. It was decided to increase the number of vaccines and venues and to administer 2,000 doses daily to eligible beneficiaries After extensive discussions in various forums and with medical experts, it was decided that the restrictions already imposed under corona curfew should remain in force for another week till 5 am on May 25, so that gain of plateauing of caseload due to the lockdown is not lost Manoj Parida | UT adviser||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-curfew-extended-till-may-25/articleshow/82717503.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The second lockdown has affected more than 2,000 farmers, 500 contract farmers and more than 5,000 workers in Muthalamada. As most parts of the country are under lockdown, mango could not be sent to its main markets in Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Indore. Now, the price of mango has fallen sharply and the farmers are not able to pluck the fruits as there is no demand. In January, when Muthalamada mangoes are the first to reach the country’s market, the Alphonso variety would fetch Rs 350 per kg. But now it is sold at Rs 25-30. Of the other main varieties, Bengarapalli is sold at Rs 20-25, Sindooram at Rs 15-20, Kilimookan at Rs 10-12 and Moovandan at Rs 7-10. Since there is no export demand, mango is sent to mango pulp factories at Krishnagiri and Salem in Tamil Nadu at throw-away price, the farmers said.Last year also the farmers faced the same situation due to the April lockdown. Though the state government had directed Kerala state horticulture development corporation to procure mango from Muthalamada, they are yet to start procurement. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lockdown-hits-muthalamada-mango-farmers/articleshow/82719537.cms||---

Warden Road, Breach Candy, Cadbury Junction on Peddar Road, Grant Road, Mumbai Central, Kamathipura and even Shivaji Park area were waterlogged for several hours in the morning. Chronic flooding spots, like Hindmata in Parel and Gandhi Market in Sion, were also inundated . “BMC’s claim of carrying out desilting work has been washed out. There was no coordination between any of its departments,” said Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh. Tweeting visuals of trash floating in nullahs near Love Grove pumping station, Shaikh added: “The pumping was not pressed into service till late afternoon. Despite spending crores on setting up pumping stations, there is no relief for citizens.” BJP MLA from Bandra (E) Ashish Shelar said: “Civic and police personnel were on the ground, but the flooding exposed BMC’s claim of carrying out pre-monsoon works. The ruling party in the BMC [Shiv Sena] and contractors can’t escape the responsibility this time. I demand a probe by the BMC chief.” Admitting that there was flooding in parts of south and central Mumbai, additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu said they will call for a meeting and review the situation. “A coffer dam was erected for some civil works at Love Grove pumping station. We will check whether or not this prevented the water from reaching the pumping station,” Velrasu said. “Some issues related to flow of water from the railway culvert have also been pointed out. The working of the pumping station on time will also be checked. All this will be examined and corrective measures will be taken before monsoon.” Earlier this month, mayor Kishori Pednekar had said 76% of desilting work was completed in the western suburbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/oppn-lashes-out-at-bmc-as-south-central-mumai-flood/articleshow/82722054.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government expects third Covid wave between August, November||GANDHINAGAR: Although it is difficult to predict a pandemic wave, the Gujarat government is bracing to face a possible third wave of Covid-19 cases between August and November, when a number of festivals are held. Beginning with Rakshabandhan in August, a number of festivals such as Janmashtami, Navratri and Diwali will follow at quick intervals after the monsoon season. With a large number of people moving about during these festivals, the government expects a spike in Covid-19 cases during this period.  A Covid patient being transferred at Civil Hospital in AsarwaA key source engaged in the planning of the government response said, “The government’s task force and experts are attempting to predict the likely third wave of the pandemic, which is very difficult to do. But top officials have opined that normally in Gujarat during festivals, crowding begins, so the coming festival season could cause a third wave of the pandemic.” People soak in the changed weather at the Sabarmati riverfrontOfficials said that religious and social gatherings and fairs across Gujarat happen during the month of ‘Shravan’ (around August). “The state government is likely to ban all such events. Thereafter, the Navratri festival will take place and the government will, in most probability, put some restrictions on the Navratri festival in October as well,” the source said. “The government will face another challenge in the Diwali and New Year festivals in November, but it aims to vaccinate as many people as possible by November if vaccine doses are available in adequate quantities,” the source said. In the first wave in November last year, the per day peak of cases was 1,607 while in the second wave in April, the peak was 14,605 on April 30, almost nine times the number of cases registered in the first peak. People queue-up for death certificates at Civil HospitalAlthough nobody in the government is spelling out an estimate of daily cases likely at the peak of the third wave, guestimates put the number at three to five times the number of cases at the peak of the second wave. Some experts say that if mass vaccination is achieved before the third wave, the peak could be much lower than in the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-expects-third-covid-wave-between-aug-nov/articleshow/82719553.cms||Kapil Dave
---||India||IIT-Bombay devises method to reuse oxygen exhaled by patients||MUMBAI: A team of alumni, students and professors from IIT-Bombay have come up with an innovative way to reuse exhaled oxygen, thereby enhancing the lifetime of oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 patients. The proposed method will help bring down the usage of over nine oxygen cylinders in a day for a critical patient to one or two cylinders, they said. The team has designed the prototype of a breathing device called ‘The reBreather’, which facilitates recirculation of exhaled breath by scrubbing out carbon dioxide and blending in fresh oxygen. It will also help in minimising wastage of oxygen in the current system at a time when hospitals are facing an acute shortage. A healthy person breathes in five litres of air per minute, which corresponds to about 1 litre/ minute of oxygen being inhaled. Of this, approximately 0.25 litre/minute of oxygen is consumed. “Covid-19 patients in intensive care can be given up to 50 litres of oxygen per minute, with only 1-1.5 litre being really utilised. Consequently around 90% of oxygen is lost to the atmosphere. The bottled oxygen could be used efficiently in a closed (or semi-closed) loop system, which we have demonstrated using the reBreather,” said professor Santosh Noronha from the chemical engineering department at IIT-Bombay. Release of lot of oxygen could also be a reason for increased fire incidents in Covid hospitals, he said. The prototype has been tested informally on healthy volunteers. Clinical trials are still pending and is likely to take time. Therefore, the institute has released the design in open source to demonstrate its practicality. While the prototype cost the team around Rs 10,000, it can be significantly brought down in large-scale industrial deployment. The institute has now invited engineers, manufacturers to adopt, replicate or even modify the design for better scalability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iit-bombay-devises-method-to-reuse-o2-exhaled-by-patients/articleshow/82726407.cms||Yogita Rao

The monitoring, the experts said, should continue after recovery and even if people are not diabetic. The advisory comes after sporadic reports of mucormycosis — a fungal infection seen in many who've recovered from Covid — among those who were not hospitalised and not administered steroids. Elevated blood sugar level is a factor that increases risk of mucormycosis. Experts said Covid-19 itself is likely to boost blood sugar levels. So regulating blood sugar levels during and after Covid is certainly advisable, they said. “Whether diabetic or not, raised blood sugar is the single most important factor in the development of this deadly disease. Sugar control then is of foremost importance,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande. Physician D B Kadam, head of the Pune Covid-19 Task Force said, “Covid can attack pancreatic beta cells causing hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Whether you are a diabetic or not, it is advisable to monitor sugar levels during and after Covid.” Infectious diseases expert Sujata Rege of Bharati Hospital said, “Mucor fungus has an enzyme (ketone reductase), which allows it to thrive in high blood glucose and acidic conditions.” Endocrinologist and state Covid task force member, Shashank Joshi, said there are seven parameters that have to be monitored during at-home care. “A close watch on sugar levels is needed during and after Covid treatment. Blood glucose levels have to stay between 140-180. The post-Covid monitoring period is three months,” Joshi said. Steroids are not advised for home-isolated Covid patients with mild disease. They don’t then face a threat of steroid-induced diabetes, commonly seen in hospitalized and hypoxic patients who are administered steroids. But most Covid-19 patients recovering at home mainly rely on telephonic consultations. “Once a patient is advised home isolation and prescribed certain drugs, he or she does not turn up for follow-up checks. Many doctors running clinics in Pune have started reviewing home-isolated patients' conditions at regular intervals. But very few turn up,” said physician Sudhirkumar Mundle.

Pathanamthitta police with the help of cybercell picked up the suspect, Vijeesh Varghese, 36, a former Indian Navy personnel, from a flat in HSR Layout where he was hiding since February-end. His order on a food app led investigators to his hidedout, sources said. He was brought to Pathanamthitta on Monday and his arrest was recorded. His fraudulent acts at work came to light on February 11, 2021, when a colleague whose wife had a fixed deposit with the branch found that Rs 9.6 lakh had been withdrawn. Suspecting Varghese’s hand, the bank authorities launched an internal probe and found he had swindled a whopping Rs 8,13,64,539 from dormant FDs and bank accounts belonging to minors, to which court orders had banned access till the persons turn 18. But Varghese had fled with his family by then. “Due to lapses on the part of his colleagues, Varghese managed to access their work computers and altered customer details to transfer large sums of money from December 28, 2019, onwards for the next 14 months,” said an investigator. Varghese, along with his wife and two children, reached Bengaluru on February 27 and rented a flat on a fake identity, Vikash Kumar. He remained in hiding after disposing of his old SIM and bank cards to avoid detection by Pathanamthitta police who were on his trail. “He had transferred the money to various accounts belonging to himself, his wife, mother and father-in-law. He used a big chunk of it to invest in the stock market and for online card games like Rummy,” the officer added. Managing to stay off police radar for nearly three months, Varghese erred when he used his newly-purchased Bengaluru number to call a friend in Kollam, his hometown. A Kerala police team tracked him to a location in Indiranagar and landed in Bengaluru on Thursday. The investigators then tracked the number to a food order and followed it to reach his flat — where he was hiding with his family — on Sunday.

Family members of a Covid-19 victim had accused Lifeline Hospital, Zirakpur, of overcharging and lapses in treatment, leading deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan to form the committee comprising sub-divisional magistrate, deputy superintendent of police and senior medical officer. The report said the rates charged by the hospital were “exorbitantly high” and it did not have National Accredited Board of Hospitals (NABH) certification as of now. The report recommended strict action under Sections 51 (b) and 58 of National Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act 1897 against the hospital. Dr Parveer Goel, managing director, Lifeline Hospital, said, “Some facts of the matter have been twisted by the complainant. We will study the report, take legal opinion and then move forward.” Dayalan said, “The hospital could not produce any medical treatment record of the patient. In fact, the entire medical record management system was found to be faulty. The claim that the hospital had given left against medical advice (LAMA) to the patient’s family to shift the patient to other hospital could not be established as the hospital could not produce any documentary evidence.” “Basic Covid care guidelines pertaining to wearing of PPE kits by the sanitation staff were not adhered to. The committee was not provided with the stock register and neither payment received record was properly maintained; no payee PAN detail entries were maintained for any transaction above Rs 1 lakh,” he said. The report stated, “The hospital failed to show before the committee NABH (National Accredited Board of Hospitals) certificate, stock register, patient’s summary or treatment record, LAMA summary or discharged certificate.” “It is ascertained that medical negligence on part of the hospital and the only treating doctor, Dr Munish Goel, cannot be ruled out as no record pertaining to treatment has been put herewith. The behavior of Dr Munish Goel is not as per his profession, as he has been found to be very rude and violent towards patients and their attendants,” the report said. The hospital also failed to submit the record and mode of payment done by the patient for or during the treatment from the date of admission in hospital till death, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/report-indicts-zirakpur-hospital-may-face-closure/articleshow/82717547.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Make rural service for doctors compulsory: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: As Covid-19 spreads rapidly in rural areas and the administration struggles to find trained medical staff, the Gujarat high court on Monday said medical staff should compulsorily serve in rural areas. During the hearing of the suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bargav Karia said that the court was concerned about the rapid spread of the disease in rural areas. They said testing facilities are not adequately available there and reports come in late, resulting in delayed treatment. When the government counsel furnished details about testing facilities, the judges said, “We will not go by figures.” The judges said: “We want to know hard ground realities whether there is facility of testing, availability of remdesivir and doctor and nursing staff.” The judges said they also want to know whether PHCs and CHCs are working and have enough medical staff and medicines. They said they want information about the oxygen situation and vaccinations as well. The government counsel conceded that districts are not in as good a position as urban areas, and therefore the state government’s focus is now on rural areas. The HC asked the government to place on record by May 24 the details about PHCs, CHCs and whether they are functional and have the required medical staff. “Whether they are on paper or really working,” the judges commented. The advocate general lamented that despite efforts, the government is finding it difficult to hire trained doctors. To this Justice Karia suggested the tele-medicine method. Justice Trivedi said that the government has to make it compulsory for doctors to serve in rural areas. “You have to make this compulsory. There is no excuse that doctors and nursing staff are not ready to go to rural areas. People in villages should not suffer only because you are not in a position to make this compulsory,” the judges said. “You have to put your foot down. Anyhow. This is an epidemic and you can send teams of experts to rural areas or semi-urban areas.” The judges added: “You have to make them remain in rural areas for a week. They can train people because people in rural areas don’t know how to put on oxygen masks, forget about anything else.” The judges further said people in rural areas do not know that they are required to go for testing. The state government asserted that the availability of testing facilities was widely publicized. Justice Karia questioned, “What is the effect? Every day, in each village, 4-5 people are dying and they don’t know they are having Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/make-rural-service-for-doctors-compulsory-hc/articleshow/82719528.cms||---

In the aftermath, bodies floated at Apollo Bunder, Colaba, Mazgaon docks and other sea faces even as piles of planks, broken masts and other pieces of timber turned the harbour from Colaba to Sewri into one long graveyard of ships. The next one in 1948, again in November, left wreckage in its wake from cargoes carried by around 300 "country craft", littering fishing villages in Versova, Danda and Thana too. About 100 lives, chiefly crew and owners of ships and boats, were feared lost and a 1,000-ton Norwegian steamer called 'Marly'--which left Bombay for the Malabar coast--vanished. According to TOI reports, seven people were killed in the city on the day and a hundred injured. 'Tauktae' is probably the closest Mumbai has come since to experiencing a severe storm, with wind speeds of up to 108 kmph near the Colaba seafront. Tauktae, experts say, was at its most intense at its closest to the Mumbai coast (distance of 120 km) before it propelled away towards Gujarat. An extreme weather event of this nature, so close to the city, portends a warning about the likely consequences of ignoring climate change, say experts. This is the third year in a row that cyclones in the Arabian Sea have menaced the west coast. Nisarga in 2020 even made landfall near Alibaug in Maharashtra while in 2019 Vayu moved parallel to the shoreline along the western coast. Experts said the recent frequency of cyclones was a clear sign of temperatures rising in the Arabian Sea. These low-pressure systems are formed when warm, moist air rises up from the sea surface. Historically, waters off the western coast have experienced fewer storms than the Bay of Bengal, and typically weaker. "The rapid warming of the Arabian Sea is leading to not just more cyclones but also more extreme rain events... Due to these warm ocean conditions it is seen that the cyclone intensifies from a weak cyclone to an extremely severe cyclone rapidly. This rapid intensification also means we need to ensure our forecasting is accurate," said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and a PhD student at the department of meteorology, University of Reading in UK, said a cyclone is not much of a menace if it dissipates over the sea itself. “However, if it comes so close to the coast like cyclone Tauktae did and Nisarga last year which made a landfall here, then it’s a massive threat. Also with it intensifying so rapidly, the authorities find very little time to evacuate those living along the coast. This is now seen to be happening frequently with the storms in the Arabian Sea," said Deoras. With little control over the discharge of greenhouse gases and the consequent rise in temperatures, warming in the Arabian Sea is certainly a trend that’s likely to written about in these columns again and again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wind-speed-of-over-100kmph-at-colaba-mumbai-has-rarely-felt-this-close-to-a-storm/articleshow/82722114.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Pune||Home-isolated patients now told to monitor sugar levels||PUNE: Doctors are now urging Covid patients who’re recovering at home to keep monitoring blood glucose levels. The monitoring, the experts said, should continue after recovery and even if people are not diabetic. The advisory comes after sporadic reports of mucormycosis — a fungal infection seen in many who've recovered from Covid — among those who were not hospitalised and not administered steroids. Elevated blood sugar level is a factor that increases risk of mucormycosis. Experts said Covid-19 itself is likely to boost blood sugar levels. So regulating blood sugar levels during and after Covid is certainly advisable, they said. “Whether diabetic or not, raised blood sugar is the single most important factor in the development of this deadly disease. Sugar control then is of foremost importance,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande. Physician D B Kadam, head of the Pune Covid-19 Task Force said, “Covid can attack pancreatic beta cells causing hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Whether you are a diabetic or not, it is advisable to monitor sugar levels during and after Covid.” Infectious diseases expert Sujata Rege of Bharati Hospital said, “Mucor fungus has an enzyme (ketone reductase), which allows it to thrive in high blood glucose and acidic conditions.” Endocrinologist and state Covid task force member, Shashank Joshi, said there are seven parameters that have to be monitored during at-home care. “A close watch on sugar levels is needed during and after Covid treatment. Blood glucose levels have to stay between 140-180. The post-Covid monitoring period is three months,” Joshi said. Steroids are not advised for home-isolated Covid patients with mild disease. They don’t then face a threat of steroid-induced diabetes, commonly seen in hospitalized and hypoxic patients who are administered steroids. But most Covid-19 patients recovering at home mainly rely on telephonic consultations. “Once a patient is advised home isolation and prescribed certain drugs, he or she does not turn up for follow-up checks. Many doctors running clinics in Pune have started reviewing home-isolated patients' conditions at regular intervals. But very few turn up,” said physician Sudhirkumar Mundle.

The orders were issued by PCS Jagjit Singh, in-charge of supplying oxygen cylinders to private hospitals and mini Covid care centres. Yashpal Garg, the nodal officer for oxygen supply, said the central government has fixed a daily quota of 20 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen for Chandigarh from INOX Barotiwala, Baddi. This medical oxygen is being utilized for GMCH, Sector 32, GMSH, Sector 16 and the Covid Hospital in Sector 48. Private health care institutions are also being catered to from this quota. Additionally, three oxygen generation plants have been commissioned recently in these hospitals, he added. He said the efforts put in by the administration have resulted in smooth supply of oxygen in the city. The consumption by some of the hospitals has considerably reduced because of efforts of optimum utilization and conservation by check of wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-increases-o2-cylinder-quota-of-private-hospitals/articleshow/82717532.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

City unit president K Sankarapandi who led the protest, in which the protesters were blindfolded to symbolise the ignorance of the union government, said the union government should immediately release the GST dues to Tamil Nadu to facilitate the fight against the pandemic. Float washes ashore in Ramnad due to winds: A five-foot long rectangular float washed ashore near Dhanushkodi in Ramanathapuram. It had two conicalstructures representing traffic cones used on roads with reflective stickers on it. Police sources said the float was deployed in the mid sea to help passage of ships and vessels.

On Sunday, a 36-year-old Covid-positive man, who had been brought in from Dehradun in a serious condition, died at AIIMS Rishikesh after being diagnosed as afflicted with black fungus. It was Uttarakhand's first recorded black fungus death. The state government has also issued an advisory with treatment procedures to be followed in black fungus deaths. Uttarakhand has reported 26 cases of black fungus infection so far, of which, 18 were operated and their eyes, nose bones, cheek bones were removed, to save the patient's life. Harish Thapliyal, public relations officer, AIIMS Rishikesh, told TOI the hospital has formed a team of 15 doctors - under the leadership of ENT surgeon Dr Amit Tyagi - to deal with the fungal infection. The infection is mainly affecting Covid patients who are diabetics and those who have been put on steroids. “Since a large number of Covid patients are admitted in AIIMS, fungal infection is being taken seriously. The team will monitor the disease, issue guidelines, take precautions and treat patients,” he said. Dr Tyagi, the ENT surgeon at AIIMS, said the hospital has received 22 cases till Monday - most of them in the last 3-4 days. Among the 22 cases, 15 had undergone surgery. Of the 15 cases, 12 are active Covid cases, while others have recovered. “In all the cases, the fungus was found affecting parts of the head and face. All are having immunosuppressants, that is, steroids on their medicine list for Covid. Apart from surgery, anti-fungal treatments in the form of amphotericin-B is being administered,” Dr Tyagi added. Professor Ravikant, director AIIMS, said that steroid administration to patients has been advised only when required as per the national and international Covid guidelines. Meanwhile, health secretary, Amit Negi, said that a committee has been formed in the state to tackle black fungus. The panel - headed by VC of Uttarakhand Medical University - has already issued a detailed treatment protocol which has been shared with hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mandatory-black-fungus-test-for-all-covid-19-patients-with-comorbidities-aiims-rishikesh/articleshow/82717574.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||‘Will govt let people die for want of injections?’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday came down heavily on the state government and the Centre for the reduced supply of remdesivir to the state since the Union government centralized its allocation. The court asked if patients should be allowed to die for the want of the medicine. The high court told the Centre to ensure that Gujarat gets enough vials and patients do not die. One of the judges even remarked, “On a lighter note, the Centre would not give any stepmotherly treatment to Gujarat.” The Centre’s counsel replied that it is being accused of doing otherwise. Gujarat began getting, on average, 16,500 vials per day; it earlier claimed that it used to procure, on average, 20,000 vials per day. The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Karia was not ready to buy the governments’ assertion that the allocation of remdesivir to Gujarat from April 21 to May 23 was 5.10 lakh vials and the figure showed an increase in supply. The judges got angry when the state government said that its daily requirement is 25,000 vials and it has requested the Centre to increase the quota. Justice Karia repeatedly asked about the real demand and the steps that were being taken to persuade the Centre to increase the quota. He observed that records were silent on this aspect. “What will happen to patients who require this? Will the government allow them to die for the want of injections?” the judge said. “The state and the Centre both have to answer this. If the demand was 25,000 vials per day, what steps were taken? It has been stagnant at 16,500 vials since last one month whereas the demand was consistently for 25,000 vials.” The court pulled up the Centre for doing nothing in this regard even after the manufacturer ramped up production from 35 lakh vials to 1 crore vials per day. “The Centre should see that enough quota is given otherwise people will die and the patients will remain in hospitals for 10 more days. Who will bear the expenditure?” the judge asked. The court criticized the remdesivir supply management for “total lack of coordination”. It also inquired about a mechanism to verify the actual demand. The HC sought an explanation from the Centre about the short supply of remdesivir and where the stock is being diverted. “People of Gujarat are deprived of these injections. Stick to day-to-day requirement and supply. The state asked for 25,000 vials per day,” the court told the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-govt-let-people-die-for-want-of-injections/articleshow/82719572.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt likely to give special relief package to affected districts||MUMBAI: The state government is likely to consider a special compensation package under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for the districts affected by Cyclone Tauktae. State cabinet minister Uday Samant, who is also Ratnagiri guardian minister, demanded a special relief package on the lines of that given last year to those affected by Cyclone Nisarga, which had made a landfall in Raigad district. “Several trees that were 30-40 years old have been uprooted. Mango growers have been most impacted; they have reported huge losses,” he said. Large-scale losses were reported from Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts on Monday. According to preliminary estimates, seven people have died, 2,500 structurespartly damaged, and thousands of trees, especially mango trees, have been ravaged due to the intense rain and gusty winds. Most of these districts have also reported large-scale damage to the power infrastructure. Last year, in the wake of Cyclone Nisarga, the state government had hiked the per hectare compensation under NDRF for horticultural land to Rs 50,000 from Rs 25,000, for damaged houses to Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 95,000, and for partially damaged houses to Rs 15,000 from Rs 6,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-likely-to-give-special-relief-package-to-affected-dists/articleshow/82722149.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Over 64,000 rural healthcare and frontline staff yet to get second jab||PUNE: More than 64,000 healthcare (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) in rural Pune are yet to receive their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines, a report by the zilla parishad (ZP) has said. Ayush Prasad, CEO of the ZP, said given the high pendency, these individuals (total of 64,859) would be given shots on priority during upcoming vaccine drives. “Most of these HCWs and FLWs received Covaxin in the first round. There was a supply issue with the vaccine and many could not get their second dose on time,” Prasad said. According to the report, 14,340 HCWs and 50,519 FLWs are yet to get their follow-up shots. Officials from the ZP said a total of 48,674 HCWs were given their first shots in Pune rural. And most were given their shots during the first four weeks of the vaccine drive. “But their second doses were delayed due to varied reasons. A significant number of HCWs got infected by the virus after receiving their first dose so they had to wait to complete the stipulated gap. Secondly, some of the HCWs were confused about the intervals between the first and second jabs,” a senior official from the health department said. As for the frontline workers, the health department official said, “Initially, their response to vaccination was limited. But as cases began increasing in the first week of March, many started to come forward. By the time their second dose was due, the Centre had extended the interval between the shots.” Data showed that Khed tehsil has administered the lowest number of second doses to FLWs, among the 13 tehsils that make up rural Pune. A total of 12,517 FLWs there have been given the first dose. But only 3,229 have received the second. Dr BB Gadve, tehsil health officer, Khed, said, “Shortage of vaccine doses and poor response from FLWs are the reasons. We’re now making a list of beneficiaries to administer the second dose as soon as possible.” However, some HCWs and FLWs said they were unable to get their second shots despite visiting vaccination centres. “We were worried about catching Covid because scores of people were gathering at these sites. So we kept delaying our second dose,” a police constable from the Loni Kalbhor station said. A senior zilla parishad official said, “It’s the healthcare workers who are most at risk of catching Covid as many work at health centres. So we’ll finish their vaccination at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-64000-rural-healthcare-and-frontline-staff-yet-to-get-second-jab/articleshow/82719571.cms||Sandip Dighe

Besides, Khattar also apprised Shah of the present Covid-19 situation in Haryana and arrangements made by the state government to contain the virus. Later, while interacting with media, Khattar confirmed his discussion with Shah. He added the state government would act as per the directions given by the Centre. Replying to a question on the Hisar clash, the CM said the incident was discussed in detail with the Union minister, wherein he also agreed that it was not appropriate to oppose a hospital’s inauguration.

---||Kochi||Kerala: CG, Navy rescue crew of stranded boats||KOCHI: An advanced light helicopter (ALH) of the Southern Naval Command of Indian Navy, rescued four crew members stranded onboard a tug that ran aground rocks close to the coast of New Mangalore on Monday morning. In another incident, the Indian Coast Guard Ship (ICGS) Aryaman rescued 12 fishermen from a stranded fishing boat off Ponnani coast on Sunday night. The boat was floating dead in the rough sea due to engine failure. In the first incident, the tug Coromondal Supporter XI, with four persons on board, drifted outside the New Mangalore port limits due to heavy winds and rough waves and ran aground rocks in the sea on Monday early morning. Even though ICGS Varaha, the offshore patrol vessel (OPV) of the Coast Guard came to their help, the vessel could not approach the tug due to high waves. Later, the Navy was informed to intervene. “The helo got airborne from INS Garuda at Kochi and after re-fuelling at Mangalore airport, undertook the rescue mission by winching them from the stranded tug. Inclement weather conditions prevailing due to cyclone Tauktae accentuated by proximity of rocks made the rescue challenging operation. The seamen were provided medical emergency treatment at Mangalore airport,” said the Navy in a statement. ICGS Aryaman came to the rescue of a boat IFB Jesus, registered in Tamil Nadu, stranded in the sea for the last two days. The coordinated search for the missing boat by air and sea assets of the Coast Guard resulted in locating IFB Jesus. “The Coast Guard Dornier identified the marooned boat and vectored Coast Guard Ship Aryaman for rescue operation. All 12 personnel drifting in the boat were first provided food, water and first aid, subsequently efforts to operationalize the defect onboard IFB Jesus were futile due to rough sea conditions and spare requirements. The boat along with all crew was towed to Kochi and were handed over to fisheries authorities,” said Coast Guard district commander (Kerala & Mahe) DIG Sanatan Jena, in a statement. Cyclone Tauktae, which left its impact off Kerala and Karnataka coast, is now slowly moving north towards Gujarat coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cg-navy-rescue-crew-of-stranded-boats/articleshow/82719593.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Over 30 people administered Covishield but given certificate of Covaxin in Doon||Dehradun: Over 30 people at a vaccination centre in the city’s MKP College premises were administered Covishield but were given certificates of Covaxin on Monday. When this was pointed out by the beneficiaries, the centre authorities claimed it to be a technical error and said that fresh certificates will be issued. The faux pas meanwhile left the beneficiaries in a state of confusion as many of them alleged that in official records, they will be eligible for the next dose after 4 to 6 weeks (as per Covaxin protocol) whereas as per Covishield protocol, they would be required to get the next dose only after 12 weeks. Talking to TOI, a beneficiary said that he had been trying to get a slot for vaccination for the past 15 days and when he got one, it came as utter disappointment. “I intentionally booked a slot for Covaxin, which was available at the MKP College centre, as shown on CoWin app. But when I reached the centre, they administered me Covishield instead. When I questioned the staff there, the nurses and a few guards with a minister standing there told me ‘how does it matter, it's ‘just a vaccine,’” said the beneficiary. Another beneficiary added that promising Covaxin and administering Covishield is still something he can understand but what came after that was nothing less than “criminal”. “We got Covishield but our certificates said that it was Covaxin. When I and a few others pointed this out, the nurses there expressed helplessness in rectifying the mistake,” said the beneficiary. A senior health department official told TOI that the MKP vaccination centre was inaugurated on Monday and it was pre-decided that the centre will administer Covaxin. “But something went wrong at the end of the chief medical officer (CMO) office and the MKP centre received Covishield instead. Now, the staff nurses administered the vaccine that was available there but because CoWin had Covaxin listed there, the beneficiaries started getting Covaxin certificates. The matter was later resolved,” added the official. Saroj Naithani, director, National Health Mission (NHM), meanwhile said that only a few people were administered Covishield and the issue was rectified immediately after it came to light. “We have re-issued the certificates to people who got Covishield but were given certificates for Covaxin,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-30-people-administered-covishield-but-given-certificate-of-covaxin-in-doon/articleshow/82717581.cms||Ishita Mishra

No efforts were taken to maintain physical distancing even as police were posted at the markets. All the stalls in the farmers’ markets in Anna Nagar and Bibikulam were crowded. Traders also jacked up the price of vegetables. For instance, ladies finger with a fixed price of Rs 12 per kg was being sold at Rs 20 per kg. Most of the produce were also not fresh due to difficulties in bringing them to the market owing to the lockdown. Several people thronged grocery stores to stock essentials. Store owners aimed to sell as much as they could before 10am, compromising physical distance. Similarly, meat stalls and fish stalls were also crowded. Many parts of the city were crowded and some arterial roads witnessed traffic congestion. “It does not look like a lockdown day,” said a trader in Thayir Market. The city police enforced curbs on movement after 10am. They closed many of the city roads such as East Masi Street and East Marret Street to stop unnecessary movement. Consumers were allowed to park their vehicles outside and walk into East Masi street to purchase groceries to prevent crowding. Only commercial vehicles involved in transporting essentials were allowed on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/people-crowd-shops-violate-lockdown-norms-in-madurai/articleshow/82719568.cms||---

They are working, risking their own lives and fulfilling the expectation of the government,” he said. To a question on oxygen requirement for Madurai, Nehru said, “It is being procured from available places. Establishment of new oxygen plants in Madurai is also being encouraged. The government is ready to tackle if there is a third wave.” Nehru also inaugurated a 200-bed siddha centre to treat Covid-19 patients at the American College.

A month after he returned, Major Khan (47) died of Covid-19 in Patiala on Monday. Khan, associated with Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab, was infected with Covid some days ago. He retired from the Indian Army in 2016 as naib subedar from Armoured Corps in 18 Cavalry. Belonging to Jhandi village in Patiala, Khan, when farmers left for Delhi on November 26, accompanied them with a water tanker and ration in a trolley. At the Singhu border, Khan made many arrangements — including lodging, preparing flags and arranging water, said Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal with a heavy heart. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said Khan was an asset. He was in support of farmers from the start. “We have lost a brave soldier on all the fronts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/major-khan-ex-soldier-who-took-part-in-farm-stir-dies-of-covid-month-after-return/articleshow/82722150.cms||---

Last week, the state government mandated people entering Maharashtra from any state to carry a negative RT-PCR report (not older than 48 hours). The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities told TOI that it was the job of the railways to ensure that passengers not carrying the report are not allowed to board trains. “There are many passengers coming to the Pune station each day without the report. Our team is conducting thermal scans and rapid antigen tests for these people. It’s the job of the railway authorities,” Sanjeev Vavare, the assistant medical officer with the PMC said.  Contrarily, the railway authorities said they have taken steps. “All passengers are informed about the state guidelines and the IRCTC website has also been updated to alert the passengers. The railways have been conducting thermal screening of passengers boarding the trains,” Shivaji Sutar, the chief public relations officer at the Central Railway, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-entry-to-rail-passengers-sans-ve-reports/articleshow/82719631.cms||Joy Sengupta

The PMR had recorded 2,182 cases on March 15 and since then daily cases have stayed above the Monday’s tally. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal areas added less than 1,000 new cases each in the last 24 hours. While the PMC areas recorded 684 new cases, the PCMC limits added 846 new patients. The rural areas recorded 1,653 new cases on Monday. The PMC area’s tally of 684 cases was the lowest since March 1. As many as 22,488 samples were tested in the region on Monday as against 32,878 tests conducted on Sunday. A drop in testing pulled down the new additions though the region has been witnessing a steady drop in daily cases since the last couple of weeks. On Monday, the region had a positivity rate of 14.2%. Besides, as many as 9,838 patients recovered in the region on Monday, which included discharges of 4,981 from the rural pockets. A report by the district health officer, Bhagwan Pawar, stated that the progressive recoveries in the region increased to 8.86 lakh, while positive caseload was at 9.72 lakh on Monday evening. As many as 108 patients succumbed to the infection in the region on Monday. These included 43 casualties each in the PMC and PCMC limits.

The region’s active caseload dropped further to 71,098 on Monday, which included 46,372 patients in home isolation and 24,726 being admitted to various hospitals. A majority of new cases are now being reported from the rural pockets of PMR, which officials attributed to increased testing in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tests-dip-days-detections-drop-to-over-2-month-low/articleshow/82719604.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Dehradun||Covid curfew in Uttarakhand extended till May 25||DEHRADUN: The week-long statewide curfew which started in Uttarakhand on May 11 has now been extended by one more week till May 25. Covid-19 cases in the state are on a decline but are still alarmingly high, prompting the state government to extend the lockdown. “In Doon, a fortnight-long curfew has been successful in bringing down the Covid numbers. However, they are still high. Therefore, we have decided to extend the curfew by one more week. If the guidelines are properly followed, we are confident of seeing a dip in the numbers in the next one week,” state agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said. It was also decided that people who had to leave the state for an emergency, like a health crisis or a death, and wanted to come back, can do so by obtaining e-passes. Right now, anyone entering Uttarakhand needs a negative RT-PCR report and a registration on the Smart City Portal, but that can be relaxed in emergency cases, the government has decided. Uttar Pradesh was allowed an exemption, residents of the state can now enter Uttarakhand without any document and by just registering on the Smart City Portal. “There have been instances of people having to go out of the state because of the death of a family member or a relative. In case of such emergencies, we have decided to issue e-passes, which can be shown to gain entry into the state,” Uniyal said. For funerals, 20 people will be allowed for prayers, four for ash immersion, and when travelling in a vehicle, funeral attendees must ensure 50% occupancy. Patient’s attendants can travel during curfew with a copy of the doctor’s prescription. Banks are allowed to be open from 10 am to 2pm each day. This will apply to the other financial institutions of the state. Fair price government shops, which were earlier allowed to be open from 7 am to 10 am on only Fridays, can open during this window on all days. Bakery shops and grocery shops will also open in the same timings. Also, industrial units have been asked to ensure the safety of their employees. Uniyal dded that people should postpone weddings as much as possible. After it turned out that weddings were fueling rising Covid numbers in the hills, where testing and health facilities are not readily available, the number of wedding attendees in Uttarakhand was capped at 20 (including bride and groom) and RT-PCR tests were made mandatory for all guests. When announcing the lockdown in early May, the government had also made it mandatory for residents of the plain districts of Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to carry RT-PCR reports when travelling to the remaining districts of the state, which are situated in the upper reaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-curfew-in-ukhand-extended-till-may-25/articleshow/82717620.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Bhopal||Stay safe from cyber risks: Advance fee frauds for Covid-19 tests see a rise in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh state cyber cell headquarters has issued a fresh advisory warning that the scammers have changed their modus operandi and are now targeting health care institutions impersonating as army personnel, posted in some distant land, while requesting to get Covid and other tests done for their family members. In lieu of advance payment for the tests, money is transferred from your account by cyber criminals. Officers have already received couple of complaints in the last one week, one is from a prominent hospital of the city. They are cheating in lieu of advance payment for the tests, officials say. As per the advisory scammers impersonate as army personnel while contacting hospitals, doctors and pathologies, requesting an advance booking for Covid-19 and other relevant tests for their family members on grounds that they are posted at a distant place. For the advance payment of the tests, they ask for your payment wallet number on PHONEPE, GOOGLEPAY or PAYTM and total amount to be paid for all the tests, through WhatsApp. Their WhatsApp display picture (DP) is in army uniform further making your belief stronger, said an officer. “In the name of verification of their account, the fraudster asks you to make transfer of Rs 5-10 to their account and immediately returns the amount to your account to gain your trust,” advisory says. As soon as you are convinced, the fraudsters send you a reverse request of the said amount on phonepe, googlepay or paytm and request you to follow his instructions in order to receive the payment. “Citing the Army's rules, they ask you perform the process quickly. As soon as you click on the request and enter the UPI PIN, the said amount is withdrawn from your account instead of receiving. This type of modus has been attempted with 2 reputed hospitals of Bhopal. Similar crimes can also be attempted against service providers like CA, lawyer, medical practitioners etc,” say officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/stay-safe-from-cyber-risks-advance-fee-frauds-for-covid-19-tests-see-a-rise/articleshow/82719625.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: School dropout’s Oxygen-auto ferries Covid positives for free||NAGPUR: Extreme situations churn out innovative responses. Confronted with one such situation, Anand Vardewar, 34-year-old autorickshaw driver from Pardi in city, has emerged a life-saver for many. “Two Covid-19 patients died in my autorickshaw while I was ferrying them from one hospital to another in search of oxygen beds in April. Shaken by the experience, I decided to do something for the distressed patients,” Vardewar, who converted his three-wheeler into a life-saving unit, told TOI. Vardewar, who dropped out of school after Class V, converted his autorickshaw into a mobile ambulance with oxygen facility. He has also obtained permission from regional transport office to ferry patients in his three-wheeler, apart from undergoing two-day training at a city hospital to learn how to operate oxygen cylinder installed in his autorickshaw. His decision was also driven by the fact that there weren’t many ambulances and those available were charging exorbitantly to ferry patients. Many Covid patients had died while running from pillar to post in search of oxygen and ICU beds. Since April, Vardewar has shifted as many as 22 serious Covid patients from rural parts of Nagpur to city hospitals. “When Covid surge began in March this year, many relatives of distressed patients had approached me for help in shifting them to hospitals in the city,” he said. Earlier, Vardewar used to ferry the patients to any hospital. But death of two patients in his autorickshaw prompted Vardewar to do something worthwhile. He discussed this with family members and Tiger Autorickshaw Sanghatana (TAS). Vardewar modified his autorickshaw into a mobile ambulance using all his and wife’s savings, with only aim to serve the needy for free. “Vilas Bhalekar, founder of TAS, took me to transport department officials who too supported me in this cause,” he said. Now, Vardewar’s small ambulance is equipped with oxygen, oximeter, sanitiser and first aid kit. Besides, he has also kept a box of masks, disposable hand gloves and PPE kits. He has been driving autorickshaw for 20 years. “All three in the family, including mother, supported the idea wholeheartedly. My wife, who works as lab technician in a private hospital, helped me get trained in operating oxygen cylinder,” he said. “As I stay in Pardi area, which is almost the boundary of Nagpur city, I provide my services mostly to patients from rural areas,” he explained. Vardewar also said he never faced any problem in refilling the oxygen cylinder as industries in Maa Umiya Industrial Estate extended support to get the cylinder refilled free of cost. In order to help more needy patients, he has also displayed his contact numbers (7350179484 / 8459759398) prominently on the three-wheeler. In the last 48 hours, Vardewar has helped at least six patients — mostly from Varode village on Nagpur-Bhandara road — who were in dire need of hospitalization. He also admitted that he has defaulted on two EMIs of his autorickshaw which he bought two years ago. He spends around Rs1,000 every day in filling up the fuel tank and admits the task was cumbersome until last week. But now he is a bit relieved after a steady drop in Covid cases in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-dropouts-o2-auto-ferries-covid-ves-for-free/articleshow/82722153.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The fresh cases were detected from 53,756 tests and represent a positivity rate of 8.4%, the lowest since April 9 when the figure was 7.8% from 1,09, 398 tests. Monday, in fact, is the first time that the positivity figure has dipped below 10% since April 11, when the figure stood at 9.4% from 1,14,288 tests. While both the fresh cases and positivity rate have been steadily declining after hitting 28,395 cases on April 20 and 36.2% positivity on April 22, the fatalities remain alarmingly high. The city saw 340 people dying due to Covid in the last 24 hours, taking the overall toll to 21,846. The toll for May is now 5,699, which is the highest figure recorded in a single month and the month still has a fortnight left. April saw 5,120 Covid fatalities. The toll has gone up relentlessly after the first two Covid deaths in the month of March 2020, when the pandemic first made its presence felt in the capital. The following month saw 57 Covid fatalities, which increased to 414 in May. By June last year, however, Delhi government was able to bring things somewhat under control, by which time the death toll stood at 2,269. The death numbers remained comparatively low in the following few months, including in September when there was a mini surge, before rising again to 2,663 in November, during yet another spike was recorded in Covid cases. The number of Covid-19 fatalities started declining swiftly in December last year and remained on the lower side till March, which saw 117 people succumbing to the coronavirus. As the country’s second major wave started making itself ferociously felt, April recorded 5,120 Covid fatalities, with more than 170 deaths logged per day on average. May, however, has already seen 5,699 deaths, which represents, on average, a figure of 335 deaths every day, nearly double of April’s average figure and almost four times the average noted in November 2020. With 10,918 patients recovering from Covid on Sunday, the number of active cases in the city stood at 56,049, compared with 62,783 on Sunday. Of these, 35,141 individuals are recuperating in home isolation. The number of patients admitted in hospitals is 15,542. Of the cumulative 24,104 hospital beds earmarked for Covid patients, 8,562 beds are now vacant as per the health bulletin released by Delhi government. There are 6,257 beds in the dedicated Covid care centres, and on Monday 708 were occupied, the remaining 5,549 vacant. In the Covid health centres, 472 of the 606 beds are now unoccupied. The 4,524 positive cases on Monday were the result of testing 53,756 individuals in the last 24 hours. The day’s testing involved 41,849 RT-PCR tests and 11,907 rapid antigen tests. While the city was carrying out close to one lakh tests a day till recently, the testing numbers have slipped down of late. Delhi government ascribes the dip to the ongoing lockdown, which has resulted in few people venturing out of their homes and visiting public places like markets where large-scale testing used to take place earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/silver-lining-in-deadliest-month-till-date/articleshow/82719672.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Hyderabad||Eli Lilly inks voluntary licencing deal with Natco for Covid drug Baricitinib||Hyderabad: US drug giant Eli Lilly has finally inked a royalty-free, non-exclusive voluntary licensing pact with the Hyderabad-based company for manufacturing and commercialisation of Baricitinib for Covid-19 treatment. With this, Natco Pharma on Monday said it has withdrawn the compulsory licence (CL) application it had filed with Indian Patent Office earlier this month. Sources said Natco had forced US drug giant Eli Lilly to the negotiating table by first filing a CL application for Baricitinib and then rolled out a much cheaper generic version of the drug before the patent waiver nod. Natco had approached Eli Lilly late last year for a voluntary licence for Baricitinib, which the latter sells under the Olumiant brand, sources said. However, after the biggie refused to engage, Natco approached the Indian drug regulators for an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the drug, which prevents a cytokine storm and is used along with Remdesivir in hospitalised Covid-19 patients. As soon as Natco got the EUA from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), it filed a CL application and rolled out the drug under its own brand Barinat with the 4mg tablet at Rs 30 each (Rs 420 for a 14-day regimen), a fraction (1%) of the average pricing of Rs 3,230 per tablet for Olumiant. TOI was the first to report on May 7, 2021, that Natco had launched the drug even as its CL was with pending with the Controller General of Patents. Natco has since also rolled out the 1mg and 2mg strength Barinat at Rs 15 and 20 per tablet. As soon as Natco filed for CL, Eli Lilly had announced that it would be “working with local Indian pharma companies to execute royalty-free voluntary licensing agreements to accelerate manufacturing and distribution of the medicine in India during the pandemic”. It went on to sign deals with players such as Cipla, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, MSN Labs, Lupin and Torrent Pharma. In its CL application, filed under Section 92 of Patents Act, Natco had cited unmet medical needs due to lack of supply and affordability in light of the national public health emergency as the main grounds. Natco’s application had said that Olumiant was not manufactured in India and less than 9,000 tablets were imported in 2019 and 2020 each, which were enough to meet the needs of only around 600 patients. In 2012-13, Natco became the first company in India to apply for and get a CL for Bayer’s cancer drug Nexavar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eli-lilly-inks-voluntary-licencing-deal-with-natco-for-covid-drug-baricitinib/articleshow/82721695.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Ahmedabad||Tauktae: HC questions vaccine drive break||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court questioned the logic behind suspending the Covid-19 vaccination programme across the state for two days citing Cyclone Tauktae, which made landfall on the Saurashtra coast late on Monday. Senior advocate Percy Kavina for the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association raised the issue and complained that such a break would adversely affect the campaign and add to the backlog in different categories. On this, Justice Bela Trivedi questioned the rationale behind suspending the programme for two days. “Is it that all the authorities are busy? Every authority has nothing to do with vaccination. There is no need to stop vaccination as such. It has no correlation. Some authorities will be busy, but at all places? There does not appear to be any cogent reason in suspending vaccination,” the judge remarked. The high court asked the state government whether it has any plans to include the workers engaged in special homes, though they are not designated frontline workers, to consider them for priority vaccination. It insisted that staff members and even inmates of old age homes be vaccinated on priority basis. The state government agreed to consider this. Before this, the lawyers’ association requested the court to ask the government to give priority to ASHA workers in vaccination because they are frontline workers. It also demanded MBBS students who have been assigned Covid duty be vaccinated on priority basis because they are taking a risk others are not ready to take. The state government informed the court that of the 6.5 crore estimated people in the state, which the Centre estimates to be 6.9 crore, as many as 1.47 crore doses have already been administered. The court wanted to know how many people have been left out in various categories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-hc-questions-vaccine-drive-break/articleshow/82719787.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Medics sound alert as kids with Covid develop MIS-C||HYDERABAD: After the shortage of remdesivir and amphotericin injections, Telangana may soon stare at a shortage of IV immunoglobulins in future, doctors warned, even as an increasing number of cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are being recorded. While the term MIS-C was coined after the pandemic hit the world, the disease similar to the Kawasaki disease, where multiple organs are impacted is being diagnosed increasingly in children. Children up to 15 years of age who have recovered from Covid-19 or had come in contact with an infected elder are vulnerable to the disease, say doctors, describing how they are getting sick, developing fever and going into shock within four weeks of showing Covid-19 symptoms. Hospitals say more instances of MIS-C are being reported in the second wave. “While we saw two types of patients last year, some who presented with shock and others who didn’t, but this year we are seeing more cases with shock. We have seen 12 cases so far this year,” said Dr Dinesh Kumar Chirla, director intensive care services Rainbow Children’s group of hospitals. The Rainbow group of hospitals alone had seen 84 cases of MIS-C in the city last year and going by the trends, it will soon overshadow those numbers, doctors say. “We are already counselling parents so that they are mentally prepared that the children could land up with MIS-C and at the time of consultation we are asking them to come back if they develop symptoms,” said Chirla. Laboratory evidence of MIS-C include raised inflammatory markers like D-dimer, CRP levels, ferritin, LDH levels apart from RT-PCR positive status from exposure to a Covid positive person. “MIS-C can present with any problem with any organ because of immunological cells affecting blood vessels, causing clots, aneurisms and severe shock. The involvement of the heart muscle is common here, which means the early recognition is extremely important. MIS-C among kids is on the rise and is going to increase in the next few weeks and more so after the third wave. The demand then will rise for IV Immunoglobulin,” said Dr Shivaranjani Santosh, chief consultant paediatrician, Magna centres who has seen four cases in the last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/medics-sound-alert-as-kids-with-covid-develop-mis-c/articleshow/82721488.cms||Amrita Didyala

Additionally, a 100 MT generation plant would also be set up in Hyderabad. The CM also asked the oxygen producers to hand over 11 tankers with each having the capacity of 20 tonnes within 10 days, to ensure Telangana should not face a situation where it is depended on other states for the supply of oxygen. KCR held a review meeting with health department officials on Covid-19 situation in the state on Monday. He urged the people utilize the government hospitals service for free treatment, saying all medicines and oxygen are available in government hospitals and asked people not to spend huge amounts by going to private hospitals since the treatment is one and the same in private and government hospitals. “Government hospitals should be given top priority for supply of oxygen where the poor are undergoing treatment and there should not be any shortage of oxygen in the government hospitals come what may,” KCR said. On the charges against private hospitals, KCR said the government had issued GO-248, 11 months back fixing the tariff of the hospitals beds for Covid 19 patients in the private hospitals. Officials informed him that Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and UP among other states were following the same guidelines. They said patients taking treatment in the private hospitals are themselves paying fee. On the alarming rise of black fungal cases in Covid 19 patients, KCR asked the officials to make arrangement for the equipment and the required medicines at ENT hospital in Koti, Gandhi hospital in Secunderabad, medical college hospitals in the districts to treat the black fungal disease. “For this, if required 25 Microdebrider machines, HD Endoscopic cameras should be purchased immediately,” the chief minister said. Officials informed that so far, the state had received 57,30,220 doses of vaccine and as on date there is a stock of 1,86,780 doses which include 58,230 doses of Covaxin and 1, 28, 550 doses of Covishield. The CM instructed officials to float global tenders for supply of the vaccines. He also asked the officials to have continuous rapport with the Centre on the vaccination quota and get the vaccines to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oxygen-plants-in-48-hospitals-more-equipment-as-telangana-gears-up-to-face-third-wave/articleshow/82721395.cms||Koride Mahesh

The precautionary messages are relayed regularly to ensure people remain vigilant and not drop their guard against the virus. While wearing masks and maintaining social distance has been mandatory in mosques, they are also limiting the number of devotees for prayers. “Through its messaging, the mosque in my locality tells devotees not to turn up at the mosque and offer prayers from home. Only few are permitted to offer prayers at the mosque and they have to adhere to Covid protocols,” Mohammed Jameeluddin from Purnipura told TOI. “People are aware of the current scenario...the lockdown has worked effectively as people are staying indoors and safe. Besides this, special prayers are also being offered to get rid of the virus and we have distributed cards with special recitations among people,” said Syed Muneeruddin Muqtar, president of the Take ki Masjid in Nampally. Maulana Hafiz Abdul Razzaq from Moghalpura told TOI that messages are being forwarded on various social media groups asking people to follow the rules enforced by the government. “All efforts are being taken to make people realise the importance of life and its protection from the virus. Right from the beginning, social distance is being maintained and masks are being worn by devotees. Only few are allowed to offer prayers in the mosques and we keep in touch with them through social media,” Maulana Hafiz said. Elsewhere, some in Old City have urged the government to consider a slight relaxation of operation hours as earnings of vegetable, fruit vendors and other small-scale traders have taken a huge hit due to the limited working hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mosques-use-azaan-to-prod-people-to-follow-covid-norms/articleshow/82721633.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hard to distinguish infections in IBD patients who contract Covid-19: Doctors||HYDERABAD: Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are already on medications that reduce their immunity, are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19, according to experts. They also pointed out that overlapping symptoms also make it hard to distinguish between an IBD flare-up and Covid-19 in such patients. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disorder in which patients experience chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. IBD patients may experience diarrhoea, bloody stools, wight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue, informed Dr Kiran Peddi, senior gastroenterologist at Yashoda Hospitals, Somajiguda. While the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever and cough, IBD patients who contract the disease may also experience diarrhoea and other digestive issues. “This can create confusion with an IBD flare. Inflammatory markers in blood can be elevated in both the conditions. Additional symptoms such as fatigue, muscle aches and headaches are suggestive of Covid-19 and can help in differentiating between the two,” said Dr Kiran Peddi. “However, IBD patients who do not have Covid-19 should not stop medication despite the risk and instead reduce the dose of steroids,” Dr Kiran Peddi advised. Other experts said IBD symptoms may vary from mild to severe, depending on the severity of of inflamation and location of the disease. There can be periods of active illness (flares) followed by periods of remission (inactivity). “While the exact cause of disease remains unknown, immune system malfunction is a possible cause. Heredity also seems to play a role in IBD. However with a recent increase in the number of cases in India (2nd largest number of cases after USA) an overlap of genetic factors, environmental factors (diet etc) and stress is being considered to be the cause of IBD,” said Dr KS Somasekhar Rao, consultant gastroenterologist and hepatologist at Apollo Institutes of Gastroenterology, Jubilee Hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hard-to-distinguish-infections-in-ibd-patients-who-contract-covid-19-docs/articleshow/82721549.cms||Amrita Didyala

This, diabetologists fear, may make people prone to mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus. Diabetologists said that they have encountered several cases wherein the sugar levels of Covid-19 recovered patients were as high as 200-400 for almost two to three weeks. “In the last one month, I have come across almost 12 patients referred from different hospitals complaining of sugar levels of 300-400 post recovery. These were mostly patients who were put on two to three weeks of steroids,” said Dr Dilip Gude, chief physician and diabetologist, Virinchi hospitals, adding that if the sugar levels go beyond 200, one must seek supervision on orals or injectables. In many cases, doctors observed that even people who were pre-diabetic turned diabetic post-steroid induced recovery. “Once people recover from Covid-19, they should constantly check their sugar and bring it under control. One must continue taking insulin until sugar levels come back to baseline. If sugar levels are not controlled, it can result in several post-recovery complications including stroke,” said Dr Sanjoy Paul, diabetologist at Paul’s Clinic, Banjara Hills. Doctors said that recovery from Covid-19 causes a lot of stress on the body resulting rise in sugar levels. Steroids, although used in small doses for recovery, tend to amplify the sugar levels further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uncontrolled-sugar-levels-pose-risk-to-recovered-covid-patients/articleshow/82721806.cms||---
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Foreign educated medical approach Supreme Court for aid to join Covid-19 care workforce||AGRA: The Association of MD Physicians, All India Foreign Medical Graduates and Russian Medical Graduates Associations have approached the Supreme Court seeking directions to states to allow all foreign medical graduates (FMGs) to join the Covid-19 healthcare workforce with facilities at par with MBBS graduates. President of Association of MD Physicians, Dr Rajesh Rajan, said, though many states, including Karnataka, Gujarat, have started the process of appointing FMGs to their state Covid teams, many are still reluctant. Over 50,000 such medicos are waiting for the government nod, he said. “Several National Medical Council (NMC) members have already written to its chairman to support the movement to stabilise and support our burnt-out Covid warriors,” he said, adding that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has officially released a press note stating the importance of FMG doctors during this crisis. He told TOI that if FMG doctors are ready to work as interns without any stipend for one year, the government should immediately take their services after registering them. “We all know about the shortage of doctors across the country. Almost every day we are losing doctors, including specialists. The existing teams are exhausted due to continuous work for the past one year,” Dr Rajan said, adding that the third wave will be more disastrous and medicos are needed to tackle it. There is need to plan ahead, he added. “We have readymade doctors then why is the government not allowing them to work,” he questioned, adding that the government has no issues if veterinary doctors are working with Covid teams but they are not ready to absorb FMGs. The petitioners stated that FMGs are doctors who have obtained their primary medical degrees equivalent to MBBS from outside India. The petition seeks a one-time exemption for their members and for all other such doctors eligible to take the foreign medical graduate exam in order to augment the health infrastructure of the country. Dr Kishan Kumar from Gujarat, who completed his MBBS from Russia, told TOI, “Though we got permission to work with Covid team, this is a temporary one for 90 days only. We are ready to serve the country for one year without any financial assistance but the government should give us permanent registration.” Around 2,500 such doctors are available in the state, he added. One of the foreign medical graduates from Prayagraj, Pushkar Tewari, who completed his MBBS from Kyrgyzstan, said that there are around 10,000 such doctors in the state awaiting the government nod. “Rural areas have also been affected with Covid and we are ready to work during the crisis for one-time exemption,” said Tewari, adding that biology teachers have also been roped in by the government but FMGs are not being allowed. The NMC had recently released draft regulations on FMGs. As per the draft, the overseas medical graduates will be required to qualify National Exit Test (NExT) in place of the Foreign Medical Graduate Exam (FMGE). The candidates intending to practise in India will have to clear NExT, within two years of completing their MBBS from abroad. Till 2020, the FMGE exam used to have only one-liner simple questions. The difficulty level of these questions was even less than NEET PG. As per the new draft, the students will now be asked to increase the difficulty level of their preparation to five times. According to sources, every year, around 40,000-50,000 graduates appear for the NExT and their pass percentage is just 9-18%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/foreign-educated-medicos-approach-sc-for-aid-to-join-covid-19-care-workforce/articleshow/82715457.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

On Sunday evening, a woman in her thirties was found along with six others on SG Road during curfew hours. When caught, she narrated a story of being involved in an accident. However, once the cops realized she was lying, she got into a scuffle with them, threw away the phone of one of the cops, and fled the scene with her friends. The incident occurred near Zodiac Square around 8.15pm. According to an FIR filed by ASI Vinesh Ramsingh, he along with other cops were patrolling the area when they spotted some men and women violating social distancing norms. The group had parked their cars on the service road and were talking to each other. One of the three women introduced herself as Vrunda Pandya to the police team and told them that an accident had taken place and they were negotiating about it. However, when the cops questioned all of them separately, each gave a different version of how the accident took place. The team asked for women cops to be sent to the spot, began taking photographs of the cars, and registering details to book the seven for violating of curfew norms. Seeing this, Pandya began arguing that the cops had no authority to take photographs of the vehicles. To prevent further allegations, one of the cops began videographing the incident on his phone. Pandya allegedly snatched the phone and threw it away, stated the FIR. Meanwhile, the cops told the group to come to Vastrapur police station for further legal procedure. Pandya told them that she had already had a talk with some officer at Vastrapur police station. She asked the four men and two women to go to the police station along with them. And as cops watched, the seven jumped into their vehicles and fled the spot.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After Monday’s rain, doctors say watch out for leptospirosis||MUMBAI: Doctors have advised those who got drenched in Monday’s rain or waded through waterlogged streets to watch out for fever or flu-like symptopms and seek medical help immediately. Executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said if people have waded through water, they should start preventive treatment or see a doctor as soon as symptoms like fever appear. “We hope not many were out because of the lockdown, but if they did wade through water, they should be watchful of leptospirosis,” she said. Other ailments typically seen during monsoon such as dengue and malaria may not see a spurt just yet. In 2020, monsoon-related ailments had seen a near 80% drop, presumably because pollution and other parameters had improved, Dr Gomare said.  The sudden change in temperature may bring some flu-like symptoms, said Dr Shashank Joshi, an endocrinologist and member of the state Covid taskforce. “If someone comes with fever and flu-like symptoms, both Covid and non-Covid tests must be done to check for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections,” he said.  Physician Dr Pratit Samdani said Covid comes with distinct symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, bodyache, loss of taste and smell, whereas seasonal flu is usually marked by runny nose, mild fatigue, etc. “Physicians don’t find it difficult to differentiate between the two as was dreaded last year,” he said, adding that one day’s rain may not increase viral fever cases but if the rain persists, it could.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-mondays-rain-docs-say-watch-out-for-leptospirosis/articleshow/82724370.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||‘Govt can’t have monopoly on all injections’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday insisted on creating a mechanism for treatment of mucormycosis and distribution of injections after the state government submitted that it has procured most of the stock of injections from the market. During the hearing of suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the high court and lawyers raised the issue regarding treatment of black fungus in Covid patients. Lawyers complained that injections were not available in market and even the state government had limited stock. The petitions demanded that the government create facilities for treatment of the disease in government hospitals. The advocate general informed the court that it has placed an order of 1,14,430 vials of Amphrotericin B injections and has sufficient stock as of now. He submitted that the injections can be procured privately, though the government tries to procure maximum stock. Justice Bela Trivedi asked, “Patients prefer private hospitals, but medicine is not available. Can they go to the government for it?” The government asserted that it would first take care of patients at public hospitals. It is not stopping others from procuring the medicine. The court asked the government to place a roadmap on how to deal with mucormycosis. “How will private hospitals deal with it since you have procured everything? How should they treat their patients?” Justice Trivedi questioned and then sought reply on how the state government will supply these injections to private hospitals. When advocate Anand Yagnik submitted that private hospitals are begging the government for medicines, Justice Trivedi said, “The government cannot have monopoly on all injections.” The HC said that a mechanism needs to be put in place to give quota to private hospitals and for every stage of treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-cant-have-monopoly-on-all-injections/articleshow/82719702.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 26 deaths, 600 treated so far for mucormycosis, say experts||NAGPUR: Data accumulated so far indicates that at least 26 persons have died of mucormycosis, out of almost 600 who have been afflicted by the black fungus in the district from March this year. The health department and district administration are yet to declare the official data regarding mucormycosis in public domain. According to sources, Nagpur Municipal Corporation has on Monday reached out to private hospitals seeking data on mucormycosis. NMC has asked each hospital management to furnish information about the number of patients treated, discharged and died at their premises. During a meeting at the office of the divisional commissioner, the Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals have been asked to form a team and special wards to tackle mucormycosis in a more dedicated manner. The government is currently working with limited data as many private hospitals are yet to furnish their records, said a source. It was also learnt that several patients may have died at home too due to various reasons, including high cost of the treatment for this disease. Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has so far treated 44 patients, with two deaths, since March this year while Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital’s ear, nose and throat (ENT) department has treated 19 with two deaths in the same period. With the issue of mucormycosis likely to be taken up by the judiciary this week, the administration is trying to compile data and information about the disease spread in the district. The disease hits Covid recovered patients and also those fighting Covid in hospital. With crucial drugs of the Amphotericin B family already in short supply, sources from the pharmaceutical sector said situation is unlikely to change in the next few days as there is a huge gap between demand, and supply and production. With no raw materials available, pharmaceutical companies too cannot do much about it. “Most of the pharmaceutical companies produce limited stock of Amphotericin B as there was not much demands for the drug in the past but now they are cancelling our orders,” said leading pharmacist Jai Tekchandani. Professor Dr Jeevan Vedi, head of the department of ENT at IGGMCH, said there should be no misconception regarding mucormycosis but a proper awareness regarding keeping immunity up, and maintaining hygiene, who are key to fight it. “The disease has been existing in the past too but it’s more now. It’s important to wear mask and also keep the surrounding clean. This fungus is all around us but due to strong immunity it fails to affect us,” said the ENT specialist and teaching faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/26-deaths-600-treated-so-far-for-mucormycosis-say-experts/articleshow/82722252.cms||Soumitra Bose

Only one person was injured, largely because most people were kept indoors by the rain as well as the lockdown-like restrictions, but several structures and parked vehicles were damaged. In Mumbai, 479 tree or branch fall incidents were reported (see box). Many of the trees were decades old and environmental activists rued it would seriously hurt the city’s green cover. In Thane, one person was injured, and seven vehicles and two houses were damaged after 72 tree collapses were reported from across the township since Sunday night. In Navi Mumbai, 53 tree falls were reported. Residential areas with heavy green cover like Bandra and Khar in the city reported the most incidents of trees being uprooted. “Visited parts of Bandra/Khar/Scruz. Sad tht many old trees uprooted @Reclamation, SV Rd, Pali Hill, Turner Rd!” BJP MLA from Bandra (West) Ashish Shelar tweeted. Dozens of trees were uprooted in Dadar and Mahim too, and a massive one fell at Hughes Road in south Mumbai. A tree fall on JVLR near Jogeshwari held up traffic for over an hour. Civic officials claimed following proper trimming of trees, no major injuries were reported. Tree experts disagreed and said the BMC’s tree-trimming exercise was unscientific and the many tree collapses were a result of it. Arborist Vaibhav Raje, who runs Treecotech, an arboriculture firm, said scientific trimming of trees was very important. To explain, he gave the example of a pilot project he had run in Colaba in 2019. Using a resistograph, an instrument that detects decay and cavities, he had studied the trees and found that they needed trimming to reduce the load and more space at the roots. “We need more proactive mechanisms to save trees. There is no preventive effort to save trees. We have lost many trees that could have been saved. The BMC needs to put in place a proper risk assessment plan for trees. If this goes on, the city’s green cover will not last the next few years. If we give a value to the trees, we have lost green cover worth crores of rupees,” said Raje. If the BMC puts in place a proper tree trimming and security exercise, it will take a few years to audit and secure the trees, he added. In 2018, the BMC’s count pegged the number of trees in Mumbai at 29.8 lakh—10 lakh more than the last census in 2008. But almost half of that increase was because Aarey Colony had been included.

The barrier has been in distress due to filling of the river for construction of the Galgibaga bridge. This inturn has resulted in erosion near and across the barrier, locals alleged. The washed out portion could be a threat, not just to the river and its marine life, but also the coconut groves and houses on either side, a local Pradip Mokhardker said. Around five families reside at the banks of the Mashem creek. In November 2019, the Canacona mamlatdar had deputed the talathi to inspect the extent of the damage to the natural barrier, which obstructs the sea water from directly entering the river. The 200m-long sand barrier, located just before the mouth of the river, had eroded at two places at the time as a result of the swelling of sea water due to cyclonic winds. The eroded sandbar, which was three metres in height, was dangerously breached and during high tide, water could enter the river, said another local, pointing out that residents on either side, faced hardships back then. The then mamlatdar Raghuraj Faldesai had sent a team to conduct an inspection of the extent of the damage to the sand bar. The current mamlatdar, Vimod Dalal, said that after he took over the post, he had proposed that the sandbar and its vicinity be developed by the forest department by growing trees so that sand could be held intact. However he said that if any resident is afraid due to the present situation, he could arrange for their safe stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/galgibaga-sand-barrier-breach-locals-fear-sea-water-entering-homes/articleshow/82722332.cms||---

Protesters from across the state gathered near the DC office in Sangrur, where some members have been protesting for around four months. The protesters reached near the residence of the cabinet minister at around 2.15PM while at 2.40PM, they removed police barricades in the wake of heated arguments. Police managed to stop the protesters at the second barricade and assured them of getting a meeting fixed. The protesters returned after getting a panel meeting fixed with the cabinet minister and others on May 24. They even had to face lathicharge several times during their attempt to gherao the CM’s residence in Patiala. “We got the meeting fixed for May 24. Earlier too, our meetings with state government officials and cabinet minister remained fruitless but now, we will intensify our agitation against the government if they fail to heed our demands. For over 130 days in Sangrur and 58 days in Patiala, our members have been protesting over their demands, including recruitment of only ETT – TET pass unemployed for the advertised 2,364 Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) posts. The state government should advertise more than 10,000 posts of ETT teachers, besides extending the age limit in recruitment from 37 years to 42 years,” said press secretary, ETT-TET pass unemployed teachers’ union, Deep Banarasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/unemployed-teachers-remove-police-barricades-to-protest/articleshow/82722278.cms||---

The deceased, identified as Omar Arlanocahtillox, was staying in Mathura for the past few years. He was admitted to a private hospital after the accident, and doctors referred him to another hospital due to the absence of a neurologist there. But he succumbed to injuries on the way to the hospital. A resident of the same ashram, Maria Krishna, performed his last rites on Monday as per Hindu rituals after getting a nod from the Columbian Embassy and his family members. According to police, Maria met Omar five months ago while performing ‘parikrama’ at Govardhan. Since then, he moved in to stay in Bhajan Kuti. However, Omar had been staying in the district for the past several years, said police. Shrish Chandra, superintendent of police (rural), said no FIR has been registered in the matter. The Columbian Embassy had been informed about the death and the body was handed over to the deceased’s women friend after getting a nod from them, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/columbian-falls-to-death-while-doing-yoga-on-terrace-in-mathura/articleshow/82715517.cms||---

In a representation to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, the federation said that given the prevailing Covid-19 crisis, the government should consider cancelling the Class XII Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) exams. “The annual mark sheets should be prepared on the basis of unit tests, assignments, and the evaluation conducted during the year. If a student’s performance is unsatisfactory, he or she should be failed,” said a member of the federation. An estimated 4.50 lakh students are expected to take Class XII general stream examinations this year. The board exams for Class XII science students should be conducted once the Covid-19 crisis is under control, according to the federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-want-general-stream-exam-cancelled/articleshow/82731268.cms||---

Five persons including a teacher were arrested by the police on Monday for operating the ‘cash for fake marksheet’ scam. Police said that the main accused Bhavik Khatri (28), a teacher, used to sell fake marksheets of class X, class XII and also of undergraduate degree courses. Police also arrested Harikrishna Chavda (25), Pritesh Bhensdaliya (28), Vasu Patoliya (21) and Suresh Panchsuriya (28) for purchasing the fake marksheets. All are residents of Rajkot city. “Bhensdaliya is a second year student pursuing his Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from Indore-based university. Vasu is a BPharm student of Rajkot’s R K University. Both had got admission into university courses based on fake marksheets of class XII which they had purchased from Khatri. While Chavda and Panchsuriya purchased fake marksheets for their relatives,” a police official informed. Police said that more arrests will be made in the coming days as they suspect involvement of many others in the scam. Another accused Ram Singh, who is from Uttar Pradesh, is yet to be arrested. Singh was allegedly involved in printing fake marksheets and supplying it to Khatri in Gujarat. Khatri’s role was to find customers for the fake marksheets. “Khatri used to earn commission for selling each marksheet. He was paid Rs 5,000 commission for selling a class X fake marksheet for Rs 25,000. Similarly, the price of the class XII marksheet was fixed at 35,000 and it went up to Rs 60,000 for any undergraduate degree certificates,” police said. “We received a tip-off about the fake marksheet scam being run by Khatri and carried out a raid on May 7. Later, we sent the seized marksheets to the UP school board and Varanasi based university for verification. After getting confirmation that they did not issue the mark sheets and we arrested five people on Monday,” police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/multi-state-fake-marksheet-scam-busted-in-rajkot-5-held/articleshow/82717829.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||CT scan rate capped at Rs 2k||Chandigarh: A day after TOI highlighted non-uniform rates for CT chest scan for Covid-19 patients, the UT health department has capped the charges at Rs 2,000, including taxes. “All private diagnostic centres conducting CT chest scan must share the data with director health and family welfare and should not declare any Covid positive or negative report on the basis of CT chest scan without confirmation from Covid-19 testing lab,” the order said. The order instructed every diagnostic centre to submit weekly report of CT scan or HRCT chest to director health and family welfare. There have been complaints of overcharging by private centres. “I was charged Rs 3,000 in a private centre while a charitable centre was charging Rs 1,300,” said Varun Sharma, a city resident. “Taking cognisance of the complaints against private hospitals over charging patients, it was decided that the health department will again notify the approved rates for Covid treatment. It will be displayed on the notice boards of the hospitals,” tweeted V P Singh Badnore, UT administrator. As per the clinical establishment act, all hospitals and clinics in the city are supposed to display the rates. “There are no rates fixed for other investigations related to Covid. If this is also done, no one will be fleeced,” said Varun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ct-scan-rate-capped-at-rs-2k/articleshow/82717815.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Field hospitals evacuated, upgrade likely before Covid patients return||MUMBAI: The three Jumbo centres or field hospitals at Dahisar, Mulund and Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), that have helped the city tide over the second Covid wave, will stay shut for the next 10-15 days as they are taken up for repairs and upgrades. It will render over 4,000 beds out of circulation. More than 600 patients were moved out of the facilities over the weekend and shifted to eight hospitals ahead of the cyclone. BMC officials said there was no serious damage to the facilities due to the storm. These makeshift structures have been operating since the past 10-12 months and a need for refurbishment was in discussion. Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said since patients have been moved out because of the cyclone, they would utilise the opportunity to prepare for the third wave. “There won’t be any bed shortage. We have adequate beds available now,” Kakani said. The BKC jumbo, India’s first field hospital, has been operating since May 25 while the Dahisar one started on July 27 and Mulund got its first patient on July 16 last year. Together, they have catered to over 30,000-35,000 patients. “Our 3 jumbo Covid care centres that have been vacated as precautions, will now be taken up for maintenance and repairs over the next 10 days,” environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted on Monday. The centres will be repaired after a structural and electrical audit starting Tuesday or Wednesday, said Kakani. The jumbo centres at NSCI in Worli and Nesco in Goregaon were not hit by the cyclone since they are housed in permanent structures. However, a portion of a glass facade at a covid facility inside the Cidco Exhibition Centre at Vashi fell as winds blew over it. Two persons received minor leg injuries in the accident, while some patients had to be evacuated as rainwater began seeping in. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “The space from where the glass cover had broken loose has now been repaired.” At BKC, the waiting area hangar was dismantled and dean Dr Rajesh Dere said equipment was covered up for protection from rain or leakage. At the Dahisar jumbo, where five of the seven hangars are used for Covid care, dean Dr Deepan Shriyan said there were minor leakages after Monday's battering. She said harnesses were used to strengthen the structure and weights placed on the roof for stability. Nearly 300 patients were shifted out of the centre. The vaccination centre that runs out of the remaining two hangars is likely to remain, she said. In Mulund, BMC shifted 111 patients from the Richardson and Cruddas centre. Of 18 ICU patients, 7 were sent to a step-down facility and the rest kept there as the ICU is housed in a permanent structure. “BMC was swift in shifting patients, but it must look at permanent structures for Covid and vaccination keeping the monsoon in mind,” said BJP MLA from Mulund, Mihir Kotecha.

---||India||Rajnath releases first batch of DRDO’s anti-Covid oral drug||NEW DELHI: The government has undertaken collective and collaborative efforts to crank up the supplies of oxygen, medicines, ICU beds and cryogenic containers to battle the Covid-19 situation in the country, which has yielded good results, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday. Oxygen supply in the country, for instance, has now been substantially increased to more than 9,500 metric tonnes (MT) per day from around 4,700 MT at the start of this month, said Singh. “The government is continuously monitoring the situation and taking effective steps to meet all requirements,” he said, releasing the first batch of the new anti-Covid oral drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), along with health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan at a function here. Developed by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a DRDO lab, in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, the 2-DG drug has been approved for emergency use as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe Covid patients. “I am told that by using 2-DG patients recover two and a half days sooner than the usual treatment. Their oxygen dependency also reduces by about 40%... The 2-DG drug is a new ray of hope in these challenging times,” said the minister. DRDO chief Dr G Satheesh Reddy said while the first batch of the drug was meant for AIIMS, military and DRDO hospitals, it will be made available to all hospitals in the country from June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajnath-releases-first-batch-of-drdos-anti-covid-oral-drug/articleshow/82726540.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Foreign-bound students in fix over vax uncertainty||MUMBAI: Students enrolled in international universities who are planning to fly out in the coming months are in a fix with the government changing the ideal gap between two doses of Covishield to 12 weeks and also the current shortage. While many are still struggling to get the first dose, they will be eligible for the second dose only after three months, when they are expected to report to colleges. Some others are confused about the validity of Indian vaccines offshore. While Covaxin can be considered by these students, if available, many US universities have asked students to opt for vaccines that are authorised and approved by international agencies. And Covaxin is yet to get a nod. Parents want government agencies to prioritise vaccination for foreign-bound students. A parent whose children got an offer letter from one of the US universities said that the administration has recognised four vaccines, of which only Covishield is available in India. “The government has suspended the drive for the 18-44 age group and limited private centres are offering it. It is almost impossible to book a slot at this rate. My sons must join college by mid- or end-August. The uncertainty is making them anxious,” she said. The US does not offer Covishield, so taking only the first dose here will also not make sense, she added. Another parent said skipping the vaccine entirely before travel plans seems risky for the safety of the child. “What if they catch the infection enroute?” she asked. “Also, we will have to travel at least 15-20 days earlier to get vaccinated there. It will become an expensive affair. Without vaccination, we may also have to account for the quarantine period in some countries,” she said. “Covaxin would have been a better choice given the gap of four to six weeks, but we do not know when it will be recognised by WHO,” she added. For another parent, the shortage of vaccine in the country is also a concern. Maitri Dore, a PhD student, who is enrolled in University of Gothenburg in Sweden and is set to travel by the end of this month, said that she plans to get vaccinated there. “I was thinking of taking the first dose of Covishield here, but I was not sure if I would be eligible for the second dose there even if I managed to get AstraZeneca in Sweden. When I enquired, I was told that the policy on cross-border vaccine co-ordination was still unclear.” There are also few students, who returned from the US after taking the first dose of Pfizer and are now unsure about their second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-foreign-bound-students-in-fix-over-vax-uncertainty/articleshow/82724405.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra deaths drop & cases fall to 56-day low, but tests fewer||MUMBAI: The state and the city marked significant drops in daily Covid case detections as well as fatalities on Monday, but, as is usual on Sundays, testing was much thinner. Maharashtra reported 26,616 cases, the lowest in 56 days since March 22 (24,645) and added 516 fatalities, down nearly 50% from 974 on Sunday. However, in the last 24 hours, the state ran 2.3 lakh tests, down from the average 2.5 lakh tests on weekdays. In the city, 1,232 cases were detected, the lowest since March 9 (1,012 cases). Deaths fell to 48 from 60 on Sunday. However, nearly 17,500 tests were run on Sunday, much lower than the average 25,000 tests it has been conducting since last week. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, said Mumbai is seeing isolated drops, where the cases are dropping dramatically on certain days to rise again marginally with testing. “There is no doubt of an improvement in the situation, but the test positivity rate has stagnated. We would like to see it drop under 5%. We have seen in the first wave that after a certain threshold, Covid is endemic in the city. When all of India was seeing a decline in cases, Mumbai was still reporting 400-500 cases,” he said. The city needs to stabilise testing and increase it even, said another task force member Dr Rahul Pandit. “’Testing, testing and testing’ is at the centre of Covid control. It has been swinging between 20,000 and 40,000,” he said. In the city, the weekly growth rate of cases in the week that ended on Sunday was 0.28%. At its peak in early April, the city’s weekly growth rate had touched 2%. On Monday, the city’s 48 fatalities took the overall mortality count to 14,272. The lingering high mortality burden has been a concern. For instance, exactly a month ago, the city had reported 56 deaths but 8,834 cases. On Monday though, while cases had dropped to 1,232, deaths have remained nearly as much. In a worrying sign, many smaller districts like Solapur and Kolhapur have reported more fatalities than Mumbai. Solapur reported 49 deaths while Kolhapur reported 83. “Even though cases are dipping, deaths will continue to be high for a few more weeks,” said a state official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-deaths-drop-cases-fall-to-56-day-low-but-tests-fewer/articleshow/82722410.cms||Bhavika Jain

The medicines are given under the supervision of a pharmacist and a counsellor from the department and are free of cost. On Monday, state Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat flagged off three “Ayush Raths” to Charkrata-Kalsi, Sahaspur-Vikasnagar and Raipur-Doiwala. “In the first phase, we will distribute the kits to 2.25 lakh people across the state. After assessing the impact, we will decide on whether or not to distribute it to more people. Last year, we had distributed kits to only healthcare and frontline workers, some 13 lakh, as they are risking their lives for our safety. This year, we are aiming to give it to every Uttarakhandi,” said the minister. Based on the success of the first “rath” or consignment of medicines, more will be dispatched. The kit contains herbal drinks and medicines made of immunity boosters such as giloy, amla, neem. Rawat added that the 678 ayurveda and homeopathy doctors and 587 pharmacists who are currently operational in the state will be roped in for distributing the kits to remote areas. The Ayush department claims to have reached out to 92,000 people affected by the pandemic so far. While some patients have been prescribed Ayurvedic medicines and given a daily routine to follow, others were shown ways to deal with stress and other post-Covid symptoms. Rawat added that the 300 vacant posts for Ayurveda doctors and 70 pharmacists will soon be filled. He said he will discuss the matter with chief minister Harak Singh Rawat as it was all the more important now amid the second wave of Covid-19 and the threat of a third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ayush-dept-distributes-ayurvedic-medicine-herbal-drinks-in-remote-hills/articleshow/82717896.cms||Shivani Azad

Airlines cancelled 56 flights and seven arrivals were diverted to safer airports on Monday. Passengers scheduled to fly on Tuesday have been advised to check their flight status before leaving for the airport. A large majority of the 200 flights the city airport is now handling in 24 hours was disrupted. What tested the nerves of passengers and flight crew especially was the staggered shutdown. Initially, the airport announced it would to stay shut from 11am to 2pm. The closure was extended to 4pm, then to 6pm, and again 8pm, and finally to 10pm. By 10.30pm, airlines had cancelled 22 departures and 34 arrivals, said an airport spokesperson. In another incident, a panel from the underside of an aerobridge crashed into a ground ambulance. It didn’t injury anyone, said the official. An Air India spokesperson said the airline operated 12 flights to and from Mumbai till 11am. “We operated the maximum number of flights till the notice on flight suspension came into effect,” said the spokesperson. The weather forecast issued on Sunday had predicted a calm day with patchy rains over the city. But Monday was a different story. Around 8.15am, a SpiceJet flight from Chennai was forced to divert to Surat as the sky over Mumbai stayed overcast at 8000 feet with cumulonimbus clouds, according to the aviation weather update forecast. An IndiGo flight from Kolkata was diverted to Hyderabad and another from Lucknow returned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-shut-down-for-11-hours-63-flights-hit/articleshow/82722418.cms||---
---||Meerut||Black fungus cases rise to 16 in Meerut||Meerut: The number of patients diagnosed with mucormycosis is steadily going up in Meerut, with the tally at 16 on Monday. Speaking with TOI, divisional surveillance officer, Meerut, Dr Ashok Talyan, said, “At present, 16 patients have been diagnosed with black fungus in various hospitals of Meerut.” What is worrying is that the number of patients with black fungus is steadily rising. Three of them were operated at Anand Hospital here. Sunday witnessed two operations while a third patient was operated on Monday. A team of senior surgeons operated on the three patients endoscopically (Denkers operation). One patient, 38, was admitted in the Covid facility of Anand Hospital on May 1. He developed severe hypoxia (a condition in the region of a body deprived of adequate supply of oxygen) on May 2. He was put on high doses of steroids. He was also a known diabetic with high sugar levels. Giving details, senior surgeon Dr Subhash Yadav said, “On May 8, he experienced pain as a swelling developed in the left eye. Our staff took the photos and sent them to me. I immediately consulted our ENT specialist and got a CT scan done. A nasal endoscopy and biopsy was done which proved mucormycosis. He was successfully operated and put on Amphotericin b. The drug was difficult to procure. Now, the patient is recovering well. Somewhat similar conditions were faced by other patients also.” The surgeon said all the patients are fine and improving. The surgeon explained that mucormycosis or black fungus, as it is called, is emerging as a cause of post-Covid complication. Mucormycosis is a fungus present in the form of microscopic spores in the air. Once inhaled, it enters the sinuses and afflicts if one has a very high blood sugar level. “During treatment, many Covid patients are given very high doses of steroids (many without a prescription and monitoring) and this increases sugar level to 400-500. Also, Mucor flourishes on Ferritin (blood protein), which is high in Covid patients. This fungus blocks the blood vessels and causes necrosis of sinus bones and even ophthalmic arteries causing blindness. It also spreads very fast to the brain and may even cause death in 50% of these cases,” warned Dr Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/black-fungus-cases-rise-to-16-in-meerut/articleshow/82717898.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B devises way to reuse exhaled O2||Mumbai: A team of alumni, students and professors from IIT-Bombay has come up with an innovative way to reuse exhaled oxygen—thereby enhancing the life of oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 patients. The proposed method will help bring down the average use of over nine oxygen cylinders in a day for a critical patient to one or two, they said. The team has designed the prototype of a breathing device called ‘The reBreather’, which facilitates recirculation of exhaled breath by scrubbing out carbon dioxide and blending in fresh oxygen. It will also help minimise wastage of oxygen in the current system at a time when hospitals are facing an acute shortage. A healthy person breathes in 5 litre per minute of air, which corresponds to about 1 litre/ minute of oxygen being inhaled. Of this, approximately 0.25 litre/minute of oxygen is consumed. “Covid-19 patients in intensive care can be given up to 50 litre of oxygen per minute, with only 1-1.5 litre being really utilised. Consequently, around 90% of oxygen is lost to the atmosphere. The bottled oxygen could be used efficiently in a closed (or semi-closed) loop system, which we have demonstrated using the reBreather,” said professor Santosh Noronha from the chemical engineering department at IIT-Bombay. Releasing a lot of oxygen also results in the oxygen concentration going up in closed spaces, which could be a reason for the increased fire instances in Covid hospitals, said Noronha. The prototype has been designed with inputs from anaesthesiologists and intensivists but has been tested informally on healthy volunteers. The clinical trials in a controlled set-up are pending and are likely to take time. The institute has therefore released the design in open source to demonstrate the practicality of the science behind it. While designing the prototype cost the team around Rs 10,000, it can be significantly brought down in large-scale industrial deployment. The institute has now invited engineers and manufacturers to adopt, replicate or even modify the design for better scalability. The researchers used medical grade soda lime for carbon dioxide absorption in the reBreather and rely on its changing colour to see if the absorption capacity is exhausted. The appearance of the soda lime needs to be frequently monitored and needs to be replaced with fresh soda lime from time to time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-devises-way-to-reuse-exhaled-o2/articleshow/82717935.cms||Yogita Rao
---||India||Need to take telemedicine to villages: PM||NEW DELHI: In an interaction with doctors on Monday, PM Narendra Modi drew attention to the importance of telemedicine, how it has played a big role for patients in home isolation, and asserted that it needs to be expanded in rural areas as well. The PM also urged doctors to include oxygen audit in their daily routine. Modi said the strategy of starting the vaccination programme with frontline workers has paid rich dividends. He said about 90% of health professionals in the country have taken the first dose. During the virtual interaction, the PM also urged doctors to spread awareness about black fungus. Noting a large number of patients are being treated in ‘home isolation’, he requested monitoring doctors to ensure SOP-driven care. He lauded doctors who form teams and provide telemedicine service in villages. He appealed to doctors to work towards ensuring that all tehsils and districts have a telemedicine service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/need-to-take-telemedicine-to-villages-pm/articleshow/82726546.cms||---

During this wave as well, we are taking care of children rescued from child labour and those who run away from home and have no one to look after them,” Khanna said. The organization is also spreading awareness for plasma donation and assisting residents with vaccination drives. Ms Mansi Mishra, the organisation’s nodal officer, said, “Our outreach volunteers keep a lookout and whenever we receive a distress call, we take immediate action. We conduct regular health checkups of the children under our care. Also, doctors pay fortnightly visits.” Khanna added that she also planned to start a Covid care centre which can be used by Covid patients who have mild symptoms. “Patients who develop severe symptoms can be sent to hospitals but minimum support can be provided to milder patients and even staff who are not medically trained can take care of them,” said Khanna.  Another NGO, Saheli Trust, has made arrangements to take in children whose parents have tested positive for the virus and need a place to isolate and those whose parents are in the hospital and need someone to take care of them. The organization, founded by Shruti Kasuhik, an engineering graduate from DIT, works primarily for women empowerment and took up Covid relief work when the pandemic struck. Kasuhik added that the organisation was preparing kits containing essential items, including sanitary napkins, to be distributed to women living in villages and slums. Former Army doctor Nitin Pandey, a patron of the trust, told TOI, “We have also started an oxygen langar at Jakhan. We provide oxygen support to people till they are able to arrange for oxygen cylinders.” The organization also delivers breakfast, lunch and drinking water bottles to attendants in hospitals of Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-ngos-shelter-children-whose-parents-are-positive-rescue-some-from-streets/articleshow/82717941.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks boards’ reply to PIL on Std X exams||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday sought replies of SSC, ICSE, and CBSE boards on a PIL challenging cancellation of Class X exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A bench headed by Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla heard a PIL by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired teacher from Pune, stating cancellation of exams could lead to problems in Class XI admissions as different boards will declare results based on different formulae. “The decision (to cancel exams) is going to create problems for two crore students in the country,” his advocate Uday Warunjikar said, adding the Centre will have to intervene and come out with a uniform policy. But Centre’s advocate Sandesh Patil said while it has “persuasive control” over the CBSE board, the ICSE board is autonomous. He also said since education falls under the Concurrent List, the state government can exercise its authority over the SSC board. Patil said the Centre on May 1 issued a notification with guidelines to promote Class X students. “It is for the SSC and ICSE boards whether to adopt the notification,’’ he added. Terming the PIL premature, SSC board’s advocate Kiran Gandhi said it is yet to come up with a formula. The three boards have to submit their to the court replies on May 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-seeks-boards-reply-to-pil-on-std-x-exams/articleshow/82729266.cms||Rosy Sequeira

He, however, brought the body back to the hospital within an hour after police warned him. “The woman, from Gevrai taluka, was admitted to the hospital on April 23. Her condition started deteriorating since the past couple of days and she died around 5 am on Monday,” additional civil surgeon Sukhdev Rathod TOI. The official said the woman’s husband demanded that her body be handed over to the family for performing the last rites, but his was turned down citing the standard protocol. “The man argued that his wife’s report came negative in the antigen test performed on Saturday and wanted to take the body to their home town. When his request was turned, the man quietly sneaked out of the hospital while the staff got busy in other duties,” said Rathod. The hospital authorities realised about it only after the class IV employees reached ward number 5 to wrap up the body and take it to the morgue. The matter was brought to the notice of police, who contacted the man and told him to hand over the body back to the hospital. Archana Pingle, a nurse working for the civil hospital, has lodged a complaint in this regard. The man and three others were booked under IPC sections including disobeying order duly promulgated by authorities and unlawfully or negligently doing any act which is likely to spread the infection. They have also been slapped with sections of The Epidemic Diseases Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-booked-for-taking-awaywifes-body-from-covid-ward/articleshow/82715808.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Akanksha Pawar, a Class X student, said,“The government should have thought of the options before making the announcement and declared the evaluation process immediately.”The Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training had conducted an online survey among schools asking them if they were ready for internal assessment. The council also conducted a survey among Class X students to see how many students were ready for an entrance exam for admission to FYJC.“We really do not understand if we should take it easy or start preparing for the exam again. After the cancellation of the exam was announced, we wasted a lot of time because the government was undecided,” Yash Kulkarni, a student from Nashik, said.A PIL was filed by professor Dhananjay Kulkarni in the Bombay high court challenging the state government’s decision to cancel exams. In a hearing held on Monday, the Maharashtra state board of secondary and higher secondary education, which conducts the SSC exam, stated that it had not devised any formula on evaluating and marking Class X students.Secondary school teacher Shilpa Gore said that the government should realise the long term impact the delay in arriving at a decision would have on children. “I feel the government is playing with the future of the children. The authorities probably do not know the ground situation and the trauma that students are going through as a result of this delay.”TOI tried to contact state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, but her office informed that the minister was out of town. Officials in the minister’s office said, “The matter is in court, so the department will wait for the proceedings to get over before taking any decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/std-x-pupils-worried-over-delay-in-marking-decision/articleshow/82720050.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The Raigad district collector together with officials of the Animal husbandry department and some NGOs have provided 2,000 kg of fodder for the horses on Saturday. The owners of the equines lost their sole source of livelihood that depended on tourism. Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhari said 2,000 kg of nutritious horse fodder has been distributed among Matheran horse owners. “All officers and employees of Animal husbandry department have voluntarily contributed from their own salaries to enable us to buy the horse feed,” said Choudhari. “The horse owners have been told to use masks, sanitisers, observe social distancing, wash hands frequently, and in case of Covid-like symptoms, they should immediately visit the nearest government hospital and seek medical advice. Food and water is also being provided to stray dogs and cattle through NGOs by assigning the responsibility to livestock development officials at panchayat samiti level who will ensure that domestic animals don’t starve,” said Choudhari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-help-pours-in-matheran-horses-get-2000kg-fodder/articleshow/82724593.cms||George Mendonca
---||Gurgaon||Over 1.7L kg Covid-19 waste in city last month, highest since pandemic began||Gurgaon: The city generated over 1.7 lakh kg of Covid-related biomedical waste in April alone, which is the highest it has produced since the beginning of the pandemic. According to Biotic, the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon’s (MCG) concessionaire for biomedical waste management in the city, Gurgaon was generating two to three tonnes of Covid waste every day last year, which has now increased to 10 tonnes every day. From May 1 to May 13, Gurgaon has already generated 1.3 lakh kg of Covid waste. Covid waste — which includes biomedical waste like used personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, masks, gloves, syringes and tissues or cotton soaked with body fluids or blood, among others — is generated in hospitals treating Covid patients, labs, Covid facilities and homes that have patients in isolation. Covid-related biomedical waste in Gurgaon comes from two channels — one is collected from households by MCG and another is generated by healthcare facilities in the city. While MCG is responsible for garbage collection, including Covid-related biomedical waste from households and its transportation to the concessionaire’s plant for disposal of biomedical waste, waste from healthcare facilities is collected by Biotic. Out of the 1.7 lakh kg of Covid waste generated by the city in April, around 1 lakh kg came from healthcare facilities and 73,426kg from households through MCG. The total caseload of the city till April 30 was over 1.2 lakh. “For collecting Covid-related biomedical waste, we have three dedicated vehicles each for Zone-3 and Zone-4 and two vehicles each for Zone-1 and Zone-2. Biotic collects waste from healthcare facilities, including hospitals and quarantine centres, directly. The waste collected by waste management agency Ecogreen from areas under MCG limits is taken to a transfer station, where Biotic takes the Covid waste in yellow bags and then taken to its plant, where it is incinerated,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG. The city saw a spurt in bio-medical waste since Covid cases started being reported here last year. In March 2020, it generated 2,418kg of Covid waste, which rose by nearly seven times to 15,077kg in April. A total of 33,502kg of bio-medical waste was generated in May, which increased to 1.14 lakh kg the next month and 1.37 lakh kg in July. August saw a slight dip at 1.09 lakh kg, which again rose to 1.34 lakh kg in September, 1.24 lakh kg in October, 1.4 lakh kg in November and 1.14 lakh kg the next month. As cases saw a slight dip in January this year, so did Covid waste — the city generated 50,569kg of Covid waste that month, which further dipped to 27,909kg in February. It increased marginally again in March (37,668kg). April, however, saw an exponential increase as the city’s healthcare facilities and households generated over 1.7 lakh kg of Covid waste amid an exponential surge in Covid cases. The city generates 800 tonnes to 1,000 tonnes of total waste every day at present, said officials. In contrast to MCG’s claims that it has 10 dedicated vehicles to collect Covid waste from households, residents said the same garbage collector picks up waste from every household, including those of Covid-positive patients. “We have common garbage collectors coming in and collecting waste from all households here. We keep our garbage outside our houses so that we don’t come in contact with the collector. So, there is no chance of garbage collectors becoming a carrier of infection,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of Qutub Enclave RWA. “Moreover, now that stickers are not pasted outside houses to identify Covid patients, it is practically not possible for them to collect garbage separately from Covid-positive households considering the surge in cases,” he added. For Biotic, the main challenge is to segregate the solid waste they get along with the Covid waste from households. “The major challenge that we are facing is that we are receiving mixed waste. We had strictly told MCG to resolve this problem and give us segregated waste, but we are getting coconut shells and food waste along with Covid waste. We in fact had stopped taking Covid waste from MCG for one day earlier this month because we are receiving mixed waste,” said Vishesh Gaur, director, Biotic. On this, Kumar said, “It is a major challenge for us as well since residents are not segregating waste. They should segregate non-Covid waste and give Covid-related biomedical waste in yellow bags to garbage collectors. They should remember that their practice of not segregating Covid waste can infect a garbage collector, since the collector will have to segregate it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/over-1-7l-kg-covid-19-waste-in-city-last-month-highest-since-pandemic-began/articleshow/82693645.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The Met centre on Monday issued an 'orange alert' of heavy to very rainfall at isolated places in Dehradun, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Bageshwar, Rudraprayag and Pithoragarh districts of the state. Giving details, Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at Met centre, said, "Intense showers accompanied with thunderstorm and lightning are likely to occur at few places in the hilly districts and Dehradun. Gusty winds with speeds of 30-40kmph will also occur at isolated places in the plains of Uttarakhand." Meanwhile, in view of the heavy rainfall and hailstorm forecast, State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has issued an advisory for the districts to step up their preparedness. As per the advisory issued by Rahul Jugran, in-charge executive director, USDMA, all the nodal officers in the integrated response system and departmental nodal officials in the districts will remain on high alert. Besides, agencies such as Public Works Department (PWD), Border Roads Organization (BRO), Central Public Works Department (CPWD) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) have been directed to remain on alert to open the obstructed roads, in case it happens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/met-forecasts-heavy-to-very-heavy-rainfall-in-uttarakhand-from-may-18/articleshow/82717987.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Goa||Goa: 70% of state without power supply, may take two more days for full restoration||PANAJI: Goa witnessed one of its worst power outages in recent times as 70% of the state was plunged into darkness, with some places going without electricity for over 48 hours, even as the electricity department staff braved heavy rain and gusty winds to restore supply after Cyclone Tauktae wreaked havoc leaving behind a trail of destruction in the state. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said it would take at least another two days to fully restore power across the state. “The major loss has been suffered by the electricity department. Village areas are the most affected,” he told TOI. Sawant said in around 200 locations, there are major transformer problems. “Low tension lines with a total span length of 55km, and high tension lines covering 42km, along with 58 distribution transformers were totally damaged, which affected power supply in 70% of the (state) network. Over 1,500 poles were bent and around a 1,000 broken,” chief electrical engineer Raghhuvir Keni told TOI. The mega outage didn’t only affect rural Goa, but even urban areas like Porvorim and Mapusa saw outages that lasted over 48 hours. “The total loss is around Rs 22 crore,” he said. A top official with the electricity department said the extent of the damage can be gauged from the fact that the state’s power demand, which is at 570MW, dropped to around 80-85MW due to the failure in the distribution network. “By noon on Monday, we were able to increase the demand to over 200MW,” the official said. “Our personnel are working round-the-clock to restore power. We are isolating the faulty sections of the feeder and charging the balance, so that there is some supply,” the official said. For instance, if a 11KV line with 10 feeders had eight faulty ones, the department was isolating those eight faulty feeders, while charging the rest. “Our immediate priority was to restore power to PSA oxygen plants so that there was no interruption in supply of oxygen to the hospitals. Today (Monday), our priority was to restore power to water plants, so that they can resume their supply,” the official said. Sawant said Goa has a shortage of manpower and the government has called in contractors from other states to work on the restoration. “The manpower to work on the main power lines has to be brought from outside the state,” he said. “A massive restoration job is under way. Additional workforce will arrive in Goa by Monday night,” Keni said. The coastal belt continued to be in darkness on Monday night, with the Candolim-Calangute belt and Salcete villages being the worst affected. “Restoration of supply to Salcete villages may take two more days,” executive engineer Rajendra Sawant said. He said the cyclone caused total devastation from Canacona to Betalbatim. “To undo the damage would take 15-20 days. Over 200 poles have been destroyed in this area itself,” he said. Assistant engineer Nicolau Moraes said the Velim station, which feeds the Carmona sub-station, will take many more days to be restored. “We are trying our level best to charge Carmona via Nessai-Benaulim-Carmona,” he said. Sawant also held a meeting with power minister Nilesh Cabral, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, heads of various departments, both collectors and police to review the impact of the cyclone. Sawant said he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah and both assured him of all possible assistance, including financial support, from the Centre. He said the state would prepare a detailed report of the losses suffered due to the cyclone and would submit it to the Centre within a week. “It is difficult for us to say how much loss has been suffered due to the cyclone. As (Shah) promised to help us financially, we are trying to find the actual loss, which would be estimated within the next three days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/70-of-state-without-power-supply-may-take-two-more-days-for-full-restoration/articleshow/82722613.cms||Lisa Monteiro

A total of 1,310 people have succumbed to the infection since the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic in the district. According to the authorities, around 15% of the deaths are of patients from outside the district but undergoing treatment in Kolhapur district. As many as 445 deaths could have been avoided had the patients been brought immediately after showing symptoms. Of the 34% deaths, 22% were reported within 24 hours of admission to hospitals, shows the the audit report, while adding that those staying for long periods in hospitals, at least for 10 days, have high recovery rate. District health officer Yogesh Sale said the patients first prefer to get treatment from doctors in their neighbourhood or family doctors, most of whom may not be equipped well with the treatment modalities. “Most of the patients who died had co-morbidities of serious nature and were senior citizens. We have, therefore, started screening and testing maximum number of people to start early treatment and save lives. Currently, we are carrying out more than 5,000 tests daily, most of which are RT-PCR,” said Sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/34-of-covid-19-patients-died-within-48-hrs-of-hospitalisation-in-kolhapur/articleshow/82715897.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The CBI arrested four persons on Monday. It was a long-awaited justice for me,” he said. Claiming that the footage of Adhikari receiving the money was captured by him during the sting operation and the clips were handed over to the CBI, Samuel said that law should be equal to all. “I had paid money to Suvendu Adhikari. He was in his office. His name is not on the list. I had gone through forensic tests and given statements regarding that. He (Adhikari) received the money from me. Why is he being kept out of the loop? The investigation should be fair,” Samuel said. Adhikari could not be reached for comments. Samuel, who had to face numerous rounds of questioning since the central investigating agencies took up the case, said people had been asking him questions about the fate of the sting operation. “I went to the CBI and ED offices in Kolkata more than 40 times. I told them that we have to wait since such cases drag on for long. It was my fight against corruption. The charge sheet was already ready for some time. Finally, they arrested four persons.” After the tape was released, Samuel was first summoned by the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee headed by BJP veteran L K Advani. He handed over visuals and documents to the committee members. “Nothing happened after that. Then I came to know from CBI sources that they had sent several letters to the Lok Sabha for the prosecution of the accused,” he said. In 2019, the CBI sought sanction to prosecute four parliamentarians of the Trinamool Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/why-is-suvendu-being-spared/articleshow/82720133.cms||Rohit Khanna

While a similar situation was faced across the state, the capital faced the mightiest fury as it received 22cm of rain. Panaji recorded the manual highest 227mm (22cm), which falls under the extremely heavy rainfall category. Old Goa was the second highest with 194mm (19cm) and Mapusa reported 170mm (17cm). “There were incidents in the past wherein extremely heavy rainfall was reported in more than one station. This is not a regular event however. In the entire monsoon season spanning four months, it is only once or twice that we get extremely heavy rainfall,” said India meteorological department (IMD) scientist Rahul M. The rainfall activity on Monday was not as intense as that of Sunday. The winds were moderate winds of 40-50kmph. The IMD however did warn of heavy rain at isolated places. “When the cyclone passes so close to the coast, its impact will be there for one day or so,” Rahul said. There is no warning for Tuesday by the IMD, however, they have warned fishermen against venturing into the seas owing to the impact of the cyclonic storm. Tauktae is expected to make landfall over Gujarat soon and its wind impact will therefore be felt on high seas owing to which fishermen have been warned against venturing into the sea. In 2019, there were higher than normal cyclones over the Arabian Sea. This year, the IMD is keeping a close watch on cyclonic systems and formations. As of now, there are no cyclones forming in this month after Tauktae.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-capital-faces-mightiest-fury-of-cyclone-receives-extremely-heavy-rainfall-of-22cm/articleshow/82722682.cms||Nida Sayed

With the arrests, police said they unearthed a racket with inter-state and international links. The police also ascertained the identity of four other men from Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, who were preparing to sell the sandalwood in the international market. “These suspects have connections with people in west Asian countries. We will soon arrest the others as well,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said on Monday. The red sandalwood was stolen from a forest in Karnataka and was being transported to Navi Mumbai. The suspects brought it till Pune with bogus documentation. The truck’s number plate was fake as well, police said. The arrested suspects — Nilesh Dherange (35) of Ahmednagar district, M A Salim (43) of Karnataka, Vinod Fernandes (45) and Nirmalsingh Gill (36) from Navi Mumbai, and Zakir Hussain Shaikh (36) of Mumbai — worked as middlemen for the main suspects, police said. “A Wakad police team led by senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar made the arrests,” Krishna Prakash said. The commissioner said constables Vandu Gire and Rajendra Kale noticed a car with a half-broken number plate at Tathawade while on night patrol in the early hours of May 13. “When the duo told the occupants to come out of the car, two of them came out and started running away while the other three were detained,” he said. Krishna Prakash said when the trio failed to furnish proper details, the constables checked Dherange’s smartphone and noticed chats related to red sandalwood and also a photograph of a loaded truck. “During sustained questioning, the trio revealed that a truck with red sandalwood was at Tathawade. Our team then seized the truck, which contained 207 logs of red sandalwood,” the police chief said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-seize-sandalwood-worth-rs-4cr-bust-international-racket/articleshow/82720200.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Delhi||‘Assassin held in central Delhi was booked in J&K’||NEW DELHI: A day after TOI broke the story of the arrest of a 25-year-old Pulwama resident from a hotel in central Delhi's Paharganj, it has emerged that the suspect, Jan Dar alias Jehangir — who was allegedly planning a high-profile killing in the capital — was earlier booked in a case of attack and stone-pelting on security forces during the violence in the aftermath of the encounter of terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016. Police officers on Monday said that his handler in the Valley was identified as Abid, a Jaish-e-Mohammed operative who is Pakistani national. Abid allegedly indoctrinated and radicalised Dar to come to Delhi and execute a target killing, police have claimed. However, it is unclear if Dar had joined the outfit or was going to be inducted after this "test". According to police, Dar was allegedly paid Rs 6,500 in cash as travel expenses and Rs 35,000 were transferred into his bank account for expenses. Dar was taught weapon handling and operations for the purpose of the target killing. Dar came to Delhi for the first time in February this year for the treatment of a relative. They stayed at a guesthouse in old Delhi and returned shortly. On April 23, the accused left for Delhi again on Abid’s instructions and met his associate, Umar, in Paharganj. They also chatted on Telegram, the probe has revealed. Meanwhile, the special cell received an input from an agency that a highly radicalised module of Kashmir was planning to assassinate the head of a religious institution in Delhi-NCR over some “objectionable” comments. An FIR under section 120-B of IPC (criminal conspiracy) was registered and investigation initiated. In a joint operation with the agency, the cops managed to track down Dar from the hotel in Paharganj before he could execute the killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/assassin-held-in-central-delhi-was-booked-in-jk/articleshow/82722637.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Kolkata||Law will take its own course: BJP||Kolkata: Amid demand for arrest of BJP leaders Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari and allegations of “vindictive attitude” of the Centre, the BJP said the law will take its own course. The party, on the other hand, lodged a complaint with the Kotowali police station against chief minister Mamata Banerjee for not trying to put an end to post poll violence. Roy, who switched over to the BJP in 2017, was also seen in the Narada sting operation tape. Narada News boss Mathew Samuel later told the CBI that while money was offered to Roy, he never accepted it. Former IPS officer and another accused in the sting operation probe, SMH Mirza, however, pointed fingers at Roy after he was taken into custody by the central agency. Mirza was later taken to Roy’s Elgin Road residence for reconstruction of events. He had alleged that Roy had been seen on phone giving instructions. Roy is now recovering after being infected with Covid-19. TMC leaders started raising questions about the impartiality of the probe, demanding arrest of the BJP leaders. While the BJP leaders did not comment on the specifics, senior leader Kailash Vijayvargiya trained guns on the TMC. “The chief minister has taken an oath to maintain law and order in the state. It is unfortunate that the CBI is being stopped from doing its duty,” Vijayvargiya wrote on Twitter. Adhikari could not be reached for any comment. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, however, said: “Let the law take its own course.” Criticizing the chief minister’s objection to the arrests and reaction of the TMC supporters throughout the day, Ghosh said, “They do not have faith in the constitution. The reason why the chief minister is instigating lawlessness.” He lodged a complaint with the Kotowali police station, alleging inaction by the CM in preventing post-poll violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/law-will-take-its-own-course-bjp/articleshow/82720254.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Pune||25% pipelines laid for water supply scheme||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has expedited laying of pipelines for the equitable water supply project. In the past two months, a 55km network of water distribution pipelines was laid, mostly in the central areas of Pune. So far, a 430km pipeline network has been created so far in the city, which accounts for 25% of the total required pipeline network of 1,750km. According to civic officials, work continued even during the lockdown-like restrictions imposed since March. In fact, the officials said, most critical spots were covered during the lockdown. The equitable water supply project also includes installation of automatic water meters and the construction of overhead water tanks to strengthen water distribution. “Laying pipelines has gained momentum in the past two months as there was less traffic on the roads due to the restrictions. Of the 55km, about 24km of pipelines were laid in Pune city’s central parts. Other areas where the new network was created included Aundh, Baner, Balewadi, Bavdhan, Sahakarnagar and Dhankawdi,” an official said. The project is aimed at curtailing water losses during distribution, strengthening local water supply network and providing equitable supply to the city at an adequate pressure. Another official from the administration said that the ongoing works were being expedited ahead of the monsoon and that there were talks to continue the work even on some days during the monsoon. “Since there will be fewer vehicles and citizens on the roads, we are looking into whether the work can be continued during the monsoon.,” the official said. Sources in the administration said that they expect a reduction of around 100km in the targeted pipeline network, mainly due to redesigning the network in some stretches and utilization of existing network in others. PMC plans to complete laying the pipelines by February 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/25-pipelines-laid-for-water-supply-scheme/articleshow/82720291.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Goa||Goa: Blackout leads to water crisis in many housing complexes||PANAJI: The state’s massive power outage transitioned into a water crisis, particularly for residential complexes and those without wells to draw water. With no electricity supply, residential colonies and independent homes had no means to pump water into overhead tanks. Water tankers were of no relief because most of them depend on pumps too, thus leaving half the states’ urban population battling water problems. Residents resorted to novel ideas to beat the water shortage, either borrowing drums of water from relatives or purchasing bottled water for cooking purposes. Cooperative housing societies asked their members to “use water judiciously” or released water at staggered timings. Cyclone Tauktae, which passed by Goa on Sunday, uprooted trees, brought down power lines and snapped electricity poles as it wrecked havoc in the state. With power infrastructure damaged, most of the state has been without electricity for over 48 hours. Most of the water that had been pumped into overhead water tanks has dwindled over the last two days leaving taps dry. “Due to the cyclone and power failure in surrounding areas, we have not been able to get water tankers. The society was forced to shut down the bathroom water supply,” a resident of Milroc Ribandar Miriam Carvalho said. A family from Sarmanas, Bicholim, was left without water and electricity for two days till activists stepped in to assist the family. Some complexes which have borewells hired diesel gensets to pump water to the overhead tanks. “Water is an issue because tankers aren’t coming. We have been asked to use water judiciously,” a resident of Casa Mangalam at Kadamba Plateau said. With power and water supply cut, many trudged down to the neighbour store to purchase bottled water for cooking and drinking purposes. Others borrowed from friends, neighbours and even their offices. “I went and filled drinking water from the office in the morning. We filled two buckets and brought it home in the car,” Claude Pinto said. Most parts of the state lacked power since Saturday night and thus dishes were also piling up along with soiled linen. “The complex hired a DG set and shut down all lifts and lights. Water was released in the morning, for one hour in the afternoon and from 8pm to 11pm. We have managed with this,” maintenance supervisor for Esmeralda on the Old Goa by-pass Sachin Birje said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/blackout-leads-to-water-crisis-in-many-housing-complexes/articleshow/82722674.cms||---

He appreciated the efforts of the state government in managing Covid and said the government was doing an exemplary job. He said it was the success of the state government that 24 out of 37 oxygen plants have been completed, while not a single plant could be set up in Delhi, the capital of the country. He said in other states such as UP and Bihar, disposal of bodies were not being done properly while in Rajasthan, the state government had ensured decent funerals at state expense. He said it was commendable that in 350 blocks isolation beds for Covid positive were being prepared. Addressing a meeting, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the state government provided free treatment to Covid patients and all types of tests, medicines were available for free. He said till now all types of vaccines were given free in the country, but this was the first time that states were asked to arrange vaccines for their people. He said the state government had decided to provide free vaccine to those who are between the age of 18 years and 44 years. “It has put an additional huge burden of Rs 3000 crore on the state exchequer, but the state government is determined to save the people of Rajasthan from the pandemic,” Gehlot added. He said oxygen concentrators would be provided at all health care centres in villages. He said 6,000 oxygen concentrators had arrived and 50,000 more were being would be procured, he said. He said high pressure oxygen was required for serious Covid patients which ranged from 10 to 50 litres of oxygen per minute. Speaking on the occasion, PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra said the Congress had given relief to more than 50,000 people who contacted the party through helplines to get beds, oxygen and life-saving medicines in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-to-distribute-10-lakh-masks-and-2-amblances-in-every-constituency-maken/articleshow/82720272.cms||---

The vessel, which got caught in cyclone Tauktae, suffered an engine breakdown close to the Redi coastline at Sindhudurg in Maharashtra. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre at Kochi got in touch with the Indian Coast Guard base at Vasco on Sunday with information that the fishing vessel was in distress 6.5 miles off the Aguada lighthouse. The Coast Guard got in touch with the fishing vessel to understand the nature of the crisis. “The operations room at the Coast Guard HQ was in constant touch with the fishing boat, which informed that they were stranded due to engine breakdown and ingress of water in the boat. They requested immediate rescue as they feared the boat sinking,” the Coast Guard said in a statement. ICGS Samarth sailed out at 3am on Monday at maximum speed to render assistance. Braving the adverse condition of the sea and night time, the ship assessed the situation. On investigation, it came to light that the crew of the vessel could not be evacuated due to very rough weather in the area. Finally the distressed boat was taken under tow with all 15 crew onboard. The boat under tow entered Mormugao harbour by late evening. Coast Guard technicians used a submersible pump to pump out the flooded compartments and then handed over the boat to the directorate of fisheries for repairs. Early Sunday morning, the Coast Guard also responded to a distress call from the 92m-long ONGC vessel MV Sagar Sarvekshak, which was on her way to Mumbai. The vessel, with 52 crew members on board, was stuck in the path of cyclone Tauktae and was drifting towards the eye of the storm. “The vessel was encountering wind speeds of 55 knots with very rough seas. The vessel informed us that her engines were not generating sufficient power to clear the vessel from the cyclone’s path,” officials said. The Coast Guard provided assistance to the MV Sagar Sarvekshak by providing regular meteorological data which helped the vessel steer clear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coast-guard-helps-2-boats-in-distress-due-to-tauktae/articleshow/82722767.cms||---

Nearly one lakh people were evacuated from the coastal areas as the cyclone is expected to inflict heavy damage to mud houses and weak structures. Districts like Porbandar, Devbhumi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Amreli, Junagadh and Bhavnagar were already reeling under the impact of the cyclone as continuously strong winds, poor visibility and rain kept people on edge. In Diu, a 125-year-old Banyan tree got uprooted due to winds. The sea remained extremely stormy with waves of nearly 10 foot lashing the coast in Veraval and Amreli. Amreli district administration clamped prohibitory orders in Rajula and Jafrabad talukas, banning gatherings of more than four people. Junagadh collector Sourabh Pardhi said, "Over 1200 people have been evacuated. All precautionary measures are being taken with respect to food and shelter. All arrangements are in place."  Energy minister Saurabh Patel, who is in Rajkot, said “A special green corridor is created between Jamnagar and Ahmedabd and all the departments including roads and building, forest and police were asked to remove the trees from the roads and be equipped with machinery on the entire route to keep the road clear of any blockages.” State-run power distributor Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL) sources said the electricity supply will be switched off as precautionary measure as the wind speed was expected to be 80 to 90 kmph. The electricity feeders, transformers and poles are likely to get damaged and it may take one or two days to restore power supply in many parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/roaring-winds-herald-arrival-of-tauktae/articleshow/82716108.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University Teachers' Association opposes common minimum syllabus||Lucknow: Lucknow University Teachers' Association (LUTA) on Monday opposed the varsity's direction to board of studies of various departments to approve the revised syllabi of subjects made by the government in accordance with National Education Policy (NEP). The higher education department had drafted the common minimum syllabus for the state universities last year after the Central government issued the NEP and uploaded it on its website. On April 20, it directed state universities to include 70% of the content prescribed in the CMS in their syllabi and have 30% content of their own. LU authorities wrote to deans of various faculties and department heads to get the syllabi proposed by the higher education department approved from their respective board of studies (BoS) and faculty boards by May 15. However, only a few LU departments have held their BoSs so far. On Monday, when the dean of academics issued another circular, LUTA issued a press statement opposing the move. LUTA president Prof Vineet Verma said, “A series of discussions are required involving department teachers and external experts before finalising syllabus, but nothing could so far be done because LU is closed due to the pandemic. Instead of showing haste, LU should wait for things to normalise”. He also said that the first university syllabus could be revised only after revision of 10+2. Besides, no other state is compelling universities to follow CMS. LU spokesperson Prof Durgesh Srivastava “Since offline meetings are not possible, the online meeting has been called on Tuesday for discussion only. Teachers can raise their issues there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/luta-opposes-common-min-syllabus/articleshow/82722769.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Centre raises Jamnagar oxygen quota from 70MT to 120MT||JAIPUR: The Centre on Monday increased the allocation of liquid oxygen for the state from Jamnagar (Gujarat) to 120 metric tonnes. Earlier, the allocation from Jamnagar was 70 MT. With this, the total allocation for the state by the Centre would go up to 380 MT from 330 MT, said an official. Of these, 100 MT is from Bhiwadi, 120 MT from Jamnagar (Gujarat), 60 MT from Kalinganagar (Odisha), 60 MT from Hazira (Gujarat) and 40 MT from Burnpur (West Bengal). Though the Centre has allocated 380 MT of liquid oxygen to Rajasthan per day, supply has been hampered because of shortage of tankers and distance of the oxygen plants (West Bengal and Odisha). The allocation of oxygen from local manufacturers (ASUs) remains the same, at 125 MT. So far, the state has received two oxygen tankers carrying 40tonnes of oxygen from Tata Steel in Kalinganagar (Odisha) and three tankers carrying 54 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen from Steel Authority of India (SAIL)-ISP in Burnpur, West Bengal. Meanwhile, the Centre has also finalised the modalities of the audit for the use of ventilators, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and the supply of oxygen in the state. The audit will be conducted by the state-level sub-group, formed under the national level task force appointed by the Supreme Court. On the directions of the Supreme Court a national task force was constituted to ensure effective and transparent allocation of liquid medical oxygen to the states and union territories. Under the task force, sub-groups have been formed in the states. The members of the state-level oxygen audit sub-group in Rajasthan are: Sanjay Lohia (mines department, Govt of India), A T Pednekar- convenor- (industry dept, Rajasthan), Dr Manprakash Sharma (SMS hospital), Dr Sushil Bhati (SMS hospital) and Ajay Singh (Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization - PESO). Box Jaipur: Keeping in view the possible damage due to ongoing cyclone, the Rajasthan Government has taken various preventive measures to maintain uninterrupted supply of oxygen across the state and also from Gujarat to Rajasthan. The guidelines have been issued to all district collectors to deal with cyclone. These include: arranging valves/humidifiers/spares in advance for oxygen plants; to arrange/locate fire tenders for fire hazards; to arrange backup DG sets as per list of hospitals/covid centres where the patients are on oxygen support; to activate civil defence and SDRF.

In the city, the vaccination drive will resume on Tuesday after three days in select centres that have not been hit by the rain, the BMC said. As planned, people aged above 60 years and the differently abled will be allowed to walk in and take the first shot of Covishield on Tuesday and Wednesday. Those coming for the second dose of Covaxin can also walk in on both days. Thane civic body, though, has suspended vaccination for Tuesday. The BMC said in view of the limited stock of vaccines available with it, not all centres will be vaccinating to their capacity. Some affected by Monday’s rain will be shut. The list of centres where vaccination will take place on Tuesday will be published on social media, the BMC said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they have left the choice with local wards. “Depending on how much their areas have been affected by rain, they will take a call on whether to vaccinate on Tuesday,” he said, adding things should streamline by Wednesday. The state on Sunday had one of its lowest turnouts in two weeks due to dose crunch and several districts not holding a drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-crosses-2cr-mark-in-maha-drive-to-restart-in-mumbai-city-today/articleshow/82718073.cms||---

While the state government is aware of these six cases at Goa Medical College (GMC), it seems oblivious of the two cases at private hospitals in South Goa. GMC dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar said that six Covid-19 patients at GMC have been detected with Mucormycosis — also called black fungus — but are doing well. The state faces a huge shortage of Amphotericin B vials“Six mucormycosis cases are being treated in Goa,” said . Bandekar. “The six patients were detected with black fungus at the time of their Covid-19 treatment and not after discharge from the hospital. All six patients are currently undergoing treatment at GMC.” The state faces a massive shortage of Amphotericin B vials, with relatives of the patients taking to social media to search for the medicine, and even asking relatives in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Belagavi to procure the medicine. The first victim was a male who died on May 11 at a private hospital near Holy Spirit Church, Margao. However, on May 15, director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa said that no case of mucormycosis was detected in the state. The first patient was treated with two doses of Amphotericin B, but succumbed a day later. The second patient tested positive for mucormycosis on May 12, and is being treated at a private hospital at Malbhat, Margao. “We have one case. The patient has Covid-19 we are doing the best we can,” said a senior doctor at the private hospital. Caused by a fungus which infects the nose, eyes, brain and sinuses, experts are trying to ascertain the exact cause for the fungus infection in Covid patients, but the state government remains oblivious to the fact. Bandekar said that the patients at GMC, who have high diabetes, may have been self-medicating with steroids. “Six patients had taken steroids a little early, even as their diabetes was high. The results of their treatment are good. We have procured antifungal drugs needed for their treatment,” he said. He said that the six were being treated with the latest protocol, namely endoscopic radical debridement. Bandekar urged people not to start using steroids during the initial phase of the infection. “Only after five days, when inflammation in the lungs is noticed, must the patient be given steroids,” said Bandekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-dies-of-black-fungus-gmc-says-six-cases-in-goa/articleshow/82722775.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Goa||Wind, rain ravage horticulture crops, vegetables, cane||Panaji: Gusty winds and heavy rain that lashed Goa on Sunday owing to cyclonic storm Tauktae, left the agricultural community devastated with losses. Horticulture crops, vegetables and sugarcane faced serious damage that amounted to approximately Rs 2.5-3 crore, as per preliminary assessment. The directorate of agriculture is in the process of assessing the damage with zonal agricultural officers who are currently visiting villages. Preliminary assessment has revealed that there is crop damage in almost every taluka, with maximum crop loss reported in Sanguem, Quepem, Pernem, Salcete, Valpoi, Bardez and Sattari so far. Coastal agricultural areas were also affected due to high intensity winds. “Clearing material on some fields has been washed away. There was inundation in some places but water receded by Monday,” director of agriculture Nevil Alphonso, said. Most of the damage, according to preliminary reports of the zonal agricultural officers, is of coconut, areca nut and banana, besides vegetables and sugarcane. Due to gusty winds, areca nut, coconut and banana experienced fruit drops. Mango trees also met with the same fate. Farmers have reported that standing sugarcane plantations also flattened. Farmers will be compensated for crop damage after assessment, Alphonso said. “We had a meeting with the chief minister on Monday. There are losses of about 225 hectares so far, amounting to damages of at least Rs 2.5-3 crore. The complete picture will be before us only after final assessment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wind-rain-ravage-horticulture-crops-vegetables-cane/articleshow/82722806.cms||---

Police said the suspect — Vishal Arjun Sonawane (41) — had an office on the Raja Bahadur Mill Road. He uploaded his number on a website, claiming to be an RTO agent. People would call him to get their RTO-related work done. He would stop taking their calls afterthey had made the payments. Police said a few cases against the suspect had been registered with the Bund Garden, Mundhwa and other police stations in the city. An officer said, Sonawane would win the confidence of the people by claiming that he was an authorized RTO agent and would show them fake letters and RTO documents. “In due course of time, police will register all the 15 or more cases against the suspect,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-poses-as-rto-agent-dupes-over-15/articleshow/82720351.cms||---
---||Kolkata||TMC supporters come out in force, protest at Raj Bhavan gates too||KOLKATA: Covid-19 protocols and enhanced restrictions were challenged in pockets of Kolkata as hundreds of angry Trinamool Congress supporters spilled out on the streets on Monday demanding the release of senior party leaders, arrested in the 2016 Narada sting case. It took a plea by MP Abhishek Banerjee to rein in the tempers from spiralling into violent protests. While the CBI office at Nizam Palace was the centre of protests, it was the parallel protests at Raj Bhavan, Chetla (near transport minister Firhad Hakim’s residence) and pockets of north Kolkata that kept cops on their toes. Though there was little vehicle on the road, cops had to shut down stretches of important roads to control the situation. It was then Abhishek took to Twitter to post a statement, “I urge everyone to abide by the law and refrain from any activity that violates lockdown norms for the sake of the larger interest of Bengal and its people. We have utmost faith in the judiciary and the battle will be fought legally.” Senior Trinamool Congress leaders also dashed to all spots — from Nizam Palace, Raj Bhavan and the high court complex — to reach out to angry party workers. As agitators tried to reach to Nizam Palace, state minister and Trinamool Mahila Congress president, Chandrima Bhattacharya wrote to the Kolkata police commissioner Soumen Mitra. In her complaint, she wrote, “action against the law and do the needful against the CBI officers who had arrested the aforesaid leaders at the behest of PM, union HM and the governor of the state.” While most focus remained on Nizam Palace, Raj Bhavan was turning into another flashpoint. TMC supporters tried to climb up the gates of Raj Bhavan and block three of its entrances. The supporters finally blocked the roads before cops could open a dialogue and manage to scatter the protesters. The maximum number of protestors were present at the North Gate. “They had initially blocked a portion of the road but suddenly moved towards the gate and tried climbing it. When we stopped them, they would not budge till the three TMC leaders were bailed out. If required, they would have stayed put for the night,” recalled a police officer. At Chetla, near Hakim’s residence, protesters, questioning why Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy were not arrested, rolled over on the road, while others tried burning tyres but were stopped. A few of the TMC supporters even got involved in an altercation with central forces who had come with the CBI to the minister’s residence. “This is political vendetta. This is cheap politics,” screamed one of the protesters. Reports of protests also came from Domjur’s Ankurhati, from Rathtala in Madan Mitra’s constituency, Kamarhati and Kanthi central bus stand. At Bankura’s Barjora, the local MLA led the protests. The NH 12 (34) of Haringhata in Nadia and the Midnapore-Keshpur state highway too were blocked by TMC supporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-supporters-come-out-in-force-protest-at-raj-bhavan-gates-too/articleshow/82720366.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Why road to recovery from Covid is getting longer||New Delhi: Weakness, fatigue, sleeplessness and brain fogging are the most common symptoms people experience after recovering from Covid-19. Many claim that even a few minutes of work tires them out. They are unable to sleep much at night. Doctors told TOI that the trend of self-medication and approaching the doctor late after onset of symptoms is one of the reasons the post-Covid symptoms linger on for so long. “Time is the biggest healer, and one should think one has already won a battle and re-start living life in a positive manner,” advised Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate professor, department of medicine, AIIMS. “The flood of content in circulation on social media only adds to anxiety and sleeplessness. People who are recovering should form a social support group and seek help from counsellors or psychologists to channelise their thoughts.” Asked why the symptoms were severe this time, as also the post-Covid recovery, Nischal said, “The disease is more severe now than last year, as are the symptoms. The virus is primarily a lung disease but it has the potential to affect the entire body because of the distribution of ACE2 receptors through which it gains entry into human cells. The dysregulation this causes takes time to stabilise.” Doctors told TOI that serious complications after recovery are only seen in 1-2% of the cases. In some individuals, its more psychological than medical, the result of being bombarded with negative news or information related to Covid. “People who recover from Covid need to have a positive approach to resuming life after having won the battle. Popping vitamins is not the only way to boost immunity, eating a protein-enriched diet, fruits and exercise also help. Yes, don’t exert yourself, take one day at a time. Recovery is like a scar and will heal gradually,” said Nischal. Dr Amitabh Parti, director, internal medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, concurred and additionally advised breathing exercise to recovered patients. “Brain fog and lack of focus are also seen in some cases. Another issue is insomnia. If patients who are recovering are constantly surrounded by Covid-related talk or information, then the mind will be disturbed and a good night’s sleep isn’t possible,” said Parti. “It’s important to relax, keep your body hydrated and take time off social media and mobile phones.” Parti recommended conversations with family and friends, especially if the patient was alone. “Anxiety and depression are due to two reasons in the current circumstances,” said Parti. “Either the individual has suffered Covid or has lost a family member to the coronavirus.” Experts pointed out that post-Covid symptoms were there during the first wave too but were now exhibiting more severe effects. “People are complaining of joint aches, body pains, headache, poor appetite, poor memory, mild cough and other problems,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. “In some cases, it takes a month to recover fully, in others two months or more. The body needs time to heal. In my opinion keeping an eye on what you’re eating and avoiding alcohol for a while also help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-road-to-recovery-from-covid-is-getting-longer/articleshow/82722796.cms||---

With the impending landfall of the extremely severe cyclonic storm forecasted in coastal areas of Gujarat, Army units and formations have prepared themselves with substantial teams along with elements of communication and engineer task forces to provide relief and all kind of assistance following Covid protocols, the Army said in a statement. “Focus is to save lives, speedy clearance of routes to ensure moveme nt of oxygen and standby arrangements at Covid hospitals,” it mentioned. “180 teams (three teams in each column) and 9 ETFs are on standby at short notice factoring in all possible contingencies,” it noted. Since the maximum impact is likely to be in Saurashtra including the union territory of Diu, 10 integrated teams are poised to be employed for aid to civil authority in Diu. Ten teams have been moved to Junagadh and others are ready to move on short notice of the state administration after analysis of situation as it builds up, it added. All units are geared up for impact and all necessary coordination has been carried out with civil administration. General officer commanding (GOC) of the army division located in Ahmedabad attended a coordination meeting chaired by Gujarat chief minister and has assured all support. Gujarat police have deployed 11 rescue companies in the coastal areas along with 41 NDRF teams. These teams will work in tandem with the disaster management authority.

---||Goa||Start preparing for third wave, operationalise all SSB beds: HC to Goa govt||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday instructed the state government to make all 550 Covid beds in Goa Medical College's (GMC) new super-specialty block operational, and to assess the oxygen requirement to prepare for a possible third wave. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that this would be done in stages, and said that 350 patients had already been transferred to this block. On being told that patients at GMC are still seen on the floor and on stretchers, the court told the government that patients cannot be made to lie on the floor when there is a 550-bed hospital in the neighbourhood. When the government stated that these would be made operational if required, the division bench shot back, instructing the government to prepare for the third wave. “Our request is don’t start with ‘in case it is required’... we have to prepare for the third wave… The only question is within how much time should it be made operational. Don’t go into the theory of 'in case it is necessary’, that is our earnest request,” the bench stated. “If some beds are unoccupied, then it’s a happy situation. Let’s not have a situation where patients are more and beds are less,” the court added. Lawyer Vivek Rodrigues, representing Scoop Oxygen, told the court that it was able to supply the required amount of oxygen to the super-specialty block, GMC, and all hospitals in Goa. The court appealed to the company to sort out any commercial considerations with the government a little later, and to prioritise the effective supply of oxygen and saving lives. The bench also complimented the state administration for putting up the oxygen tank at GMC in record time, stating that if it were to be delayed by a day or two, the storm would have overtaken it. Pangam stated that the government is trying to create a buffer stock of oxygen in the state, and the court asked whether other industries could be convinced to make efforts to help as part of their CSR, stating that Vedanta already converted its existing plant to supply oxygen. "When assessing the requirement (on oxygen), don’t assess it depending on what is presently happening, presently we are also happy to learn that the numbers are coming down, but when you make your assessment, please take into account a possible third wave. We should hope for the best but should be prepared for the worst,” the bench stated. The state government also said that it would resolve issues of shortages of oximeters, medication and other issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/start-preparing-for-third-wave-operationalise-all-ssb-beds-hc/articleshow/82722822.cms||---

Fire personnel were on their toes the whole day long, responding to distress calls, especially one relating to removal of trees that had fallen on homes. According to the department’s headquarters, personnel responded to 180 calls for help on Sunday while low priority cases were taken up on Monday. “Most of the calls were about tree falls. We managed to respond to 180 calls. However, the extent of the loss has yet to be estimated,” an official said. Only two people lost their lives in the state even though the severe cyclonic storm saw wind speeds of 100kmph and extremely heavy rainfall. Government sources said that over 200 homes suffered major and minor damage, for which the state government has promised compensation from the disaster relief fund. Around 700 electricity poles and approximately 190 electricity transformers have been damaged across the state, resulting in most parts, including fringes of the state capital, going dark for 48 hours. “Many cars have been destroyed as a result of trees falling.

It will be available for Rs 600 per dose at these facilities. The IMA said if all goes well, private hospitals in the state will start vaccination from June 1. “We at IMA propose to charge Rs 600 per dose of vaccine in the private sector on behalf of the Serum Institute. We have asked the presidents and general secretaries of all branches of the state to send their requirement for the vaccines. The demand draft (DD) has to be sent in the name of IMA,” said secretary, IMA, Dr Ajay Khanna. “We are making the price universal and declaring them prior to purchase so that no one can charge extra. The vaccination at private hospitals will boost the inoculation drive and will make the process hassle-free for many,” he added. Private hospitals across the country had been asked by the central government to procure their own vaccine stocks from May 1. After this, vaccinations stopped at private facilities as they were not provided with any guidelines on how to go about it. Meanwhile, daily cases continue to decline in Uttarakhand, with the state recording 3,719 daily Covid-19 cases on May 17. A total of 136 deaths took the toll past the 5,000-mark to 5,034.

---||Delhi||BJP targets AAP over ration, says needs of migrants ignored||New Delhi: Delhi BJP functionaries on Monday accused the AAP government of ignoring the needs of migrant workers and the poor badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said that in the past six years not a single new ration card has been made in Delhi. Though over 17 lakh families have ration cards, thousands of eligible people still do not have it, claimed Bidhuri. “When the state government sought applications for making ration cards, 54 lakh applications were found to be valid, but till date, they have not been issued ration cards,” he said in a conference along with Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and MP Meenakshi Lekhi. Gupta claimed that the free ration announced by AAP is in fact being distributed under central government’s National Food Security Act and PMGKAY scheme. New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi, meanwhile, claimed that the Centre gives pure ration, which is being adulterated by the state government. “Many women, like Moti Nagar resident Jagdamba who works as a labourer, have not received ration inspite of having a card,” she said. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed that despite orders to distribute ration under PMGKAY from May 17, 90% fair price shops did not distribute the ration, causing the poor who turned up to wait and risk getting infected with Covid-19. Kapoor added that later, the distribution of ration under NSFA and the PM’s scheme started at many centres. The food commissioner and a senior food department officer did not respond to TOI's attempts to seek their reaction over the issue. No response from the AAP government was available despite attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-targets-aap-over-ration-says-needs-of-migrants-ignored/articleshow/82722888.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The girl’s mother has lodged a first impressional report with the Chakan police. The man has been arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  On Saturday night, when the girl was in the garden, the suspect sexually assaulted her. The girl’s mother noticed it and lodged a complaint against the man after discussing the matter with her family members, police said. In another case, the Chakan police had registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against a man on the charge of outraging the modesty of a seven-year-old girl last week, when she had gone to apply for an Aadhaar card. The police said according to the complaint by the girl’s mother, the suspect, who was at the centre as well, forced the minor to sit on his lap under the pretext of taking her thumb impression. “The woman also claimed that the suspect showed the girl obscene clips on his computer and also touched her improperly,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-in-net-on-charge-of-assaulting-minor/articleshow/82720428.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Paid Rs 1.7 lakh for 2-day ICU stay in Lucknow's private hospital: Daily wager||LUCKNOW: A two-night stay in a private hospital for the Covid treatment of his mother cost Deshraj, a daily wager, Rs 1.7 lakh. The amount not only took away his entire lifesaving, but also put him in debt. What was worse is that his mother did not survive. It was only later that Deshraj realised the Bakshi Ka Talab hospital had heavily overcharged him. Like Deshraj’s case, there are various people who have been complaining how Covid-19 treatment expenses in private hospitals have bled bank accounts. Families have lost entire savings in many cases. This, after they have struggled to find a hospital bed and spent on oxygen cylinders and other medicines. According to rates fixed by the government, a private hospital can charge Rs 8,000-10,000 daily for an oxygen bed, Rs 13,000-15,000 a day for ICU bed and Rs 15,000-18,000 daily for a ventilator. So far, the district administration has taken action against five hospitals for overcharging and giving ‘kuchcha’ bills. In the case of Deshraj’s mother (65), on May 1, her oxygen level dropped to 35. After a desperate search, they found a bed in the BKT hospital. “I had no idea about rates fixed by the government. Even if I did, at that time my priority was to save my mother’s life,” said Deshraj (45), a gardener with a monthly income of Rs 15,000. He had to pay Rs 1 lakh for two days in ICU, Rs 13,500 for tests, Rs 37,500 for medicines and injections and after the patient’s death, Rs 5,000 to hire a hearse. “Besides exhausting life savings, I borrowed Rs 46,000 from my employers. The hospital gave kuchcha receipts for the payments,” he said. Vinod Khatri, a private company executive, also had to take loans for the treatment of his father Radhey Shyam Khatri (75), a retired bank employee. He was in ICU for 18 days in a hospital on Faizabad Road in April, but could not survive. “We spent nearly Rs 10 lakh on treatment which included Rs 50,000 daily for ICU and drugs in the hospital. When my father’s entire medical insurance was exhausted, I had to borrow money,” he said. Manasnagar resident Anurag Dixit, who works in a multinational company, said that he spent over Rs 4.5 lakh on the treatment of his mother Meena (65) at a private hospital in Gomtinagar. “She was in hospital for 17 days, initially in ICU and then on ventilator. I had to break my fixed deposits and take loans, but despite our best efforts, we could not save her,” said Anurag. So far, Gomtinagar resident Aadya Shree has spent over Rs 2.5 lakh on her father’s treatment. “We bought two oxygen cylinders worth Rs 25,000 each when he was in home isolation, as beds were not available in any hospital. Somehow, we got one, but the hospital said we will have to bring our own 5-litre capacity oxygen concentrator, which cost us about Rs 75,000. Although the hospital charged Rs 1 lakh for the bed and drugs during the 9-day stay as per the fixed rate list, while discharging the patient after recovery, it asked us to donate the concentrator for another patient,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/paid-rs-1l-for-2-day-icu-stay-in-pvt-hospital-daily-wager/articleshow/82722869.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Dehradun||Pandemic triggering panic attacks in teenagers, increased anxiety levels in adults, say Doon-based psychologists||Dehradun: As tragedies and trauma become more common than ever in the wake of the second and more deadly wave of Covid-19 across India, several youths are reaching an inflection point where they are unable to process their feelings and just feel numb to the grief around them. Abhinand Patil, a Dehradun-based 18-year-old student, told TOI, “Unfortunately, the surge in deaths due to Covid-related complications and the many reports on India's creaking healthcare system have made me accustomed to the sad events happening in my surroundings. All this is too overwhelming. I feel that the pandemic has taken my youth away from me.” Like Patil, thousands of other students and even adults are struggling to keep their minds calm amidst a raging pandemic. “I deal with patients aged 16-60 years. While the teenagers are showing temper and panic issues, people aged above 35 years are reporting rising levels of anxiety,” Saumya, psychologist, Heart It Out, a social organisation told TOI. When asked about the major causes behind the rise in cases of mental uneasiness, she added, “There are a lot of fears relating to the Covid-19 infection which causes pervasive anxiety and frustration. Besides, the pandemic and consequent lockdown is also leading to helplessness, boredom, sadness, uncertainty, loss of hope, a feeling of dejection, aimlessness, extended monotony and loneliness.” The situation is particularly grim for those admitted in hospitals as they get to encounter death from close corners. “It’s traumatic for a Covid-19 patient to see another patient succumbing to virus-related ailments. Sometimes, patients get a panic attack when they find out that the person on the bed next to them lost the battle to the virus,” said Nidhi Kala, a psychologist at the Doon Hospital. According to mental health experts, people in the age group of 25-to-45 years have been the worst affected. Reeta Sharma, psychologist and psychotherapist, Holistic Healing Hub, told TOI, “In my opinion, people between 25 and 45 years of age are the most affected as they’re burdened with financial and other responsibilities. I have also recorded an uptick in women patients during the pandemic. Many of them complain of an existential crisis. This is more common among women who shoulder the responsibilities of their in-laws as well.” A shortage of medical supplies and the state of hospitals due to a dramatic increase in the caseload is also triggering fear among locals. “The unending search for medical help and resources has left me drained. People fear medical apathy after contracting Covid-19 more than the virus itself. I don't know what to feel anymore. I have grown numb to the news of people passing away,” said 44-year-old Shrayyash Tiwari, a Dehradun resident. On being asked if mental health issues have increased during the second wave of the pandemic in comparison to its first wave, Kala said, “The cases of mental health issues have certainly increased this time around. Most of us didn’t see another wave coming and were not willing to go back to living the isolated lives again. Consequently, people now complain that they don't see an end to the pandemic.” Meanwhile, mental health experts suggest that people should get involved in activities they love to stay positive and involved during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pandemic-triggering-panic-attacks-in-teenagers-increased-anxiety-levels-in-adults-say-doon-based-psychologists/articleshow/82718152.cms||---

In the complaint lodged with City police station, DHO Dr Hari Pawar said some scamsters are trying to lure unemployed youths saying there are vacancies in the health department of Yavatmal and those would be filled in by direct recruitment basis. “There are no vacancies in the department as claimed in the fake advertisement,” said Dr Pawar, debunking the claims of the scamsters of a direct recruitment drive. Police have launched an investigation to track down the miscreants. Similar advertisement proclaiming vacancies in zilla parishad, especially in the education department, had gone viral earlier. Though a probe was ordered by the then chief executive officer, it was reportedly abandoned for the reason best known to the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fake-recruitment-advt-goes-viral-dho-lodges-fir/articleshow/82720494.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Infection fear, transport shortage hit OPD footfall||KOLKATA: A combined impact of a spurt in Covid admissions and ban on public transport has driven away patients from the OPDs (out-patient department) across Kolkata’s private hospitals. Even as the demand for a bed rises, OPDs, like last year, have started wearing a deserted look. While this has left a large number of patients in need of consultation in the lurch, some hospitals are relieved to have a relatively empty hospital that has made their task of adhering to Covid-compliance norms easy. Along with the stricter regulations that came into effect on Sunday, there has also been a drop in positivity rate in at least three city hospitals that conduct Covid tests. At Peerless Hospital, which would receive 450 OPD patients till March, the number trickled down to just 176 on Monday. The decline has been steady and almost proportional to the rise in the number of Covid admissions. “Like last year, OPD patients have started staying away fearing infection and also because there’s no transport available now. Covid patients can arrange ambulances but they don’t have the option,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Medica Superspecialty Hospital shut down its OPD last month since the area was being used for the movement of Covid patients. While its Covid units across its three centres remain fully occupied, OPD footfall has dropped drastically since Sunday at AMRI Hospitals. Last week, it had been around 40% of the normal mark. “On Monday, it has come down to around 20%. First, the fear of visiting a Covid hospital is back. Secondly, transport is scarce for non-Covid patients. So, this will continue till the transport restrictions are lifted and the number of Covid patients slides,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. Dip in OPD numbers started in April at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) with a 40% slide. It fell sharply by another 50% in the first half of May. “Following the stricter regulations from Sunday, the numbers have now come down to 300-350. It doesn’t sound very bad yet but the fact it is that we receive 1200 OPD patients in normal times. Over the last two months, it’s been reduced to a third and the plunge will now be sharper,” said RTIICS regional head R Venkatesh. Scores of elderly patients find themselves in trouble. “We are planning to resume the online consultation platforms for the sake of these patients since this wave could last longer than the first one. Our helpline numbers receive more than a hundred calls from these patients whose contact with doctors are suddenly snapped,” said a hospital chief. At Peerless Hospital, which tested around 450 a day with a positivity rate of 60% till May 8, the number of tests dropped to 348 on Saturday with a positivity rate of 37%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/infection-fear-transport-shortage-hit-opd-footfall/articleshow/82720479.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Mumbai||Patients who recovered at home must monitor blood sugar: Doctors||Medical experts are urging Covid patients who’re recovering at home to keep monitoring their blood glucose levels. The monitoring, the experts said, should continue after recovery and even if people are not diabetic. The advisory comes after doctors reported sporadic cases of mucormycosis — a fungal infection seen in many who’ve recovered from Covid — among those who were not hospitalised and not administered steroids. Elevated blood sugar level is a factor that increases risk of contracting mucormycosis. Experts said Covid-19 itself is likely to boost blood sugar levels. So monitoring blood sugar levels during and after Covid is certainly advisable, they said. “Whether diabetic or not, raised blood sugar is the single most important factor in the development of this deadly disease. Sugar control is of foremost importance,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande. Physician D B Kadam, head of the Pune Covid-19 task force, said, “Covid can attack pancreatic beta cells causing hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Whether you are a diabetic or not, it is advisable to monitor blood sugar levels during and after Covid treatment.” Infectious diseases expert Sujata Rege of Bharati hospital said, “Mucor fungus has an enzyme (ketone reductase) that allows it to thrive in high blood glucose and acidic conditions.” Endocrinologist and state Covid task force member Shashank Joshi said there are seven parameters that have to be monitored during at-home care of Covid patients. “A close watch on sugar levels is needed during and after Covid treatment. Efforts have to be made to keep blood glucose levels between 140-180. The post-Covid monitoring period is three months,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/patients-who-recovered-at-home-must-monitor-blood-sugar-in-maharashtra-docs/articleshow/82723006.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Death toll of teachers due to poll duty now 1621, says union in letter to Yogi Adityanath||BAREILLY: A prominent teachers’ union in UP said on Monday that after updating figures from various centres across the state, the number of teachers who died after contracting Covid during panchayat poll duty has been revised from the earlier 706 to 1,621. In a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, president of Prathmik Shikshak Sangh Dinsesh Chandra Sharma has demanded Rs 1crore compensation for the families of the teachers and appealed that they be called "Covid warriors". The list contains the names, employee numbers and other details of the teachers. The union said that most deaths took place in May. By the end of April, after the fourth and last round of rural polls, unions in UP had put the number of dead teachers at 706. They had appealed to the state government to postpone the counting of votes, which they said would lead to further spread of the infection and more deaths. A petition was filed in the Supreme Court seeking rescheduling of counting. But the court refused to stop the process after an assurance from the state election commission that all protocols would be followed. Counting then went on for three days as thousands worked together, flouting norms of social distancing, often without masks. Leader of another teachers’ union, which is affiliated to RSS, confirmed the new figure. Spokesperson of Akhil Bharatiya Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, Virendra Mishra, in a hospital recuperating from Covid-19, said that the numbers could be "even more than 1,600". The state government, on its part, has asked all Basic Shiksha Adhikaris (BSA) to compile a list of such teachers and send it to them. BSAs haven't been able to complete the list as yet. Sharma told TOI, “We have shared the names and contact numbers of the kin of the teachers who have died. The CM can get the data verified sitting in his office. Many children are orphans now. Many women are widows. But there is not a single word from any government official or politician for them.” TOI contacted the families of a few teachers whose names were mentioned in the new list. Ajeet Yadav (47) a school teacher in Bareilly, had fallen ill during election duty on April 15. He tested positive for Covid-19 on April 23. He died during treatment on May 13. His brother Dinesh Yadav said, “He was threatened that an FIR would be registered despite his condition." Manoj Verma (41), a teacher at Ullara in Sitapur, also died due to Covid-19. His brother-in-law Ashish Gautam told TOI, “He fell ill after attending training at the block campus and returned home on April 16. After two days of treatment at home, he was taken to a hospital in Lucknow. He tested positive on April 27 and died during treatment on May 7. We had informed his department about his condition but no support was provided." Currently three members of his family are battling for life in a hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/death-toll-of-teachers-in-up-due-to-poll-duty-now-1621-says-union-in-letter-to-yogi/articleshow/82718178.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The dusty village in Fatehpur tehsil has, so far, recorded 16 deaths in 16 days, including six from one family, which has created a growing sense of fear among its residents. This is not an isolated case. Two other villages, Kheerva and Mangluna, in the district too had witnessed a series of deaths, mostly related to Covid, leaving the local administration puzzled. Kheerva hit the headlines with 27 deaths in the last 30 days, while its neighbouring village Mangluna recorded 16 deaths in 10 days, horrifying the village of expats. Of the total deaths in Badi, three have died at the Sawli Covid care facility while the remaining 12 have died due to influenza-like symptoms. Sawant Singh’s family from the village lost six of its members since May 2, including one who died in an accident. He lost his brother Anand Singh, nephews Chotu Singh and Jeetendra Singh, sister-in-law Saroj Kanwar, an aunt and cousin Rajendra Singh. Singh said that of the six, three of them — Jeetendra, Rajendra and Anand — died while battling Covid at the Sawli care facility. “Chotu died in an accident in Jaipur while the remaining two had Covid symptoms,” Singh said, alleging that his request to local authorities to conduct RT-PCR tests on remaining family members has fallen on deaf ears. Despite a large number of deaths in a village with a population of 3,000, the district administration has not yet woken up to the crisis, sources said. The routine random sampling has not been done in the village. Panna Lal, a villager, said that, at present, several villagers were down with Covid. But since they had no faith in the system, they have opted for home remedies. “I will visit Roru Badi on Tuesday for an inspection and to assess the situation," said Ajay Choudhary, chief medical and health office (CMHO), Sikar, who ruled out community spread in the area. “Our teams have done extensive survey and sampling in the two villages of Kheerva and Mangluna. But it turned out that only five and three deaths, respectively, in these villages were due to Covid," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/16-deaths-in-16-days-inyet-another-sikar-village/articleshow/82720477.cms||---

CMO faces action||LUCKNOW: After chief medical officer of Lucknow Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar failed to lodge FIR against three private hospitals allegedly found overcharging patients against government norms for Covid-19 package, nodal officer for Covid management Roshan Jacob has warned the CMO of departmental inquiry if he does not take action against the hospitals. A letter of warning was served to the CMO on Monday afternoon. “Ensure the FIR is lodged by Monday night, or departmental inquiry will be initiated against you. During inspection, the three hospitals were found charging huge bills to patients for Covid-19 treatment,” read the report marked to the CMO. Dr Bhatnagar said, "We are investigating the matter related to three hospitals fleecing patients. Based on the report, a written complaint will be handed over to police for FIR and a copy will be sent to the district administration" On May 12, an inspection was conducted by Jacob’s team which included joint director health Dr Sunil Pandey, additional CMO Dr K D Mishra and special officer revenue board Apoorva Yadav. Hospitals on Kursi Road, Faizabad Road and in Gomtinagar were inspected. During scrutiny, it was found that hospitals were charging up to 800% more fee than the government approved Covid-19 package of Rs 18,000 per day. This includes treatment of hypertension and uncontrollable diabetes. The package also includes food, nursing care, monitoring, emergency tests, visiting charges, consultancy, test and hemodialysis. According to Jacob’s report, “Even after constant reminders that no patient will be charged for oxygen, the Kursi Road-based hospital was charging patients heavily for it. One patient was charged Rs 86,400, another Rs 38,400 and one Rs 28,800. The hospital did not even give original bills to the patient for total charges it took.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/why-no-fir-against-fleecing-hospitals-cmo-faces-action/articleshow/82722910.cms||---

The suspect has been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, police said. The incident took place in Premnagar locality of Bareilly on Monday. Naveen Kumar had lost his job last month and was in a foul mood. He often quarreled with his wife, Deepmala. On Monday, Naveen turned violent and started beating up Deepmala with a stick. Their neighbour, Arjun, 24, son of a home guard, tried to rescue her. An enraged Naveen turned his ire on Arjun and thrashed him. He would have continued beating him if neighbours had not rescued him, said a witness. Not realizing that his injuries could be fatal, Arjun’s family took him to the police station to lodge a complaint. Thereafter, they took him to a private hospital, where he died after some time. Rohit Singh Sajwan, Bareilly SSP, said, “We have registered an FIR under the section of culpable homicide and the accused Naveen will soon be arrested. Prima facie it appears that the victim died of a head injury.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-thrashed-to-death-for-trying-to-save-woman-from-violent-husband/articleshow/82718180.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

And it’s very recent that she got the modern boat for practice. Prachi said that her journey was not easy. “When I started my practice in 2018, there was hardly any awareness on para players in kayaking and canoeing. There was no boat for para players. In such a situation, the biggest challenge for me was to start practicing,” said Prachi. For players, there is a special kind of boat to maintain the balance on the water. “My coach Mayank Thakur told me that he would construct a prototype of the boat. I was not sure how to start practice on it. But, when I used the boat, I found that it was efficient,” said Prachi. Coach Thakur said that he used an oil drum to maintain balance of the boat. “I fixed the drum with a pair of bamboo on one side of the boat. “It was not possible to arrange a proper modern boat so this ‘jugaad’ was the only option for Prachi,” said Thakur. Prachi practiced on Jugaad Boat for almost three years. Thakur even constructed the modern boat for Prachi. “Original para canoe boat costs Rs 5 lakh. However, we have made the new boat for just Rs 25,000. Prachi has been practicing on it for the past few months,” said Thakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/gwalior-girl-sails-to-tokyo-paralympic-on-her-jugaad-boat/articleshow/82718211.cms||---

Referring to the Law Commission’s 255th report of March 2015, the NGO pleaded that its recommendations be accepted and the power to appoint election commissioners be given to the high-powered committee. “The appointment of the members of the Election Commission solely by the executive is incompatible with the values enshrined in the preamble and basic features of the Constitution. “Democracy is a facet of the basic structure of the Constitution and in order to ensure free and fair elections and maintain healthy democracy in our country, the Election Commission should be insulated from political and/or executive interference,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/change-way-of-appointing-ec-members-adr/articleshow/82726594.cms||---

He has sent a letter to chief minster Uddhav Thackeray and state Congress president Nana Patole complaining lackadaisical approach of Wadettiwar despite having ample funds under him. “There is acute shortage of oxygen and ventilator beds and also doctors and medical staff to treat Covid patients at government facilities in Chandrapur. The administration’s apathy towards providing higher wages has failed to attract doctors and staff on contract basis despite two interviews scheduled by the health department,” Puglia wrote in the letter. He claimed that large funds are available under the head of mining royalty fund. Apart from this, the administration has powers to spend 30% of the allocation made in the district planning fund. But the guardian minister is not keen on offering higher wages to doctors sought on contract basis, he said. Puglia said doctors are paid a monthly honorarium of Rs60,000 under the National Health Mission, but are seeking higher wages. Hence, ZP CEO has taken the lead and prepared a corpus fund by collecting one-day salary of all officers and employees. The CEO has now hired five doctors for Covid treatment at the wages of Rs1 lakh per month and additional Rs40,000 is being paid from employees corpus fund. Puglia asked when the CEO can take such an initiative, why the guardian minister, having ample funds under him, is reluctant. He alleged that there were 200 deaths during the first wave in Chandrapur while the second wave has taken the toll past 1,250. Puglia demanded an inquiry into the matter. He has has urged the administration to offer higher wages to doctors and hire them to treat Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-mp-blames-wadettiwar-for-high-covid-deaths-in-chanda/articleshow/82720553.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa CM Pramod Sawant to opposition: Stop trying to gain political mileage from cyclone||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday lashed out at political functionaries trying to gain mileage from the situation that has arisen since Cyclone Tauktae’s ferocious assault on Goa on Sunday. “Political functionaries should not gherao offices of PWD and electricity department to gain political mileage,” he said, advising them not to take advantage of the situation. The chief minister further urged political parties and the people to cooperate with the government to bring normalcy in the state. Sawant also thanked panchayats and municipalities for coming forward and volunteering to clear fallen trees from roads. On Sunday, he had said that two people were killed in the cyclone, over 200 houses damaged, and more than 500 trees uprooted. Meanwhile, reacting to the issue of water entering the new super-speciality block, Sawant said that family members of those admitted have taken videos and circulated them. He said that those who show those videos “want to do politics” and should not be encouraged. He said that the block is a new building, and that people should not circulate “such videos”, adding that when there's a cyclone, “such things will happen”. However, he also said that there was no major impact of the cyclone on Goa Medical College (GMC) and other hospitals. Meanwhile, the chief minister also clarified that the admission of Covid-19 patients at private hospital has been taken over by the government from Monday onwards, after an order was issued to that effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-to-opposition-stop-trying-to-gain-political-mileage-from-cyclone/articleshow/82722915.cms||---

In the ranking published by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Monday, the state climbed 27 ranks to bag the second position. The state had earlier come 29th in the list. Jharkhand has taken the top position. “The ranking is based on different parameters, including completion of Smart City Mission projects, the cumulative value of tenders issued, work completed and utilisation of funds, among others,” an official said. The overall score of the state is 35.61 points. Four cities from the state, Udaipur, Kota, Ajmer and Jaipur, found spots in the ranking of 100 cities. While Udaipur came 8th, Kota stood at 11th, Ajmer 29th and Jaipur 36th in the 100 city rankings. Urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “The state received Rs 1,845 crore under the Smart City Mission, so far. Out of this, Rs 1,563 crore have been spent on various projects in smart cities. From 405 projects in four cities, 138 of them have been completed by spending Rs 448 crore. Some 178 works are in progress and 17 works worth Rs 145 crore are being processed.” “Based on discussions with public representatives and smart city guidelines, new public utilities were included in Jaipur, Udaipur, Ajmer and Kota cities. An action plan was prepared for time-bound implementation of works and was effectively monitored. After continuous and regular review of works, they were inspected from time to time. As a result, the momentum could be maintained even during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Dhariwal said. The Centre has released third and fourth instalments of Rs 100 crore and Rs 50 crore, respectively, for Udaipur. Similarly, for Jaipur and Ajmer, a third instalment of Rs 50 crore each has been released, and for Kota a request for the third instalment has been sent. “In Jaipur, we will utilise Rs 150 crore to develop Gangauri Hospital, SMS Hospital and Medical College, which are proving to be extremely beneficial for residents during these times. Also, infrastructure of MBS, JK Lon Hospital in Kota and JLN Hospital in Ajmer are being upgraded by utilising smart city funds,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-comes-2nd-in-centressmart-city-mission-rankings/articleshow/82720535.cms||---

It is the matter for the particular industry to look after the welfare of its employees and also to consider the prospects of the industry,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Monday. “We can only make an appeal to the industries to ensure that the best Covid protocol is maintained, please have as little staff as possible during this period to live up to the spirit of the lock down,” the bench said. The bench made the observations on PILs moved by employee unions of Renault Nissan and Wipro Infrastructure challenging the exemption granted to the units during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cannot-interfere-with-the-states-lockdown-decision-on-industries/articleshow/82724807.cms||---

The service was flagged off on Monday by party UP incharge and MP Sanjay Singh, who said that the auto was equipped with oxygen cylinders to help patients whose oxygen levels had started falling. “Currently, people are being fleeced in the name of ambulances. Those who are desperate are being made to pay huge amounts for short distances. AAP has, therefore, introduced these auto ambulances which would be ideal for patients whose oxygen levels are between 85-90%,” he said. The party has started a similar service in Varanasi, Prayagraj and Meerut, Singh said, adding that in other areas, the party was helping with food and medicines. AAP has issued a number 9818430043, which is linked to a central command room. At present, Lucknow has 10 such auto ambulances functional. Varanasi also has 10 while Prayagraj and Meerut have five each. In Delhi, the party had started with 70 ambulances. The service will be provided for free to whoever contacts the party for the ambulance. “We will increase the numbers and expand to other cities as per need,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-flags-off-free-auto-ambulance-for-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82722954.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Demand for GPs soars in Cov times||Kolkata: When Lake Road resident, Sukanya Banerjee, was down with fever a couple of months ago, the fears that she had been nursing since the outbreak of the pandemic suddenly came true. With no doctor’s chamber in the neighborhood, she was suddenly unsure about whom to approach for advice. “We used to have a family doctor when we were children. But when the doctor passed away a couple of decades ago, we couldn't get another general practitioner (GP). Since then, we have been going to the OPD in a clinic run by a private hospital on Southern Avenue. But since March last year, it was becoming difficult to consult a doctor as most hospitals have been designated for Covid,” said Banerjee. The problem that she faced is one that many have encountered in this pandemic. While the city now has lots of specialists, there are very few doctors for the first port of call. GPs or family physicians that used to thrive till the mid-90s have now become rare. And those that are there suddenly find themselves overwhelmed with patients.  Dr Satyaki Bardhan had a steady flow of patients, particularly during change of season with a bulk of them from the Peyarabagan slum. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the volume of patients has increased by 25%. And his clients are no longer primarily the economically disadvantaged. Businessmen, traders, professionals have been queuing up for checkup in case they developed fever or displayed any other Covid symptom. Ranajit Kumar Das, who has also been seeing patients through the pandemic at his chamber near Purna Cinema in the morning and evening, said that dearth of GPs is owing to the corporatisation of doctors and demand for specialists in private hospitals. “I still function in the old-fashioned way and have been seeing patients at the chamber for three decades now,” said the 67-year-old doctor who charges a modest fee of Rs 400 from patients. Manas Gumta, general surgery head at College of Medicine & Sagore Dutta Medical College, blamed the entry of corporates into the healthcare sector for the disappearance of GPs or family physicians. “Even for a simple common ailments, people have to now consult a gastroenterologist. A GP could have easily handled it,” said Gumta, who pointed out how the pandemic had brought the spotlight back on GPs. Dr Pijush Banerjee, general physician for the last 35 years, has been such a go-to person for scores of residents in and around Salt Lake. “When the pandemic struck, my work pressure increased much, but during the second wave it has increased manifold. I have to stay up till 3am now. Treating Covid patients means a lot of follow-up. My patients call me every time they feel something has gone wrong,” he said. Senior radiation oncologist, Subir Ganguly of Apollo Glenegales, agreed the trend among the medical professionals to get a specialist degree because it is more lucrative not only in terms of money but also glamour and acceptance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/demand-for-gps-soars-in-cov-times/articleshow/82720513.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj offered his virtual tributes to the lord while temple priests performed first ‘rudra abhishek’ on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government, last month, had suspended the yatra for pilgrims until further orders. Notably, last year, the Char Dham Yatra had started for people of Uttarakhand on July 1 due to the rise in Covid cases. As per the estimate of Devasthanam board, over 3.2 lakh devotees visited Char Dham temples, including Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. More than 90% of whom visited Badrinath and Kedarnath temples. “Respecting the sentiments of the devotees at the time of crisis, we are preparing to hold virtual darshan of Char Dham. People will be able to take a glimpse of the gods by a click of their remote. I spoke to the chief minister and he gave permission for the same,” said tourism minister Satpal Maharaj. The minister added that the rituals of opening of the portals of Kedarnath, the most visited among Char Dham temples in the state, started at 3am on Monday. 'Rawal' [priests], additional chief executive officer of Devasthanam board BD Singh, Rudraprayag district magistrate (DM) Manuj Goel and a few other administrative and police officials participated. “Rawal Bhimashankar and chief priest Bagesh Linga, Rudraprayag DM and BD Singh entered the temple's main courtyard from the east gate and the doors of Lord Kedarnath temple were opened at exactly 5am after the chanting of prayers at the main gate. Once the temple's doors were opened, the chief priest Bagesh Linga awakened the Symbhu Shivalinga from the Samadhi and Shringar and 'rudra abhishek pujas' were performed after the Nirvana Darshan. The first puja was performed on behalf of the PM,” said Harish Gaur from Char Dham Devasthanam Board. Gaur added the doors of Shri Badrinath Dham will open at 4.15am on May 18. CM Tirath Singh Rawat has expressed his happiness over the opening of the Kedarnath temple and wished for peoples' well being.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/portals-of-kedarnath-temple-opened/articleshow/82718297.cms||Ishita Mishra

All but four out of the 702 ventilator-supported beds are occupied, while 98% of the ICU beds are full, according to a report issued on Sunday. The patients are still finding it difficult to get a bed in hospitals. Even beds with oxygen support are occupied up to 94%. Out of 3,395 oxygen-supported beds in the city, 3,177 were occupied on Sunday evening. All the big corporate and private hosptials providing Covid treatment are almost running with full capacity, especially the beds with oxygen support and ventilators. In the biggest government-run dedicated RUHS Hospital, all beds are occupied. The hospital has 715 general beds, 442 oxygen beds, 153 beds with ventilators and 52 beds in ICUs without ventilators and all of them are occupied. However, the hospital claimed that there was a decrease in number of fresh admissions. “We were continuously admitting 200 to 250 patients daily, but in the last 24 hours, we have seen a decreasing trend as only 90 fresh admissions have been made,”said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS hospital, adding that it could be an impact of lockdown imposed by the state government. A health department official said the impact of decreasing active cases on occupancy of beds in hospital will be seen after some time. Jaipur has 36,839 active cases currently, even after 8,825 Covid patients recovered on Monday. The number of persons found infected were 2,023.

Gaurav Jain had recovered from Covid a few days ago and was reportedly under depression after he failed to find a bed for his father, who was Covid positive and critical and being treated at Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, in another private hospital for treatment. Police said Jain, an engineer based in Gurugram, came to Jaipur ahead of the lockdown. He contracted the infection in the last week of April and tested negative on May 2. However, during his home quarantine, his father, who has multiple comorbidities, contracted the infection. “His father’s condition started to deteriorate last week and he was shifted to ICU. Reportedly, he was not happy with the treatment and was looking for a bed in another private hospital. He was under stress since his father's condition was going from bad to worse and he was not able to find a better hospital,” police said. In the last few days, he called up friends for help but couldn’t find a hospital. Earlier on Monday, he told his mother he was going out to buy medicines but instead went to the top floor of his apartment and jumped. “The neighbours rushed him to a nearby hospital but he was declared brought dead,” police said. His mother and wife, who doesn’t live with him, were informed about the incident and the body sent for post-mortem. “The incident has been recorded on the CCTV camera. We are collecting all evidence to determine the cause of death,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-free-city-youth-fails-to-find-hosp-for-father-kills-self/articleshow/82720637.cms||---
---||Delhi||Fixing MRP on O2 machines may be counter-productive: Centre to Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday told Delhi high court that fixing the MRP of oxygen concentrators during a global shortage would be “counter-productive” as manufacturers would “walk away” if there was a cap fixed to their product. It said the prices had gone through the roof across the world and the focus of the government was to ensure there was no shortage of the product and supplies were not disrupted. The Centre said that there were different concentrators in the market with different prices, sizes and names. It further said that the government was monitoring any move to increase the prices above 10% of the MRP from last year. The court, however, pointed out that its earlier order was not to fix a price, but to have a formula to determine the MRP of oxygen concentrators. “We are not asking the government to fix a price in rupee or paisa, but to fix a principle on which oxygen concentrators will be charged. If this is not an extraordinary circumstance where it should intervene, then what will be?” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed. The court countered the Centre’s stand and underlined that “there has to be some limit to it. It cannot be limitless. Tomorrow, some Chinese manufacturer will say he will sell it at 5x rate... it cannot be allowed (sic)”. It said the government has a responsibility towards the people/patients so that they were actually able to afford the product. “They can’t be taken for a ride. Shortage of a product cannot be taken advantage of. Should you not think of the consumer?” the court asked. In a related development, several Delhi hospitals, which had moved the court last month with hours of medical oxygen left, withdrew their petitions as the supplies have now stabilised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fixing-mrp-on-o2-machines-may-be-counter-productive-centre/articleshow/82722992.cms||Abhinav Garg

We provide treatment to all. Patients from Haryana trusts us. Also, patients from UP, MP, Punjab, Gujarat get continuous treatment here, whether they are suffering from Covid or non-Covid diseases. We have good schemes such as free medicine, free diagnostics and now we have one of the best Covid treatment protocol,” health minister Raghu Sharma said. The state is battling against Covid and its hospitals are almost full, especially in Jaipur and Jodhpur. But, in the last two to three days, the state witnessed significant reduction in active cases due to sharp increase in recovered cases. In just two days, 53,899 persons defeated Covid in the state, which has brought down the number of active cases further to 1,76,363. However, the state is continuously reporting deaths above 150. As many as 157 persons lost their lives to Covid-19 taking the state’s toll to 6,934. “More than 150 deaths are being reported daily, which is a concern for us. It could be due to late detection of cases. Now, we are strengthening measures for early detection by introducing antigen test, which gives immediate result. Early detection will ensure timely treatment in rural areas and it will help us bringing down number of deaths,” said Sharma. It is for the third consecutive day when state reported a decline in active cases. Active cases dipped by 18,019 on Monday. On Sunday, it had reduced by 14,306 and 4,065 on Saturday.

On Monday, the 18 newly elected MLAs of the party expressed their preference to the Congress central observers at a meeting at TNCC headquarters. Senior Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Puducherry Lok Sabha MP V Vaithilingam and AICC in-charge of TN Dinesh Gundu Rao were at the meeting to elicit the views of the MLAs. Congress leaders including TNCC president K S Alagiri and P Chidambaram among others were present. “The central observers heard the preference of individual MLAs and also took it in writing. Kharge has left for Kerala, where the party’s newly-elected legislators are meeting on Tuesday to elect a new CLP leader in that state. After it’s completion, Kharge will present the views to the Congress leadership,” a TNCC source said. Party leaders who spoke at the meeting stressed on the need to have a CLP leader, who will be effective in countering the charges levelled by the BJP members on the Congress. Emergence of the NTK as an alternative force was also cited as a reason to have a strong voice in the assembly, sources in the Congress said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sonia-gandhi-may-decide-on-clp-leader/articleshow/82724852.cms||D Govardan
---||Kolkata||Recipients brave travel curbs for jabs; many civic units halt drive||Kolkata: Many people braved travel restrictions to reach vaccination centres for jabs on Monday, the first working day after the restrictions were announced on Saturday. Even as the vaccination process was smooth at the Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) in hospitals, there was trouble at some KMC-run CVCs when large number of recipients, who had queued up since early morning, were told that the vaccination was temporarily suspended at the civic clinics. The decision was taken after the changed guideline increased the time between the two doses of Covishield. There were protests at Garia (Atabagan), Chetla, Behala among others. However, a few centres that had a stock of Covaxin offered the doses. According to a KMC health department official, Covaxin was scheduled to be administered from 16 urban primary health centres but several of them did not function on Monday due to logistical issues. “Due to the restrictions, we have a manpower problem at all our clinics. In addition, there is a problem of miscommunication on the part of the civic administration as well. We did not get any clear message to undertake vaccination,” said a civic health staff. “There were no specific instructions about continuing with the vaccination programme in the wake of a revised guideline from the union health ministry. It was natural for some citizens to become impatient. We hope to resume the vaccination as soon as we get a nod from the headquarters,” said a borough executive health officer. Apart from the civic facilities, in other centres though, vaccination was carried out as usual. On Monday Wooldlnads Hospital inoculated 700 plus recipients who took the Covaxin jab at the hospital as well as its six other CVCs. “All braved the lockdown and managed to reach our CVCs. Many in the 18-44 group said their friends and relatives are unable to book a slot. That is because of the demand supply gap. This too should ease once more private CVCs start vaccinating,” said Woodlands Hospital MD and CEO Rupali Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/recipients-brave-travel-curbs-for-jabs-many-civic-units-halt-drive/articleshow/82720590.cms||Saikat Ray

While one wallows in the luxury of comfortable home surroundings, gone are the energies or dynamics of a physical workspace that I was getting used to ever since we started unlocking last year. A zoom meeting with all its advantages, can actually add to the stress, given erratic net connections to begin with,” rued Ruby Ray, chief marketing office (CMO) of a pan-India livestock company. Yusuf Fakhri, a partner in an architect firm, is supporting employees with rationThe Park Street resident is bracing for low productivity as she and her team are not in a position to supervise the vendors and business partners. “All these would inevitably delay projects. At the vendors’ end, there aren’t enough manpower to complete assignments. This would have major cost implications,” said Ray, who conducts webinars on life-coaching, which includes ways to overcome disadvantages of WFH. “Much as I offer solutions on how to beat lack of motivation, burning out, overlapping of work and life, I am constantly battling against the odds myself,” the mother of 17-year-old Ronit mused. Yusuf Fakhri, architect and partner at Designs, a leading architectural firm, wasn’t looking forward to the work-life balance much, though he felt “the restrictions were needed to arrest the surge in cases”. The sudden announcement made people like him jittery. “From home, we must ensure labourers have enough rations and essential materials. Some of them have left the sites, while others hadn’t returned from the Eid holidays. We are counseling and supporting those who stayed back. It’s not easy doing all of these remotely,” he said. Just when organization heads and team managers were nudging members to rejoin office, the quick transition to WFH hasn’t augured well for many. “It’s difficult coordinating with the workforce from our respective homes. We are also at a disadvantage in terms of customer relations. Not to mention delays that the restrictions would cause in legal clearance of projects,” said Vivek Khemka, director, Keventer Projects Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-covid-restrictions-in-place-managers-and-executives-fret-over-wfh-logistics/articleshow/82720586.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Jaipur||20,000 O2 concentrators in the pipeline as patients gasp for breath||JAIPUR: Covid patients gasping for breath are now getting some relief from oxygen concentrators. Faced with short supply of oxygen from the Centre, the state is strengthening its network of oxygen concentrators from urban to rural areas. Covid care centres such as Jaipur’s Bilwa, ESI Hospital, Institute of Respiratory Diseases and Jaipuria Hospital are using oxygen concentrators in increased numbers. In Jaipur, around 550 beds are using oxygen concentrators, while 3,395 beds get supply from cylinders and central oxygen supply system. The World Health Organisation (WHO), too, donated 100 oxygen concentrators to the state government on Monday. Apart from WHO, various organisations and individuals are coming forward and purchasing oxygen concentrators to help the government. “We are taking all possible measures to deal with the shortage of oxygen. We are getting oxygen concentrators from organisations and individuals, which has come as a great help,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. He said that oxygen concentrators are now being used from urban areas to rural areas for immediate relief to Covid patients gasping for breath. In a bid to save lives of people, the state government is now ensuring availability of oxygen concentrators even in rural areas and planning to install five oxygen concentrators at each primary health centre and 10 at each community health centre. Before the second wave, the state had 1,500 oxygen concentrators. “Now, the number has increased to 6,500. Nearly 20,000 more are in the pipeline,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary, health department. “Oxygen concentrators have advantage that it keeps supplying oxygen to the patients by filtering it from the air,” Mahajan said. Oxygen cylinders have to be refilled, but oxygen concentrators keep supply oxygen by filtering it from the air. Excluding patients with severe symptoms, oxygen concentrators are being used in patients requiring immediate oxygen therapy for saving their lives having mild to moderate symptoms. “Concentrators are available with different capacities. Some produce oxygen from 2-3 litres per minute and others may produce high amount of oxygen per minute. But in severe patients who need high flow nasal cannula, oxygen concentrators cannot be used as in such patients the requirement is 40 to 50 litres per minute,” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, private hospital and nursing home society, who added that seven oxygen concentrators have been donated by a private organisation and three by Dr Vinay Goyal. WHO representative Dr Rakesh Srivastava said 100 oxygen concentrators provided by them to the health department cost Rs 15 crore and they can produce 8 to 10 litres per minute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/20k-o2-concentrators-in-the-pipeline-as-patients-gasp-for-breath/articleshow/82720578.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

After the third phase of polling, the teacher complained of breathlessness. She was then tested positive and was admitted to the district hospital. She however, succumbed to Covid-19, barely three days before her wedding was to be held on April 30. Case 2: A 50-year-old Ram Karan Singh, who participated in the last phase of polling in Shahjahanpur, fell down at the Election Commission’s block office while he went to submit the election bag. He remained unconscious the whole night and was admitted to the district hospital the next day by some villagers. He was sent home and on May 15 he died after developing complications. Lucknow: As the death toll of teachers cross the 1000 mark, the teachers’ unions in UP, including one affiliated to the RSS, are seeking justice for families of teachers who succumbed to Covid-19 while deployed on panchayat poll duty. As per a list of the Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, an RSS affiliate, 1,205 teaching and non-teaching staff of primary schools across UP died due to election duties. While Lakhimpur Kheri saw the death of 56 teachers, tributes were offered to 54 teachers in Rae Bareli. A comparatively small district Lalitpur recorded 42 deaths, the list showed. Demanding compensation and job to dependants, RSM functionaries said over four lakh teachers and employees were roped in for panchayat poll as voting officers. The association urged the government to provide relaxation in rules while doling out jobs to dependents of the deceased. “Our request to the government to vaccinate teachers before deploying them on poll duty went unheard. Be it training or vote-counting exercise, no Covid-19 protocols were followed which took over 1,000 lives,” said Shiv Shankar Singh, RSM’s organisational secretary. He said the dependants who are class 12 pass or below should be accommodated on clerical posts and not as class four employees. State general secretary, RSM, Bhagwati Singh said, “There is no district where teachers have not fallen prey to Covid-19 due to election duty. These teachers didn’t die due to heart attack in a day, but because they were exposed to an unsafe environment.” UP Prathmik Shikshak Sangh too have come out with a list of 1,600 teachers who succumbed to Covid while on poll duty. Union’s state general secretary Sanjay Singh said, “We are sad and shocked by so many casualties. The government’s apathy is adding to the crisis. While the government is getting verification of dead teachers done, officers are changing reasons or are delaying the process. Instead of talking to us, they are doubting the list.” “When bodies are being immersed in water, government wants post-mortem report. Teachers had Covid like symptoms but their report was negative. Later, they developed complications and died. So they are not eligible for compensation. Who will take care of all such families?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-assns-demand-jobs-for-deceaseds-kin/articleshow/82723004.cms||Isha Jain

The board of management of the Homes felt that since the hostel is not in use now, the building can be given to the state health department, which can use it for Covid patients during this pandemic. The offer was accepted by the state health department after it inspected the building. The building was constructed 96 years ago by Scotsman Archibald Birkmyre as his tribute to Daddy Graham and as a “gift to the children of Kalimpong”. Reverend Dr John Anderson Graham, the Scottish missionary to the Darjeeling, remains a legend today, having built the school for orphans who needed love more than education. Among the many admirers he had in his lifetime was Birkmyre, a wealthy businessman, who was also a part of the Viceroy’s legislative council. The present board of management of the Homes, headed by its president Shane Calvert, who is also the former Anglo Indian MLA, made the offer formally to the state health secretary on Saturday, after which inspections were done on Monday and the state health department formally accepted the offer. “Each floor has over 5,000 sq ft of usable area and can be used for setting up Covid beds. We have also offered the portico for use,” said Calvert. Initially, at least 100 Covid beds can be set up in the building. The high ceilings, huge windows and well-ventilated big hall like rooms have been appreciated by the health department officials. The building, however, does not have a lift and hence very serious patients cannot be kept on the top floors. “The space is huge and there is locational advantage in this building. You cannot imagine being offered so much space for setting up a Covid safe home and vaccination centre just off Park Street. The entrances are also huge and there will be no question of crowding too,” said a health official. Calvert is happy that the Homes has been able to make its humble offering as the state grapples with the Corona situation. The state health secretary, Saumitra Mohan, said, “We are working out the details.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/grahams-homes-hostel-off-park-street-to-serve-as-a-safe-home/articleshow/82720622.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Chennai||Chennai: 150 inmates shifted to remand wing, but prison is still packed||CHENNAI: At least 150 prisoners have been shifted from the remand wing at Puzhal to the convicts’ wing as part of a decongestion exercise. The fact that the remand wing accommodated 2,000 prisoners against the capacity of 1,250 was reported in the TOI issue of May 15 (Saturday). With 50 prisoners having been released on bail, the strength in the remand wing is now 1,800, which is still high. More prisoners will be shifted from the more congested blocks in the remand wing to one of the least populated blocks in the section for convicts in a phased manner, said officials. The convicts’ wing, which had 700 inmates against the capacity of 1,250, now has 850 inmates after the latest exercise. Following instructions from director (prisons) Sunil Kumar Singh, ADGP, officials in the prison identified those likely to cause the least trouble to avoid unnecessary problems on the wing for convicts and shifted them. Those selected have been in the remand wing since 2015 and even earlier. At the Puzhal jail, where 250-300 prisoners are shifted every Saturday from sub-jails in and around Chennai and neighbouring districts, admissions have been temporarily stopped, said officials. The director (prisons) has also ordered that ‘Kabasura Kudineer’ and multi-vitamin tablets be given to all inmates with their breakfast, while those who are ill or have symptoms of the infection will get an additional egg, apart from zinc tablets and ‘channa sundal.’ The Central Prison at Puzhal, on the city’s outskirts, is spread over 220 acres and comprises a 100-acre wing for convicts and smaller sections for remand prisoners and women offences. While each of the wings for men can accommodate about 1,250 prisoners, the block for remand prisoners was accommodating about 2,000 as per data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/150-inmates-shifted-to-remand-wing-but-prison-is-still-packed/articleshow/82724878.cms||Selvaraj A
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: As Covid curfew extends, wait for grocery delivery gets longer||BHOPAL: With the state capital under ‘indefinite’ Covid curfew, households are getting flashback of the early lockdown days of 2020. The storeroom of every other household is running out of essential items. A redeeming aspect this year is the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables — which are available despite Covid restrictions. The administration has authorised 54 shops across the localities, that can make home delivery on receiving grocery orders. The system however is not that efficient as there are too few shops for too many people. The shops themselves are running out of stock, as wholesale markets are closed. “I had read about the shops allowed to take orders for home delivery. The shops were named zone-wise, which many people are not aware of. For example, I do not know which shop is authorised to take orders in my locality. It is very confusing,” said Krishnakant Bharadwaj, a resident of Gulmohar. Early risers have an advantage, for they can go and fetch milk and bread and eggs as some grocery shops are open three days of the week — Monday, Wednesday and Friday. However, the shopkeepers say that they are running out of the popular and ‘branded’ products and have to offer off-brand alternatives, which do not have many takers. The wholesale markets from where they replenish their stocks, are closed since April 13. “Wholesale grocery market at Jumerati, Janak Puri and Hanuman Ganj cater to 30000 retail grocery shops in Bhopal and adjoining districts. There are many problems which need to be considered in this system. If the BMC and district administration allows only 54 shops to operate for home delivery, how will they be able to take the pressure of so many customers. We have been requesting the district administration to allow both the wholesale and retail shops to operate from 6.00 am to 9.00 am but they are not responding. We are as concerned over Coronavirus as they are but you can't close everything and wait for the infection rate to come down. As far as we know, the positivity rate has not declined much in Bhopal and even if it has, can the administration give a time frame that we shall control the situation by May and then, there will be no lockdown. They are extending the lockdown for a week every Saturday . And, the day markets open, you will see huge crowds outside shops. Whatever they might have achieved by a month of lockdown, will be undone in two days,” said general secretary of Bhopal Kirana Vyapari Mahasangh, Anupam Agrawal. Some residents have pointed out that vegetables and groceries are not the only essential items amid the pandemic. “I work for an IT company and am working remotely from Bhopal. My laptop needs to be fixed, but there is a part which is not available due to the Covid curfew. The administration should allow one or two shops of every category to open once in a while — which are as important in the WFH era,” said Rahul Karmakar. There have been complaints about e-grocery stores as well. “The slots are always booked. The booking has to be made one week in advance. It is incovenient,” said Prabhat Tripathi, a resident of Shahpura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/as-covid-curfew-extends-wait-for-grocery-delivery-gets-longer/articleshow/82718313.cms||---
---||Chennai||No workers, scarce material: Home delivery to be delayed in Chennai||CHENNAI: The ongoing near total lockdown in Tamil Nadu will delay delivery of apartments to homebuyers in and around Chennai by at least two months, say building industry sources. A large chunk of guest workers and masons from other states and other districts in Tamil Nadu have already left for their hometowns, and movement of construction material from other states too has come to a grinding halt, they say. “Of the three lakh guest workers in the construction sector, 1.5 lakh have left Chennai and suburbs during the past one week. As of now, concrete work alone could be executed, and there is no scope for carpentry and painting, as material is not available,” said S Ramaprabhu, state secretary of Builders Association of India. Constructions are happening only in about 25% of housing projects now, he said, adding that even those construction sites are making do with available stocks. Chennai and its adjacent districts have about 3,375 housing projects comprising units ranging from 8 to multiple blocks under various stages of construction. Stakeholders in the construction sector say the industry is staring at a crisis similar to the one that prevailed during the complete lockdown in 2020. As the TN government’s lockdown protocol permits only insitu construction, material such as brick, cement and msand alone could be sourced locally. Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI) Tamil Nadu chapter president Suresh Krishn said ferrying material, including locks and tiles from northern states and even from the neighbouring Karnataka has been stopped during the complete lockdown. Whilelocks are sourced from Delhi and tiles are procured from Gujarat. “Such factors have affected the scheduled completion dates of housing projects. This will delay handing over of apartments by two months to the homebuyers,” Krishn said. The Chennai Civil Engineers Association president, S Jagadeesan, said adequate manpower was not available in brick industries as well. “It may lead to shortage of construction material that could be sourced locally. Already, the construction sector was facing a situation similar to the complete lockdown last year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-workers-scarce-material-home-delivery-to-be-delayed/articleshow/82724871.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Bank manager, farmer cheated by online fraudsters||BHOPAL: A city-based bank manager was cheated of Rs 20000 by online fraudsters recently. The victim filed a complaint with cyber crime branch, which was forwarded to Jehangirabad police station and a case of fraud was registered on Sunday. According to police Tanmay Verma, 29, a resident of Arera Colony, told police that on December 24, 2019, he posted an advertisement on an online portal to sell his furniture. Few minutes later, he received a call on his mobile phone on which the caller introduced himself as Vikas Patel. He expressed his desire to purchase his furniture and asked details of his online payment wallet. In the name of verification of his online payment wallet account, the fraudster asked him to make a transfer of Rs 5-10 to his account and immediately returned the amount to the victim to gain his trust. As soon as the victim got convinced, the fraudster sent him a reverse request of Rs 20000 on the online payment wallet and asked him to follow his instructions in order to receive the payment. He sent a QR code to Tanmay and as the victim scanned the code in his mobile phone, money was deducted from his account. Meanwhile in another case, online thugs siphoned Rs 41000 from the bank account of a 72-year-old farmer through net banking. Berasia police acting on a complaint filed by victim farmer Ramesh Sharma, a resident of Nichi Laloi in Berasia, registered a fraud case against unidentified accused on Sunday and started the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bank-manager-farmer-cheated-by-online-fraudsters/articleshow/82718315.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Single-day Covid-19 tally below 5,000 again, but 265 more die||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 4,482 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the lowest since April 5 and the second day in a row that the figure remained below the 5,000-mark. The fresh cases were an outcome of 65,004 tests, with a positivity rate of 6.89%. This was lowest since April 7 when it was 6.1% from 90,201 tests. Monday was the first time since April 11 that the positivity rate dipped below 10%. Though the capital has been witnessing a consistent dip in the number of Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate, the death count remains alarming. On Tuesday, 265 people succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 22,111 with a cumulative case fatality rate of 1.58%. May has already recorded 5,964 Covid-19 fatalities, the highest figure recorded in a single month since the outbreak in March last year. With 9,403 patients recovering from Covid-19 on Tuesday, the number of active cases stood at 50,863, compared with 56,049 on Monday. Of these, 31,197 patients are recuperating in home isolation. With more people recovering from the disease every day than the number of new cases being reported, the number of active cases has dipped by 48.9% from the all-time high of 99,725 reported on April 29. The number of patients admitted in hospitals at present is 14,399 and of 24,305 Covid beds, 9,906 beds are vacant, according to Delhi government’s health bulletin. Out of the total 6,257 beds in dedicated Covid care centres, 657 are occupied and 5,600 are vacant, while 478 out of the 606 beds in dedicated Covid health centres are also available. The positive cases on Monday were from a total 65,004 tests carried out in the last 24 hours, including 43,915 RT-PCR tests and 21,089 rapid antigen tests. While the city had been carrying out close to 1 lakh tests a day till recently, the numbers have decreased of late. The Delhi government ascribes the dip to the ongoing lockdown because of which people are not venturing out of their homes. As per Delhi government’s figures, the dip in cases has also meant that the number of patients being discharged from hospitals is increasing every day in proportion to new admissions of Covid-19 cases. The trend was first visible from May 13. On Sunday, the number of new admissions dipped further to 952 and the number of patients who were discharged was 1,079. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP Hospital, Delhi’s largest Covid facility, told TOI on Monday that while the hospital was earlier getting 125 to 150 patients daily, now it doesn’t get more than 30 to 40 patients a day. “The number of patients coming to the hospital has come down as overall the positivity rate has decreased in Delhi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/single-day-tally-below-5k-again-but-265-more-die/articleshow/82753017.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The CM also said that the central government was ensuring free vaccination for those above the age of 45 years while the state government had announced free vaccination for those in the age group of 18 to 44 years. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said that the work of vaccination in rural areas will be rolled out at war footing, as was done for testing. He said that till now, 1.16 crore people had received their first vaccine shot while 31.6 lakh people had received their second. Meanwhile, to acquire more vaccines, the government has made crucial changes to its global tender conditions which will now allow companies like Pfizer and Moderna to also bid. It has halved the global tender earnest money deposit amount from Rs 16 crore and made changes to temperature and storage conditions. From storage at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, the temperature has been reduced to -20 to -80 degrees Celsius.

A total of 6.7 lakh consumers faced power tripping, 4 lakh of whom got their electricity supply restored within a few hours while others continued to face cuts for a longer duration. Power outage also affected 40 Covid hospitals in Thane, Vashi, Pen and Raigad, officials said, adding in 35 hospitals the supply was restored immediately while five others were on generators. At several places, electricity poles were uprooted or tilted while cables were damaged either due to tree fall incidents or winds, officials said. In the island city, there were a total of 60 complaints, said BEST. Across Maharashtra, 23.8 lakh consumers faced power cuts, 13.2 lakh of whom got it back. Of the 210 Covid hospitals, supply was restored at 173 while others were on generators; 138 substations were damaged, of which 78 were fixed. Due to power tripping, scores of residents were left without fans, lights, AC and lifts. Building water pumps stopped working amid the humid weather and heavy rain. In western suburbs, several residents of Yari Road in Andheri West complained of power outage for up to three hours. A resident of Sea Breeze on Yari Road said there was no power since 11.20am and it was not restored till 2.15pm when she spoke to TOI. An Adani Electricity official said the power cut was due to heavy winds affecting the distribution system and “supply was restored with minimum interruption”. Complaints poured in from Goregaon, Santacruz, Andheri, Kurla, Ghatkopar, Dadar and Sion, among other places. Valdhuni, Kalyan, did not have power supply for at least eight hours. Power utility firms were more prepared this time than for Cyclone Nisarga last year. “All the empanelled agencies assigned for breakdown and preventive maintenance were instructed to be ready with the required manpower, material and vehicles. In case of outage, priority was given to restore supply through alternative systems. At the same time, repair work was done on a war footing,” said an MSEDCL spokesperson.

---||Lucknow||Medical infra in Uttar Pradesh is at God’s mercy: Allahabad High Court||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad High Court on Monday said the medical infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh’s villages and towns is ‘Ram Bharose’ (at the mercy of God), while taking serious exception to the disposal of the body of a patient, Santosh Kumar, as unidentified in Meerut district hospital. If this is the state of affairs of a medical college in a city like Meerut, then the healthcare system of the state, particularly in towns and villages can be likened to the famous Hindi saying — Ram Bharose, the court observed, adding it’s a case of ‘high degree carelessness’. “A patient is admitted to the hospital in absolute care of doctors and paramedical staff and if they adopt a casual approach, then it is a case of serious misconduct. They are playing with the lives of innocent people. In these few months, we have realized that the state’s medical infrastructure as it stands today, is very delicate, fragile and debilitated,” the court observed. Hearing a PIL on Covid care, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar directed additional chief secretary (medical and health), Uttar Pradesh to file an affidavit, fixing responsibility in the matter. The court fixed May 22 as the next date of hearing. The court also suggested to the government to take steps to produce vaccines on its own, while observing that “one cannot understand why the government of ours, which is a welfare state is not trying to manufacture vaccines by itself on a large scale”. Criticising the government for its failure to ramp up the medical infrastructure in the state, the court warned, “If we fail to identify a Covid-infected person at the earliest, we are definitely inviting a third wave.” The court suggested that facilities at all hospitals and nursing homes in the state must be improved. “In Uttar Pradesh, apart from Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI) and universities like King George’s Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, there are five other medical colleges, which should be equipped with modern facilities within four months. Emergency laws should be applied for land acquisition to upgrade medical infrastructure. Funds should be provided forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an institute at par with Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute,” the bench said. The court directed the state government to come up with a definitive report by the next hearing on ways to upgrade medical colleges within the deadline. The court then observed, “If we have to test 30% of Bijnor's population in three months, which is around 10 lakhs, we will have to conduct 10,000 tests per day. But going by the DM’s statement, we do not see any robust testing machinery in the near future in Bijnor or five other districts. If this is the state of affairs, one can guess where we are leading people when the third wave of the pandemic strikes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medical-infra-in-up-is-at-gods-mercy-hc/articleshow/82726617.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The whirlwind tour of Covid hotspots by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, immediately after recovering for Corona, has also come as a succour to party MPs and MLAs ranks who have been facing the heat in their respective constituencies in the wake of raging second Covid wave. “The CM who is leading from the front to implement Covid control measures of his government, has to also rise to save the party’s representatives from the people’s displeasure,” says a party insider. Union minister of state for labour and employment Santosh Gangwar recently wrote to CM Yogi complaining about poor Covid care in his parliamentary constituency. Earlier, Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal too had drawn the CM’s attention towards alleged lack of medical oxygen in both government and private hospitals. Likewise, BJP’s Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore had complained about vacant beds in government hospitals even as patients continue to die because of lack of beds and oxygen. Kishore, recently lost his elder brother to Covid. He had also threatened to stage a sit-in, if oxygen is not made available to the ailing—including those who are isolating at home. Before that cabinet minister and Lucknow (Central) MLA Brijesh Pathak; Bhadohi MLA Dinanath Bhaskar and Kanpur MP Satyadev Pachauri too had written such letters to health authorities pointing out how they felt helpless as calls poured in with requests for hospital beds and medical supplies such as oxygen. The BJP, in fact, lost four of its MLAs – Ramesh Diwakar (Auraiyya), Suresh Srivastava (Lucknow west), Kesar Singh (Bareilly) and Dal Bahadur Kori (Rae Bareli) – within a span of 15 days. Besides, two UP ministers -- Chetan Chauhan and Kamal Rani Varun -- succumbed to the virus in the first Covid wave last year. BJP insiders said that the party leadership was not in a position to counter any allegations levelled by any party representative as it would send a wrong signal to their respective constituencies. Sources said that by approaching the party leadership, especially CM Yogi, the MPs and MLAs manage to allay apprehensions of people even as the second wave of Corona posed an enormous challenge before the state government. “The party understands concern of the leaders and is taking appropriate action. We are also in regular touch with party MPs and MLAs who had expressed their discontent over lack of adequate facilities to meet the crisis,” said UP BJP spokesperson, Hero Bajpai, while speaking to TOI. He said the ruling BJP has to meet the crisis faced by over 22 crore people. “People and the political leaders of other parties may point out the loop holes but they should also cooperate in this time of crisis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogis-covid-hotspot-trips-a-succour-to-bjp-mps-mlas/articleshow/82723133.cms||Pankaj Shah

An official from the joint director of health services (JDHS) in Trichy said that there was no communication in this regard from the state health ministry till Monday.A check with some of the private hospitals revealed that they were yet to get the supply of remdesivir. Some of the reputed private hospitals in the district already had tie-ups with the four major manufacturers of the drug and were getting regular supply. However, new private hospitals were left in the lurch as manufacturers have been turning down their requests citing limited production of the drug. Health officials expected that an order in this regard may be sent to the JDHS soon.Chief minister M K Stalin had announced on Sunday that the steps will be taken to make remdesivir available at private hospitals instead of selling them at the special counters of Tami Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC). Unaware of the announcement, many had queued up at the TNMSC counter in Trichy on Monday. City police rushed to the spot and turned them away citing the latest order. The special counter was functioning at the Government Physiotherapy College near KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College from May 8. The centre has been issuing 50 tokens daily and issuing six vials of remdesivir each to the attendants of patients in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pvt-hospitals-yet-to-get-remdesivir/articleshow/82723131.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Delhi||Vaccination for 18-44 years may come to halt from Friday: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: With just enough vaccine doses left to last till Thursday and the central government unable to provide any this month, vaccination of those in the 18-44 age group might come to a halt in Delhi, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Monday. “We have limited vaccine doses for citizens between 18 and 44 years. Vaccines will only last for three more days after today and we may have to shut our centres after if the central government is unable to provide us with adequate doses for this age group,” Sisodia said, addressing a digital press conference. Sisodia said that, in a letter addressed to the Delhi government, the Centre had committed to distribute 3.8 lakh doses for the 45+ age group, but the same provision had not been extended to those in the 18-44 group. He said that the Centre should match the doses for 45+ citizens and distribute 3.8 lakh doses for the 18-44 group too. “I have written a letter to the central government today, requesting their support on three key matters. First, to make vaccine doses available for citizens between 18 and 44 years, just like they have given us doses for citizens above 45 years,” he said, adding that, otherwise, Delhi government would have to shut the centres in four days. He also said that allocation data of vaccines should be made transparent. “At present, the Centre takes the responsibility of allocating 50% of vaccines and passes on the responsibility for the other 50% to state governments. But there is no transparency as to how this happens. The allocation data on how many vaccine doses have been administered to which state and for which age group should be open to the public,” he said. “We also need to know how many vaccine doses are being sent to private and government centres,” he said. Sisodia said that the Centre should inform them about the number of vaccine doses that will be administered to Delhi in June and July, the same way information for May was sent. The deputy CM said that vaccination centres for the 45+ group have been moved from hospitals and dispensaries to Delhi government schools with the introduction of a ‘walk-in’ facility for those above 45 years of age. AAP MLA Atishi said on Monday that walk-in vaccination for the 45+ age group has started in 97 schools, which will help those without any smartphones or technical know-how. Atishi said that there is less than a day's stock of Covaxin left in Delhi for the 45+ age group and the Covishield stock will last another five days. “Hence, we will have no choice but to temporarily shut down as many as 50 vaccination centres administering Covaxin to this segment after tomorrow (Tuesday). In case we don’t receive new stock for Covaxin by the central government, we will have to shut down even more centres,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-for-18-44-yrs-may-come-to-halt-from-friday-sisodia/articleshow/82723154.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He also urged the Centre to prioritise the options for vaccinating children. In response to CM Kejriwal’s tweet, Union minister for civil aviation Hardeep Singh Puri said that international flights have been closed since March 2020 and with Singapore, there is no air bubble as well. An air bubble is a bilateral agreement between two countries with rules in place allowing carriers of the two countries to operate international flights. Puri further tweeted that there are only a few ‘Vande Bharat’ flights through which Indians trapped in the country are brought back. “These are our own people. Still, we are keeping an eye on the situation. All precautions are being taken,” he tweeted. Delhi has been reeling under the second wave of Covid-19 for the past one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/singapore-strain-cm-calls-for-flight-curbs/articleshow/82753136.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Amravati seeing an M-shaped curve: Expert||MUMBAI: The resurgence of Covid cases in Amravati after a steep fall has become the subject of intrigue, with many questioning if the district is witnessing a ‘third wave’. Epidemiologists concur the answer is ‘no’ since a spurt within an ongoing wave largely points to inadequate Covid control measures on the ground. Experts say the mutation could also be playing a role, reports Sumitra DebRoy. The state’s second wave started from this Vidarbha district that began to see a steady spike in mid-January. From less than 500 active cases on January 15, it had 10,205 active cases on Monday, with 1,208 deaths. In between, the figures have seen a swing. Amravati, which had less than 500 active cases on January 15, saw 3,090 cases by February 15—a 518% rise. By the end of February, the district had 6,600 active cases. As lockdown-like measures were introduced on February 22, cases started to climb down. By March 31, the active cases were down to 2,935. Within a month and despite the lockdown-like measures, cases started to rise again in mid-April. On April 15, it had 4,636 active cases, which touched 7,134 by the end of the month. As on Monday, Amravati district had 10,205 active cases and 1,208 deaths. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, medical epidemiologist and health systems expert, called it the ‘M’ shaped curve. “Firstly, till a district’s positivity rate has come below 5%, we cannot say it is out of a wave. And, if a region starts witnessing a rise within an ongoing wave, it means measures on ground are not working,” he said. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid taskforce, said mutations could be driving the high transmission in Amravati. The double mutation— E484Q and L452R, now classified as B 1.617, was detected in samples from Amravati as early as February. B1.617 was recently categorised as a variant of concern by the WHO. “Sub-lineages of the variant, B1.617.2, are also seen in Amravati samples,” he added. A closer look at the transmission trend within the district shows Amravati Municipal Corporation was driving the January spurt, while the rest of the district, including its semi-urban and rural areas, pushed up the April numbers. On February 28, for instance, the corporation area had reported 632 new cases while the rest of the district had recorded 230 cases. The trend has completely reversed now. On May 15, for example, the corporation saw 219 detections, but the rest of the district contributed to 736 cases. State’s surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate called it a classic behaviour of the virus and not a third wave. While a drift from urban to peri-urban and rural is common in other districts too, none of them have registered such a sharp rise after a drop. “When all districts in Maharashtra, including Mumbai and Pune, were seeing a rise, we were seeing a decline. But when everyone is seeing a dip now, we continue to see an increase,” said district civic surgeon Dr Shyamsunder Nikam. Within Amravati, Warud and other commercial towns like Achalpur and Morshi are contributing to most cases. District health officer Dr Dilip Ranmale said there is intermingling of people in these areas plus an influx from cities of Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-mutations-inadequate-measures-may-be-driving-amravati-spike/articleshow/82723181.cms||Sumitra Debroy

But while people around them head to the nearby vaccination centre, Sandhiya is adamant about not taking the jab. “I heard that some people fell ill after taking it, so I feel it’s dangerous.

Narhari said that it has been noticed that Covid-19 patients are developing mucormycosis (black fungus) infection following Covid-19 treatment. It has led to an increase in the demand of Amphotericin-B injection used for its treatment. Amphotericin-B is a medicine used only on extremely serious patients and therefore it’s imperative that it is only sold to persons who have been prescribed this injection. The injection is supplied to C & F or stockists of the manufacturing company for sale. In order to ensure its availability for patients who need it and check its hoarding and black marketing, the C & F of the company would supply the injections to the stockist or a hospital or nursing home on the basis of prescription of a registered medical practitioner. While hospitals and nursing homes should follow guidelines/protocols issued by the health department for use of the injection, the stockist would sell/supply the injections to the wholesalers proportionately, who will only provide the injection to hospitals/ nursing homes, where treatment of black fungus is possible, on the basis of number of black fungus patients admitted there for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fresh-sops-to-check-illegal-sale-of-black-fungus-injections/articleshow/82718381.cms||---

On Monday afternoon, the department took stock of the situation and marked the location of each lion in the region. Later in the evening, the forest staff were told to move to safer places in view of the impending storm. Of the 674 lions in the Saurashtra belt, 350 are in the coastal area, Amreli and Bhavnagar. The remaining are in the sanctuary area. “There are around 40 lions in some patches in coastal Saurashtra, and we are keeping a watch on them. Some lions have already moved to higher grounds. We are keeping our fingers crossed, and praying that the lions will be safe,” said Shyamal Tikadar, principal chief conservator of forests in Gujarat. He said once the cyclone crosses the region, the staff will once again take account of the lions. In June 2015 flash floods following unprecedented heavy rain, at least 14 Asiatic lions lost their lives and 20-odd had gone missing. The missing lions were later found from hillocks and other areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/praying-for-lions-safety-forest-officials/articleshow/82720871.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Vulnerable’ PGI docs resist active pandemic duty||Lucknow: Despite Covid-19 protocol and various orders related to coronavirus pandemic putting people over 60 years of age in vulnerable category, the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) has decided to deploy its seniormost faculty members on active Covid-19 duty. Worried over the implications, the faculty members and their families have raised their concerns with the institute and the medical education department. The order is likely to affect at least a dozen senior teachers, some of whom have survived Covid-19 infection. The list includes Prof Anil Agarwal (anaesthesiology), Prof PK Goel (cardiology), Prof Kumudini Sharma (opthalamology), Prof Anees Srivastava (urology), and Dr Sunil Pradhan (neurology), among others. “We have simply informed the authorities about our situation. We have also told the minister and officials that we are willing to contribute through passive roles on supervisory side but an active duty is a direct threat to our health. Various advisories from the Union ministries of health and social justice have recognised that people over 60 years of age are at greater risk of infection and its complications,” a faculty member said. Sources said the decision is actually an outcome of the demand by a section of teachers (under 60 years) that every faculty member should be put on active Covid-19 duty by roaster. “Being in majority, the under-60 group has earned the support of teachers’ body – the SGPGI Faculty Forum,” a senior teacher said. The office staff confided that the problem is persisting on account of an ambiguity in the official order on deployment of medical teachers for Covid-19 duty. Issued by principal secretary, medical education, Alok Kumar II, on May 12, the point number four of the order says that “faculty members of the rank of professor, additional professor, and associate professor up to the age of 60 years must be deployed on active Covid-19 duty”. “Now, the two groups are interpreting the order as per their convenience. While the 60-plus teachers say that the order does not speak for deployment, the other maintains that it doesn’t suggest that the 60-plus cannot be deployed,” an insider revealed. Director, SGPGI, Prof RK Dhiman said: “The matter has come to my notice today. An amicable solution will be worked out at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vulnerable-pgi-docs-resist-active-pandemic-duty/articleshow/82723187.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The zones also have 82% of the total active containment zones.In the past two days, K Abishekapuram and Ponmalai zones alone have reported 404 and 545 fresh cases respectively. The K Abishekapuram zone covering Thillai Nagar, Puthur, Woraiyur and Thennur is dotted with government and private hospitals, and had remained a hotspot during the first wave too due to the floating population to the hospitals. However, in the past two weeks, the Ponmalai zone that mostly has residential settlements has surpassed the rest of the three zones in fresh cases. While corporation was considering Ariyamangalam and Srirangam as hotspots owing to the presence of congested residential streets and vegetable markets, the Ponmalai zone that covers KK Nagar, Subramaniapuram, Ponmalaipatti, parts of Thiruverumbur and Cantonment did not get enough. A source claimed that testing in Ponmalai was not on a par with the other zones. “We are clueless about the spread, even people staying indoors are testing positive. As we have commenced door to door survey, we are expecting early identification of cases to bring down the spread,” a health official with the Ponmalai zone said. As far as containment zones are concerned, K Abishekapuram has 30 active zones followed by Ponmalai with seven. Ariyamangalam and Srirangam have four active containment zones each. Containment zones are being established if three or more positive cases are reported in the same street. “We have planned to conduct fever camps and random RTPCR testing in Ponmalai and K Abishekapuram zones extensively to curtail the infection,” corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said. Similarly, mobile medical units are to be mobilised in the two zones for covering the commercial streets and hospital localities in random samplings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-zones-account-for-68-new-covid-19-cases-in-trichy-city/articleshow/82723170.cms||Deepak Karthik

Meanwhile, a section of vendors refrained from establishing their stalls in the temporary market. A corporation official said that the crowd was high as it was the first day. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/temporary-veggie-mkt-fails-to-curtail-rush-in-trichy/articleshow/82723190.cms||---

Of special significance was the ‘koorma’ shila (stone), where the idol of Ram Lalla would be installed once temple construction is over.RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi, temple Trust general secretary Champat Rai, Nirmohi Akhara mahant Dinendra Das, Trustee Dr Anil Mishra, VHP leader Rajendra Singh Pankaj and officials of Larsen & Toubro, Tata Consulting Engineers and Balaji Tucson were present. Digging and excavation is continuing for creating a 40-foot deep foundation, which will be 400 feet long and 300 feet wide. This will be filled with 44 layers of engineered film material to provide hydrolytic stability, toughness. Talking to TOI, member of Ram Temple Trust, Dr Anil Mishra, said, “Two layers of 300mm engineered film have been laid. Construction has picked pace and all foundation layers would be placed before the monsoon.” Special prayers accompanied by Vedic chants began at Ramjanmabhoomi early Monday before installation of the nine shilas. At 9.15am, all the shilas — Nanda, Ajita, Aparajita, Bhadra, Rikta, Jaya, Shukla, Poorna and Saubhagyani were installed.

---||Kochi||Kochi may witness more dengue cases this year||KOCHI: Kochi, which tops the cities in the state in number of Covid-19 cases, may be hit by dengue as well. Unavailability of health workers to be deployed for dengue control activities coupled with many other factors have seen that the number of cases is increasing in the city even in January-April period when very few cases get reported normally. The health department has started measures to avoid spread of communicable diseases, especially dengue. “As the healthcare workers are being deployed for Covid control activities, there is a shortage in the field staff who can be used for dengue prevention works. So, the residents themselves should engage in vector control activities,” said district medical officer Dr N K Kuttappan. Ponnurunni, Chalikkavattom, Thammanam, Kaloor South and Kadavanthara are the areas where vector density is very high in the city. In all these areas, the mosquito density is more than 10 which is critical level. Of the total 193 dengue cases confirmed in the district so far this year, more than 100 cases are from Kochi corporation limits. “Normally, there would be very few cases of dengue and other vector-borne diseases in January, February and March. But this time several cases have been reported from Kochi during the period,” said senior biologist (Ernakulam) Abdul Jabbar. “It is the money plant which is the common source of vectors. After the lockdown in 2020, most of the city residents made it a habit to grow money plants. During January-March period, it is very dry climate and there would be no sources outside the houses where the vectors grow,” Jabbar said. “But the money plants kept inside houses is a breeding ground of mosquitoes. We could see vectors in the money plants kept in the drawing rooms and even bedrooms of many houses in the city,” he said. The lockdown has stopped all the activities in shops and commercial units. This will aid the breeding of mosquitoes in such places. Once monsoon sets in, the sources of vector outside the houses would be filled with rainwater and will help breeding of mosquitoes. This will lead to rise in vector-borne diseases like dengue in the next few months. Now, cases of other communicable diseases like malaria and H1N1 are very few. “As people started to use face masks widely, H1N1 cases have dropped significantly. Only five malaria cases have been reported in Ernakulam district so far this year. The malaria cases were reported among guest workers and those who came back to the district from other states only,” officials with the health department said. Another concern is the chances of outbreak of waterborne diseases like leptospirosis and diarrhoea in flood-hit areas like Chellanam. So, the authorities have decided to take urgent measures to contain the spread of such diseases in those areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-may-witness-more-dengue-cases-this-year/articleshow/82718464.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The commissioner has suggested that welfare offices under the department of social welfare be used for providing vaccination. On May 10, TOI had reported about disabled activists asking the government to make some arrangements. They had suggested options like at-home vaccination, holding camps at old age homes, and creation of separate facilities for such people. The letter sent by the commissioner stated, “In the light of ongoing pandemic and increasing cases of Covid-19 in Delhi, it has come to notice that people with disabilities are facing problems getting vaccination. Section 25 (1) (C) of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act 2016 also mandates priority in attendance and treatment.” The commission said, there are approximately one lakh people with disabilities registered for disability pension and over 2.3 lakh PWDs residing in Delhi as per Census 2011. “It is observed that many homes/schools/district social welfare offices are available with the department of social welfare, which may be utilised for the purpose of vaccination of the PWD,” the letter added. According to Mukherjee, some NGOs have also offered to provide their facility for the vaccination purpose. He requested that separate inoculation centres be provided in each district for the convenience of people with disabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/prioritise-vax-for-disabled-plea-to-govt/articleshow/82753184.cms||Shradha Chettri

The district has increased its oxygen manufacturing capacity by almost 40% in the last one year and is now producing around 650 tonnes of medical oxygen every day. While the district needs only around 30 tonnes of medical oxygen per day, Raigad is helping Mumbai and other cities in MMR and even districts like Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Beed, Jalna, Kolhapur and districts in Marathwada region meet their medical oxygen demand. Mumbai needs around 240 tonnes of oxygen a day. Around 180 tonnes is used from oxygen tanks installed at major hospitals. The remaining 60 tonnes is supplied through jumbo and dura cylinders that come from Raigad. “At the start of the first wave, Raigad had a capacity to manufacture around 400 tonnes of medical oxygen. This has been augmented to 650 tonnes per day. Raigad’s demand is around 30 tonnes and we are sending the rest to other districts, including the MMR. We were not complacent after the first wave and carried on with capacity enhancement measures. There has been a 40% increase in production,” said Nidhi Choudhary, Raigad Collector. According to Choudhary, not only was the capacity of existing medical oxygen plants ramped up, but they also fast-tracked the conversion of industrial oxygen into medical oxygen. Within Raigad district, Pen, Dolvi, Mangaon and Taloja are the main oxygen manufacturing areas. Oxygen manufacturer INOX Air is located in Dolvi. “Apart from adding capacities in existing plants and getting steel units like JSW in Dolvi to make medical oxygen, we have set up a pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plant at the district hospital in Alibaug which produces six tonnes of medical oxygen per day. We are adding four more PSA plants at our sub-district hospitals too,” Choudhary said. “We have also added seven tonnes a day from the Tata Steel plant at Khopoli. The FDA and transport department helped fast-track approvals and make the supply chain smoother. We will look to increase capacity further so that the rest of the state can breathe easy,” Choudhary said.

Currently, there are three mobile units operated by the corporation and patients in the city are making better use of it. There would be two nursing staff and medicines required for patients in each unit. “Earlier, we had started two mobile medical units. On Monday, we launched a third unit,” said mayor M Anil Kumar. “Hospitals in the city and surrounding areas are filled with patients. Interestingly, many of them wouldn’t need hospitalization if we provide timely consultation and medicines. In case of another group, panic forces them to seek hospital admission. All these issues can be addressed by launching more mobile medical units,” he said. The corporation authorities have already arranged eight ambulances required for operating mobile medical units.  “K J Maxi MLA, cooperative banks in Edappally and Palluruthy and certain other agencies have promised to supply ambulances required for starting more mobile medical units. Unavailability of nursing staff is the only hurdle in starting new units,” Kumar said. “The district administration is planning for a mega recruitment drive. Then, we may get more nursing staff,” he said. A private shipping company has procured 22 helmet non-invasive ventilators (NIVs), a portable ventilator unit, and handed it over to the corporation. This will come handy for the local body in providing immediate ventilator facility to patients without hospital admission. This will also help enhance the treatment facilities in the city in a big way by avoiding hospitalization, added the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-care-corp-plans-to-have-more-mobile-units/articleshow/82718568.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Dr Reddy’s mulls seeking trial waiver for Sputnik Light||HYDERABAD: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is mulling approaching drug regulatory authorities to seek waiver for separate clinical trials of Sputnik Light, the single-dose version of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V recently approved in Russia. Russian Direct Investment Fund’s (RDIF) Indian partner is also exploring the possibility of seeking a waiver of the requirement for each local Sputnik V manufacturer to conduct separate clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals as part of the process of speeding up the deployment of locally made doses, a top Dr Reddy’s Laboratories official said on Monday. Hetero Group, which has been roped in for manufacturing over 100 million doses, has already got regulatory approval for conducting Phase III clinical trials of the locally made Sputnik V on around 300 volunteers to test if it is at par with the imported vaccine. “…we are working with the Indian regulator to understand what is the optimal way to do this. This being a technology transfer, not a redevelopment, there is a possibility to be able to avoid it (separate trial)…it is not clear as of now so we will…work with the regulator to bring some guidance on how to do this,” said Dr Sauri Gudlavalleti, head of R&D and IPDO, Dr Reddy’s. On Sputnik Light, he said: “We are collecting all the data and evidence that formed the basis for Sputnik Light to be approved in Russia. Once we have the data and are in a position to submit it, which I expect will happen in the next few weeks,… we will submit that and seek feedback from the regulator…we will have to work with the regulator to see if the evidence is adequate to waive the trial...,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-mulls-seeking-trial-waiver-for-sputnik-light/articleshow/82720899.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Nathsagar, the dam reservoir, currently has record 33 TMC live storage — more than the double of average stock for the last five years. A total of 11 major dams and other key irrigation projects from Marathwada also hold satisfactory storage, assuring no dearth of water for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes in near future. Jaisingh Hire, assistant engineer with Command Area Development Authority (CADA), said the protracted rainy season last year minimized the need of water release for rabi season, leading to better storage in Jayakwadi major irrigation project. “Still, we carried out three rotations of water release for rabi crops for the benefit of tail-end of the command area. Further, four more rotations for hot-weather season of crops (March-June) were planned and the release is still on. Despite all the release of water for irrigation purposes and also considering the reservations for drinking needs and industrial use, Nathsagar will carry over 22% live storage even if no rainfall is received in the first month of the rainy season,” he said. Hire said instructions have been issued to operate the flood control rooms of Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) round-the-clock in Aurangabad, Nanded and Nashik. Marathwada has highest number of 75 medium dams in Maharashtra. The water level in these reservoirs was 29 per cent on Monday as compared to 19% during the corresponding period last year and 2% in 2019. The region also has 753 small dams — highest in the state. The cumulative water stock in these dams stands at 17% as against 12% in 2020 and 2% in 2019, as per official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jayakwadi-to-have-22-stock-even-without-rainfall-till-june/articleshow/82716647.cms||Prasad Joshi

Fourteen ports were asked to stop their operations by the Gujarat Maritime Board as it was reported that Tauktae was likely to make landfall in Saurashtra region. All mother vessels, each having the capacity to carry thousands of containers, were asked to leave the main ports of call by 10am on Monday, said an official at the GMB, the state’s maritime regulator. All units in the Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ) on Monday were directed to remain closed from 6pm till 6pm on May 18. The directive came from the Kandla SEZ Authority (KASEZA). “In case the units are involved in the continuous process or manufacture of essential items as defined in the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs, the same shall be allowed to function with bare minimum staff,” the authority said. The units were also advised to keep an action plan ready for addressing any emergency situation and at the same time taking care of Covid protocols. Meanwhile, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) stated that it has initiated all actions in line with the disaster management plan and standard operating procedures at its port facilities in Hazira, Dahej, Mundra and Tuna in Gujarat and in Dighi in Maharashtra. “We have simultaneously stocked medicines, dry rations and kept communication lines clear and prepared for power disruptions,” said an APSEZ spokesperson. As for the ships at the ports of Gujarat, an official said: “On Sunday, 46 of these ships were anchored at private ports and 56 at Gujarat Maritime Board operated ports.” The official added: “On Monday morning, they had all left for the high seas.” Once at the high seas, where the cyclone is not predicted to hit, the vessels are safe and will wait till the storm has subsided, the official said. The ports that have halted operations include Pipavav, Jafrabad, Navlakhi, Sikka, Okha, Porbandar, Veraval, Bhavnagar, Alang, Dahej, Rozi, Magdalla, and Mundra. Six sailing vessels at Old Mundra have been kept in the shelter. Corporate and industrial houses in Gujarat are taking various precautionary measures too. “The SOPs are all-encompassing covering people safety, vessel safety, equipment safety, backup yard safety, vehicle and railway safety,” the APSEZ said in its media statement. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd, is at Moti Khavdi near Jamnagar, where the company runs the world’s largest refinery project with a huge petrochemicals project. RIL’s Jamnagar refinery is likely to witness heavy wind and rains. “The complex has been designed to sustain 180 kmph wind velocity, which is much higher than the anticipated cyclone wind velocity,” according to a company statement. “But precautionary measures are being taken to ensure that the supply of oxygen to various states continues uninterrupted.” RIL has ramped up oxygen manufacturing capacity at Jamnagar to become India’s largest producer of medical-grade liquid oxygen from a single location. “RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani continues to be in Jamnagar overseeing the supply of oxygen,” the statement said. Saurashtra region houses a large number of industrial units. They include Ambuja Cements, Nirma, Tata Chemicals, Aditya Birla Group’s Indian Rayon, and the refinery complex of the Russian oil giant Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy. “We are prepared with all the necessary precautions to tackle any eventuality,” a spokesperson of Essar Ports said. “We are working in close coordination with the local administration. We have moved all our floating crafts to inner anchorage.

Residents of 40 villages in the coastal area in Surat district were alerted by the district administration.  Teams of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) visited residences in Dumas, Bhimpore and Sultanabad villages to create awareness among the locals. Those living in weak structures like mud houses were shifted to government school buildings in these villages. “Apart from coastal areas, our teams surveyed weak structures and residents were shifted to safer locations in Udhna and Vadod area. Some structures in these areas can suffer damage in cyclonic conditions,” said Bachhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner.  Till Monday evening, incidents of uprooting of five trees in Pandesara, Rander, Haripura and Nanpura were reported. No one suffered injury in these incidents, according to fire officials.

---||Lucknow||Covid under control now, positivity rate 3.5%: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Describing the Covid situation in the state as 'under control”, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday claimed a sharp dip in the positivity rate from 16.5% to 3.5% within a span of few days. The CM, who was on a tour of Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar, said as compared to the first wave, the second Covid run witnessed a sudden surge in demand for oxygen and medicines like Remdesivir and mischievous elements triggered panic among people. “Aapda ke samay dhairya humara sabse bada mitra hota hai (Patience is our greatest friend in time of crisis). However, some people purposefully tried to spread an environment of fear, when they should have focussed on boosting the morale of people. This resulted in panic and people scrambled to get oxygen and Remdesivir leading to disorder in the state. Thankfully, the situation has been brought under control,” the CM said, after visiting the integrated command and control centres in both districts and holding meetings with senior officials. Attributing the sharp decline in active cases by 1.61 lakh in 16 days to the state’s test, trace and treat policy, the CM said, his government pursued aggressive strategies to control spread of the virus. This was also visible in rural areas, where experts were apprehensive of an explosion in cases. “From May 5, monitoring committees have been going house to house, identifying people displaying Covid symptoms, isolating them, getting them tested and treated,” he said. The CM said, in the first wave, the state managed with around 300 tons of oxygen, but in the second wave, more than 1,000 tons was required which the Centre helped supplement through Oxygen Express trains and Air Force. Besides, the state government decided to set up oxygen plants in each district. Saharanpur would be getting 11 new oxygen plants while Muzaffarnagar, which already had four, will be getting six more. Asking people to strictly adhere to the Corona curfew, the CM said this was not a lockdown as the government had ensured people’s livelihoods would not be hit. “Essential services, sugar mills and industries are continuing to function. Crowd control was important, but we also wanted to ensure people were not troubled,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-under-control-now-positivity-rate-3-5-yogi/articleshow/82723288.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Delhi: Expanding eligibility makes 2nd dose of Covaxin a mirage for 45+||NEW DELHI: From finding no slots available to technical issues like incorrect date of the first vaccine dose, many people aged 45 years and above are finding it tough to get an appointment for a Covaxin shot even as the central government has extended the dosing interval for Covishield to 16 weeks. There is a sense of panic that the inability to get the second dose of Covaxin will render the first useless. While the dosing gap between the first and second shots for Covishield has been lengthened to 12-16 weeks, the interval for Covaxin remains 28-42 days. Several people TOI spoke to confirmed failure to get a slot for the second dose of Covaxin. The government should have prioritised them and let them receive the second mandatory jab, they felt. “It’s a helpless situation. We can’t keep going to the vaccination centres and returning without the injection, especially the elderly. The city has more centres for Covishield than for Covaxin. We were due today for the second dose but didn’t get any slots,” grumbled a woman. Dwarka resident Shivani Bhattacharya went to the Co-Win website to reserve a slot, but couldn’t for two days in a row She told TOI, “I, my husband and my 77-year-old father are due for my second dose on May 26. Two days on Co-Win did not help. We even asked the hospital where we got vaccinated the first time, it doesn’t have the vaccines. Before the government allowed people in the 18-44 age group to get vaccinated, it should have at least given some priority for second jabs to first-dose recipients of Covaxin aged above 45 years. It would have been smoother for earlier approved groups to have got both doses before opening up the vaccination for younger people.” Anasuya Gupta, who has been struggling to reserve a slot for her husband and domestic help, felt a drive-in inoculation facility for the elderly was a must. “Older people have problems like comorbidities, constant need of oxygen and toilet needs,” she said. “A drive-in facility is necessary for such people and even for 45+ people with health problems. And then the availability of Covaxin is also a problem. In Gurgaon, there are only four government vaccination centres earmarked for Covaxin against 12 for Covishield. If the elderly and 45+ population was prioritised for the first dose, their second dose should also have been a priority.” Unlike Gupta and Bhattacharya, Subhash (name changed) managed to get a slot in Delhi but wasn’t sure if Covaxin was available. “I will check with a friend first who is scheduled to get vaccinated a day before me. The government has been saying the stock is exhausted, so I am not very confident of getting my second shot,” he said. From wrong information on the first dose on Co-Win, the hassle of reregistering for the second is also irritating people. “The smoothest way would have been for the website to automatically schedule the second dose according to the date and place of the first, leaving any rescheduling or vaccination centre change to the recipient. The 18-44 group can get vaccinated anytime, a week or 10 days later. But those who have to take the second dose of Covaxin can’t wait,” one individual asserted. It is not just people above 45 years who are worried about their second dose of Covaxin. Sunny Sehgal, 34, who must take his second dose in the first week of June is already worried. “Every day we hear that there are no Covaxin stocks and that they won’t be getting more any time soon,” he said. “These are enough reasons to worry as the pandemic is not yet over and we have been warned by experts about a third wave too. There was so much hype created for people to get vaccinated, but if the government was going to struggle with vaccine supplies, then what was the point?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expanding-eligibility-makes-2nd-dose-of-covaxin-a-mirage-for-45/articleshow/82723278.cms||Sakshi Chand

Singh sought a CBI inquiry into the cases registered against him by Maharashtra police and into the offer of “compromise” conveyed to him in a telephonic conversation which he had recorded last month. He sought a stay on his arrest in any of the cases “foisted” on him. The Bombay high court, which had ordered a CBI inquiry into the alleged extortion charges on Singh's petition, was told by the Maharashtra government last week that Singh would not be arrested till May 20 on the SC/ST case brought against him by a policeman for an alleged incident in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/transfer-probe-outside-maha-param-bir-in-sc/articleshow/82726640.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy asked the state government to reach out to the Covid-19 infected people through NGOs. Advocate General BS Prasad said the government has tied up with ISKCON in the GHMC area to help the affected people. The bench expressed dissatisfaction over the silence of the government for reducing the daily Covid-19 tests to 50,000 on most of the days. It took note of the affidavit of the public health director, but questioned his silence on not doing one lakh tests every day and on setting up 14 RT-PCR labs in the state. “He said 300 mobile labs are functioning, but no details are given as to where are they functioning,” the bench said. Accepting a suggestion made by advocate Chinnolla Naresh Kumar, the bench directed the government to take these mobile labs to the villages to collect samples from the people. Additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy said the Centre has increased the supply of oxygen and remdesivir to Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-set-up-more-community-kitchens-for-affected-families/articleshow/82720954.cms||---
---||Delhi||God bless this country, your officers are living in ivory towers: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Centre’s officers are living in “ivory towers” oblivious of ground realities that Covid-19 has not spared a single-family, Delhi High Court said on Tuesday, after getting to know that an Indian firm collaborating with Sputnik vaccine makers of Russia is being starved of funds by the Centre. “Which bureaucrat is giving you instructions? Is he not alive to the situation? God bless this country. That is why we are facing this situation. In such matters instructions are need to be taken from the highest authorities, that, too, within 30 minutes,” the court said, highlighting that such partnership attempts with foreign vaccine manufacturers are an opportunity to the nation facing shortage of vaccines. “Tell your officers it is an opportunity for you, don’t lose it. The virus has not spared any single family. Your officers are living in ivory towers,” a bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla remarked. “Does your officer not see so many deaths are taking place in the country and we are short of vaccines? You are so short of vaccines and you are not taking it through. Maybe it is an opportunity for you. Don’t be so negative. It is like a raging fire and nobody is bothered. You people don’t understand the larger picture or what,” the court fumed. “No one is applying its mind” when there is an opportunity for the government to get millions of vaccines, the bench said. “Otherwise, deaths will continue to happen. Every day you are castigated by each and every court and still you are not awake.” The high court was hearing a plea of Delhi-based Panacea Biotec seeking release of money as per a July 2020 arbitral award saying it needed funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on. “The collaboration of applicant with RDIF gives India an opportunity to ensure that the vaccine manufactured by the applicant is used for sale in India,” the court noted while asking the Centre to file a reply in a week. According to the plea, “If the awarded amount is not released… the whole process of manufacture of vaccine at the fastest pace may get derailed and delayed, which will not be in the larger interest of humanity.” The Centre opposed the plea, arguing that the manufacturing won’t benefit the country as it would be for global supply by RDIF and its Indian partner. The government claimed the vaccines were to be sold outside India. In response, the company pointed out that no manufactured vaccine could be exported without the government’s consent and these vaccines were meant for Indian use. The bench said the company was willing to deposit 20% of the sale proceeds in the court, so it should be taken as an opportunity to get more vaccines. Panacea Biotec argued that Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech were also exporting Covid-19 vaccines to various countries. “Unless timely steps for manufacture of Covid-19 vaccine are taken, the death toll can go up to astronomical figures,” it said while maintaining that 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V would be manufactured for the global market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-god-bless-this-country-your-officers-are-living-in-ivory-towers/articleshow/82753253.cms||---

The state government has decided to hold discussion with the Centre with a demand of slashing the prices. In the meantime, we are thinking to offer subsidy at the level of the state government,” he said. Currently, only the Centre is offering fertilizer subsidy to the farmers. Notably, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state agriculture minister Dadaji Buse hit out at the central government over hike in fertilizer prices, but did not announce any relief. Meanwhile, farmers’ leader Jayaji Suryawanshi alleged that there is no coordination between the three ruling parties of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi. “While Kharif season is about to begin, there is no consensus among ruling party leaders on how to deal with the issue of rise in fertilizer prices. Ruling party leaders have beeb making different statements and promises with no benefit in sight for the farmers,” he said. Bhuse, however, has sent a letter to the Centre highlighting the fact that it will be difficult for the farmers to buy fertilizers due to repeated natural calamities along with the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19 for more than one year. Meanwhile, Aurangabad district is likely to have cultivation of Kharif crops on over 6.81 lakh hectare for the upcoming season. “The district is slated to have rise in cultivation of tur and soybean with regular sowing of maize and cotton among other crops”, an official release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-mulling-over-giving-fertilizer-subsidy-desai/articleshow/82716670.cms||Prasad Joshi

Delhi Police registered multiple FIRs and arrested 24 people for allegedly pasting posters critical of the Prime Minister in connection with the vaccination drive against Covid-19. The posters reading “Modiji humare bachon ki vaccine videsh kyu bhej diya (Modiji why did you send vaccines of our children to foreign countries?)” were pasted in several parts of the city. Police sprung into action and recovered more than 800 posters and banners across Delhi and lodged FIRs. Challenging the police action, lawyer-petitioner Pradeep Kumar Yadav contended that people were arrested in violation of even the Supreme Court order and pleaded the court to intervene to protect the citizens’ rights guaranteed by the Constitution. He pleaded the court to stay all FIRs and release all those who were arrested by police including a 19-year-old school dropout, and a 61-year-old photo frame-maker. "This court in a catena of cases has held that freedom of speech and expression with regard to public cause is a fundamental right of every citizens guaranteed under the Constitution of India. Further this court in Shreya Singhal case while setting aside Sec 66-A of Information Technology Act which constitutes an offence for sharing an information in the social media, has held that information sharing in the social media does not constitute any criminal offence under the IT Act. Recently, this court has passed a specific direction to the respondent state authorities not to register any criminal case over the public seeking medical help in the social media," the petition said. "In contrary to above decision of this court, the authorities are registering FIR against innocent persons over their hate speech against the PM with regard to his official functions over the second wave of Covid-19 crises and government vaccine policies," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pil-in-sc-seeks-quashing-of-firs-lodged-for-criticising-pm-on-vaccine-policies/articleshow/82723358.cms||---

While the stock of Covaxin for this group is already depleted, Covishield is left for only three days. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi on Tuesday said that starting from next week, the centres vaccinating this age group would be temporarily shut down due to the shortage of vaccines. A fresh stock of 60,240 doses of Covaxin was supplied to Delhi by the Centre for 45-59 age group and healthcare/frontline workers, Atishi said, thanking the Centre. The stock of Covaxin for this group is left for only two days and that of Covishield for four days, the MLA added. Around 1,13,142 vaccines were administered on Monday and 67,487 doses out of these were given to 18-44 years old, while 45,655 people over 45 years and healthcare/frontline workers got the shots. In Delhi, more than 36 lakh people have so far been jabbed with the first dose, and 10,77,526 fully vaccinated. Delhi has administered nearly 46,94,970 doses till now. “A meagre population of 7 lakh youths between 18-44 years have been inoculated with the first dose. Hence, it is a humble request to the Centre to supply sufficient vaccines for the segment at the earliest,” Atishi said. To increase the capacity of the vaccination programme extensively, walk-in for those above 45 commenced on Monday in nearly 100 government schools, said Atishi. “We are going to increase the number of such centres located in government schools. This is because a lot of people are not equipped to do the online registration process or don’t have smartphones,” the AAP functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-halt-jabs-for-18-44-yr-group-from-next-week/articleshow/82753289.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On May 11, there were 9,574 new cases were reported and it reduced everyday leading to 5,921 new cases reported on May 17. In the past one week, the number of active cases has also reduced to 88,983 on May 17 from 1,11,366 on May 11. Thus there has been a reduction of around 22383 in number of active cases. On an average, the number of active cases reduced by around 3200 per day in the past 7 days. Apart from these, positivity rate — the number of people found positive out of every 100 tested — has also reduced by 5% from 14.7% on May 11 to 9.1% on May 17. Sources said that on May 11, there were only two districts where there were less than 20 cases were reported in the state but on May 17, there were at least 10 districts where less than 20 new cases were reported in the state. Sources said that the reduction is significant primarily as positivity rate has also reduced and this has come without any reduction in number of tests conducted per day, but still the positivity rate of 9.1% is higher, and it is higher primarily because of few districts like Indore and Bhopal where it is fairly high till now. If the same pattern continues in the state, then it is likely that the overall positivity rate will be below 5% which is considered to be good, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/weekly-covid-cases-in-mp-drop-from-9k-to-less-than-6k/articleshow/82718599.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Ranchi||No free Covid vax for non-Jharkhand residents, orders health dept||RANCHI: Non-Jharkhand residents and those who are not posted in the state but are staying here should not get the Covid-19 vaccine during the free drive to inoculate all adults between 18 and 44 years, a government order has said. In its order issued to all 24 districts late on Sunday night, the state health department said authorities should be vigilant on the identities and addresses of those coming to the vaccination centres. The move came in the wake of reports that people from neighbouring districts of other states have crossed over to get the free vaccine. The Hemant Soren government began the administration of free vaccines from May 14, two weeks after the nationwide rollout, due to lack of doses. Sources in the state government told TOI that there are reports of people from neighbouring states are lining up at vaccination centres in at least two districts to get the doses after registering themselves in the CoWIN app. State nodal officer for vaccination, Dr Ajit Prasad, “We got such reports from Bokaro and West Singhbhum where people from neighbouring states turned up at vaccine centres. Hence, the department has now issued directives to all districts to ensure proper verification before administering the shots.” Notably, people living in the border districts keep shuttling between the states for work and other purposes. In Saranda of West Singhbhum district, the border with Odisha is just a road and the villagers from both sides crossed over from time to time. “The CoWIN app can’t recognize geographical boundaries and hence, even those living in Odisha side can easily register to get the vaccine at centres in Jharkhand,” another official said. Following the order, several districts have issued fresh protocols to plug the loopholes. In East Singhbhum, the district administration has asked all block development officers and vaccine centre officials to verify the background and addresses of beneficiaries before administering the shots. The district's deputy commissioner, Suraj Kumar, said, "Directives have been issued to BDOs of border districts to check the identity cards of the beneficiaries so that anyone from Bengal or Odisha could not get the vaccine." According to health department records, about 1.97 crore people fall in the age group of 18-44 but the state is currently reeling under an immense shortage of doses. Moreover, after the Centre put the onus on the states to arrange vaccines for this age group on their own, officials said it is important to be more vigilant to avoid financial losses and a situation where the state residents could not get the vaccine. State water resources minister Mithlesh Thakur said, "For the state government, vaccinating its people is a priority. Hence, we should ensure that all of them get the free vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-free-cov-vax-for-non-state-residents-orders-health-dept/articleshow/82719397.cms||ASRP Mukesh

According to the government's safety protocols imposed since Sunday, the gathering of five or more persons in public places is banned and it also put a cap on the number of people attending a funeral to 20 and 11 for marriages. All travels are also banned and people going out to buy essential commodities and for emergency purposes must procure e-passes which are valid for three hours from the time of issue. Several Twitterratis and state residents criticised the two ministers for spreading the virus in the name of "public service" and enjoying a "free run" amid the restrictions. They also came down heavily on the police for remaining a mute spectator. Responding to Hasan's tweet, social media user Gulam Rabbani wrote: “This is Jharkhand government’s minister. Expressing condolences and concern for the deceased is welcome, but this way?.” Another social media user, Pankaj Prasoon tweeted, “Why are you standing and crowding the place in such a way? Common people have to get e-pass for even buying vegetables, but ministers are allowed to hold such assemblies.” While Hassan could not be contacted for a comment, Patralekh said the crowd did not listen to his repeated appeals to refrain from attending the funeral. Meanwhile, Irfan Ansari, the Congress MLA from Jamtara, appealed to Soren to immediately roll back the e-pass system saying it created hassles for the common people, especially to those living in the rural areas where internet connectivity is a problem. He, however, skirted from commenting on the two ministers’ conduct. He said, “People in the villages are suffering and with great difficulty, they are trying to get the e-passes. While many don’t have smartphones, while those who have aren’t tech-savvy to generate the passes. Moreover, without cyber cafes and pragya kendras, how will people who don't have smartphones and computers with internet access the portal. The biggest sufferers are vegetable vendors, milkmen, farmers, labourers and daily wagers. They are the ones who are facing the wrath of the police. This rule must be scrapped immediately." He, however, added that the e-pass must be made mandatory for those coming to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ministers-violate-cov-curbs-citizens-blame-police-for-not-taking-action/articleshow/82720495.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||BSF jawan laid to rest with state honours, hundreds attend funeral||DUMKA: Covid-19 safety protocols were violated during the funeral of deceased BSF jawan Manish Jha at his native place in Basukinath in Jarmund block on Monday. Jha’s six-year-old daughter Sneh lit the funeral pyre of his father. Residents said the protocols were “violated” by state agriculture minister and local Congress MLA Badal Patralekh when he attended the funeral along with “hundreds of his supporters”. According to the government's safety protocols, a maximum of 20 people is allowed to take part in a funeral. Moreover, many of those who attended the cremation did not wear masks and no social distancing was maintained. Jha, a 33-year-old BSF constable died of heart attack while on duty at a check post in the Uri sector of Jammu & Kashmir on May 15. He was laid to rest with full state honours and Patralekh briefly carried the coffin. Earlier, Patralekh also accompanied the military team which carried the coffin from Ranchi for handing it over to Jha's family at their house in Jarmundi block. Following the violation of protocols, several Jarmundi residents demanded legal action against the minister for risking the lives of people. Kundan Kumar, a resident of Jarmundi, said, "Isn't the minister supposed to lead by example when the country is fighting the pandemic? Shouldn't he have paid his respects without bringing a huge number of supporters? There are many ways to pay respect to the brave jawan and his family." Patralekh, however, denied that the crowd is his supporters and said he was present behind the gathering of people at the funeral. Talking to TOI, "It is obligatory from my part as a local public representative to pay tribute to the jawan and share the grief of his family members. That is why I took his body to his native place from Ranchi on Sunday night." He also added that the crowd did not listen to his repeated requests not to take part in the funeral. Deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B was among the top administrative and police officials taking part in paying tribute to the deceased jawan at his home. Meanwhile, SP Ambar Lakda said, "I had entrusted one of my subordinates to visit the Jha's home to pay tribute and express condolence to his family. However, no one has reported to me about the violation of protocols." It may be noted that the official figures put about 50 Covid deaths in Dumka but sources said the number could be higher as several patients have died at their homes without the reports reaching the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsf-jawan-laid-to-rest-with-state-honours-hundreds-attend-funeral/articleshow/82719524.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

These steel girders were installed in 1981 and had corroded.“The codal (service) life of the new cement structures will be 75 years and it will have several advantages. There will be zero maintenance and tracks will also be safe, besides complaints from passers-by about droppings from trains will be eliminated,” said the officials.However, sources said, the flip side is that earlier with steel girders, the height from the ground was 1780 mm. This will be reduced by 700mm and hence the RUB will be 3.5 metres and hence only light vehicles will be able to use it. Buses, trucks, mini-trucks and other heavy vehicles will not be able to pass through it.“Taller vehicles will have to pass through Mangalwari ROB till Maha Metro builds its four-layer structure on the lines of Wardha Road. The work is going on in full swing,” said railway officials.About delay in the project completion, officials said, “In March, we had finalized to complete the project, but after Covid-19 struck several officials and employees, the work was postponed. Besides, there was a lot of paperwork involved as designs had to be approved by Visvesvaraya National Institute Of Technology (VNIT) and headquarters. Another major issue was getting blocks from the commissioner of railway safety (CRS). Despite Covid, we took it as a challenge to complete the work by month-end.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gaddigodam-rub-to-open-by-may-end-for-light-vehicles-only/articleshow/82721032.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Ranchi||Petrol dealers urge state govt to lower VAT on fuel||RANCHI: The Jharkhand Petrol Dealers’ Association (JPDA) on Monday wrote to chief minister Hemant Soren, urging him to lower the Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. At present, the Jharkhand government levies a VAT of 22% and a Re 1 cess on a litre. The dealers of the state sell an average of 1.35 lakh kilolitre diesel each month. However, the JPDA claimed that the state’s dealers are missing out on sales of nearly 30,000 kilo litres per month as industrial units are purchasing diesel from West Bengal owing to relatively cheaper prices. “Unlike Jharkhand, West Bengal levies a VAT of 17% and as a result, the state industries are finding it cheaper in the neighbouring state. We urge the government to rationalize VAT in Jharkhand and make it at par with West Bengal. This will help us achieve higher sales from the industries,” the JPDA wrote in its letter. The JPDA argued that though the slashing of VAT will hurt the government’s revenue collection, the latter will eventually stand to gain if the volume of sales goes up. “Currently, the government earns a revenue of Rs 15.49 per litre through VAT and cess. If the rates are at par with West Bengal, the revenue on a litre will be Rs 11.97 crore. However, we project that if the VAT is lowered, sales in the state will increase by 30,000 kilo litre, which will cause additional earnings of Rs 32.3 crore every month,” JPDA claimed. Besides upping the volume of sales, the lowering of VAT will also directly affect the public and contribute to lowering inflation as transportation charge of essential supplies will reduce, the JPDA said. In a separate letter, the JPDA also urged Soren and rural affairs minister Alamgir Alam to set up a special vaccination camp in blocks and rural areas for inoculating the petrol pump employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/petrol-dealers-urge-state-govt-to-lower-vat-on-fuel/articleshow/82719563.cms||---

Dr Pradip Bhattacharya, critical care expert and head of Rims Trauma centre, was among the nine doctors from across the country selected for a video conference with Modi on Covid-19 on Monday evening. Talking to TOI, Bhattacharya said: “The session lasted for more than an hour and I informed the PM about our work as well as difficulties we face. He was receptive of our suggestions and ideas. I spoke for six minutes and, apart from sharing my experiences, informed him about the technical snags in the ventilators.” Bhattacharya added that that soon after the meeting, he received a call from the PMO and was asked to share the details about the ventilators. “During the meeting, the PM had told us that all our suggestions are being noted and they will be addressed immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pmo-swings-into-action-after-rims-doc-raises-ventilator-issue/articleshow/82720440.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM inaugurates hospital, puts stress on curbing Covid spread in rural belt||RANCHI/RAMGARH: In its bid to ramp up detection of Covid-19 infections in rural areas, chief minister Hemant Soren on Monday announced a host of measures and said Anganwadi workers will now be equipped with rapid antigen test (RAT) kits and pulse oximeters to test the villagers. Soren made the announcement while inaugurating an 80-bed Covid hospital in Ramgarh online from his official residence in Ranchi. He further said the government will provide medical kits to patients in rural areas and timber for free to cremate Covid-19 victims. He said, "Anganwadi workers will visit villages of their jurisdiction and conduct antigen tests on the rural populace. We are also setting up Covid-19 care centres in rural areas where positive patients can be isolated and monitored.” Underscoring that his government’s focus has shifted to minimize the pandemic’s spread in the rural areas, Soren said orders have been placed for 45 lakh RAT kits with the Centre to ramp up testing in blocks and panchayat areas. “Lack of awareness is a major challenge in rural areas. To overcome it, all deputy commissioners have been directed to ensure that mukhiyas are vaccinated on priority so that the reservations against the vaccination drive in rural parts can be removed,” he added. In a recent order, the state department of health, medical education and family welfare directed all district administrations to commission PSA oxygen plants at their sadar hospitals. Now, two oxygen equipped ambulances will be deployed in each block to ferry critically ill Covid-19 patients to the nearest hospitals. “Anganwadi sevikas will also be given pulse oximeters to check oxygen levels of the patients. Additionally, have also prepared a plan to distribute five lakh medical kits for Covid-19 patients in the rural areas,” Soren said. Soren also informed Hazaribag MP Jayant Sinha and Mandu MLA J P Patel after inaugurating that free timber will be provided at the burning ghats. He said, "For the convenience of people, we are deputing earth moving machines at graveyards and burial grounds. An order has been issued stating that no one will be charged for conducting the last rites of their deceased.” The hospital, equipped with a central oxygen supply system, was set up by the Tata Steel Foundation in the DAV School building at Ghatotand in Mandu block of Ramgarh district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-inaugurates-hosp-puts-stress-on-curbing-cov-spread-in-rural-belt/articleshow/82720614.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said: “We are yet to receive a treatment protocol from the Union health ministry for black fungus cases. Once we get it, the state government will implement it at the earliest.” TOI spoke to several doctors who are treating patients with black fungus and have operated on a couple to remove their eyes. They said people who have been infected with Covid-19 and have used steroids during treatment need to keep a check for symptoms. ENT specialist and surgeon Dr Abhishek Ramadhin said: “I would suggest everyone to keep a watch on symptoms like severe headache, pain in sinus region and increased blood sugar levels. They should see an ENT specialist after recovering from Covid-19 as these are indications of Mucormycosis. I have been treating around eight patients of black fungus. The problem is that people are realising about the disease very late. The infection spreads very fast from the sinus to the eyes and then to brain.” Dr Anindya Anuradha, consultant ophthalmologist at Shree Bhagwan Mahavir Medica hospital, who had done the first surgery to remove an eye from a black fungus patient, said: “Availability of medication used to treat mucormycosis is key as its prevalence has increased. This is not something we do not know about, but the problem is we aren’t getting medicines required to treat patients. I know three patients from different parts of the state who couldn’t be shifted to Ranchi as they couldn’t be stabilized due to lack of medicines.” Consultant ophthalmologist Dr Malay Verma said: “There are mainly three molecules used to treat mucormycosis patients with and one of them is Amphoterricin B and it should be liposomal as it doesn’t have any adverse effects. I would strongly suggest people to get themselves examined to an ENT doctors soon after they detect symptoms as that is the only way to save the eyes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/recovered-cov-patients-with-steroid-use-at-risk/articleshow/82720567.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Nagpur||Greens question nod for tendu collection in Covid, ban on wildlife tourism||Nagpur: With tendu leaves collection in full swing in Maharashtra, the Centre and state government’s double standards have been exposed. While it has stopped wildlife tourism activity, there is no stopping of tendu collection even though Covid-19 pandemic has spread alarmingly in rural areas now. “When the state is reeling under strict lockdown and Section 144 (no gathering of five or more persons), why are tendu contractors allowed? If tendu collection, where thousands of labourers are involved, is allowed, why not tourism?” ask conservationists. “If tendu collection is allowed, tourism activity should also be allowed. Like tendu, thousands of families are directly and indirectly dependent on tourism. In fact, the chances of damage to wildlife and forest during tendu collection are more than tourism due to anthropogenic pressure. Rural areas have become Covid hotspots now and if tourism is restrained same should be applicable to tendu, till the pandemic is under control,” said wildlife conservationist Kishor Rithe. This year, stakes in tendu are high owing to good rates the produce has fetched. The forest department sold 231 units for Rs53 crore. Last year, the revenue was Rs 26.50 crore from sale of 144 units. There are 2 lakh workers involved. Deepak Singla, district collector Gadchiroli, where tendu collection is a prime activity, said, “Even as section 144 is in force and restrictions have been imposed, on the request from the forest department the state government on April 14 added all operations related to forestry under essential services. Singla added, “Tendu collection is the major livelihood source for people in this tribal district. So, we allowed allied activities related to farming and agriculture. There are no records to show wild animals have been infected with Covid. We have already intensified RT-PCR tests and vaccination and are keeping a watch.” However, conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar said, “Four tendu collectors were mauled by tigers in Gadchiroli and Chandrapur last week. If a Covid-19 positive person is killed, there are chances animal may get infected. The coronavirus is now in the air and in Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, the virus infected 8 lions from humans. Tendu collection should be stopped till the pandemic is under control. While contractors make profits from tendu, compensation for human kills is paid by the forest department.” “Instead of earning revenue, forest department’s priority should be conservation of biodiversity for future ecological security. Once large portion of forest revenue was from cattle grazing but later due to ill-effects on forest regeneration it was restricted and controlled. Tendu collection is hardly 100-year-old business. Considering the effects on regeneration and destruction to wildlife, it should be stopped immediately,” said Bhamburkar. “Tendu leaves collection should not be done from fruit-giving big trees. Plucking directly affects food availability in terms of fruit, which provide energy for survivability of ungulates and their dependent fawns. Tendu tree is a food provider in pinch period,” says wildlife expert Uday Patel. Even Suresh Chopne, president, Green Planet Society, says, “Only those who have negative RT-PCR test report should be allowed to enter the forest for collection of tendu leaves. In rural areas, people are reluctant to go for tests and vaccination.” “If tendu collection is a forestry activity then tourism is also regulated by the forest department. It is done with stringent Covid-19 protocol. Only one month is left before the parks close, so what is the harm in allowing tourism, where limited people enter the park with precautions,” says Nikhil Abhyankar, a wildlife lover. However, NR Praveen, CCF, Chandrapur, says, “Possibility of virus infection cannot be ruled out if there is interface of Covid positive people with wildlife. There have been 12 deaths due to wild animal attacks in the district since January.” Praveen said, “The argument for allowing tendu collection and banning tourism may be true, but the latter is not being allowed due to lockdown which poses travel restrictions. Both are policy decisions taken by the state government, we have no say in it.” “The killer bidi is manufactured from tendu. It is narcotics, so why should government promote such non-conservative human-centric anti-wildlife activity of tendu plucking,” Patel asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-question-nod-for-tendu-collection-in-covid-ban-on-wildlife-tourism/articleshow/82721243.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Chennai||Covid-19: Tamil Nadu’s case tally tops 16 lakh, death toll crosses 18,000||CHENNAI: As Tamil Nadu added 33,075 new cases and 335 deaths, the state crossed two grim milestones. Cumulative case tally since March 2020 crossed 16 lakh and the death toll crossed 18,000. After discharging 20,486 people on Monday, the state had 2.31 lakh people under treatment for Covid-19. Meanwhile, 63,101 people took the vaccine until 7pm on Monday. Deep dive of doubling period: The growth of both, cases and deaths, has been spiraling, bringing down the time taken to add every 1 lakh new cases and 1,000 deaths. For instance, it took 115 days for the state to add another 1,000 deaths after registering 12,000 fatalities on December 22. But the jump from 13,000 deaths to 14,000 (on April 30) took only 14 days. A week later on May 7, toll crossed the 15,000-mark and four days later, on May 11, the state had recorded more than 16,000 deaths. Since then, the state added 1,000 deaths every three days and the toll now has crossed 18,000. Similarly for infections, the state’s case tally grows by 1 lakh every three days. While it took 112 days for the state to add 1 lakh cases to reach 10 lakh on April 19. On April 27, the case tally crossed 11 lakh. In the next 17 days, case tally crossed 15 lakh (on May 14) and 16 lakh in three days thereafter. Active cases continue to grow:Chennai reported 6,150 new cases on Monday less than 6,247 reported on Sunday and the 6,640 reported on Saturday. But active cases have increased from 46,367 on Saturday to 48,156 on Monday. After Chennai, Coimbatore had the second highest number of fresh infections — 3,264. The western city had 24,195 active cases on Monday against the 7,288 it had on May 1 — recording the highest increase in active cases in May. While cases in the active case registry for May grew by 16,907 in Coimbatore, Chennai reported a rise of 16,681 cases. In terms of growth rate, Perambalur topped the list with a jump from 205 active cases on May 1 to 1,574 now. On Monday, the central district reported 135 new cases – the least in the state. Fatalities increasing fast:In the past one week, the state has added 2,125 deaths compared to 1,412 deaths reported last week. A combination of reasons including delayed testing and admission, lack of access to medical care, and a more infectious mutation of the virus strain has pushed up deaths. On Monday, barring Kallakurichi and Ariyalur, all other districts reported deaths. The highest was in Chennai (86), followed by Chengalpet (33) and Tiruvallur (20). Health minister Ma Subramanian, who was in Kancheepuram on Monday, said he will initiate action against self-financing medical colleges and deemed universities that do not admit Covd-19 patients. Occupancy rate was above 90% for oxygen and ICU beds in most districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-19-tamil-nadus-case-tally-tops-16-lakh-death-toll-crosses-18000/articleshow/82726709.cms||---

On Sunday, the Khaparkheda police registered an offence of rape against a 35-year-old officer who was a probationer in the 72nd batch of NADT and passed out last year. Officers of Indian Revenue Service (IRS) cadre joining income tax department after passing civil services exams are trained here. NADT is to IRS officers what Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie is to IAS officers. The IRS officers passing out from here form the top brass of income tax department. After 16 months training, the probationers take over as assistant commissioners of income tax. The alleged crime was committed when he was a probationer in NADT undergoing training. The officer has been posted at Bengaluru and not been arrested so far. He was booked following a complaint filed by a female medical doctor at Khaparkheda. According to police sources, the accused had met the complainant in August 2019, at the hospital where she worked. After initial friendship, they established physical relationship a month later. At that time the complainant was undergoing a post-graduation course, said sources. It has been alleged that the probationer had promised to marry her after he passes out of NADT. Later, she found out from the academy’s records that he was already married. This led to disputes, and finally a complaint. It is also alleged that the officer took obscene pictures of the complainant. A police source involved in the probe said the sleuths have got entire details of their telephonic chats on the basis of which a prima facie case has been registered. The next step would be decided after further investigation. Details will also be sought from the NADT, a source said. The director general of NADT, Nitin Gupta, said he had no intimation about the case so far. Police sources said NADT would be contacted soon. Earlier in 2011, an under-training probationer had levelled allegations of sexual harassment against a faculty, who was also an IRS officer. The complainant was later shunted out of the academy in the middle of the course. In another cases that was reported in 2012, a probationer allegedly took obscene pictures of his wife, also a probationer, to blackmail her. He was later arrested in Bengaluru. Later in 2015, another probationer was arrested by Delhi police in a similar case.

Following a visit to the capital of the UAE, members of a Kolkata-based digital learning startup, Notebook, sounded positive about the initiatives of Adio. “Startups in eastern India, particularly those with a business vertical catering to the local markets, will find a large target segment in the Middle East,” said Subhayu Roy, co-founder of this startup. Nexart, a Trivandrum-based technology startup, had launched a beta version of their product Eyewey, a mobile application, last year with the help of the Authority of Social Contribution- Ma’an Social Investment Fund. Nandu Jith, founder and CEO of the startup, said: “The pandemic hit us badly, hence we had to reiterate our business model and focussed more on the mobile application. We moved this project from a concept stage to its successful rollout by seeking assistance from Adio that is conducive to growth with more funding rounds, more incubators and new laws making the operations of new business enterprises easier.” Abu Dhabi is building up its capital market by attracting asset managers and international investors to set up local offices that can provide financial support and draw up alternative expansion plans for startups. “The lockdown has thrown up challenges for funding, thereby making it tough for startups to stay afloat. They can get incentives from Adio’s innovation programme or equity funding. The ‘emiratisation’ policy helps in boosting the capabilities of people. To attract talent, the immigration process has been designed to make it easy for the skilled workers and those with higher educational qualifications to obtain work permits,” said Bin Hendi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/abu-dhabi-lends-a-helping-hand-to-covid-hit-startups/articleshow/82721682.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Delhi||Six Delhi districts with high positivity rate under lens||DELHI: Covid cases are declining across all the 11 districts of Delhi but in some districts the positivity rate continues to remain higher than the others. All the districts witnessed a sudden and sharp surge during the last fortnight of April and in the first week of May, but, like the rise, the decline too has been very sudden and fast. From 36% in the second fortnight of April, the overall positivity rate of Delhi has come down to 10%. According to an official report of May 15 seen by TOI, southwest district reported a 21% positivity rate. NE district has lowest positivity rateAccording to an official report of May 15 seen by TOI, north district reported a positivity rate of 16.4%, southeast 13.3%, northwest 13.2%, west 12%, east 10%, central 9.6%, New Delhi 9.2%, Shahdara district 9.2%, south 7.9% and northeast 5.6%. The daily Covid tests hover between 2,200 and10,000 and all the districts are strictly enforcing the lockdown measures but the outcome in some present a different picture. The Centre is also watching the situation in districts reporting a higher positivity rate and monitoring Covid management there. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be interacting with the Delhi chief secretary and district magistrates of six districts of Delhi — west, southwest, northwest, New Delhi, east and south —from11am on Tuesday besides those of 40 other districts from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The chief secretaries have also been asked to attend the meeting through video conferencing. North district with 16.4% positivity and southeast district with13.3% positivity have been left out. A recent analysis of the trend at the six hotspot districts reveals that they reported a very high positivity rate during the fourth Covid wave. Southwest district saw a positivity rate as high as 65%, west district up to 37%, southeast up to 59%, south district up to 29%, Shahdara up to 45%, northwest up to 37%, east up to 34% and New Delhi up to 24.55%. However, New Delhi district had 9.3% positivity rate on May15. The DMs of southwest, northwest and north districts did not respond to TOI’s attempts to get their reaction about the prevailing Covid situation. A report on the situation in the six districts has been sent to the ministry of health and family welfare which will be making a presentation before the PM on Tuesday at the start of the video conference. An official who did not wish to be identified said that the authorities arenotclearaboutthecausesbehind the higher positivity rate in some districts as compared to other districts and only experts will be able to give an insight. Different officials from these districts said they are conducting the maximum number of tests incontainmentzones,slums,middle class areas and also villages. "The spread of Covid tests also influences the positivity rate. If more tests are conducted in the containment zones and adjoining clusters and among the contacts of Covidpositive persons, then the positivity rate is likely to be slightly higher," said a government doctor who is involved in Covid management. "More tests in superspreader areas also push up the positivity rate. It has been observed that more tests conducted in slums and underprivileged areas gives a lower positivity rate. That is why it is suggested that the districts should use mixed locations for carrying out the tests."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/six-delhi-districts-with-high-positivity-rate-under-lens/articleshow/82726733.cms||Alok K N Mishra

The high court observed that despite the curfew imposed by the state government, the number of cases seems to be on the rise and urgent measures are to be taken to arrest the spread of the virus. The high court took suo moto cognizance of the reports about the deaths happened due to non-availability of oxygen at Anantapur and Kurnool. The state government had filed memos in this regard stating that the deaths reported at both Anantapur and Kurnool are not entirely because of non-availability of oxygen but with some other reasons associated with the health condition of the deceased. C Sumon, special counsel for the government, told the high court bench comprising Justice C Praveen Kumar and Justice K Lalitha that the lockdown measures will give results in the days to come. He said that the number of cases remain same from last few days without any significant increase, indicating that the peak has been reached and this number will gradually come down henceforth. When it comes to the number of hospitals and number beds available across the state, the high court observed that this is the time that private hospitals should rise to the occasion and even if they don’t, the state government should make some quick decisions without waiting for their consent. The high court expressed displeasure over the condition of government hospitals. The bench said that they have noticed that regular sanitation is not being done at government hospitals. Even the food is not properly being supplied to the patients. The high court also made some serious observations over the information regarding availability of hospital beds. Though the state government has come up with a dashboard, it is not useful to the patients as it is being updated every four hours. Justice Praveen Kumar said that he has seen a patient who roamed around all hospitals for bed but eventually died before getting one. There has to be a better mechanism put in place so that patients can know about information about availability of beds, the bench said. On vaccination front, the high court asked whether it is true that the state governments can procure 25 per cent of the vaccines from the manufacturers. The advocate general replied that the matter is now with the Supreme Court there have been many views over the issue and control on vaccination is presently with the Union government. The high court further suggested the government to procure essential drugs like Remdesivir, blood thinners and steroids to contain black marketing. The high court also suggested to consider taking over ambulances across the state and ensure social distancing norms maintained at vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/utilise-services-of-pvt-hosps-to-tackle-covid-hc/articleshow/82717390.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Nagpur||HC asks govt for info on black fungus’ medicines shortage||Nagpur: After being informed about the massive shortage of medicines used to treat mucormycosis, commonly known as ‘black fungus’, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday directed the Maharashtra government to apprise it of the issue.“This court is not aware of any protocol being devised by the Centre or state for combating this infection. It’s also not known about the drugs that are expected to be the part of standard treatment to be provided to patients suffering from it,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said.The directives came after intervenor’s counsel M Anil Kumar filed an application informing about the shortage of drug Amphotericin, which is being used for treating this fungal infection that’s wrecking havoc in diabetic Covid-19 patients post recovery. He prayed for making the medicine available to patients.During an urgent hearing on a suo motu PIL where Shreerang Bhandarkar is amicus curiae, assisted by Nidhi Dayani, the bench put on hold issuance of work orders for setting up oxygen plants at government expense at Shalinitai Meghe Hospital at Wanadongri, and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital at Hingna.The orders had been issued to Noida-based W2E Engineering Private Limited for Rs1.74 crore each by the collector, who moved an application seeking HC clearance on the issue.Anil Kumar pointed out that both these hospitals are providing Covid treatment by taking nominal charges. According to him, these being private institutions, it’s expected that they also make their own contributions for the purpose. However, no response has been received from them.“We direct both institutions to submit details about the ability to set up oxygen generation plants at their cost and financial capacity to undertake such projects. These details may be forwarded to the collector, who shall submit them before next hearing. We, however, clarify that if any financial assistance is required by them, the HC would certainly consider making it available,” the judges said.HC: Implement Covid-19 SOPs at all Vid courtsThe HC directed its registry to bring revised standard operating procedure (SOP) to stop Covid-19 spread to the notice of principal district judges (PDJs) across all Vidarbha districts. “This SOP has been approved by us and it would also be made applicable to all courts in Nagpur district. The PDJs should consider applying it within their respective jurisdictions.”The HC was hearing an intervention application by Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa member Parijat Pande through senior counsel Anil Mardikar, who raised the concerns expressed by the District Bar Association (DBA).After receiving several requests, the PDJ here issued a revised SOP, including regulation of the number of courts which would operate everyday along with working hours and staff members’ presence.The other steps relate to E-filing of urgent matters with facility to physically do it by putting them in the drop-box, hearing through video conferencing, producing accused through virtual mode, making separate arrangements for recording of statements of witnesses or accused, making preparations for judgments, restricting use of lifts and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-govt-for-info-on-black-fungus-medicines-shortage/articleshow/82721933.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The state government had challenged the single judge order before a division bench seeking to set aside the order. Justice D V S S Somayajulu had stayed the GO issued by the state government to take over the management of Sangam dairy. He observed that the state government did not have the power to take over the management and stayed the GO while allowing the Sangam dairy management to continue as usual but directed not to alienate the properties without prior permission of the court. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said that the single judge erred in his judgment and the state government’s did not completely take over the management of the dairy. He said the intention of the government is to protect and prevent further depletion of its assets and it has executive powers to do that. The high court bench comprising Justice C Praveen Kumar and K Lalitha observed that the matter needs further examination as pointed out by the single judge in his order and without examining the material facts they are not inclined to interfere with the single judge order at this stage. Further hearing of the case has been posted after the HC’s summer vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sangam-dairy-court-declines-to-interfere-with-single-judge-order/articleshow/82717436.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Nagpur||Finally, Muniya notified a conservation reserve||Nagpur: Five months after the state board of wildlife (SBWL) approved 11 conservation reserves (CRs), including three from Vidarbha, the government issued final notification of Muniya Conservation Reserve. The decision was taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as chairman of the SBWL at its 16th meeting held on December 4, 2021. Apart from Muniya, the other two conservation reserves included Mogarkasa outside Pench Tiger Reserve and Mahendri in Warud in Amravati district. Thackeray had approved 10 conservation reserves, most of them in Western Maharashtra. Notifications of Mogarkasa and Mahendri were not issued as areas of both the conservation reserves are being revised. The Mogarkasa proposal was for 37.70 sqkm while Mahendri was for 67.48sqkm. Mogarkasa acts as a cushion for tigers dispersing from Pench. “There was some mismatch in preparing the Mogarkasa proposal and hence the area is being revised. There was a controversy over whether to make Mahendri a sanctuary or a conservation reserve. It was decided to first declare it a reserve and then a sanctuary,” said officials. The 96 sqkm Muniya has been carved from Butibori and North Umred forest range under the Nagpur division. Of total area, 60.82 sqkm is reserve forest and 35.18 sqkm is protected forest. The area consists of 24 compartments of Butibori and 15 compartments of North Umred ranges. “The decision is going to be an important milestone in further safeguarding and strengthening the critical corridor between Umred-Karhandla-Paoni wildlife sanctuary and Bor and Tadoba-Andhari tiger reserves. There will be now responsibility sharing and better coordination,” said Ravikiran Govekar, CCF and field director, Pench. The initial proposal to declare Muniya a reserve was first submitted by Vijay Ghugey, president, Nisarga Vidnyan Mandal in September 2007. On April 22, 2008, TOI was the first to report about it. It has taken 14 years to come to fruition. “The proposal was based on surveys conducted by us then. A fresh survey needs to be conducted to ascertain the flora and faunal diversity in Muniya to prepare a wildlife management plan. There are over 18 villages on the fringes of Muniya and there is huge biotic pressure, which needs to be eased by sensitizing locals,” said Ghugey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/finally-muniya-notified-a-conservation-reserve/articleshow/82721999.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Visakhapatnam||9 black fungus cases reported in Andhra Pradesh so far||VISAKHAPATNAM: With nine black fungus (mucormycosis) cases identified among recovered Covid-19 patients in Andhra Pradesh so far, state health officials are focusing on managing this fungal infection. According to health experts, mucormycosis begins to manifest as a skin infection in air pockets located behind the forehead, nose, cheekbones and in between eyes and teeth. It then spreads to the eyes and the lungs, and can even spread to the brain. The fungal infection leads to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing up of blood. Compromised immunity in some Covid-19 patients, particularly those with highly-elevated blood sugar levels or those on certain medications for Covid-19, may put people at the risk of developing the fungal disease. The disease is uncommon among people not having diabetes but can be fatal if not treated properly. Chances of recovery depend on early diagnosis and treatment. Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary (health and family welfare), said that the state government has decided to make black fungus a notifiable disease, which means that even private hospitals have to report black fungus cases to the government. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the health department to bring the disease under Aarogyasri cover. As per initial estimates, treatment of each patient may cost Rs 2–3 lakh,” said Singhal. He added that arrangements for treating suspected black fungus cases will be made at all teaching hospitals in the state. “Private hospitals with doctors qualified to treat the condition and empanelled under Aarogyasri scheme will also provide treatment. Apart from the allocation of the Union government, the state government will float tenders on its own to procure injections needed to treat the disease,” the principal secretary (health) said. The state health department has also decided to conduct awareness camps on black fungus disease for field-level medical staff and the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/9-black-fungus-cases-reported-in-ap-so-far/articleshow/82717504.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

While party cadre is running these facilities, local doctors associated with the party are extending services at these centres. The party has set up 40 such centres till date. CPI(M) state secretary Penumalli Madhu said, “We found that many of the poor, particularly those associated with the party, are struggling without isolation facilities after getting infected with Covid-19 as majority of them live in small one-room houses. We decided to convert party offices into Covid care centres to provide relief to the poor.” The 80-year-old communist stalwart, Madhu has been visiting centres to oversee arrangements. The initiative started with the launch of an isolation centre at Balotsav Bhavan near Makineni Basavapunnaiah Vignan Kendram (MBVK) in Vijayawada.

Alipiri circle inspector B Devendra Kumar said one Naidu, who is actually a painter by profession, had roped in people from other areas to dig the tunnel in search of hidden treasure. Naidu said his ‘guruji’ in Nellore, who died six months ago, showed him some inscriptions on copper plates and asked him to start digging at a place on the hillock near BTR colony. Naidu was told to dig about 120ft into the ground to find the ancient treasure in two underground rooms on the Seshachalam hillocks. A native of Anakapalle, Naidu shifted base to Tirupati in 2014 and used to do odd painting jobs to make a living. He later came in contact with Ramaiah Swamy, the self-styled ‘guruji’, who ‘decoded’ some inscriptions on copper plates to find the path to the treasure rooms. Both started the digging with help of local people about a year ago. After Ramaiah’s death about six months ago, Naidu continued on his digging mission to find the treasure, till his arrest on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/7-treasure-hunters-arrested-from-seshachalam-forests/articleshow/82717538.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

They will directly oversee transport of oxygen tankers. District SPs will coordinate from district oxygen war rooms. Officials said that coordinating channels are being maintained between law-and-order ADGs and Covid control rooms of neighbouring states. So far, AP police have provided green channel for oxygen tankers in five instances to ensure oxygen reached its destination in the nick of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/police-map-green-channel-routes-from-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82717664.cms||---

Since the beginning of this month, a self-proclaimed Ayurvedic doctor named Bonigi Anand has been preparing and distributing medicines that, he claims, can tackle Covid-19 Official sources informed that district collector KVN Chakradhar Babu has deputed a team of medical officers from district medical and health office (DMHO) and Ayush department to examine Anand’s medicine and submit a report. Krishnapatnam circle inspector Khaja Vali said, “Crowds have been gathering at the place for at least the last 10 days. One of the main reasons for the crowds in that people genuinely believe that this medicine could work and there haven’t been any side effects reported so far.” Officials have been baffled to find three queues converging at a point in the village. Sources say that the three queues are for three different groups: people who have tested positive for Covid-19, people who have fever and other symptoms and people looking to boost immunity. Speaking to the media, the self-proclaimed Ayurvedic doctor said that four medicines have been prepared, each with an alphabetic code. P — for clearing lung infections, F — to remove toxins, L — to strengthen liver efficiency and K— to help cure critical cases. According to Anand, some to the ingredients he used include pepper green camphor, nutmeg, honey, black cumin and cinnamon.

In the second wave that has exposed chinks in the state's medical infrastructure, the fund has received as little as Rs 2 crore in April-May this year. Sources said the state government was expecting private companies, philanthropists and individuals to loosen their purse strings and make generous contribution to ramp up medical infrastructure, with the state witnessing a frightening surge in new infections and deaths in the past month. However, the state's Covid-19 relief fund is now left with Rs 9 crore - Rs 2 crore raised this year and Rs 7 crore unspent from last year. S Selvakumar, principal secretary to the CM, said, "This year, the pandemic has hurt most private companies, especially in the manufacturing and small-scale sectors. Therefore, their contributions have reduced to a trickle." Tweak in CSR exemption terms may have hit spending of firmsAnother likely reason is that the Centre has tweaked exemption terms under corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending. Now, the Centre allows private companies to seek CSR exemption for funds directly spent on Covid relief work or on material assistance they are providing to the public. This, sources said, may have forced a majority of big companies to reduce their financial assistance. An official in the chief minister’s office said, “During the first wave, the Centre had issued an order that state governments need to issue certificates for companies on their contribution to the fight against Covid-19. However, during the second wave, the government has given the companies direct responsibility to aid and declare it as CSR contributions towards Covid-19 assistance.” Sources said the government has reportedly asked its wholly-owned subsidiaries to contribute to the State Disaster Response Fund, a common pool from where the state government allocates a maximum of 50% of funds for Covid relief work this year. The remaining 50% of the funds is set aside for tackling natural calamities like earthquake, floods and drought. The State Disaster Response Fund has received about Rs 70 crore since April this year. A source in the chief minister’s office said they were planning to seek contributions from companies as well as individuals to help the government in providing financial aid to below-poverty-line families in the state who are struggling to make ends meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rs-318-crore-in-first-wave-rs-2-crore-now-big-fall-in-donations-to-covid-fund-in-karnataka/articleshow/82726913.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

During the period, Tumakuru has reported 38,300 cases and Dakshina Kannada 20,299 with a big rise week on week. Chennai tops the list with 1.2 lakh cases, followed by Malappuram (Kerala) with 73,556 fresh Covid cases. Tumakuru, 70km from Bengaluru, is bearing the brunt of a surge in the IT city, according to officials involved in Covid management in the district. "As the surge began in Bengaluru, many from Tumakuru who were living in the state capital returned home. Most of the beds are occupied in both government and private hospitals in Tumakuru. The spurt began in April, and it is continuing," said Dr MB Nagendrappa, DHO, Tumakuru. DK, Tumakuru have better infra: DocsPeople are cooperating with testing. We’ve focused more on contact tracing and testing the primary contacts,” said DHO Dr MB Nagendrappa. In Tumakuru, over 6,000 tests are conducted in a day. From May 1, the district has seen 2,000 daily cases on average. The district has 28,194 active cases as of May 16 and 689 cumulative deaths. In Dakshina Kannada district, nearly 1,000 daily cases are seen on average and the district has an active caseload of 12,506. “We don’t have any bed crisis, with 85% cases in home isolation and being monitored. The problem is for ventilator beds. Of 191 ICU beds, 180 are occupied. Of 206 ventilators in both private and government hospitals, 204 are filled,” said Dr Kishore Kumar M, district health officer of Dakshina Kannada. Cases in Dakshina Kannada jumped in March with nursing college students returning from Kerala testing positive for Covid and clusters of cases were seen. Of Dakshina Kannada’s 1,659 oxygenated beds, only 446 were in use as on Monday. “About 5% of the total cases require high-flow nasal oxygen cannula bed and ICU admission. We are able to manage the bed requirement,” Dr Kumar told TOI. Health officers told TOI that Dakshina Kannada and Tumakuru are districts with better health infrastructure as private medical colleges and hospitals are well-established. “If we see a similar surge in some north Karnataka districts like Yadgir, it will be tough to manage,” said an officer. The Covid surge in both districts was discussed in a video conference with deputy commissioners of all districts on Monday. An expert committee member said testing in these districts should be ramped up so that treatment can start early, preventing fatalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-spike-tumakuru-and-dakshina-kannada-on-centres-radar/articleshow/82726967.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu school education department skips Union HRD minister-convened meet on NEP||TRICHY: Tamil Nadu school education department officials did not attend the meeting called by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Monday to discuss the new education policy. School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, however, said that they didn’t boycott it but chose not to attend it as the central ministry did not respond to his e-mail where he had expressed willingness to attend the meeting along with officials. A couple of days ago, he said, the department received an email from the Union education ministry asking its officials to attend a meeting on Monday to carry discussion on managing online education during the Covid-19 pandemic and the status of the new education policy’s implementation. “I took this matter up with the chief minister M K Stalin who said that a new government has taken office in Tamil Nadu but asking only officials [to attend] without ruling party members is against the federal system of governance,” Mahesh Poyyamozhi told reporters in Trichy. Pointing out that the department’s officials responded to the e-mail and sought permission to include the state school education minister in the meeting, but did not get a response, the minister said Tamil Nadu didn’t boycott the meeting but did not attend it either, in the absence of a response to the email. He also agreed that it is not the time to do politics as the matter pertained to the future of school students. “But we made our stance clear in 2019 itself on new education policy,” Mahesh Poyyamozhi said. The Centre released the draft new education policy in 2019 and Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin, who was then leader of the Opposition, had released a detailed response with suggestions in July 2019. Ahead of this year’s state assembly election, the DMK manifesto promised to come up with a state-level education policy opposing the NEP. Stalin had questioned board exams recommended for students of Classes III, V and VIII besides the vocation courses after Class VIII saying this appeared to be imposition of hereditary education. The NEP includes a threelanguage policy which is against the two-language policy of the state and also does not mention the reservation system. Centralisation of education is not practised even in western countries. But here the Centre wants to decide on what a child should study in various states. “The NEP may cater to children of elite and well settled families in society. It doesn’t suit the rural poor children. We seek changes to the policy as suggested by our chief minister and we will try to achieve it through dialogue,” said Mahesh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-school-education-department-skips-union-hrd-minister-convened-meet-on-nep/articleshow/82726966.cms||---

In a bid to stabilise patients and give their kin breathing space to find a bed, a group of techies have pooled money and set up a 21-bed oxygen care centre in the city. Under the banner of CV7 (Civil Volunteers Ward 7), the volunteers have been operating the centre at Sindhi College, Kempapura, near Hebbal since Saturday. "Initially, we thought of providing this facility only to residents of ward-7 (Byatarayanapura) but now we have decided to provide this facility to everyone across the city. Our volunteers are mostly techies working in various multinational companies," said Suhas Narayanamurthy, a volunteer with CV7. More than 10 patients have used the facility so far, he added. Patients aged 18-70 can access oxy beds for 4 hours at a timeMany people who test positive are in panic. They can come here so that their caregivers can look for beds in hospitals without worrying about their condition. We will also help move the patients to hospital once they get beds,” Suhas said. Patients aged 18-70 can access oxygen beds for four hours at a time, between 9am and 9pm (golden hour). “Project ‘Oxygen Centre’ aims to provide oxygen support service for Covid patients whose oxygen levels are between 88 and 92. This will be an interim arrangement till the patient or attendants find beds,” said Pramod Krishnaiah, another volunteer. “This timely oxygen supplementation will help people with mild respiratory distress. This will provide some time to the families to arrange for beds. We’ll also provide assistance to the caregivers to secure a bed, and logistical support to the family,” Pramod said. Dr Thomas J Kishen and his wife Dr Shinika Sehgal are part of the initiative, and 3-4 nurses work in shifts under their supervision. CV7 has a tie-up with a nearby hospital to attend to any medical emergency. “We will assess the condition of patients. We are not supposed to take in critical patients, especially those whose oxygen saturation level is below 88,” said Kishen. Suhas said the group has spent more than Rs 18 lakh on purchasing oxygen cylinders, concentrators, beds and medical equipment for the centre. “We are a group of 11 volunteers, mostly techies, so we collected money from our family members. We didn’t ask for any donations from others. The cost of medical equipment and transportation has also increased due to the pandemic,” he noted. It is up to patients to pay fee of Rs 500 for use of the beds, volunteers said. The initiative is supported by organisations like Lodge of Light 413 and Sindhi Seva Samithi. Those who require support can call at 9880976070, 9980588355 and 7760889523.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/techies-set-up-21-bed-oxygen-care-centre-in-bengaluru/articleshow/82726989.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
