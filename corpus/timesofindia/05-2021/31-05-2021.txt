---||India||Covid-19: Let Budget schemes kick in before asking about stimulus, says Nirmala Sitharaman||Battling crises has become second nature for finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. If it was the economic slowdown in 2019 when she took charge, now the Covid pandemic that hit India soon after in 2020 poses near-, medium- and long-term challenges. In an interview with TOI’s Sidhartha, Surojit Gupta and Rajeev Deshpande, the FM made it clear that funds will not be a problem either for healthcare or meeting other requirements of the economy, while maintaining that it was impossible to anticipate the speed and intensity with which the second wave hit the country. Excerpts:How has the second wave affected GST collections?It will certainly be better than what we used to get in October-November, but with some states under lockdown — and the e-way bills are indicating that — there could be some reduction. I want to maintain April’s level (of Rs 1.4 lakh crore). But I don’t see this dip as being something that will continue in the next few months. Last month was particularly bad, now we are already seeing that it is improving. For the full year the revenue secretary said the compensation shortfall would be around Rs 1.5 lakh crore. States are suggesting a higher number... Even last year there were calculations and calculations. There was also this thing about why you would want to differentiate between the protected revenue, based on (the promised) 14% growth, and the actual reduction in collections, resulting in a larger gap because of Covid. Debates will happen and I am very keen on hearing them. Even on Friday (when the GST Council met), I sat through it and heard everybody. The formula for compensation borrowing has been in place since last year. We will take it from there. This year itself if I get better revenues, last year’s dues, which have not been paid, can be paid. That need not be a borrowing (to that extent). There is also this concern that after July 2022, once the cess collection stops, are we going to fall off the cliff because we won’t have anything to collect or share? For that, we will have a separate session. A group of ministers has been set up to examine the issue of rates on items such as vaccines, drugs, oxygen-related equipment needed to fight Covid. There were two suggestions from states, one was zero duty and the other one was zero-rating. What are the reasons to not take them up? Not taking it up is not anybody’s position. The GST Council consists of states and the Centre. The chairman happens to be the finance minister of the country. The voting rights of the Centre and the states are all agreed on. We are not a collection of people divided into two groups. We are not adversaries. That approach worries me. In 2019, when I took charge, in the first few meetings I was constantly reminded that the spirit of every decision here is consensus and that is what I am striving to keep. We should be able to have open and free discussions. There was a discussion on zero rates and we heard both voices. A decision on zero rating is not within the Council’s hands. The Council can decide, but it requires amendment to the law. The states will have to pass ordinances before their assemblies meet. Therefore, some ministers like (West Bengal FM) Dr Amit Mitra suggested that, instead of that, we keep it as 0.1 or 0.01. Let the group of ministers decide. GST will complete four years. When will the next set of steps on rationalisation be taken? That was mentioned by one or two members on Friday. Last year, I had said rationalisation of rates and correction of inverted duty structure will be needed, but we will have to choose an appropriate time. It was felt that this may not be the time to do it although it is on everybody’s mind. There are things such as life-saving medicines and concentrators which you only need in an emergency. Is there a need to get them into a lower slab? The WHO’s protocol is also evolving. You have A, B, C drugs today. But as we move along, B is dropped and D is added. Automatically, going by that rule, I need to exempt D, but I will have to bring back B (restore rates). The Council will have to take a call on how you offer concessions while keeping the dynamic nature of the situation in mind. In the longer-term is there a need to have medicines, healthcare items like concentrators, testing kits, etc, in the lowest bracket?What we have today under GST is what we imported from the pre-GST era. When we see the pandemic, we all think we need to give with a large heart. On Friday, one of the comments was (on being) heartless. Is the GST Council heartless? I am part of it today, somebody else was there earlier. Lifesaving drugs were required even then (before Covid), were they (the members) heartless? When you sit there (in the Council), you are sitting there representing your people. The rates today are what I have inherited based on the decisions of the Council (to go for revenue-neutral rates). If you want a change, we will discuss. That is the only way. Is the GST Council becoming a political platform since the Opposition-ruled states seem to distance themselves and suggest that they were not part of the exercise? How do you ensure policymaking against this backdrop? You will have to keep trying. I can’t have it the way I want even if I feel mine is a very noble thought. To the credit of the Council, in spite of the politicisation you are referring to, people listen, talk, discuss, raise their concerns and freely discuss. Every member finance minister feels that they can speak openly. On Friday, for the first time, there was coverage on some TV channels even as some of the finance ministers spoke. It did upset me. There are no secrets being discussed but it will lead to a situation where people are going to keep quiet and free discussion may not happen. After the meetings, finance ministers go out and speak to the press, just as I brief reporters. But if there is a running commentary going on — it will not help. I am glad Dr Amit Mitra agreed with me. What is the assessment in the finance ministry about the impact of the second wave on the economy? There is also this criticism that a large stimulus is not being unveiled by the government... I don’t know who said that. We are just in May, even the first quarter is not over. The Budget, which is designed for a Covid-affected economy, will have to go down to the people. We are not even taking that on board, and we have started talking about where is the big deal stimulus? The Budget itself is designed keeping necessity (for a stimulus). Many of the schemes which were announced during Atmanirbhar Bharat are still being used. For example, the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) still has money in it. We opened it up for other sectors and that can still be expanded. The Swamih Fund has started with 135 projects all over the country to provide last-mile funding. It will help people who are paying rent and EMI and is also a stimulus in a way because cement, steel and labour will benefit. So, there are quite a few Atmanirbhar announcements which are active. Setting up wellness centres in rural areas, agricultural infrastructure and so on. Last year, we increased the budget for MGNREGA when there was demand. If necessary, I will give more but there is not that much demand, meaning the kind of increase that we saw last year is not there. Post-corona, when labour is returning, it is negotiating based on the skills acquired. So, there are things happening and that is why I said that we have not made a final call on what is the impact of the second wave yet on the economy. Does it make sense to wait and then assess the impact because until a few weeks ago people were more worried about lives than livelihoods? We are continuing the process of assessing, but it is going to be drastically different from one week to the other. Every week, the inputs are going to be fairly different. Some sectors have been hit particularly hard — tourism, hospitality, etc. Do you see any room for doing something for these sectors? I tried in the pre-Budget time. We had extensive consultations but couldn’t bring a formulation which could work. In fact even during the final days we met hoteliers but we couldn’t arrive at a formulation. However, we did open up the ECLGS for smaller hoteliers. I fully recognise that hotels, tourism, hospitality and all the contact-based industries have suffered. What is the feedback? Is there a little more distress because in sectors such as MSMEs the recovery was just about starting at the time of the second wave? It’s too early for me to comment. I am not in a position to gather comprehensive feedback, we are getting some inputs. It’s too early to get a comprehensive picture to reach a conclusion. The way the virus is behaving, will we have to adapt to these partial lockdowns in various parts of the country? That is why it was the right approach that the PM has been underlining, that a local containment zone approach, a micro containment approach makes complete sense because the local area and the local authorities would be in a position to assess better. Will you need more allocation for health this year? I am going to have a review next week. People should start spending on the ground. After that if they need more, I am willing to give. But not even two months of the financial year are complete yet. You have also set aside Rs 35,000 crore for vaccination in the Budget. But assessments suggest you may need to double that... We know the manufacturing capacity of the two Indian vaccines manufacturers. I have given them money up to July in advance. While giving that I have not even asked for any guarantees. We made that exception to the rule. I have to pay, but which government pays all that on April 1? As you use, so we give. That’s so with MGNREGA, education, health, social budget. Let them supply. We are also looking at imports, a lot of things are happening. How do you respond to the Opposition’s charge that the government did not order adequate number of vaccines and criticism of the vaccination strategy? I quite welcome the opposition party talking about vaccine policy, whether we got it right, whether we got it wrong, everything. When they speak, they should also say how they have contributed to vaccine hesitancy in this country. How they have repeatedly said things which have damaged the vaccine policy rolling out in this country. How they questioned Indian vaccine producers and their credibility…On the one hand you say this was set up by Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Do you forget their contribution? On the other they go about questioning vaccines produced in this country and ask are they credible? They said, “I will not take it, that is Modi’s vaccine, that’s BJP vaccine”. Today, you are saying, “Oh, where is the vaccine?” Be consistent. You want it or you don’t want it? Make up your mind. There is also this criticism about governance failure in handling the second wave. What is your response? I can understand the tragedy and the impact it has had on individual families. In one way or the other, everybody has been touched by this tragedy, particularly during the second wave. I am really sorry that the extent to which the burden fell on families. Children are left orphaned. But the speed with which it spread and the intensity with which it spread, all within a matter of 10-15 days, no amount of preparation could have been adequate. I am not saying this because I am in government and therefore I want to defend it. I am not giving a “Bachao”, I am not giving a saving statement. States, Centre, private hospitals, medical fraternity, who would have imagined the extent (and) intensity with which it came and the speed with which it spread? Since October, money has been given for oxygen in hospitals and for beds and other infrastructure. Work is going on. So how much of preparation would have been adequate and if somebody actually knew this was happening? For instance, the opposition parties, were their states prepared? I am not finger pointing. At this time, what are we talking about? Governance failure? How much more would have been sufficient? Can somebody put a number? Impossible. Look at Japan, do they have less money, are they less in buying vaccines for the entire population? Are they incapable of handling? After all, they are a very organised and systematic society. Osaka’s hospitals are full. I wish them well. That’s (also) the case with Taiwan, with so many places where the virus has surfaced again. In this time, with all humility, I would only say all of us have to work together to alleviate the suffering. We have to keep working till such a time peoples’ suffering come to an end. How do you see the privatisation programme in the wake of the lockdown? We are on course on disinvestment. I am not doing it just for revenue. I am also doing it because it’s a policy, it’s a Cabinet decision and, above all, by keeping them there and if they are not professionally run, it’s a loss of taxpayers’ money and I am answerable at that end. How much of a worry is the global inflation situation as well the domestic price pressure? In answering this, I will talk about governance. Not only taking care of Covid-related matters, but even on essential goods, essential food items, edible oils, pulses — the group of ministers kept meeting and making sure that we have imports in time, orders are placed in time, stockists who are hoarding release stocks. Every such thing has been happening even during the lockdown. Seasonal variations, supply shortages — all this will lead to this question. We are making sure that meetings are held so frequently that, if there are interventions required, we will do it. We do not want prices to be a burden. Petrol price has crossed Rs 100 a litre in some parts of the country. Will you review taxes? It is not just for me to decide, there are many layers, including the states. The stock market indices are rising. The question often asked is this a recognition of India’s prospects or is there something wrong with this exuberance? I am not getting into what causes the exuberance or not. It is a fact that Indian companies are doing well, listed companies are doing well. Indian macroeconomic fundamentals are sound, India seems to be the place even by the global investing community’s assessment and India seems to be the place for future manufacturing. Today, our schemes have been attractive enough, for instance, the performance-linked incentive scheme. FDI flow has not really abated, it is going steadily upwards. So, obviously the stock market is reflecting it and it’s also true even the Indian public is no longer just looking at small savings or risk-free saving. They are also willing to invest in markets, mutual funds, and have direct investment into stocks of companies which are transparent in their operations. Sebi’s interaction tells us about the interest and awareness on stock markets in the last one year. So, the common people of India have also realised there is a potential world out there. How much of a concern is the global liquidity situation? I don’t think it’s an issue to be worried about at this moment. These things will have to be watched before we undertake a policy intervention. But at this stage, we are not talking about liquidity-related issues, which are global in their nature. The insolvency process has been bogged down by some promoters gaming the system. Is the government taking a close look at how to get past these hurdles that are being sought to be put up to slow down the process? I am so glad that the courts in India are repeatedly reaffirming the fundamental strength of IBC and its legality is strengthened by every judgment. Of course, there is such gaming which eventually results in loss of time. For companies this is the biggest burden, you go bid genuinely for a company and the committee of creditors is willing to take an offer and then suddenly somebody puts a spoke in the wheel. So, those kinds of things are the ones on which we have to apply our minds and seek some kind of an intervention, if necessary, by bringing in amendments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-let-budget-schemes-kick-in-before-asking-about-stimulus-says-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/83096617.cms||Sidhartha

---||India||First in 12 weeks, Covid deaths in India start to dip||NEW DELHI: India's painfully high death count in the second wave of the Covid pandemic is finally coming down. In the week ended Sunday, nationwide fatalities dipped by 17%, the first decline in 12 weeks, even as the daily death toll dropped below 3,000 after 34 days. Meanwhile, the second wave is now receding across all states/Union territories except a few in the northeast and in Ladakh. While fresh cases of the virus fell for the third week running, this week's numbers showed the most comprehensive decline yet as infections had started to fall in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Assam — states that had shown a rising trend till last week. With 12.95 lakh new infections recorded in May 24-30, the weekly case count registered a drop of 27% over the previous week, the steepest yet in the second wave. Just as significant was the fall in deaths. India recorded 24,372 fatalities in May 24-30, a drop of almost 5,000 from the previous week's toll of 29,331. These included previous deaths added to the toll in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand during this period. Read AlsoNortheast may be next Covid hotspotThe northeast could be poised to become the next target of the ongoing second wave of Covid, according to a forecasting tool based on data till May 21. Development Data Lab, a research organisation working on open data, and a team led by University of Chicago’s Prof Anup Malani calculate thePrior to this week, the Covid death toll had risen for 11 weeks in a row as the deadly second wave left the country's health infrastructure completely overwhelmed. Weekly fatalities had last seen a decline in the March 1-7 week. In the month of May alone, the Covid toll in the country has crossed 1.15 lakh so far. In another sign of the tide having turned, fatalities reported on Sunday dropped below 3,000 for the first time since April 26. The country recorded 2,722 deaths, not counting the 412 earlier fatalities that Maharashtra added on Sunday, on top of the day's toll of 402. The state has added close to 6,000 old deaths in the last two weeks.

Besides, states have also been advised to expand vaccination for priority population groupsMeanwhile, 1,53,663 fresh cases were reported on Sunday, the lowest daily count in 50 days since 1.52 lakh new infections were reported on April 10, as per TOI's Covid database. Daily cases in the country have dipped for the fourth day running after touching this week's high of 2,12,083 on Wednesday. In the weekly count, only five out of 36 states and UTs in the country registered a rise in cases as compared with the previous seven days. These states/UTs were Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Ladakh. The drop in some other states, such as Assam and Tripura, was marginal, indicating that the pandemic continues to rage across the northeastern region.

---||India||Country fought first wave of Covid-19 courageously, will be victorious in second round: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: The country fought the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic “courageously” and it would be “victorious” in its ongoing fight against the virus during the second wave, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday. “In the form of the corona pandemic, we are being continuously put to test. This is a crisis that has plagued the whole world, so many people have lost their loved ones. Even big countries were not spared from its devastation,” Modi said in his monthly radio programme ‘Mann ki Baat’. He emphasised that no matter how big the challenge, the country’s ‘vijay sankalp’ (resolve to be victorious) had always been equal to the challenge. “Our collective strength and our spirit of service has always rescued the country from the midst of every storm,” he said. During the programme, he spoke to three people involved with transporting oxygen cylinders and containers through rail, road and airways, and listened to their experience and challenges during the recent crisis when many parts of the country faced severe shortage of medical-grade oxygen. He also pointed to the government completing seven years in office and highlighted signature initiatives, including power connections to all households and the Jal Jeevan mission to provide tap water to all rural homes. “In the midst of this pandemic, India is moving forward with the resolve of service and cooperation,” he added. Modi pointed to the scheme to provide tap water connection to every rural household in the country by 2024 under Jal Jeevan Mission and said it had made strong progress without any break during the pandemic. “In the seven decades after independence, only 3.5 crore rural homes of our country had water connections. However, in the last 21 months, 4.5 crore houses have been given clean water connections. Of these, 15 months were of the corona period,” he added. The PM also noted the contribution of farmers and the agriculture sector during the pandemic. “The agricultural sector protected itself from this attack to a great extent. Not only did it keep itself safe, but the sector also progressed, moving forward. Farmers produced record output and this time, the country went on to procure record amounts of crops. This time, in many places, farmers have got more than the minimum support price for mustard,” he said. Noting that India was able to provide support to every citizen due to record foodgrain production, he said, “Today, 800 million underprivileged citizens are being provided free ration in this hour of crisis. So, no such day ever occurs in a needy home when the stove is not lit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/country-fought-first-wave-of-covid-19-courageously-will-be-victorious-in-second-round-pm-modi/articleshow/83097179.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19 has no credible natural ancestor: Study||LONDON: Amid calls for a fresh probe into the origins of Covid-19, a new study has found that Chinese scientists created the virus in a lab in Wuhan, then tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering versions of the virus to make it look like it evolved naturally from bats. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 virus has no “credible naturalancestor” and was created by Chinese scientists who were working on a ‘Gain of Function’ project in a Wuhan lab, the Daily Mail reported on Sunday, citing a new research paper by British professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Dr Birger Sorensen. The new research claims that scientists took a natural coronavirus “backbone” found in Chinese cave bats and spliced onto it a new “spike”, turning it into the deadly and highly transmissible Covid-19. The paper also quotes that researchers found “unique fingerprints” in Covid-19 samples that they say could only have arisen from manipulation in a laboratory. Authors Dalgleish and Sorensen wrote in their paper that they had prima facie evidence of retro-engineering in China for a year, but were ignored by academics and major journals, reported DailyMail.com. The study alleged “deliberate destruction, concealment or contamination of data” at Chinese labs and notes the silencing and disappearance of scientists in China who spoke out about the activities. The research, has been obtained by DailyMail.com, is expected to intensify the ongoing debate on China’s role in creating the virus that has claimed thousands of lives. In the 22-page paper which is set to be published in the scientific journal Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, Dalgleish and Sorensen pieced together how Chinese scientists, some working with American universities, allegedly built the tools to create the coronavirus. Incidentally, ‘Gain of Function’ projects, which involves tweaking naturalviruses to make them more infectious, had been outlawed by former US President Barack Obama. In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Sorensen said that four amino acids on the spike have a positive charge, which causes the virus to tightly cling to the negatively charged parts of a human, becoming more infectious. Because these positively charged amino acids also repeal each other, it was rare to find even three in a row in naturally occurring organisms, while four in a row is “extremely unlikely”, he said. “The laws of physics mean that you cannot have four positively charged amino acids in a row. The only way you can get this is if you artificially manufacture it,” Dalgleish told DailyMail.com. “The implication of our historical reconstruction, we posit now beyond reasonable doubt, of the purposively manipulated chimeric virus SARS-CoV-2 makes it imperative to reconsider what types of Gain of Function experiments it is morally acceptable to undertake,” they wrote. In the paper, the scientists wrote that a natural virus pandemic would be expected to mutate gradually and become infectious but less pathogenic, which did not happen in the case of Covid-19. Dalgleish and Sorensen claimed that after the pandemic began, Chinese scientists took samples of the COVID-19 virus and ‘retro-engineered’ it, making it appear as if it had evolved naturally. “We think that there have been retro-engineered viruses created. They’ve changed the virus, then tried to make out it was in a sequence years ago,” Dalgleish told DailyMail.com. The scientists also highlighted that Chinese scientists who wished to share their knowledge have not been able to do so or have disappeared. Sorensen said that he believes the virus escaped from lower security areas of the institute, where he believes Gain of Function research was performed, reported DailyMail.com. “We have seen lab leaks and we know it's happening. We also know from the reports we’ve seen, that coronavirus is worked on in Biosafety Level 2 or 3 labs. If they do Gain of Function in such labs, what do you expect?” he said. In February 2020, Botao Xiao, a molecular biomechanics researcher at South China University of Technology, published a paper claiming “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan”, highlighting safety issues at the institute. However, he withdrew the paper weeks later after Chinese authorities denied any accidents at the lab. Dalgleish further told DailyMail.com that he believed China's resistance to the theory that COVID-19 is a man-made, escaped virus comes from scientists fearful that the revelation would shut down their field. "This looks like a weak defence to protect the discipline so that this type of genetic engineering will not be interfered with. I make no bones about it. The Gain of Function engineering should have been banned ages ago," he said. Despite former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove saying publicly that the scientists' theory should be investigated, they said their research was dismissed by major scientific journals that were adamant that the virus jumped naturally from bats, reported DailyMail.com. However, leading academics, politicians and the media have now begun to contemplate the possibility that Covid-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China - where experiments included manipulating viruses to increase their infectiousness in order to study their potential effects on humans. US President Joe Biden on May 26 said he has asked the US intelligence community to "redouble their efforts" to come to a conclusion on the origins of Covid-19 and report back to him within 90 days. China state media rejected the idea that Covid-19 had originated there and said that it is "a conspiracy created by US intelligence agencies" A few days ago, an article was published in the Wall Street Journal which revealed that three researchers at Wuhan Institute fell ill in November 2019 and had to be hospitalized. The report was based on previously undisclosed US intelligence. The researchers were admitted into the hospital a month before China reported the first case of Covid-19. The revelation has sparked debate and raised questions about whether China knew of the deadly virus way before it apprised the world. Recently, former New York Times science journalist Nicholas Wade published an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists where he argues that evidence is stronger than the virus leaked from a lab than that it occurred naturally. In an elaborate report, Wade said that much of the work of Chinese virologists on gain-of-function in coronaviruses was performed at the BSL2 safety level lab, which requires taking fairly minimal safety precautions. The pandemic broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019."For the lab escape scenario, a Wuhan origin for the virus is a no-brainer. Before that, an Australian daily revealed that Chinese scientists were thinking about bioweapons, visualising a World War-III scenario. The Weekend Australian newspaper cited a Chinese government document that discussed the weaponisation of SARS coronavirus. DailyMail.com further reported that China had installed the first of a planned five to seven Biolabs in Wuhan in 2017 for the purpose of studying the most high-risk pathogens, including the Ebola and the SARS viruses. In March, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus also called for further studies after the release of an inconclusive report on an international team's field visit to Wuhan to research the origins of Covid-19, citing difficulties accessing raw data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-has-no-credible-natural-ancestor-study/articleshow/83097782.cms||---
---||Business||Covid treatment: Banks offer unsecured loans of up to Rs 5 lakh||MUMBAI: Banks will offer off-the-shelf unsecured loans of up to Rs 5 lakh to individuals for Covid treatment, and business loans up to Rs 100 crore for setting up healthcare facilities. The launch of the new schemes was announced by SBI chairman Dinesh Khara and Indian Banks’ Association chairman Rajkiran Rai on Sunday. Khara said that SBI has decided to price its unsecured loans at 8.5%. The bankers also provided an update on the restructuring offer made to small businesses under the scheme announced by the RBI earlier this month. Rai said that up to April, banks did not see any problem in the servicing of loans. However, in May, there was a drop in collections but it was too early to get an idea of the number. Individuals seeking a restructuring of loans can make an application on the bank’s website or manually submit the proposal. Both the borrower and the bank will have to agree to a resolution plan within 30 days of the application and September 30 would be the last day for finalising the resolution plan. Khara said that public sector banks have formulated a templated approach for restructuring loans to individuals, small businesses and MSMEs for up to Rs 25 crore. He said that banks would be proactive and would reach out to eligible customers through bulk SMS messages and offer-cum-acceptance would be generated and sent electronically. The personal loans would be available to all individuals for treatment of self or family member. The minimum loan amount would be Rs 25,000 and the term would be for a maximum of five years. The RBI had encouraged lenders to provide such loans earlier this month by offering to refinance up to Rs 50,000 crore with priority sector status for such advances. While banks have financed oxygen plants and vaccine manufacturers in May 2020, the standardised packages are expected to speed up disbursement. The business loans would be available for anyone engaged in building and servicing healthcare infrastructures such as hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, diagnostic centres and pathology labs. It will be available for greenfield investments as well as for adding to existing capacity. The quantum of loan, which will be for a tenure of up to 10 years, will be Rs 100 crore for metro centres, Rs 20 crore for tier-1 and urban centres, and Rs 10 crore for smaller towns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-treatment-banks-offer-unsecured-loans-of-up-to-5-lakh/articleshow/83100237.cms||---

As per the master plan submitted to the expert appraisal committee for environment clearance, which has received the go ahead, the PMR will come up on 15 acres and will have 10 low rise buildings of not more than two floors. The PMR will not have any basement, according to the CPWD’s proposal. Sources said the PMR will be a complete complex for the PM’s residence and PMO. TOI on November 3, 2019 had first reported new PMO and PMR coming closer to South Block. According to the plan, the PMR complex will have a facility for parking 112 vehicles and will accommodate around 1,000 employees. The daily floating population is estimated to be 500. The SPG building for PM’s security will come up close to PMR on a 2.5 acre plot. There will be only one building with a basement. It will have parking space for 175 vehicles. CPWD had not submitted the details of the budget to be spent for PMR while the total project cost for the Central Vista redevelopment is Rs 13,400 crore. This excludes the cost of Parliament and redevelopment of Rajpath. Though CPWD had proposed to complete the PMR and SPG building by December in its proposal submitted in January this year, the work plan has been delayed due to the second wave of Covid. “There was a plan to complete the two new buildings in Africa Avenue and K G Marg by April-May and hence existing offices in hutments could be shifted for the construction of PMR. But these have been delayed and we expect shifting of offices may start by August and the bids for construction of PMR and SPG building can be floated by then,” said a source. A new PMR is part of the mega revamp of the Central Vista area in Central Delhi. The government has already floated a tender for the first three office buildings that will come up on IGNCA plot. These buildings will have modern facilities including centralised air-conditioning, IT-based building management and basement parking system, and total management of solid and liquid waste within the campus. Each building will have 24 large conference halls to accommodate 40-45 people, a library, pharmacy, creche and music room besides gymnasium and yoga centre. According to the overall plan of these office buildings, PMR, VP Enclave and a mega conference hall, the total number of 4,642 existing trees will be reduced to 3,165. The CPWD has submitted that 30,547 trees will be planted as compensatory afforestation in other parts of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/construction-of-new-pm-residence-likely-to-begin-in-august-after-slight-delay-caused-by-pandemic/articleshow/83098128.cms||Dipak K Dash

Many have got full fee waiver till the completion of intermediate, too. After losing her husband, who was a scientist at the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, to Covid-19 in August last year, Sunitha Bathula was concerned about the education of her two sons. “I don’t have any employment and I even lost my parents in the last one year. Worried about who would pay the fees for my sons, I reached out to the Hyderabad Public School (HPS), Ramanthapur administration, who readily waived off Rs 1.20 lakh in fee and informed me that they’d take care of the education of my two sons,” said Bathula, who has one son is Class 9 and another one in Class 1. The HPS, Ramanthapur has extended such relief to eight other students who lost their parents in the past one year. The situation was much the same for A Anwitha, a Class 5 student of Pallavi Model School. After her family paid Rs 23 lakh towards hospital bills for both her mother and her father for Covid-19 treatment, it was a struggle to pay school fees for the academic year 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/compassion-lesson-schools-waive-fees-of-covid-orphans/articleshow/83100456.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Business||Antrix deal: NCLT orders winding up of Devas for indulging in 'fraudulent activities'||NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has ordered the liquidation and winding up of Bengaluru-based startup Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd while declaring that the company was incorporated in a “fraudulent manner to carry out unlawful purposes”. It stated that the company’s management is continuing to resort to “fraudulent activities” in relation to its commercial contract in 2005 with Isro’s commercial arm Antrix Corporation. In 2011, the Devas agreement with Antrix to build, launch and operate two satellites was annulled by the central government against the backdrop of the 2G scam and allegations of manipulations in the deal. In its order on May 25, the Bengaluru bench of the tribunal directed the official liquidator attached to the Karnataka high court to take expeditious steps to liquidate the company in order to prevent it from perpetuating its “fraudulent activities and abusing the process of law” by enforcing the arbitration tribunal award passed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against Antrix in 2015. “The incorporation of Devas itself was with fraudulent motive and unlawful object to collude and connive with then officials of Antrix and to misuse/abuse process of law, to bring money into India and to divert it under dubious methods to foreign countries,” the NCLT bench comprising members Rajeshwara Rao Vittanala and Ashutosh Chandra said. The tribunal has directed the liquidator to submit a report by July 7. The tribunal also observed that “Devas failed to show any cogent reason as why it should not be wound up and to keep its name on the Registrar of Companies, Karnataka.The only reason apparent on record, by perusal of various pleadings raised in the instant petition is that it wants to prosecute enforcement of award in question, in the name of the company in the courts of India and abroad by abusing the process of law”. Taking a dim view of the proceedings initiated by Devas in the international forum against Antrix, the NCLT observed: “Devas, while accepting the termination of agreement in question before ICC court, later changed its version and claimed huge damages. Though the tribunal finds that the Government of India has sovereign power to frame and change its policies, which includes termination of agreement in question, it has continued to misuse the process of law to its advantage. It has successfully taken arbitration out of the country contrary to terms of agreement. And even without permitting Antrix/government to take appropriate course of action on the award, it has precipitated the issue by initiating various proceedings before Indian and foreign courts for enforcement of the award in question, when the validity of award is under challenge before competent court...” It said that Devas “in all its fairness” should have waited for the outcome of the proceedings pending against the validity of the award before attempting to enforce the same. It also observed that “even after filing of the instant petition, instead of proving to the satisfaction of tribunal that it is not liable to be wound up, as sought for by the petitioner, Devas has started proxy war by approaching the honourable NCLAT and honourable Karnataka high court, through Devas Employees Mauritius Pvt Ltd, by raising un-tenable grounds one after the another”. On October 30 last year, ICC had passed an award directing Antrix to pay $1.2 billion compensation to Devas for terminating the contract. A month later in November, the Supreme Court had stayed the proceedings to execute the award. It was on January 18 this year that the Centre had authorised Antrix CMD Rakesh Shashibhushan to present a petition to wind up Devas on the grounds specified under Sect 271(1)(c) of the Companies Act. On January 19, the tribunal had admitted the petition filed by Antrix for winding up Devas and had appointed a provisional liquidator for the company, directing it to take control of its management, properties and actionable claims. Now, after almost four months, it has allowed the petition of Antrix.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/antrix-deal-nclt-orders-winding-up-of-devas-for-indulging-in-fraudulent-activities/articleshow/83101597.cms||Surendra Singh

Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan tweeted: “Hotels offering Covid-19 vaccination packages shall face strict legal action! Such activities are in contravention to rules under the national Covid vaccination program and must cease immediately.” The Union health ministry wrote to all states on Saturday, saying it had come to its notice that “some private hospitals are giving packages for Covid vaccination in collaboration with some hotels, which is against (rules).” The Centre has pointed out in the letter there are four available options for vaccination — government centres; private hospitals; at government and private offices and “near to home” centres for elderly and differently abled. “Apart from this there is no other avenue to carry out (Covid) vaccination… therefore vaccination (being) carried out in start hotels is contrary guidelines and must be stopped immediately. Necessary legal and administrative actions should be initiated against such institutions,” the letter by Union health ministry additional secretary Manohar Agnani says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-government-warns-hotels-against-stay-vaccination-packages/articleshow/83101705.cms||---

However, experts from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the national task force for Covid-19 have advised against repeating Covid tests within 102 days of recovery, citing presence of “non-viable dead-virus particles” that stay in the body for a while. These virus remnants cannot transmit the illness but can cause a false positive test result. The experts said surgeons should consider performing a non-urgent surgery on a Covid-recovered patient only after six weeks of recovery to ensure faster healing and convalescence post-surgery. “At present, Covid reinfection is confirmed only after 102 days of diagnosis. So, retesting within this time frame is not advisable,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the task force. Read AlsoCovid-19: ICMR approves ‘saline gargle’ RT-PCR test, results in 3 hoursA new ‘saline gargle RT-PCR method’ promises to make testing simpler and cheaper, and give out results in three hours. The method has received approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Scientists at the Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri)“Also, a minimum period of six weeks prior to non-urgent surgery is recommended for Covid-recovered patients who were symptomatic. As for emergency surgeries in recovering or recovered patients, these must be done immediately with due precautions,” Pujari said. He, however, added that if a patient experiences recurrence of Covid symptoms, re-testing and consultation with an infectious disease expert can be considered. Experts said a Covid-recovered patient’s preoperative risk assessment should be “individualised”, by factoring in surgical intensity, co-morbidities and the risk-benefit ratio if procedure is delayed. “Residual symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain are common in patients who have had Covid. These symptoms can be present for more than 60 days after diagnosis,” Pujari said. Read AlsoMaybe relook advisory barring repeat of RT-PCR on Covid positive patients: HC to ICMRNEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday suggested to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that it may need to re-look its recent advisory which said RT-PCR must not be repeated on an individual who tested positive by either Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) or RT-PCR. Justice Rekha Palli askedCovid may also have long-term effects on heart function. A thorough preoperative evaluation, scheduled well ahead of surgery with special attention on cardiopulmonary systems, should be considered in patients who have recovered and especially in those with residual symptoms, according to the guidelines issued by the American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA). President of Poona Surgical Society, Sanjay Kolte said, “Retesting recovered patients within 102 days from Covid diagnosis only adds to anxiety and is a wastage of money. Importantly, surgeons should adopt universal precautions while performing elective surgery rather than insisting on RTPCR reports.” Suggested wait times· Four weeks for an asymptomatic patient or someone who has recovered from only mild, non-respiratory symptoms · Six weeks for a symptomatic patient (including cough, shortness of breath) who did not require hospitalisation · Eight to 10 weeks for a symptomatic patient who is diabetic, immunocompromised, or was hospitalized with Covid · Twelve weeks for a patient who was admitted to ICU with Covid-19 · No Covid retesting within 102 days · People who’ve recovered from Covid need not take another RT-PCR test to check if they have been reinfected · There is a possibility of a swab test returning a positive result after detecting non-viable remnants of the virus, even after the infection has cleared the system, an ICMR study has clarified · Non-viable virus remnants are dead particles that can no longer infect or transmit the illness · But if one tests positive 102 days after the first Covid episode, it can be considered as a case of new infection, provided there was a negative molecular test in the interim, the ICMR has said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wait-6-weeks-for-surgery-after-covid-says-icmr/articleshow/83101731.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||India||Mehul Choksi no longer an Indian citizen, can’t be sent back, says his lawyer||NEW DELHI: Uncertainty shrouds the fate of absconding diamond dealer Mehul Choksi despite the Indian government having sent officials with legal documents and a special aircraft to Dominica for his deportation directly to India. While the arrival of the long-range business jet, a Bombardier Global 5000, at Dominica’s Doughlas-Charles airport signalled the Centre’s keenness to get Choksi, the challenge for India is to prevent his return to Antigua and Barbuda where, according to the Caribbean nation’s PM Gaston Browne, Choksi enjoys legal and constitutional rights despite his government working to revoke the diamond dealer’s citizenship. While maintaining that Dominica needed to send Choksi directly to India, instead of repatriating him to Antigua, Browne confirmed that Indian authorities had indeed sent an aircraft on May 28 to Dominica where Choksi is in the custody of law enforcement agencies. The Caribbean leader, who is keen to send the alleged fraudster back to India, on Sunday refuted the claim of Choksi's lawyers that he had been abducted and spirited away to Dominica. According to Browne, Choksi had travelled to Dominica with his girlfriend. Sources in Delhi believe authorities in Dominica are ready to cooperate. However, they are wary of the stand of courts in both Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, with Choksi engaging expensive lawyers. Besides, his team has also enlisted, as Browne said, the support of opposition parties in Antigua and Barbuda. The government settled on a Bombardier Global 5000, chartered from Qatar Executive, the charter subsidiary of Qatar Airways, because of the small size of the airport in Dominica. It can handle only small planes capable of doing around 500 miles without having to be refuelled. The Bombardier, in contrast, can fly long distances at a stretch. It flew from Delhi on Thursday afternoon to reach Dominica after 12 hours, with just a refuelling stop in Madrid. Sources said authorities in Delhi wanted to avoid too many stopovers in case they succeeded in getting hold of Choksi. Choksi's lawyer has pleaded before the court, which put his repatriation on hold and will hear the matter again on Wednesday, that he can't be sent back to India as he ceased to be an Indian citizen after having acquired Antiguan citizenship. Significantly for India, Browne also said the issue of Choksi's Antiguan citizenship remained unsettled. "Yes, I can confirm there is a jet there. My understanding is that the Indian government has sent certain documentation from the courts in India to confirm that Choksi is indeed a fugitive and my understanding is that the documentation will be used in the court case that will be heard next Wednesday," Browne told a local news agency. Browne, who has been accused by the opposition of working to deny Choksi his legal rights, also said Choksi had travelled with his girlfriend to Dominica where he was detained on May 26 for illegal entry. Browne has hit back at opposition leaders saying Choksi was financing them. Choksi has claimed through his lawyer that he was abducted by men who sounded Indian and was brought to Dominica. "The information that we are getting is that Mehul Choksi may have taken his girlfriend to Dominica probably to have dinner or have a good time and so on and got caught. That would have been a monumental error because in Antigua, he is a citizen, we could not deport him," Browne said in an interview to a local radio station as reported by Antigua News Room. "The problem is if he is sent back to Antigua because he is an Antiguan citizen, even though his citizenship is unsettled, he still enjoys constitutional and legal protections. We have no doubt that his citizenship will ultimately be revoked because he did not disclose material information," Browne added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehul-choksi-no-longer-an-indian-citizen-cant-be-sent-back-says-his-lawyer/articleshow/83100432.cms||---

The Centre will provide 6 crore doses to states and UTs in June for inoculating those above 45 along with health and frontline workers, whereas an additional 5.8 crore doses will be available for direct procurement by states and private hospitals for the 18-44 age group, the health ministry said. Read AlsoWill be able to manufacture, supply 10 crore Covishield doses in June: Serum Institute to CentreNEW DELHI: Serum Institute of India (SII) has informed the government that it will be able to manufacture and supply nine to 10 crore doses of Covishield in June, official sources said on Sunday amid complaint by states about the shortage of anti-coronavirus vaccine jabs. In a recent letter to UnionMeanwhile, Serum Institute of India (SII) informed the government that it will be able to manufacture and supply 9-10 crore doses of Covishield in June, PTI reported, quoting a letter from the company to home minister Amit Shah. The company had earlier indicated a capacity of 6.5 crore doses in June. Earlier, estimates drawn by the government had suggested around 10 crore doses for June which included 6.5 crore doses of Covishield, 2.5 crore shots of Covaxin and 1 crore of Sputnik. However, the Centre is likely to have revised the earlier estima-tes about availability of vaccine doses in June after taking into account the supplies indicated by SII in its letter to the home ministry. Though the government has not specified the quantity of particular vaccines while indicating 12 crore doses for June, it has earlier said that there is usually a time lag between production and supplies to reach the respective states and vaccination centres. “The delivery schedule for this allocation will be shared in advance,” the health ministry said.

For the month of June, 6.1 crore doses of vaccines will be supplied to states and UTs for vaccination of priority group of healthcare workers, frontline workers and those aged 45 and above as free supply from the central government. In addition, more than 5.8 crore doses will be available for direct procurement by states/UTs and private hospitals. Therefore, in June, close to 12 crore doses will be available for the national Covid vaccination programme. In May, more than 4 crore vaccine doses were made available by the Centre to states. Besides, more than 3.9 crore doses were available for direct procurement by states as well as private hospitals. Overall, 20.8 crore doses of anti-Covid vaccines have been administered across the country since January 16 when the government rolled out the vaccination drive. Around 4.3 crore people had received two doses of vaccines till 10 pm on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-12-crore-doses-covid-fight-to-get-a-shot-in-arm-in-june/articleshow/83101769.cms||---

He is likely to attend several meetings at the secretariat on Monday on cyclone relief and Covid. CM Mamata Banerjee may chair the cyclone relief meeting in which Bandyopadhyay, along with other state secretaries, are expected to attend. Bandyopadhyay reached the secretariat on Sunday evening and spent several hours in his chamber. He drove in at 4.50 pm and left at 7.45 pm. CM Banerjee had on Saturday appealed to the Centre to withdraw the letter asking Bandyopadhyay to report to New Delhi and “allow the chief secretary to work for Covid- and cyclone-affected people. We are working as a team. Allow us to work”. The Centre, sources said, has not responded to the CM’s appeal. On Friday, a letter from the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions reached the secretariat recalling the chief secretary, asking the state government to “relieve Bandyopadhyay with immediate effect” and directed him to report to New Delhi on Monday. Four days before this, on May 24, the Centre had approved a state government request to grant Bandyopadhyay a three-month extension as chief secretary for his role in Covid management and cyclone relief and reconstruction. The Bengal government has not released Bandyopadhyay. Like the Union ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, which is headed by the Prime Minister, CM Banerjee heads the personnel and administrative reforms department in Bengal. On Saturday, Banerjee had referred to Centre’s caveats filed in the Calcutta high court and Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), dubbing them as "one-sided". According to sources, the Bengal government was taking legal opinion on this matter. The central letter cited rule 6(I) of Indian Administrative Service (cadre) rules, 1954, which says, among others, that "provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government will give effect to the decision of the central government". Former chief secretary Basudeb Banerjee felt this order was "illegal". "A rule can’t be interpreted in a piecemeal basis. The first part of the rule mentions that state and the Centre must concur to such a deputation. Should it fail the second part applies. Was any such attempt made by the Centre? Also was his extension as chief secretary for three months cancelled before this recall order was issued?" he argued. It was still not clear till the filing of this report whether Bandyopadhyay, or the additional chief secretary, department of personnel and administrative reforms, Bengal had written to the Centre on the transfer issue. "A formal intimation is likely," a senior officer said, refusing to elaborate and give a timeline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-chief-secretary-alapan-bandyopadhyay-may-not-report-at-north-block-today/articleshow/83101826.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Five women and a man were arrested in Bhopal and Indore in September 2019 for allegedly trapping well-placed people and blackmailing them with objectionable videos. The SIT notice sent to Nath said he had claimed in an online press conference on May 21 that he was in possession of a pen drive/CD of the honeytrap case. The notice went on to state that this “pen drive/CD was extremely important evidence” and it would make the probe more effective and stronger. It added that Nath should be present in his home in Bhopal at 12:30pm on June 2 to record his statement and hand over the pen drive/CD to the SIT. Speaking on the issue in Morena, Nath said he would respond to the notice but added the pen drive was not with him and several journalists were in possession of it and it was being circulated widely in MP. Nath said he was kept informed about the case by the police as he was the CM at that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hand-over-pen-drive-sit-tells-kamal-nath-in-honeytrap-case/articleshow/83101845.cms||---

After announcing ahead of the April 6 Assembly polls that she would stay away from politics, Sasikala said she could not see the party getting ruined due to “infighting”. Though she did not directly mention AIADMK or its leadership, her statement was seen as a pointer to alleged differences between the top two leaders, K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam. In an audio clip of Sasikala’s brief conversation with two of her loyalists over phone she could be heard saying, “we will for sure streamline the party...certainly, I will come.” In a second audio clip, she could be saying that the party, apparently a reference to AIADMK, was built thro-ugh hard work of leaders, including her, and it was anguishing to see “them fighting”. She added that she could not be a mute spectator to the party getting ruined. Sasikala said she would meet supporters soon, after the second wave of coronavirus passes. There would soon be a good decision, she said. This is seen as a hint at resumption of efforts to regain control of AIADMK, which she and her nephew Dhinakaran lost years ago after she was imprisoned in 2017 following conviction in a disproportionate assets case. Palaniswami and Panneerselvam do not reportedly see eye to eye and they have been issuing statements individually on political matters but give joint- statements on party matters. AIADMK spokesperson and state joint secretary of legal wing, R M Babu Murugavel, said, “we have got nothing to with her comments.” “The reference Sasikala was making, including infighting, would have relevance only for the AMMK and and the matter is related to that party alone,” he said. PTI In March this year, Sasikala had said that "she will stay away from politics," but would pray for of Jayalalithaa's "golden rule". Sasikala became AIADMK interim general secretary following Jayalalaithaa's demise in 2016 and this appointment was rescinded at a general council meet in 2017 and it also announced invalidation of all the appointments made by Dhinakaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sasikala-hints-at-return-to-admk-helm/articleshow/83101846.cms||---

The woman, a brick kiln worker, was arrested from Pakki Sarai locality under the Ghogha police station area in Bhagalpur district. She was produced before a Bhagalpur court on Sunday. The court granted transit demand of the woman to the Delhi Police team. Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Gudia said more than Rs 90 lakh was deposited and withdrawn from Sarita’s bank account and another Rs 44 lakh from the bank account of her sister, Pinki Devi. “Several crores of rupees were transacted through bank accounts of Sarita’s three other relatives,” she added. Karanveer Singh, investigation officer of Delhi Police team, said the probe began following a complaint lodged by a Delhi resident, who alleged that he had not received oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir from the “agent” despite paying huge money. “During investigation, we found that huge money was transferred from Delhi to different SBI accounts in Karnataka and Bhagalpur. “Money was mostly withdrawn through ATM cards at various places in Bihar, including Patna,” Singh said, adding the gang running the racket has more than 20 members. Sarita, on the other hand, told mediapersons that she was lured by one Amit Raushan of Ghogha locality to open bank account for illegal transactions. “He also opened bank accounts of five of my close relatives by collecting related documents and promised to pay us a good amount of money per month,” Sarita said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-racket-delhi-cops-nab-woman-from-bhagalpur-village/articleshow/83096163.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Patna||RJD, Cong assail PM Modi’s 7-yr rule||PATNA: Hitting out at the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre on its seventh anniversary, main opposition RJD said on Sunday that the people were at the receiving end during the period. The RJD has put up posters in front of its party office on Beerchand Patel Marg here to recall the ‘miseries’ the people had to face since the NDA government assumed office seven years ago. The posters having a picture of PM Narendra Modi in the middle have the caption, “Modi tere saat saal mein janta huee behal'. They have special mention about skyrocketing price rise, unemployment, privatization of public sector units, hollow promises and lack of medicare in government hospitals at the time of Covid-19 pandemic. Referring to the soaring prices of essential commodities and petroleum products in the country, the posters said that mustard oil (edible oil) was being sold for Rs.200 per kg. Similarly petrol and diesel were sold for Rs.100 and Rs.93 per litre, respectively. People have to shell out Rs.960 for each LPG cylinder. “The government provided LPG connections to the poor under 'Ujjwala Yojna' but the subscribers have to pay Rs.960 for each cylinder. This has exposed the government's policy for the uplift of the poor,” the posters said. The posters ridiculed the hollow promises made by the government to provide job to 2 crore youths every year. Instead, public sector units were being privatized and handed over to the capitalists. The posters mentioned about Railways, BHEL, GAIL and BSNL among others. Taking a swipe at the economic policy of the Union government, the posters said that the 'wrong' economic policy has pushed India to the poorest among the Asian counties. The posters, however, blamed 'the wrong' economic policy for the present economic crisis in the country. Talking about the miseries of the people at the time of pandemic, the posters said that people had to stand in queue for oxygen cylinders to save the lives of one's near and dear ones. More shockingly, they had to wait for hours together at crematorium or burning ghats to perform the last rites. “The long queue that started during demonetization continued till the time of cremation of dead bodies due to Covid,” RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said. The Congress, which is an ally of the RJD, also lashed out at the NDA government at the centre on completion of seven years in office. “People will recall the tenure for the sufferings they have never experienced earlier,” Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma said. BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand, however, said that the able leadership of PM Narendra Modi has taken the country to a new height and established India's supremacy across the globe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-cong-assail-pm-modis-7-yr-rule/articleshow/83096095.cms||Ramashankar

State health minister Mangal Pandey told the newspaper here on Sunday that all the health care centres in the state, both in urban and rural areas, have been directed to make necessary arrangements for proper treatment of people likely to be infected in the third wave. The health department has been making preparations at all levels based on the experiences of the first two waves. “Special arrangements are being made for the treatment of children,” he said. Giving details of the preparations, the minister said special wards for children with necessary facilities are being created in all the hospitals lacking such wards. Facilities of ICUs and ventilators and beds are being strengthened at all the health centres. All the hospitals were recently asked to furnish their requirements of necessary equipment and other medical facilities and their demands have already been received by the health department. The process of acquiring all the required equipment has already started and all the needed materials would be made available to the hospitals soon, Pandey said. The minister further pointed out that cryogenic tanks are being installed in hospitals for continuous supply of oxygen and ventilators are also being made available at all the health centres. BiPAP (bilevel positive air pressure) machines for children are being installed at all the paediatric intensive care units (PICU), neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and special newborn care units (SNCUs) in children wards of health centres. Besides, essential medicines would be made available in all the health centres in rural and urban areas of the state, he said. The minister said steps have already been initiated by the health department to appoint a sufficient number of doctors and paramedical staff in various hospitals and health care centres. The process of appointment of doctors and nurses in different hospitals has already been started and all the appointments are likely to be finalized soon, he said. The minister asserted that the government is leaving no stone unturned for strengthening the health care infrastructure with a view to protecting the lives of its people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-making-preparations-for-third-wave/articleshow/83094468.cms||B K Mishra

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vaccination drive picks up pace on weekend||KOLKATA: Close to 1.3 lakh Covid vaccine doses were administered across the state on Sunday, giving an impetus to the inoculation drive that had slowed down due to paucity of vials. Along with the state buying more than 10 lakh doses between the second and third weeks of May, Bengal also got a few shipments from the government of India (GoI). In fact, on Sunday, Bengal received a little over 2.6 lakh Covishield doses from GoI. Due to the shortage of vaccines, the inoculation drive had hit a speed breaker since the end of April. Rationing of supply led to most Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) remaining closed on Sundays over the past few weeks. Now, with many private hospitals getting their own vaccines, things have changed. On Sunday, 1,160 private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) were open apart from 1,117 government ones. “We had been administering close to 5 lakh doses a day from March till the beginning of April. But we had to go slow as the supply became scanty. Now, with the state buying vials, the central government supply resuming and private hospitals getting their orders, our drive will regain speed,” said a health department official. Under pressure to ramp up the drive at its urban primary health centres (UPHC) across the city, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has started strengthening its health department infrastructure at the ward level. From a mere 30 UPHCs two-and-a-half months ago, the vaccination drive has now spread to 150 centres. Of these, around 140 are at KMC’s UPHCs. The rest are at community halls, schools and other public buildings. Recently, the KMC health department recruited 450 paramedics to serve more recipients. After training, these paramedics have been engaged at KMC-run CVCs across 144 wards, said a civic health department official. “We had to recruit paramedics as the number of existing staffers was grossly inadequate for the growing demand of Covid vaccination at UPHCs,” said a KMC health department official. According to the official, demand was growing particularly in added areas like Behala, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Kasba, Garfa and large areas off EM Bypass. Around 2,000 doses were administered every day in March, said a KMC official. Civic doctors and paramedics are now arranging for around 10,000 doses daily. The numbers are likely to go up further as the civic body resumed administering the first dose of Covishield to senior citizens (60+ group) and the 45+ group at its 108 vaccination centres this week. The KMC is also administering the second dose of Covaxin at its 44 UPHCs. This apart, the civic doctors and paramedics are also engaged in fulfilling vaccination needs of Covid-priority groups at over 100 centres. Transport workers, vegetable sellers, fish vendors, hawkers, grocers and sex workers form the bulk of the Covid priority group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-drive-picks-up-pace-on-weekend/articleshow/83096383.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat leads vax drive with 18% getting first dose||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat till Sunday evening vaccinated 1.27 crore persons for the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine while 41.12 lakh had got the second dose. Only eight states including Gujarat have so far vaccinated more than 1 crore population cumulatively. Out of this, six have achieved vaccination of 1 crore plus for the first dose. Out of these states, Gujarat has covered the maximum population at 18.7% with the first dose – considering the population estimate for the state at 6.8 crore. Rajasthan and Karnataka rank number two and three with 17.9% and 16.2% coverage of population. It’s to be mentioned that the population estimates also cover 0-18 years for whom the vaccination has not started yet. Likewise, analysis of the second shot – completing the two-dose vaccine for both Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines administered so far – among the states with 1 crore-plus vaccines reveal that Gujarat ranked second with 32.2% behind West Bengal’s coverage of 36.8% of those who have already taken the first dose. In all, only 6% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated. According to experts, the number needs to grow much higher to shield the population against the possible third wave. In fact, month-on-month analysis revealed that the daily vaccination in April was 1.58 lakh, which came down to 1.02 lakh in 30 days of May – a drop of 35.5%. Due to an increase in the gap between two shots, the average daily vaccination for the second shot remained the same at 57,000 in April and May. Senior state health department officials said that the focus remains on vaccinating the working population. “The sessions for the younger population are being increased – the last one week was focused on inoculating the 18-44 years population. While the 45 years-plus population is getting vaccines in on-the-spot registrations, it has not yet begun for the state for the younger population,” said an official, adding that the inventory for both the sessions is kept separately. “The CoWIN registration requirement would continue for the 18-44 years for now.” Experts stressed on expanding inoculations in the rural areas where the coverage is comparatively lower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-leads-vax-drive-with-18-getting-first-dose/articleshow/83097079.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: After fungi, bacteria preying on Covid-recovered patients||RAJKOT/VADODARA/ SURAT/AHMEDABAD: First the virus, then fungi and now bacteria. Recovering from Covid-19 doesn’t seem to be a relief as doctors across the state are now reporting rising cases of several bacterial infections. Doctors across Gujarat are getting cases of patients with infections caused by bacteria like pseudomonas, klebsiella and acinetobacter, which are mostly causing secondary lung infections 20-25 days post recovery and in some cases, even after 40 days. “I am treating four patients with post-Covid secondary lung infection. Those patients who were prescribed immunosuppressant drugs during Covid, have co-morbid conditions or existing lung-ailments are vulnerable to bacterial and fungus infections,” said Dr Jayesh Dobariya, Rajkot-based critical care specialist. Pulmonologist Dr Milan Bhanderi explained, “We had seen this kind of bacterial infection in post-swine flu cases when patients were developing secondary lung infection within 8-10 days, but now we are diagnosing people with similar condition even 30 days after Covid recovery.” Much like mucormycosis (black fungus), Covid patients with uncontrolled blood sugar, low immunity caused by steroids, other medications or exisiting ailments, are more susceptible to bacterial infections. Vadodara-based infectious disease specialist Dr Hiten Kareliya said, “We are seeing bacterial infections in lungs, urine and blood in Covid-19 recovered patients. Some patients are developing these infections even while they are hospitalized.” “Predominance of gram-negative pathogens could be due to the invasive device-associated infections during hospitalization due to mechanical ventilation and central venous catheter implantation in these patients,” said Interventional pulmonologist Dr Amit Dave . Dr Maharshi Desai, Ahmedabad-based critical care specialist and member of state-appointed Covid task force, said that there are two categories of patients that come with fungal or bacterial infection. “The first category is of patients who are still in hospital but are technically non-Covid with negative RT-PCR. Another category is those already discharged and come back to the hospital with infections. In both these categories, we see infections due to weakened immune systems,” he said. A majority of these patients already have an underlying illness such as diabetes or a heart ailment among others, said infectious diseases specialist Dr Swati Gohel. “While occurrence of such infections is more among serious patients with prolonged hospitalization and age factor, we are also seeing a rise in infection among young patients with no history of oxygen dependency or steroids. This is pointing towards Covid’s role in attacking the body's immune system,” she said. “In ICU there are more invasive procedures and use of steroids which causes the secondary infection,” said Dr Samir Gami, Surat-based pulmonologist, adding that fatality due to secondary infection is high as multiple organs like lungs, kidneys, liver and heart get affected.

India’s wearable market touched highest-ever first quarter shipment numbers in January-March. With a shipment size of 11.4 million units and 170% year-on-year (YoY) growth, wearables touched record highs owing to a strong momentum in the watch and earwear categories, according to data from IDC. The watches segment alone grew 463% YoY in the quarter to become the fastest-growing category in wearables, replacing the leadership position occupied by earwear devices in the previous quarters. The earwear category grew 209% YoY with 9.3 million shipments. Analysts said the pandemic has led to the industry accelerating innovation and average selling price is also declining with more Indian makers entering the fray. Features to track health metrics in wrist wearables and truly wireless earwear devices are focus areas, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wearable-devices-log-record-growth-of-170-in-march-qtr/articleshow/83098910.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Chairing a high-level meeting to review the state government’s preparedness for floods in the wake of numerous suggestions received from different MPs, MLAs and MLCs, through videoconferencing from ‘Sankalp’ hall at his residence, Nitish said his government’s top priority is to provide necessary assistance and security to the affected people during the floods. He said the suggestions provided by the elected representatives should be kept in mind while executing the ant-erosion and flood fighting works in the respective regions. The CM said four departments – water resources department (WRD), minor water resources department (MWRD), rural works department (RWD) and road construction department (RCD) – held division-wise meetings with the respective MPs, MLAs and MLCs through videoconferencing from May 13 to 21 to seek their suggestions on the flood fighting works. He said the people’s representatives gave very valuable suggestions on the flood fighting works in those meetings. “The suggestions provided by the people’s representatives will help the departments in formulating their future schemes for flood protection,” Nitish said and asked the officials of all four departments to keep in mind the suggestions provided by MPs, MLAs and MLCs while finalising the flood protection schemes of their respective regions/constituencies. He also asked the officials to ensure restoration of all damaged roads, bridges and culverts by June 15 on a priority basis. “Also ensure proper maintenance of all roads and bridges,” the CM said, adding quality of works should also be maintained. He asked the WRD officials to complete the heightening and strengthening works of different embankments before the arrival of monsoon in the state. “All the ongoing anti-erosion and flood protection works should be completed soon,” Nitish told the officials. The CM further asked the RCD and the RWD officials to keep a special vigil on all roads crossing through the flood-affected areas. The officials were also asked to launch a special drive to clean all bridges and culverts before the arrival of monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-repair-roads-bridges-by-june-15/articleshow/83096267.cms||Madan Kumar

Since Friday police have nabbed four persons from Vadodara who were practising as doctors without having a medical degree. The police said that they had received a tip-off after which the three quacks were arrested. Cops along with Dabhoi’s medical officer raided Dr A S Saheb’s clinic in Hiraji na Tekra when the doctor was examining patients. “We asked him to show us his medical degree but he didn’t have any. After further questioning, Sheikh admitted that he never pursued any medical course,” the police said. Sheikh told the cops that he had studied only till Xth standard at his home town in Andhra Pradesh. He moved to Gujarat some 10 years ago and has been practising as a doctor in Dabhoi since then. Sheikh used to examine patients and also prescribe medicines. The cops seized several tablets from his bogus clinic. In another case, Shankar Vishwas was arrested from his clinic in Dabhoi Nagarpalika Shopping Centre. Vishwas told the police that he was practising as a doctor for the last 15 years without having any medical degree. He had studied only up to Class 12th in West Bengal. The investigators seized several tablets from his clinic. A resident of Itola village on the outskirts of the city was also found practicing as an allopathic doctor without having the requisite medical degree. The SOG sleuths arrested Hariram Kushwaha, who is a native of Madhya Pradesh. Hariram was running an illegal clinic in Itola for the last one year. He told the cops that he had undergone training in homeopathy in MP. An offence was registered against him in Varnama police station. The cops said that they are now investigating if any person had suffered from adverse effects due to the medicines prescribed by the accused trio. On May 28, the prevention of crime branch (PCB) had arrested quack doctor Sushant Kumar Roy. Roy, a native of West Bengal, had shifted to the city about 20 years ago and began treating people in Nandesari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/quacks-fleecing-people-with-impunity/articleshow/83095066.cms||---

In the five fiscals through 2019, bicycle sales volumes logged a modest compound annual growth rate of around 5%. In FY20, it contracted a massive 22% as government purchases — standard bicycles for various welfare schemes — plunged and a large bicycle manufacturer downed shutters. However, the previous fiscal saw a turn for the better. The industry is classified into four segments — standard, premium, kids and exports. The pandemic has spurred the demand for cycles as fitness and leisure accessory causing a significant shift in bicycle sales. The premium and kids bicycles have seen their share rise from 40% to over 50%, while the ubiquitous commuter roadsters have shrunk to 36%, said Nitesh Jain of Crisil. The Covid-triggered demand for fitness and kids bicycles has led to the cycle industry all set to hit 1.45 crore units this year, up from 1.2 crore units in FY21. “The pandemic induced constraints on fitness and leisure options increased the demand for bicycles especially in the premium and kids segments. Strong demand in these restricted the overall decline in sales volumes to just 5% in FY21 despite further reduction in government purchases of standard cycles. Given the ongoing second wave, there should be a 22% jump in sales in premium and kids segments,” said Jain. Pankaj Munjal, CMD of cycle market leader Hero Cycles says the pandemic has induced a push towards a cycling culture. The need to avoid public spaces, shopping malls, gyms has led people to adopt cycling for leisure and fitness as families and friends bond over cycling trips. “Ever since the pandemic broke out, the demand for premium bikes has soared in urban India both in metros as well as Tier II & III cities,” he said. “With a culture of biking for fitness, health and recreation catching up Indian bicycle industry is witnessing soaring growth,” he added. Nor is this restricted to the organised sector alone given that one third of all cycle sales are from unorganised companies. “In FY21 the combined organised and unorganised sector sales were 18.37 million units which will hit 22 million (2.2 crore units) due to retail sales on health and environmental considerations. It will be a 20% increase over FY21,” agreed K B Thakur, secretary general of All India Cycle Manufacturers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/bikes/fitness-freaks-pedal-a-shift-in-cycle-market/articleshow/83098800.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

In a study of over 100 family-owned businesses by Executive Access India, conducted exclusively for TOI, 64% companies said they are optimistic in their outlook for the current financial year. A majority (51%) of such businesses see opportunities for growth in the domestic market with the focus on expansions, while 22% are contemplating diversification and 10% looking at growing business overseas. Executive Access India MD Ronesh Puri said, “Indian family businesses feel the Covid crisis will soon pass as vaccination gains steam. They are more optimistic (64%) and feel Indian businesses have huge resilience and are quick to adapt. They feel supply chain constraints are temporary and will not impact business as there has been huge learning on the same since last year.” Nevertheless, there is unpredictability about the near future and 79% of the companies surveyed felt this could be the biggest pain point. Emami Group’s director Aditya Agarwal said, “I do believe that the inherent instinct for survival is very strong in Indian family businesses. The business is an essential part of the family and they will do whatever it takes to sustain it, even if it means working doubly hard for small earnings.” According to the study, cash crunch, which was a big constraint last year, does not appear to be a major concern this year with only 9% of the responding companies terming it is as a worry, even though economic uncertainty is the top challenge mentioned by 68% of the respondents. In the advertising and marketing sector, however, 50% respondents see cash crunch as a pain point in FY22. Irrespective of this concern, advertising and marketing players said they want to expand their business in India and oversees. Gautami Gavankar, CEO - Estate Planning & Trusteeship and Head - Family Office at Kotak Mahindra Group, said family business owners have realised the importance of liquidity, personal wealth and planning a safety pot during these tough times. Many family businesses have either set up family offices to manage their investment portfolio and other needs, or are taking steps to set up appropriate structures to take care of family requirements. “In our interactions with family businesses, we find that many of them are taking proactive steps to perpetuate the family business in this time of uncertainty. These include planning with respect to business succession versus ownership succession, preparing the next generation to run the business, creating safety pots, etc. Family businesses are putting a plan in place through a combination of instruments such as a will, trust, family charter, shareholding agreements, etc. These are all steps in the right direction and would help family businesses navigate these unpredictable times,” said Gavankar. Leveraging technology continues to be the top priority for 61% of the companies. “While the family businesses are quite strong in most areas, the pandemic has made it necessary for these to evolve with the dynamic environment and focus on digitisation. Additionally, family businesses should also fortify their role in the matters of ESG (environment, social and governance). These are key steps to strengthen and grow the existing business,” said Agarwal. In this atmosphere, while hiring talent, the top priority for companies is the competency of the candidate (56%) and cultural fitment (30%). These beat traditional priorities like track record and educational qualifications of the individual. “India Inc feels that in these challenging times, it is even more important to hire the best talent as demands and expectations from candidates have grossly increased. They need candidates to hit the ground running, fast. In the talent-hiring process, low energy (36%) and arrogance (33%) seem to be the biggest put-offs for employers. It is an action-oriented world with far more emphasis on teamwork and hence much less tolerance for arrogance,” said Puri. On future plans, almost all companies in the real estate sector, and 50% in automotive and logistics sectors, said they would cut costs this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/most-family-owned-cos-remain-bullish-on-fy22/articleshow/83098847.cms||Namrata Singh

Appreciating his work during the second wave of the pandemic, the PM said that when a tanker driver reaches a hospital with oxygen, he comes across as a godsent messenger. “We can understand the magnitude of responsibility involved in such work…and the resultant mental pressure one undergoes,” said the PM. “We are seeing how the country is fighting against Covid-19 with all her might. This has been the biggest pandemic in the last 100 years and during this very pandemic India has confronted many a natural disaster with fortitude,” he said adding, “We’ve seen in the days gone by how our doctors, nurses and frontline warriors have toiled day and night without bothering about themselves, and continue to do so. Amidst all this, there indeed are people who’ve played a major role in the fight against the second wave of Corona”. The PM said that when the second wave came, the demand for oxygen surged all of a sudden. This was a very big challenge, as delivering medical oxygen to remote parts of the country was indeed a huge task. If an oxygen tanker moves fast, the slightest error can lead to the risk of a big explosion. Many plants manufacturing industrial oxygen are located in the eastern parts of the country. Transporting oxygen from there to other states of the country requires many days. In confronting this challenge, the country was helped by cryogenic tanker drivers, the Oxygen Express and Air Force pilots. Many such people worked on a war-footing, saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Dinesh is one of such tanker drivers. The father of a son and two daughters, Dinesh has been driving an oxygen tanker for 15-17 years. Appreciating his work, the PM said that he is not just a truck driver, he is engaged in saving the lives of lakhs of people. Replying to the PM’s query, Dinesh said, “Wherever we deliver oxygen, it gives us a lot of happiness. For us, it’s just that we are fulfilling our duty. If delivering oxygen on time gives life to someone, it is a matter of great honour for us”. The PM also asked about his family members and the study of his kids. He also appreciated him for staying away from his family for months, just to ensure that people’s lives are saved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-converses-with-o2-tanker-driver-from-jaunpur/articleshow/83094899.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Sangam city consumed 26 metric tonnes of oxygen during the peak of second Covid wave||PRAYAGRAJ: An analysis of the health department revealed that the average consumption of medical oxygen in Sangam city during the peak of second Covid wave was 26 metric tonnes. The district witnessed a drastic rise in the number of Covid cases between April 6 and 17, and registered the highest number of daily cases (2,436) on April 17. Analysis also revealed that the average consumption of oxygen in the past 10 days of this month was 16 metric tonnes, and the average availability of oxygen in the city was around 50 metric tonnes. There was a surplus availability of around 34 metric tonnes of oxygen in the past 10 days. Officials of the health department had conducted a detailed study on the supply, consumption and demand of oxygen during the second Covid wave, and found out that oxygen was available in surplus amounts in the city. Currently, the city has nine oxygen plants. Officials said that the number of Covid positive cases had crossed the 1,500 mark on April 10 when the city recorded 1,682 cases. On April 15, as many as 2,324 new cases were recorded. The caseload remained between 2,000 and 2,300 from April 15 to 25. The daily count of fresh cases started declining thereafter. Only 1,874 cases were recorded on April 25. The caseload came down below 1,500 and 1,000 on April 28 and May 2 respectively. However, there was already ample oxygen available at all 20 Covid hospitals in the city. Figures revealed that Covid cases slipped below 500 on May 7 and that the numbers further declined below 200 on May 14. On May 19, only 96 cases were recorded. Moreover, the graph of cases came down to less than 50 on May 25. Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer Dr Rishi Sahai told TOI that there has always been surplus availability of oxygen in Prayagraj when the second Covid wave touched its peak. He added that the average consumption of oxygen was recorded as 26 metric tonnes, while the average availability of oxygen in the city was 50 metric tonnes. Dr. Sahai also claimed that there has never been a dearth of oxygen concentrators and ventilators in the city. The city currently has 227 operational concentrators and 326 operational ventilators, he added. Officials of the health department revealed that the average consumption of oxygen during the Covid peak in neighbouring Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi was was 0.4, 1.5 and 0.7 metric tonnes respectively. The average availability of oxygen in these districts stood at 0.5, 16.4 and 0.9 metric tonnes respectively. As per the analysis, the average consumption of oxygen in Prayagraj district was much higher as compared to the neighbouring districts. The availability of oxygen concentrators in Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi was 97, 62 and 60 respectively, while the number of ventilators in these districts was 25, 39 and11 respectively. Moreover, Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi have a total of 45, 42, 36 and 25 ambulances respectively, and 31, 30, 23 and 11 of them were converted into Covid-dedicated ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sangam-city-consumed-26-metric-tonnes-of-oxygen-during-the-peak-of-second-covid-wave/articleshow/83093719.cms||---

With people not turning up at the blood banks for donation, most hospitals are running short of blood. Thalassaemia is a blood disorder that causes the body to have less haemoglobin than normal and patients require blood transfusion after every 15- 20 days. Low turnout at blood donation camps has also affected the stock in blood banks and hospitals. Most blood banks in the state supply blood on a replacement basis. However, as per the guideline, thalassaemia patients should be given blood without replacement. A five-year-old boy from Muzaffarpur’s Musahri block has received more than 400 units of blood since he was 19-month-old. It was not easy for his family to arrange blood during the lockdown period when people are scared to donate blood. The child’s father, Rohit Gupta (34), said his son had received the blood (AB+) on May 10 and required another transfusion of blood. However, he was finding it difficult to arrange the donor. “People are not ready to donate blood as the blood banks are asking for the negative Covid report. Despite possessing a thalassaemia card, I never get blood without donating blood. The government-run blood banks always turned us away, saying that they don’t have blood for this group,” Gupta said. Praveen Jain from Saran, who was also finding it difficult to arrange blood for his six-year-old son, said, “Ever since the imposition of lockdown, it has become difficult to get blood as donors are scared. After moving from pillar to post for 4-5 days, I finally managed the A+ blood for my son.” A social worker in Patna, Mukesh Hissariya, who is working for thalassaemia patients, said blood donation has been hampered due to lockdown, affecting the patients suffering from blood disorder. “There has been scarcity of different blood groups, including A+, A-, O- and AB. Those who need blood can contact on my number 9308393446,” he said. Hissariya added, “Maximum number of patients suffering from thalassaemia is in Purnia district, where the donation camps were discontinued due to the lockdown.’ Purnia DM Rahul Kumar on Sunday donated blood and made an appeal to the people to do the same and save lives of people. “Covid has affected supply of blood in hospitals seriously and thalassaemia patients who need regular blood transfusion are in dire need. Please donate blood and save lives (sic),” the DM tweeted. Prashant Kumar from Purnia, whose 11-year-old daughter need blood transfusion after 15 days, faced many hurdles to get AB+ blood. “The private operator asked for blood donation in lieu of required blood. Besides, they also take cash up t0 Rs 3,000. Sone parents, whose kids are suffering from thalassaemia, have formed a group to help each other. So far, 20 kids have died in Purnia since last year’s lockdown due to scarcity of blood. At least 138 are suffering from this disease,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thalassaemia-patients-suffer-as-shortage-hits-state-blood-banks/articleshow/83094327.cms||Faryal Rumi

The lack of anti-fungal injection has prompted doctors at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) to use alternate drugs. The two hospitals have been selected as centres of excellence for treatment of black fungus by the state government. The cases of mucormycosis are seen in Covid positive and post-Covid patients and those who received high doses of steroids and were on oxygen support during their Covid treatment. Around 10-15 patients turn up on an average per day for the treatment of black fungus at hospitals here. According to doctors, 5-7 vials (each vial is of 50mg) a day of the drug are required to be administered to a patient for at least 10-12 days. But the drug’s shortage is creating problems for patients and medical facilities. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-P, said 40 patients infected with black fungus need 5-7 vials of injection per day at the hospital depending on their weight. “Based on their medical condition, biopsy report and surgery debridement (process of medically removing the infected tissue from the body), the doctors administer the Amphotericin-B injections to them,” he said. “The stock of Amphotericin-B injections being given by the health department finished on May 28. No injection has been given to patients since Saturday. The daily requirement of the injection at AIIMS-P is 500 vials. In view of unavailability of the injection, the doctors are using alternate medicine such as Caspofungin and Posaconazole of different companies, which are less effective,” Dr Sanjeev said. At AIIMS-P, the number of mucormycosis patients has risen to 70. Of them, 16 were discharged and four died. The number of black fungus patients at IGIMS rose to 105. Of them, at least 90% needed Amphotericin-B injection. Dr Krishna Gopal, assistant professor, general surgery at IGIMS, said they had sent their requirement of 3,000 vials of Amphotericin-B injection to the state government on May 26, but received just 350 vials on Friday. “The fresh stock of vials was used on the same day. Due to non-availability of injection, the treatment of patients with black fungus has been disrupted at IGIMS,” he said. The IGIMS has so far received 2,150 vials of injection from the state government this month. According to doctors at IGIMS, around 90 mucormycosis patients need 250 milligram of doses per day to recover from the infection. In view of scarcity of anti-fungal injection, the hospitals are now asking the patients’ kin to arrange the drug. One Rakesh Kumar Giri, whose father was admitted at AIIMS-P with black fungus and went through a surgery on May 22, said the hospital staff told him to arrange the injection which is not available in market. Sudha Goswami, who was also trying to get the injection for one of her family members, said it was not available at any medicine store in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mucormycosis-city-hospitals-run-out-of-amphotericin-b-injection/articleshow/83094291.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar, Jharkhand among country’s lightning hotspots||PATNA: An idiom which was perhaps coined in 18th century to denote surprise, has come to stay as a grim reminder of vagaries of nature as lightning strike has become a lurking threat to outdoor activities, particularly for the farming community in the country. Lightning is the most impressive, commonly experienced geophysical phenomenon, producing the brightest light and the loudest sound commonly occurring on the Earth. There are approximately 30 to 100 cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning discharges per second worldwide; that translates roughly to 9 million discharges per day worldwide. If we look at the genesis of the lightning strike, thunderstorm formed due to convective heating are the main source of lightning. In the process of vertical growth of thunderstorm, a strong turbulent motion sets in inside the cloud in which the meteors like raindrops, grauple, hail keep on colliding with each other as they move up and down and gain weight eventually to fall out of the thunderstorm in the form of rain or hail. In the process, different sets of particles acquire negative or positive charge through charge separation. As a result of this complex distribution and redistribution process, few charge centres are formed within the thunder cloud. Considering that average height of the cloud in our region varies between eight to twelve kilometres and the electric field created due to process of charge separation can have any value between five kilo volt per meter to twenty-five kilovolts per meter, the actual voltage difference within the cloud and between cloud and ground can be of the order of 100k volts with current value exceeding one thousand amperes. The enormity of this powerhouse can be judged from the fact that most of our domestic application operate at 240 volts and draw a current of 5 to 15 amperes. A typical small thunderstorm system can produce lightning flash to ground every 20-30 seconds for 40-60 minutes which is their active life span and may affect an area within the radius between 6 and 10km. Globally, 85% to 90% of lightning occurs over land because solar radiation heats land faster, causing convection (thunderstorms) to be taller and stronger. This makes entire India venerable to lightning strike, but considering the fact that lightning is essentially a product of thunderstorm, so central and eastern parts of the country, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and adjoining areas of Bangladesh are the thunderstorm or lightning hotspots. Pre-monsoon session starting from March till the onset of monsoon rain is the most venerable period for lightning in the country. During last two decades, over 2000 people have reportedly died each year due to lightning across India, with the figure touching a high of 3,000 in 2016. In context of Bihar, the situation is equally grim, with annual lightning related death varying between 150 and 400. Year 2020 was particularly harsh for the state with over 459 lightning deaths, out of which around 98 deaths took place one single day on June 25,. Field survey of the affected areas have revealed that in majority of cases, people take shelter underneath big, tall tree to avoid rain, but in the process become victim of lightning strike. In only less than 10% of the cases, the lightning directly strikes an animal or human being, In most frequently occurring scenario, lightning strikes a nearby object or ground and then travels as ground current to a nearby person. When moving inside a concrete structure is not feasible, it is advised to move to a drier ground and sit in squatting position, keeping both the feet together which ensures that the voltage level between the two feet is same which makes the flow of current inside the body improbable. Wearing a thick sole boot and covering the head provides with another layer of protection from lightning strike. Sudden death following a lightning strike is mostly due to simultaneous cardiac and respiratory arrest. Therefore, like all other cases of cardiac arrest, lightning-affected person may survive if medical assistance is provided within stipulated period. With an elaborate network of ground and space-based observations, meteorological agencies are able to identify the areas of potential formation of such thunderstorm. For a wider outreach, these services have been made available free of cost through mobile apps like DAMINI of ministry of earth sciences and INDRA VAJRA of Bihar government. At the end of the day, we have to remember that we cannot control the nature, but we can always adapt and equip ourselves to face it safely.

Scientific researchers working in the Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases in the USA have offered support to the laboratories in India on humanitarian grounds by deciding to provide “extraordinary methodology” that has been developed by them and unveiled as ‘Saliva-Direct’ test. The Yale University was made aware of surge in Covid-19 cases in the eastern region of Bihar through ‘Friends of Bhagalpur’ working in the USA. Dr Anne Wyllie, associate research scientist at YSPH, told this newspaper that they have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which uses ‘saliva’ and has received emergency use authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration in the USA. “They are looking to work with laboratories that might find ‘Saliva-Direct’ test protocol useful. We are on a public health mission and everything we are doing is for free and for humanity,” she added. Dr Wyllie said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has expressed interest in this connection. Elaborating on the test protocol, she said it is simplified saliva-based diagnostic test that doesn’t require collection tubes with preservatives and has replaced the nucleic acid extraction with a simple enzymatic and heating step. “Saliva-based Covid test is designed to detect nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. This approach enables laboratories to utilise their existing infrastructure and improve test implementation time. It requires limited investment to start mass Covid test based on this technology,” she added. Dr Robby Sikka from the USA, who has been working closely with Dr Wyllie on saliva-based Covid test, said the process is aimed at helping the people across the globe by ensuring screening at an affordable cost. Melinee D’silva, a research scientist at New York Medical College (USA), said they are trying to reach out to the laboratories in India as well as the one at the JLNMCH in Bhagalpur in order to serve the humanity and save precious human lives. JLNMCH principal Dr Hemant Kumar Sinha said they have received an email from Dr Wyllie. “We will soon seek permission from the state government in this regard,” Dr Sinha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yale-university-offers-expertise-to-jlnmch-for-saliva-based-cov-test/articleshow/83097700.cms||Kumar Rajesh

SHO of Jhajha police station Srikant Kumar said Toofani’s daughter, Gudiya Kumari (16), and the boy, Kundan Kumar (18), were cousins and lived in the same village. He said the duo had gone missing on March 11. Their bodies were found floating in Nakti dam under Jhajha police station on March 14. “Families of both sides were convinced that the duo had committed suicide. However, police recently received post-mortem reports of both bodies and it became clear that they were murdered,” the SHO added. “Further investigations revealed names of Toofani and five of his relatives , who hatched a conspiracy to kill the duo,” he said. Jamui SP Pramod Kumar Mandal said police had suspected foul play after the recovery of the bodies, but waiting for concrete evidence. “It later became clear the girl and the boy were strangled to death and their bodies were later thrown into the dam,” the SP said, adding raids were on to arrest other family members of the girl involved in the killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jamui-man-held-for-killing-minor-daughter-nephew/articleshow/83096038.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Weekend witnesses more pleasure outings, cop challans & vehicle seizures||KOLKATA: Vehicle seizures and prosecutions over Saturday and Sunday indicate a growing tendency to flout restriction norms, especially during the weekends. Kolkata traffic police seized 1,158 vehicles on Saturday — the highest on a single day since restrictions began on May 16. According to Kolkata Police, close to 62% of all vehicle seizures have taken place between Friday evening and Sunday, when the pressure on the roads should have been the least due to the enhanced restrictions. However, pleasure outings or car trips for no other reason than leaving the house seemed to have increased significantly over the weekend. A comparative analysis of weekends confirms this tendency. On the weekend between May 21 and 23, a total of 2,403 vehicles were seized — 979 on Friday, 923 on Saturday and 501 on Sunday. This weekend, between May 28 and 30, the seizures, cops said, are expected to cross 2,200 by the end of Sunday. While 406 vehicles were seized on Friday, 1,158 were seized on Saturday. Till Sunday noon, 417 vehicles had been seized. There have been 1,981 seizures this weekend since last reports came in. In all, about 4,384 vehicles have been seized over extended weekends — Friday to Sunday. “Of the 7,486 vehicles seized so far, that is close to 59% of all seizures. Add to it the 269 seizures on May 16, a Sunday and the first day of the restrictions, and that is almost more than 62% of all the seizures made by us in the past 15 days,” said an officer. Individual traffic guards said that a few nakas among the 30-odd set up in the city each day witness almost double to triple the number of seizures on a weekend compared to a weekday. One such naka is on the Howrah bridge. “The only explanation is that these vehicle owners probably believe that police vigil will be lax on holidays. They may also think weekends are ideal for car rides,” said an ACP. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said that they have now asked cops on the road to carry out special checks. “We have asked our men to check all vehicles. It is important that the norms are followed every day for effective tackling of Covid,” said an officer. Local cops said a stronger naka in the morning is required to send out a strong signal. “After the special checks at night — till 1am — to implement the special night restrictions, it is not always possible to hold early morning checks. The lacuna is visible between 8am and 9am when cars and bikes enter the city’s central area virtually unchecked. This is added to the number of vehicles going out in the morning,” said an ACP. Cops also said that areas with a number of lanes and bylanes offer two-wheeler riders the perfect scope to skip police naka checks in areas like Shyambazar or Bhowanipore. “The central business district is well marked and usually has a cop presence everywhere. It is not easy to skip surveillance here,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-witnesses-more-pleasure-outings-cop-challans-vehicle-seizures/articleshow/83096417.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: As cases dip, private hospitals lower tariffs, offer discounts in Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: Corporate and private hospitals in the city have switched up their strategy with the decline in Covid-19 cases. Many hospitals that collected exorbitant charges for ventilator and oxygen beds have now reduced tariffs to fill beds. The number of Covid-19 cases in Krishna district started to resuce over the last ten days following measures taken by the district administration and the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC). The district is registering around 700 Covid-19 cases on average every day. This has meant that the rush at hospitals has lessened. Around 18 per cent of beds at government hospitals and 80 per cent of beds at Covid care centres are vacant. Corporate and private hospitals in the city have also seen a corresponding dip in patient footfall. In a bid to attract the patients, many hospitals have deployed marketing staff to get in touch with patients who had consulted them through outpatient services and are attempting to convince them to get themselves admitted for better treatment. “We have consulted a pulmonologist at a reputed corporate hospital in the city and from the next day we started receiving calls from the hospital offering beds. They even offered discounts on bed charges,” M Lakshman, a private teacher residing at Madhuranagar and who recently contracted Covid-19, told TOI. Many corporate hospitals are also gathering the data of Covid-19 patients from laboratories and contacting them. “We tested positive for Covid-19 and had it confirmed through an RT-PCR test at a private laboratory. No one except our family knows that we are sick. But we are getting calls from the hospitals repeatedly enquiring about our health condition and offering ICU and oxygen beds,” a resident of Nidamanuru said. Interestingly, many residents said they preferred government hospitals over corporate institutions and had also utilised the teleconsultation service provided by 104 helpline and other voluntary organisations. Some hospitals have deployed marketing staff to get in touch with patients and attempt to convince them to get themselves admitted for better treatment||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/as-cases-dip-private-hospitals-lower-tariffs-offer-discounts/articleshow/83095073.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: No Bada Mangal festivities this year,temples to livestream ‘aarti’, rituals||LUCKNOW: City temples dedicated to Lord Hanuman have decided not to have festivities on Bada Mangal in view of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and safety protocols. Like last year, people will be able to witness live-streaming of the puja organised by various temples. This year, there are four auspicious Tuesdays – June 1, June 8, June 15 and June 22 – on which Bada Mangal will be celebrated. Temples will remain closed for devotees on the first Bada Mangal on June 1. Temple administrations will decide about the remaining Tuesdays later. The festival, believed to be 400 years’ old, is mainly celebrated in Lucknow and a few other places in Uttar Pradesh. Bada Mangal is observed on all Tuesdays of the Jyestha month of the Hindu calendar. Said to be the first temple of UP where Bada Mangal celebrations began, the Aliganj-based Naya Hanuman Mandir receives over 50,000 devotees on Bada Mangal. A grand fair is organised outside the temple which is visited by people from across the state. However, no such fair will be organised this year. “It is believed that Bada Mangal festivity began after the city was hit by a plague many decades ago. Those who were inside the temple at that time were safe. Since managing huge crowd of devotees and maintaining social distancing is a tedious task, the temple will remain closed. We are making arrangements for virtual ‘darshan’ for devotees,” said Anil Tiwari of Aliganj Shri Mahaveer ji Trust of Naya Hanuman Mandir. “The day is not only dedicated to Lord Hanuman but also reflects Hindu-Muslim amity. Members of both the communities to celebrate the auspicious day together,” he added. Other temples like Hanuman Setu, Dakshin Mukhi Hanuman Temple, and Panchmukhi Hanuman Temple will also remain closed on June 1. Hanuman Setu Temple, which on an average receives over 80,000 devotees during Bada Mangal, will be open for high priests for traditional ‘aarti’. “All the programmes have been cancelled. Whosoever wishes to offer prayers, will only be able to do so from outside the temple,” said Chandrakant Dwivedi, high priest of the temple. “Irrespective of corona curfew, Covid norms will still remain in place in the city. If we go by the district administration rules of allowing five people at a time inside the temple, then also complete maintainence of Covid protocol will not be easy to comply with. Therefore, live-streaming of ‘aarti’ will be done,” said secretary of Shri Sankat Mochan Hanuman Ji Trust Diwakar Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-bada-mangal-festivities-this-yrtemples-to-livestream-aarti-rituals/articleshow/83098938.cms||Aditi Singh

In a tweet on Sunday, Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said, “The complaints regarding fudging the official data were made last year too. The same thing happened this year. PPE kits were sold to private hospitals and people died due to lack of tests.” He further alleged that diagnosis reports were sent to the people who had never submitted their samples for antigen or RT-PCR tests at the test collection centres set up by the government. “More astonishingly, the reports of antigen tests were submitted to the people after one—and-a-half months despite the fact that such reports could be made available to them within 15 minutes,” he added. Similarly, the actual number of deaths due to Covid were suppressed by the officials concerned. Most of the complaints were received from Muzaffarpur and Bhagalpur districts in the state. Tejashwi, however, blamed CM Nitish Kumar for the sorry state of affairs prevailing in the government hospitals.“No action was taken against the offenders as they sought the blessings of the CM,” the RJD leader alleged. The JD(U), however, countered the allegations and said that Tejashwi has virtually turned into a twitter boy. “He remains out of the state whenever there is a crisis in the state. Yet he keeps on leveling baseless allegations against the government,” JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said. BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand suggested the leader of opposition to do positive politics at the time of pandemic. “It's not he time to do petty politics rather help the people fight the deadly virus with utmost care. The government is doing its best,” he asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sstate-govt-fudging-official-data-on-covid-tests-tejashwi/articleshow/83096443.cms||Ramashankar

While interacting with Prayagraj district leaders via virtual meeting on the occasion of the Modi government’s seventh anniversary, Maurya said the party has confined itself to observing the event as ‘Covid sewa diaws’. Maurya said, ‘seva’ is the biggest contribution and BJP’s motto is not only to contest election but also serve the people. He also highlighted the achievements of the Modi government and claimed that the party has been working for the welfare of people. He said, the Centre launched several welfare schemes, including Ujawala yojna, Jan Dhan yojna, Kisan Sammannidhi yojna, Saubhaya yojna, Sukanya Samridhi and Pradhan Mantri Awas yojna, which are benefitting people living in lowest strata. He claimed, BJP and its workers have worked tirelessly for the people during the pandemic while the Opposition parties were involved in raising pointless issues and giving baseless statements. “If Opposition parties were not involved in propaganda regarding vaccination, there would have been different results and country would not have to suffer. They are only hatching conspiracies to defame the Modi government,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjp-worlds-largest-party-through-seva-sangharsh-dy-cm/articleshow/83093726.cms||---
---||Business||Covid treatment: Banks offer unsecured loans of up to Rs 5L||Mumbai: Banks will offer off-the-shelf unsecured loans of up to Rs 5 lakh to individuals for Covid treatment, and business loans up to Rs 100 crore for setting up healthcare facilities. The launch of the new schemes was announced by SBI chairman Dinesh Khara and Indian Banks’ Association chairman Rajkiran Rai at an online press conference on Sunday. Khara said that SBI has decided to price its unsecured loans at 8.5%. The bankers also provided an update on the restructuring offer made to small businesses under the scheme announced by the RBI earlier this month. Rai said that up to April, banks did not see any problem in the servicing of loans. However, in May, there was a drop in collections but it was too early to get an idea of the number. Individuals seeking a restructuring of loans can make an application on the bank’s website or manually submit the proposal. Both the borrower and the bank will have to agree to a resolution plan within 30 days of the application and September 30 would be the last day for finalising the resolution plan. Khara said that public sector banks have formulated a templated approach for restructuring loans to individuals, small businesses and MSMEs for up to Rs 25 crore. He said that banks would be proactive and would reach out to eligible customers through bulk SMS messages and offer-cum-acceptance would be generated and sent electronically. The personal loans would be available to all individuals for treatment of self or family member. The minimum loan amount would be Rs 25,000 and the term would be for a maximum of five years. The RBI had encouraged lenders to provide such loans earlier this month by offering to refinance up to Rs 50,000 crore with priority sector status for such advances. While banks have financed oxygen plants and vaccine manufacturers in May 2020, the standardised packages are expected to speed up disbursement. The business loans would be available for anyone engaged in building and servicing healthcare infrastructures such as hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, diagnostic centres and pathology labs. It will be available for greenfield investments as well as for adding to existing capacity. The quantum of loan, which will be for a tenure of up to 10 years, will be Rs 100 crore for metro centres, Rs 20 crore for tier-1 and urban centres, and Rs 10 crore for smaller towns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-treatment-banks-offer-unsecured-loans-of-up-to-rs-5l/articleshow/83098687.cms||---

The state government has proposed to set up 16 new medical colleges where only 11 colleges are functioning at present. Construction work has started in two medical colleges at Paderu and Pulivendula. With the establishment of the new colleges, the number of medical seats is going to significantly increase and more seats will be available for students from economically weaker sections. The 16 colleges will come up at Paderu, Vizianagaram, Anakapalli, Rajahmundry, Palakollu, Amalapuram, Eluru, Machilipatnam, Bapatla, Markapuram, Piduguralla, Madanapalle, Pulivendula, Penukonda, Adoni and Nandyal. So far, the state government has issued orders for construction of multispecialty hospitals in tribal areas at Seethampeta, Parvathipuram, Rampachodavaram, Buttayigudem and Dornala, where an extent of 885 acres of land was procured for medical colleges and multispecialty hospitals. With regard to medical education, Vizianagaram, Anakapalli, Rajahmundry, Eluru and Machilipatnam will each have 150 seats while the remaining colleges will have 100 admissions each. The medical colleges and teaching hospitals will offer emergency, casualty and diagnostic services, with advanced intensive care units and 10 state-of-the-art modular operation theatres. The project is being taken up as part of Nadu-Nedu.

---||Business||With Rs 45k cr kitty, govt extends loan guarantee scheme to airlines||Mumbai: The government on Sunday expanded a scheme that guarantees loans to Covid-hit businesses to include the aviation sector with maximum assistance for a borrower capped at Rs 200 crore. The fourth iteration of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which has been extended up to September 30, will also fully guarantee loans up to Rs 2 crore to hospitals for setting up oxygen plants. The ECLGS was introduced by the government to provide relief to small businesses after the first phase of the lockdown last year. Under the latest ECLGS 4.0, an additional 10% of credit limits can be provided and more time can be given to eligible borrowers. The current ceiling of Rs 500 crore of loan outstanding for eligibility under ECLGS 3.0 has been removed, subject to maximum additional ECLGS assistance to each borrower being limited to 40% or Rs 200 crore, whichever is lower. The scheme provided for guarantees on loans of up to Rs 3 lakh crore. SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said the scheme had proved its value in the first phase of the pandemic. Banks have sanctioned loans worth over Rs 2.5 lakh crore under the scheme, of which Rs 2.4 lakh crore has been disbursed. This would mean that banks have headroom to take up fresh proposals worth about Rs 45,000 crore. In ECLGS 1.0, borrowers could avail of a loan of four years and repay only interest for the first year. If eligible for restructuring, they can now extend the loan for five years by repaying only the interest component in the first two years. “Our preliminary assessment is that we should be in a position to build a book of about Rs 2,000 crore,” Khara said, referring to fresh loans under ECLGS 4.0. The loans to hospitals, nursing homes and medical colleges for setting up an oxygen plant would be available at a concessional interest rate of 7.5%. Rajkiran Rai, chairman of Indian Banks’ Association and MD of Union Bank of India, said that the contours of the scheme have been shared with other banks and while each lender may tweak it according to its policies, most would be able to launch the schemes soon. “With the second wave of Covid and incremental stress on debt servicing of the borrowers, Relief measures under ECLGS will support liquidity position of the borrowers, apart from incremental stress on the asset quality of lenders. The government will also not be burdened with additional cost because of the second wave and this will also improve the utilisation of overall ECLGS funding pool available,” said ICRA’s VP Anil Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/with-rs-45k-cr-kitty-govt-extends-loan-guarantee-scheme-to-airlines/articleshow/83098731.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Summer break pattern changes in e-class season||KOLKATA: Reading Enid Blyton on a summer holiday afternoon is now a thing of the past, as the pandemic has taken away the luxury of enjoying month-long summer vacations for many students. Several schools have decided to give holidays at regular interval to break the monotony of online classes instead of a long holiday. South Point School, due to the continuous surge in the number of Covid-affected families and in order to provide some respite for the children, guardians and teachers from the raging pandemic, had decided to start the summer break from May 10 . The school resumed online classes from Monday, May 24. “Earlier, students were allowed a month-long break during summer. Now, keeping them focused on the monitor for long hours during online classes is taking a toll on their mental and physical health. So, we have now introduced breaks at regular intervals,” said spokesperson of the South Point School, Krishna Damani. The school is now allowing students to go on break after every six weeks of intense online classes, for seven days. “It is not keeping them away for a long time. The students need to concentrate on completing the syllabus which can only be done if they are motivated to attend rigorous online classes,” explained Damani. Richard Gasper, principal, St Augustine School, however, felt a proper summer break is required. “We have given a summer break because the students and teachers need some relaxation. We have been able to finish the syllabus on time,” he said. The Vivekananda Mission School has not yet started the vacation. The authorities are planning to give a two-week break in June. “We need to complete the syllabus which is our primary aim. In 2021-2022 the academic session is running delayed. So, we have deferred the vacation,” said the principal Sarmistha Banerjee. Several schools have curtailed the duration of the summer holidays, from one month to 15 or 21 days. Bobby Baxter, principal of Julien Day School Ganganagar confirmed that the summer vacation has been slashed for 21 days and the online classes will resume from June 7. “Students need to rigorously study and complete the syllabus. Since the classes are online and students are given breaks between sessions, we decided to curtail the summer vacation by a week,” pointed out Baxter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/summer-break-pattern-changes-in-e-class-season/articleshow/83096434.cms||Somdatta Basu

Reason: Nearly three years ago, Hardas Karangia, 55, had died on August 22, 2018. “When we received this message about vaccination for our late uncle, we were shocked. When we downloaded the certificate of vaccination, it was issued in the name of the late Hardas Karangia. How can this be possible? Something must be wrong and my late uncle’s Aadhaar card may have been misused. Government should investigate this matter thoroughly,” Arvind told media persons on Sunday. According to Karangia, the particular vaccination was done at Samajwadi Health Centre in Upleta taluka of Rajkot district. One the one hand, people are not getting vaccination slots and are having to stand in long queues for hours together, on the other hand vaccination certificates are being issued in the name of the dead!” Karangia added. Nilesh Shah, chief district health officer (CDHO), Rajkot district, told TOI, “The matter has come to our notice and we have ordered an inquiry into it. If anyone is found indulging in any malpractices in the vaccination programme, a criminal case will be lodged.” According to sources, till now 3.12 lakh doses of vaccination have been administered in Rajkot district, of which 2.63 lakh are first doses and over 76 lakh are second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaccination-cert-in-dead-mans-name-in-upleta/articleshow/83097214.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences overhauls Covid care, brings in spate of reforms||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), one of the state-level Covid-19 hospitals to treat severe referral cases, has brought in several reforms in Covid-19 treatment and patient care in recent weeks. It has set up a first-of-its-kind mini call centre in the state to keep the relatives of the patients informed about their health condition. About 30 people, including senior doctors, attend to calls round-the-clock in three shifts. Not only do they receive calls from the patients’ attendants or relatives, but the call centre employees also communicate the patients’ condition to the family members on a daily basis. Speaking to TOI, director, VIMS, Dr K Rambabu, who served as the state Covid-19 nodal officer for about 14 months before the appointment, said that the call centre does away with the need of attendants making rounds around the hospitals. “They can directly call the hospital for patient information. Even if they do not call, the call centre employees would update the patients’ relatives,” said Dr Rambabu. The VIMS has improved its triaging facility with eight to 10 beds for hassle-free admission. “Our first priority goes to the patients referred by the 104 call centre. The gates would be opened for direct walk-ins, if there are any vacant beds. Considering the allegations over ornaments, we have made it mandatory that the staff has to enter the irremovable ornament data in the case sheet and take a photograph of the same. The document would also be signed by the patients’ attendants,” said Dr Rambabu. The hospital has tied up with an NGO to provide free food and water bottles to the patients’ attendants, waiting on its premises. “Considering the ongoing curfew situation and their financial constraints, we have negotiated with an NGO to supply 300 meals a day. The senior doctors are offering in-hospital teleconsultation to improve the medical services being offered to the patients. Another NGO is providing food and snacks for doctors and medical staff, who are relentlessly working for the last 15 months in Covid-19 management. The major credit of all these reforms goes to the doctors and medical staff,” said Dr Rambabu. Dr Rambabu added that the VIMS has set up an oxygen supply monitoring committee. “Three people, including an oxygen technician, work in each shift to ensure unhindered oxygen supply to the patients. The hospital has recently got a 20 kilolitre oxygen tank to improve the oxygen supply situation,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vims-overhauls-covid-care-brings-in-spate-of-reforms/articleshow/83095030.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

This centre is part of a planned 1,000-bed care facility for treatment of Covid-19 patients at Gurajada Kalakshetram and hostel-1. In his keynote address, Pradhan described the inauguration of the Covid care centre as a perfect example of cooperative federalism.

He thanked the Andhra Pradesh government for extending its support required to start the Covid care facility on the premises of RINL-Vizag Steel. “To a large extent, we have overcome the challenge of availability of oxygen, Remdesivir and other medicines. Our next challenge is to vaccinate our vast population. With our domestic producers expanding their production and ongoing talks with global vaccine producers, vaccine supply is set to receive substantial augmentation from June onwards.

On Saturday, Shiva completed his 49-day journey after he reached Guntur (GGH) to get himself tested for Covid-19. Speaking to TOI, Shiva explained that he had been keen on doing the feat for around a year. He explained that he understood the importance of blood and organ donation after his sister struggled to get blood during the initial lockdown in March 2020. “We were in a difficult situation as it was just the day when the lockdown began. My cousin Srilatha who is 20-years-old had a difficult time in getting blood for her delivery and after seeking help across social media groups and other friends. We got it at a critical stage,” Shiva explained. Srilatha managed to give birth to a baby boy but the traumatic memory stayed with Shiva. “After much deliberation, I decided that I shall do this feat in a bid to raise awareness across the places to which I can travel,” Shiva added. On April 11, Shiva began his journey from Kanyakumari and travelled to Kollam and then re-entered Tamil Nadu transiting 15 districts and reached AP at Tada. During the peak of the curfew, he was funded by his college professors in JKC for food and other amenities. For accommodation, he camped on platforms and other areas while trying to maintain a speed of 40 to 50 km per day in a span of 10 hours. Shiva said that he had approached Telugu Book of Records and submitted his photographs, videos and acknowledgements from several government officials across the states to which travelled. “It’s not about the award. I hope to encourage the importance of blood and organ donation especially during the crisis the world is facing,” Shiva told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/24-year-old-walks-over-2000km-to-raise-awareness-on-blood-donation/articleshow/83095477.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Her surgeon asked her to undergo an RT-PCR test before the procedure, which showed ‘positive’. As a sizeable number of people recovered from Covidopt for non-urgent or elective surgical procedures, treating surgeons are insisting on repeat RT-PCR/antigen tests as pre-operative protocol. But experts from Indian Council of Medical Research and the national Covid task force have advised against repeating Covid tests within 102 days of recovery, citing presence of ‘non-viable dead-virus particles’ that stay on for a while even after full recuperation. Also, experts said surgeons must consider performing a non-urgent surgery on a Covid-recovered patient 6 weeks after recovery for quick healing post surgery. “Presently, Covid re-infection is confirmed only after 102 days of diagnosis. So retesting as pre-operative protocol in this time frame is not advisable,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a national task force member. “Also, a minimum 6 weeks before non-urgent surgery is recommended for Covid-recovered patients who were symptomatic. As for emergency surgeries in recovering or recovered patients, these must be done immediately with due precautions,” Pujari said. But he added that if a patient experiences recurrence of symptoms after Covid recovery, re-testing and consultation with an infectious disease expert can be considered. “Residual symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain are common in patients who have had Covid. These symptoms can be present more than 60 days after diagnosis,” Pujari said. Covid may also have long-term effects on heart function. A thorough pre-operative evaluation, scheduled well ahead of surgery with special attention to cardiopulmonary systems, must be considered in patients who have recovered and especially in those with residual symptoms, guidelines by American Society of Anaesthesiology state. Surgeon Sanjay Kolte, said, “Re-testing recovered patients within 102 days from Covid diagnosis only adds to anxiety and is a waste of money. Importantly, surgeons should adopt universal precautions while performing elective surgery rather than insisting on RTPCR reports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-after-covid-wait-6-weeks-to-undergo-non-urgent-surgery/articleshow/83098121.cms||Umesh Isalkar

"This is the only means to get our grievances addressed. And I am yet to receive a reply," said Grace. It’s been nearly five months since the transgender welfare board became inactive. The board is meant to address the grievances of the community and help bring them on par with the rest of the population. It comprises 11 officials including the minister of social welfare, who serves as its chairperson and 12 transsexuals, who serve as non-official members. Senior officials from the social welfare department said that the term of most of its members had ended last year and the assembly elections further delayed the selection process. “We have begun shortlisting candidates and will form a new board in the coming weeks,” the official said. “People are losing jobs, have no ration card, no money and no home. The board was inconsistent in its work even last year,” said Juvena, a 28-year-old transsexual, who lost her job as an accountant due to the pandemic last year. Juvena said that a majority of them do not have ration cards, because of which they are unable to access any welfare assistance from the state. A few transgender people residing near Valluvarkottam high road said that due to their dire circumstances, several of them are forced to beg or take up prostitution. “Even the educated ones, who had jobs in private firms, are now struggling to make ends meet,” said *Rani, a food stall owner. During the lockdown last year, the previous government had announced an additional monthly relief assistance of Rs. 1,000 for the transgender people, which also didn’t continue for long. “We don’t know how long the pandemic will last, and it’s high time the authorities intervene and address our issues,” said Grace.

He said there had been an exponential rise in food grain production and record procurement of food grains had been made by the central government. This however, did not cut ice with the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which alleged that the claims were in contravention of ground realities. SKM leaders said despite the agricultural sector turning out to be the only one that witnessed growth during the Covid lockdown, farmers did not get dividends as they failed to get even minimum support price (MSP) on many crops except wheat and paddy. They accused the Prime Minister of projecting his achievements in a “sugarcoated way.” “The Prime Minister spoke only a few words about farmers and agriculture and preferred to remain silent on the question of the three agricultural laws as well as guarantee of proper MSP to all farmers on all crops. He spoke about one or two crops, citing historic growth, but in real terms, they do not talk about all the crops and all farmers,” said senior farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal and Joginder Singh Ugrahan at the protest in Patiala. The farm leaders alleged even though the three agricultural laws were against farmers and would affect them adversely, the PM only preferred to do his own “Mann ki Baat” without listening to anyone. They alleged that the SKM had written to the Prime Minister on May 21 but he had not responded. Meanwhile, SKM leaders appreciated boxer Sweety Boora’s gesture of dedicating her Asian Championship bronze medal to farmers. She also urged the PM to talk to farmers and accept their demands as soon as possible. Morcha leaders further stated that the storm at Shahjahanpur border on Saturday night caused extensive damage to farmers’ tents, stage, langar and essential goods. They said farmers who were trying to tackle the situation also sustained serious injuries. They urged social welfare organisations and the general public to provide all possible help to provide relief to farmers protesting at the Shahjahanpur border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/enough-mann-ki-baat-lets-talk-about-reality-farmers-to-modi/articleshow/83098096.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Aurangabad||75% beds vacant at Covid facilities in Aurangabad city||Aurangabad: With continuous decline in fresh cases of Covid-19, around 75% beds have become vacant in different Covid care facilities across Aurangabad, reducing the burden on health machinery.As per official data, a total of 1,248 beds are vacant at different DCHs, 2025 in DCHCs and 2,826 in CCCs within municipal limits of Aurangabad on Saturday. Also, DCHs and DCHCs have 861 and 1,218 vacant oxygen beds, respectively, besides 88 unclaimed ventilators together in total. At the district level, Aurangabad now has a total of 4,054 active cases of Covid-19 — considerably less as compared to last few weeks. The drop in case-load has reflected in terms of demand for oxygen supply as well. The state-run Covid care facilities in Aurangabad currently require 16.65 tonne of oxygen per day, whereas private hospitals need 11.91 tonne of oxygen. Dr Neeta Padalkar, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said the CCCs and other health facilities, having very low or no occupancy, would continue to function in near future too. “Even if the case load has come down, we have to remain prepared for the worst. With a section of health experts predicting the third-wave of Covid-19 we should be our toes,” she said. Notably, the AMC has decided to set up 100-bed capacity CCC at MGM and at on the premises of Garware Company especially for kids. The necessary preparations for setting up the facilities are in full swing, authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/75-beds-vacant-at-covid-facilities-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/83092255.cms||---
---||Chennai||IIT-Madras, ICCW plan studies to forecast groundwater quality||CHENNAI: The quality of groundwater in localities closer to the beach in Chennai like Injambakkam and Besant Nagar is poor, while the quality in core areas like Adyar, Choolaimedu and suburbs like Ramapuram was found to be excellent. This was revealed by an IIT-Madras team that has started collecting data as part of a pilot project to map the quality of Chennai’s groundwater in association with the state government. While this was based on samples collected in March, the researchers said the quality of groundwater will further deteriorate in June with water table levels dropping. As the quality of water fluctuated, the project aims to gather enough data so that ground water quality can be forecast. The International Centre for Clean Water (ICCW) has developed a device to assess various water quality parameters on the spot and upload the details into a cloud server. It plans to collect enough data that can help in the forecast in the city at any time of the year at the click of a button. The team has already collected samples and tested them from 39 locations and plans to expand it to 60 more locations. “Water quality changes even at a 50 to 100 m distance. We cannot talk about water quality in a given region by just one parameter in any city, where rapid urbanisation has happened. But overall, Chennai’s water quality is reasonable. We have enough water and enough good water. But we need to conserve it,” said Prof T Pradeep, professor-in-charge, ICCW. Water quality index is measured based on various parameters like chloride, total hardness, fluoride, nitrate, turbidity, ammonia, alkalinity is considered poor when it is between 100 and 200, good if it is between 50-100 and excellent if it is between zero and 50. The researchers said several factors influence the city’s groundwater quality including the rate of withdrawal, proximity to the sea shore, contamination from sewer lines, amount of rainwater recharge and industrial effluents. “Typically groundwater levels will go down between March and June and continue to go down till monsoons start in October. So compared to March the quality would have deteriorated in June,” said E Nandakumar, ceo, ICCW-IIT-M. ICCW, which collected data with the help of students from Stella Maris College, will soon cover another 60 locations in the city. To collect data on the spot, the team has developed a device with sensors that can assess the various water quality parameters, generate a reading and transfer the same to a cloud server through a mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/iit-m-iccw-plan-studies-to-forecast-groundwater-quality/articleshow/83096487.cms||U Tejonmayam

---||Delhi||Delhi: From Ashram to RTR phase-II, wait for project completion to be longer||NEW DELHI: The Public Works Department will require at least 70 labourers to be working if the Ashram Chowk underpass is to be finished in time. It has only 15. At least 50 are required at the Rao Tula Ram Phase 2 construction site, but barely 10 were there on Monday. With this shortage of workers, the resumption of construction work after seven weeks of the Covid lockdown did not lead to any significant progress. “When the 2020 lockdown was lifted, there was a major crunch of labourers because most had returned to villages. And though most of them swore they wouldn’t come back to Delhi for work, they did, and we were soon operating at full capacity,” said a PWD official. “However, we hadn’t expected a similar problem to rise in the current circumstances.” The PWD construction projects did resume on Monday, after the lockdown was relaxed for industrial units and construction sites, but the day’s operations were on a very small scale due to the inadequate workforce. “More than half the workers at both the small and big project sites have headed back home, and we are not sure if some of them will return,” the official added. “The engineers heading these projects are chalking out a plan on how to allot work so as not to disrupt the timelines unrealistically. New workers will, of course, be recruited to meet the demand if the existing labourers decline to come back to the city.” Another official said that given the situation, the Ashram Chowk underpass project will take more than its stipulated time to be completed. During the presentation of Delhi budget in March, it was stated that the underpass would be finished by June-end. But the Covid crisis in the capital has led to at least four months’ delay before the busy traffic intersection can be thrown open for public use. India Trade Promotion Organisation was in a happier space on Monday. For its project at Pragati Maidan, the company, along with PWD and L&T, took care of the migrant labourers in Delhi itself and the labour strength on Monday appeared hardly affected. “The ITPO construction work is almost complete though we are running behind the deadline,” said an official. “We are hopeful of all the construction work ending in less than a month’s time. This is possible because we don’t feel the shortage of labour here. The construction sites that have been hit are those whose workers left the city.” PWD is helming ITPO’s Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project, Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor, Ashram underpass, and Benito-Juarez Road underpass, a part of the RTR Phase 2 project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-ashram-to-rtr-phase-ii-wait-for-project-completion-to-be-longer/articleshow/83127996.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

One person has been arrested from Bharatpur district in Rajasthan. Investigators have come across a list of 21 people from Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh who have been blackmailed by this gang. They collected Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh from each of them. However, none of them reported the matter to police. The MLA, Neeraj Dixit, could have been the gang’s 22nd target had he not approached the police in time, said police officials. Chhatarpur SP Sachin Sharma told TOI that this gang portrayed itself as young women on dating apps for cat-fishing people after gathering their personal information through social media sites. Once targets were identified, they lured them with photos and invited for real chats. After chatting for a while, they would get the victims on video call, capture the screen and edit it to contrast it with offensive adult content — most often cuts from pornographic clips, police said. According to the police, even after victims paid, blackmailing often did not stop. They kept threatening people that their morphed chat videos online would be circulated across social media. The accused have so far allegedly cheated people to the tune of Rs 14 lakh. On May 22, Maharajpur MLA Neeraj Dixit approached Gadimalhera police station with a complaint alleging that an unknown woman was trying to blackmail him by threatening to circulate his objectionable videos over the internet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/multi-state-sextortion-gang-that-hit-mla-busted/articleshow/83101859.cms||P Naveen
---||Aurangabad||Govt to replicate Beed pattern of crop insurance||Aurangabad: Maharashtra agriculture minister Dada Bhuse on Sunday said the ‘Beed pattern’ of crop insurance will be replicated across the state and a necessary proposal to this effect was forwarded to the Centre. “The existing pattern of crop insurance in Maharashtra needs to undergo reforms. The Beed pattern is found to be beneficial for the farmers and it will be scaled up across the state after completing necessary formalities,” said Bhuse during his official tour to Aurangabad.Also known as the “80-110 Plan,” the ‘Beed pattern’ ensures premiums above a certain threshold are refunded to the state government. As per the pattern, the insurance company is not required to accept claims that exceed 110 % of the gross premium and the state government must bear the cost of any such claims. While the insurance firms pay the state government any premium surplus that exceeds 20% of the gross premium. Bhuse, who held a review meeting ahead of kharif season, said an inquiry needs to be done on the profits earned by insurance firm through the existing model of crop insurance. “In Maharashtra, around Rs, 5,800 crore is collected from insurance firms towards crop insurance for both rabi and kharif season of crops every year with contribution from the state, the Centre and the farmers. Of these, official data show that insurance claims of only Rs 1,008 crore are settled while the rest of the amount is earned as profits by insurance companies,” he said. Bhuse said the government machinery was taking organised measures to ensure a smooth supply of seeds and fertilizers among other essential to farmers.“The government is purchasing seeds from Mahabeej and private firms to ensure there is no gap between demand and supply. The data collection of surplus stock of seeds available with farmers is also on. The farmers are requested to raise the complaints, if any, of substandard seeds with local agricultural authorities at the earliest. Also, as per estimates, the demand for urea is likely to increase and efforts are taken to supply the same,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/govt-to-replicate-beed-pattern-of-crop-insurance/articleshow/83092281.cms||Prasad Joshi

The protesting farmers also held the Central government responsible for the state of affairs. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh alleged, “Both the Centre and state government failed to deal with the Covid crisis despite the virus knocking the country about a year ago. Both the governments are equally responsible. What could be more shameful than dead bodies being eaten by dogs near Ganga river? The central government kept Rs 200 crore to establish 162 oxygen plants but only 33 have been set up so far. The state government failed completely as it could not recruit the necessary medical staff and provide infrastructure to hospitals.” He said, “Governments in Punjab and Haryana are blaming farmers for Covid spread. Punjab CM asked us not to organise the protest as it could spread Covid. We followed Covid guidelines, including social distancing, wearing masks and sanitisation.” Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader B S Rajewal accused the Centre of making the agri laws a prestige issue. “We had written a letter to the Centre government but got no response. The government seems to be holding on to ego. All three farm laws are not in favour of farmers and country. We proved this during the clause by clause discussion on farm laws. We stick to our stand to get the laws repealed. The issue of crop MSP is very important for farmers,” he claimed. During their three-day agitation, farmers asked the state government to provide Rs 10 lakh compensation each and a government job to kin of farm activists of Punjab who died during the agitation. Farmers asked the Punjab government to fill the vacancies of technical and medical staff in the Punjab health department, provide free of cost vaccination and life-saving drugs, stop imposing fines on violators of curfew or Covid guidelines; recruit staff to operate ventilators lying unused in government hospitals; provide more L3 facility beds and check black marketing of medicines and oxygen. The protesting farmers also said private hospitals must be brought under government control for treatment of Covid patients and charges of private hospitals should be kept within the reach of common people, especially the poor. They asked the Central government to levy taxes on corporate houses and increase government investment in the public sector, including the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/3-day-protest-against-pb-govts-covid-failure-ends-in-patiala/articleshow/83098125.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

I have taken pictures, but I did not know whom to complain to,” he told TOI. He added that the dumping place between 6 am and 8 am. This is the latest case TOI is reporting of private tankers dumping sewage into the canal. It's not just sewage. Often, private garbage trucks dump their load into the canal. The public works department, the Greater Chennai corporation and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board have acted on complaints and penalized drivers and seized their vehicles. But the menace continues. The Chennai metro water supply and sewerage board sent a proposal to the state government recently to designate it as the nodal authority to regulate private sewage tankers. At present, an official said, only the TNPCB and the GreaterChennai Corporation can take action under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act. C R Balaji, a social activist, said the Chennai River Restoration Trust had studied the entire Buckingham-canal, Cooum and Adyar rivers. They have charted plans as well to plug sewage flows. “But the work is very slow. This lockdown time should be utilized to speed up work and ensure that such illegal dumping is stopped and regulations are brought in,” he said. In 2019, the CRRT said that 1,064 sewage dumping points, including 22 inside city limits, were identified and plugged. “But this illegal sewage dumping is not through pipelines but by private tankers that take contract from industries, IT companies, apartments and other buildings. This can be stopped only by setting up CCTV cameras and bringing in strict regulations and surveillance by one competent authority that will take responsibility for it,” said Suresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sewage-being-dumped-into-buckhingam-canal-illegally/articleshow/83096514.cms||---

---||Chennai||Three suspects attack cop in Chennai, escape custody||CHENNAI: Three suspects escaped from the Vysarpadi police station on Saturday night after sparking a ‘fight’ among themselves and attacking a sub-inspector who rushed to the spot to defuse the ‘quarrel’. A manhunt has been launched for Ajith Kumar, 24, Ajay Gupta, 22 and Jagadeswaran, 22, who broke a glass window in the lock-up and tried to ‘stab’ themselves and each other, police said. A day after an 11-member gang of people including women attacked a SI and two constables who had gone to bust a gang selling liquor illegally, a special team was checking vehicles at Ashok Pillar (distinct from the structure near Vadapalani) in the area when they found the three men moving around aimlessly. When questioned about the reason for their presence in the area at that hour, each of the three came up with different answers. Their suspicions aroused, the special team members took the three to the station where interrogations revealed that Ajith Kumar had 24 crime cases pending against him at the Kodungaiyur, MKB Nagar, Otteri and Pulianthope police stations, while Ajay is involved in nearly 20 cases and Jagadeswaran in an equal number of cases including murder and attempt to murder cases. After they were detained in the lock-up — where they were not handcuffed as it was only for an inquiry that they were held — sub-inspector Anand was deployed to safeguard them. Later that night, the staff at the station were startled on hearing a huge noise from the spot where the trio was kept. As Anand others ran there, they saw the suspects ‘attacking’ each other and rushing about, said a policeman. Some of their relatives standing outside the police station also created a ruckus, demanding their release. The SI was seeing all this when one of the three men broke a glass window and threatened to stab himself. The other two also did the same. Concerned that the suspects placed under him could seriously injure themselves, the SI tried to overpower them when they attacked him, leaving him with injuries. They pushed him away before fleeing, said the policeman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/3-suspects-attack-cops-escape-custody/articleshow/83096551.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Congress activists call Modi govt a failure, Sanjay Raut joins chorus||MUMBAI: Alleging complete failure to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, Congress activists led by party state unit president Nana Patole staged massive demonstrations across the state to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday. Sanjay Raut, spokesperson of Congress ally Shiv Sena, suggested the Centre should introspect on whether it had provided basic needs like employment and better education and health infrastructure. He said the country had survived seven years of the BJP-led government because of the past altruistic contributions of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, who he said established infrastructure and institutions. On Sunday, the Modi government completed seven years in office and the Congress observed it as a black day. “We have absolutely no vaccination plan. The central government never put up its demand before the manufacturing companies,” Patole said. He said lakhs died of Covid-19 as Modi took care of the rich and ignored the poor. Patole was joined by Congress city unit chief Bhai Jagtap. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat led protesters in Nashik and former CM Prithviraj Chavan, in Pune. Patole said that during the first wave Modi was busy welcoming the then US President Donald Triumph and when it appeared that the situation was out of control, he blamed the Tablighi Jamaat and gave a communal colour to the pandemic. He said that during the second wave, Modi and entire union cabinet was busy campaigning for state elections in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-activists-call-modi-govt-a-failure-raut-joins-chorus/articleshow/83098134.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||India||‘Red tape beats even Everest challenge’||AURANGABAD: A few days ago, Sambhaji Gurav became the third policeman from the state to scale Mount Everest. But even as police naik Rafiq Shaikh, the state’s first policeman atop Everest, raised a toast to Gurav’s feat, he couldn’t help but mention his continuing wait for service benefits and funding promised by the state in recognition for his achievement in May 2016. “Climbing Mount Everest was easier than overcoming red-tapism,” rues the 35-year-old Aurangabad policeman, who lost three of his toes to frostbite while descending. The chief minister’s office (CMO) had tweeted on June 12, 2016, that the state government would bear the complete cost of Shaikh’s expedition. Shaikh, who met Fadnavis personally, was also promised a departmental promotion. “In November 2017, the official process began for seeking my service record and expedition details to facilitate the departmental promotion. I was to get Rs 52 lakh as funding for the expedition. But I was told some technical issues had cropped up. I have since met several political leaders, including former home minister Anil Deshmukh, but only got hollow promises,” Shaikh said Sunday. On 31 July, 2019, the home department had written to the Maharashtra DGP highlighting issues in funding Shaikh’s expedition as there was no “budgetary head” for such an allocation. It had also said the release of money cannot be done through the CM’s relief fund given a pending litigation in the Bombay HC related to the use of the corpus for purposes other than medical or accidental deaths. “It was the state government which had, on its own, announced the funding, followed by initiation of the process of collecting my service record and expedition details,” Shaikh said. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil did not respond to text messages or phone calls by TOI on the issue. NCP spokesperson Vikas Lawande said his party would take steps to ensure Shaikh got his dues. “We will take up the issue with the home minister,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/red-tape-beats-even-everest-challenge/articleshow/83101893.cms||Prasad Joshi

K V R K Thirunaranan, who is monitoring Pallikaranai and Perumbakkam marshlands, said that most of the larger birds have already left, while smaller waders which prefer to search their feed in the mudflats are going now. The common redshank and whimbrel, rarely sighted waders which travel several thousand kilometres from Siberia and Scandinavia, have been seen this year. Every year, at least two whimbrels are seen at the Kovalam creek or in Perumbakkam marshland. Sighting whimbrels in a marshland had dwindled in the past few years when their habitat had been destroyed in many areas. Unlike the common redshank, whimbrels are not found in a flock, he said. Thirunaranan also found that the common redshanks were healthy, with many sporting the breeding plumage — a sign that the birds were able to get fat during their migration to the Kovalam creek or Perumbakkam marshland, he said. A few researchers from the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) who are based at the Point Calimere bird sanctuary in Vedaranayam had ringed the common redshanks seen there. BNHS deputy director (ornithology) S Balachandran said the common redshank is found in North Scandinavia, North Italy, Tunisia and Turkey besides east and west Siberia. It winters in regions stretching from the Mediterranean to tropical India, Indonesia and Africa and breeds in Southern Siberia, Mongolia and Russia’s far east. In the south, they are found in marshes, margins of lakes, river banks and estuaries. Breeding population of this bird species is found in northwest Himalayas and north Sikkim, he said. At least half a dozen common redshanks ringed at Point Calimere sanctuary in TN were sighted in other parts of the world a couple of years later, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/waders-start-return-migration-trip-from-city/articleshow/83096588.cms||P Oppili

But, the price of mutton has been jacked up by Rs 150 to Rs 300 a kg compared to the first week of May. Till Saturday, fish and meat were door delivered only by a few local meat shops and service providers, who took orders on messaging apps and delivered within a day. All fish and meat stalls remained shut. On Sunday, mutton was sold for Rs 850 to Rs 1,200 a kg through various apps and the same quantity of chicken was sold for a flat rate of Rs 240. Only some varieties of fish were available through online apps, but were sold out within an hour on Sunday. Traders taking orders on the phone said that limited volumes of fish were available for sale as it has to be sourced from other places in view of the 45-day ban on trawling. Former president of Chennai Poultry Wholesalers Association J Rajkumar said all meat shops are closed in the city. "We are permitted to offer meat to eateries and restaurants in the current lockdown. Traders with access to online food aggregators and taking orders on the phone also deliver at doorsteps of residents," he said. Meanwhile, retail chains are delivering vegetables within a couple of days, though people depending on home delivery apps were facing logistical issues due to the intensified lockdown. P L Muthu, operations head of a city-based online delivery app providing grocery and vegetables, said that the frequency of sourcing vegetables from different parts of Tamil Nadu has been affected by the intensified lockdown. "Moreover, home delivery apps are facing shortage for manpower, which is delaying the delivery time in Chennai," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/online-apps-resume-delivery-of-mutton-chicken-fish-still-scarce/articleshow/83096593.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 14 home-buyers can exit project at BKC, get refund||MUMBAI: MahaRERA has directed Radius Estates and Developers, a co-promoter of the Ten BKC project at Bandra, to allow 14 home-buyers to withdraw from its project and refund amounts paid by the home-buyers, with interest, for failing to pay pre-EMIs and for delaying possession. The builder was also directed to pay Rs 10 lakh penalty to MahaRERA. The 14 home-buyers had booked flats in the free sale component of the redevelopment project between 2016 and 2017 under the subvention scheme and paid 64%-75% of total consideration of their flats, themselves and through financial institutions, to the promoter. According to the complainants, the promoter has neither handed over possession by November 30, 2019 ,as per allotment letters nor has it refunded amounts paid. The home-buyers, represented by advocate Tanuj Lodha, stated that the promoter failed to execute registered agreements for sale with the complainants and to adhere to its responsibility to pay pre-EMIs to financial institutions, thus contravening the comfort letters issued by it. The co-promoter, who was represented by Vibhav Krishna, stated that since allotment letters have not been terminated, the complaints are premature. The co-promoter pointed out that date of completion of project has been extended to December 2022 due to the lockdown and said that it has paid pre-EMIs under the subvention scheme up to January 2020 and the entire amount received from the complainants has been used for the construction. The co-promoter also said promoters are facing issues due to disputes with middle-income groups and a case is pending before commercial arbitration in Bombay high court. MahaRERA member Vijay Satbir Singh observed that the co-promoter had issued comfort letters to home-buyers, stating that it will pay the pre-EMI to the financial institutions till possession. However, the co-promoter has stopped paying the same from February 2020 and failed to fulfil its commitments. Thereafter, though the co-promoter agreed to reimburse pre-EMI paid by complainants, it has failed to do it. The member pointed out that the co-promoter was not entitled to accept more than 20% amount out of total consideration under MOFA and 10% under RERA, without executing a registered agreement for sale with the allottees and if the complainants were not willing to execute the agreement for sale, it should have taken appropriate steps against them or refunded their money by cancelling their bookings. Singh directed the promoter to refund entire amount paid, with interest, at SBI’s marginal cost of lending rate plus 2% and directed the promoter to settle all issues with financial institutions separately regarding repayment of money paid by them on behalf of complainants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-14-home-buyers-can-exit-project-at-bkc-get-refund/articleshow/83098143.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

A police team led by deputy superintendent (DSP) Pushpa Khatri rushed to the spot at Bibipur and pacified the farmers in two hours, after which they lifted the blockade. Farmers of Bibipur parked their tractors on the road and core committee members of Bhartiya Kisan Union also reached the spot in support of farmers and accused BJP government of using repressive measures to split the peaceful agitation. According to police, Dalbir Singh has been booked in two cases — one registered on May 24 for allegedly makig comments against Khattar and the second one was registered in 2017. In the case registered in 2017, Dalbr was booked under Section 124 A (whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government established by law in India, a shall be punished with imprisonment for life) for making comment on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many other persons occupying constitutional posts. In the case registered on May 24, Dalbir has been booked for comments on Khattar, under sections 506 (criminal intimidation) 505 A (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement or report containing rumour) 504 (Whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person, intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation will cause him to break the public peace) and 294 (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) of Indian Penal Code. Khatri said farmers had assumed that Balbir was in police custody. “We told them that police produced him in court in the evening on Saturday and he was remanded in judicial custody,” she added. BKU Jind president Azad Singh Palwa said police promised to cooperate with farmers while procuring bail for Dalbir in court. “Farmers will not tolerate police action and they don’t fear jail. The Modi government should not be in any illusion,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/jind-roadblock-against-farmers-arrest/articleshow/83098135.cms||---

On Monday, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital created a dedicated ward for children suffering from MIS so that beds and other essential requirements can be met. Doctors said the maximum number of kids who were facing post-Covid issues were in the age group of 5-15 with 50% of them having cardiac-related issues. Many of the kids who are having post-Covid symptoms had asymptomatic Covid. Dr Dhiren Gupta, paediatric intensivist at Ganga Ram, stated that they had been collecting data from various hospitals in Delhi and NCR to gauge the situation. As per the data collected by Gupta on Saturday, 108 children with MIS are admitted at ten different hospitals in Delhi. “Well, the idea is to be prepared and not worry. The situation is alarming, but one must understand that the age group we are looking at also has a good recovery rate. It is important that parents do early recognition and timely bring the children to the hospital to avoid adverse situations. Ganga Ram currently has 26 patients out of which 11 came only on Saturday, five of them are on ventilator. The youngest patient we have is 8 months old and the oldest 17 years old,” Dr Gupta said. When asked what kinds of symptoms children are showing, Gupta added that in around 50% of the children, some or the other have a cardiac issue and the blood pressure tends to go down. “We basically classify them into febrile inflammatory states, Kawasaki disease type and toxic shock syndrome. In around 15-20%, we see the toxic shortage syndrome and children usually have stomach aches. First six hours in all the three kinds of MIS-C issues are crucial,” Gupta said. As per data shared by Gupta, Gurgaon has around 80 cases while Delhi has 108 as on Saturday. Out of this, Apollo has 18 cases, St Stephen’s 10, Saroj Hospital 5, Max Shalimar Bagh 20, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalya 10, Max Saket 10 and Jaipur Golden Hospital and Saroj Hospital have 5 patients each. Doctors state that early recognition of the disease is a must. Speaking to TOI, Dr Arvind Kumar, director and HOD, paediatrics, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh said, “I feel the next four weeks will be crucial as the number of cases is going down and usually the MIS-C symptoms show post 3-4 weeks later only. One must watch for symptoms like fever for 3-4 days, abdomen pain, loose motions, red eyes or rashes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-gear-up-to-deal-with-kids-facing-post-covid-complications/articleshow/83128020.cms||Sakshi Chand

Superintendent of police, Balrampur, Hemant Kutiyal said, “A 39-second video of the dumping of the body of Covid victim, Prem Nath Mishra, into the river went viral on different social media platforms on May 29. In the video, a man wearing a PPE suit was seen with another person in black shirt and blue jeans holding a body packed in a PPE kit. They then opened the PPE cover and threw the body into the river under Kotwali Dehat police station area,” said Kutiyal. A probe was ordered and the chief medical officer of Balrampur, Dr VB Singh, was asked to submit a report. “A probe was conducted which revealed that Prem Nath Mishra from Shohratgarh in Siddharthnagar was admitted to district memorial hospital in Balrampur on May 25. The next day, Prem Nath tested positive and his treatment started at L2 district hospital. However, he succumbed to infection on May 28,” added Dr Singh. He said the body of Prem Nath was handed over to his nephew, Sanjay Kumar, around 12 pm on May 29 by an ambulance driver, Rampreet, at Sisai ghat. “The body was wrapped in a PPE kit as per Covid-19 protocol. However, hours later a video showing the body being thrown into the river went viral,” the CMO said. “On the complaint of the ambulance driver, an FIR under the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act has been lodged against Sanjay and his associate Manoj. More sections of the IPC will be levelled against the duo,” the SP said. Ever since the reports of people dumping bodies into the Ganga came to the fore, the UP police has started patrolling by boats to prevent disposal of bodies in rivers. The state government is also offering a support of Rs 5,000 for dignified cremation of the deceased whose families cannot afford the last rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-arrested-after-video-of-covid-victims-body-being-dumped-into-river-goes-viral/articleshow/83099240.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Daily vaccination crosses 12,000 mark for first time in Sangam city||PRAYAGRAJ: The pace of Covid-19 vaccination has gradually picked pace in Sangam city as the daily number of inoculations crossed the 12,000 mark for the first time on Saturday. Officials of the health department have attributed the rising awareness level among recipients of all age groups living in urban and semi-urban pockets for the rush at urban-based vaccination centres. However, the rural-based vaccination centres are yet to witness the rise in the number of vaccine recipients, especially in the middle-aged recipients. More than 70 per cent of recipients were from the age group between 18-44 years and were more open to vaccination, revealed the centre officers as well as the figures. Nodal officer (vaccination) and additional chief medical officer Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “In urban areas, most of the recipients believe that vaccination is the only key to beat the virus and as a result, there has been an increase in the number of recipients at urban-based vaccination centres”. On the other hand, officials of the health department are finding it difficult to erase the myths regarding vaccination among rural people, particularly middle-aged and aged people who refuse to get a vaccine administered when contacted by primary health workers or Anganwadi workers. As many as 5,59,144 Covid vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, including to those above 45 years and between 18-44 years, in the district till May 30. While 4,53,121 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,06,422 recipients had also received the second dose of the vaccine. Officials have now decided to ramp up the vaccination exercise of recipients between the 18-44 age group, which was earlier underway at 35 sites, to 60 sites now. The authorities have also taken up the administering of the second dose of vaccine at 10 centres. Figures of health department revealed that "on an average, over 10,000 vaccine dose were administered to beneficiaries daily of all age groups including 45 plus and recipients between the age group of 18-44 years. For instance, a total of 12,147 vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups in the past 24 hours which included 10,418 recipients of the first dose and 1,729 of the second dose. On May 28, 27 and 26, as many as 10372, 10655 and 11456 recipients were administered doses respectively. Figures also revealed that the number of vaccine recipients aged between 18-44 year age group was three times more than the recipients aged above 45 years. More and more youngsters lined up all rural and urban-based centres to get themselves vaccinated. Officials claimed about 60 per cent of the district population falls in the age category of 18-44 years and the majority of them live in rural and semi-urban areas. "The good thing is that recipients of this age group are quite excited and enthusiastic to get the vaccine," claimed an official. Moreover, the health department has also roped in youngsters, those already vaccinated, appealing to them to promote vaccination among their friends, relatives and near and dear ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/daily-vaccination-crosses-12k-mark-for-first-time-in-city/articleshow/83093761.cms||---

Villagers, angered by continuous supply of dirty water, protested on Sunday by locking the village’s waterworks and warned that if officials do not come to the village to hear their problem, they will protest by climbing atop the local water taken on Monday. Villagers said drinking water supply in the village had been continuously mixed with drainage water, about which all employees and officials of the water supply department were made aware of, but no permanent solution had been reached by the district administration. They said the main reason for this was that the supply pipeline in the village was old and had been damaged from many place, due to which drain water would mix in the drinking water supply. Earlier, on Satrday, angry villagers on Sunday gheraoed the waterworks under the banner of All India Kisan Sabha and started an indefinite protest. At noon, the junior engineer of the department reached Dabwali. Negotiations with the engineer lasted for an 1 hour, but he did not give a satisfactory reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/dirty-water-chautala-residents-lock-waterworks-to-climb-tank/articleshow/83098144.cms||---
---||Delhi||Gautam Gambhir clean chit not worth the paper it’s written on: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Trashing a purported clean chit to BJP MP Gautam Gambhir by the capital’s drug controller over allegations of hoarding fabiflu, the Delhi high court on Monday said “it is not worth the paper it is written on.” A furious bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh rapped the drug controller department of Delhi for not properly examining how Gambhir procured a huge quantity of Covid-19 medicines. “He interdicted flow of medicines that would have gone to normal supply and been available to patients. We all know there was a shortage of fabiflu in the second wave. How can the inquiry report say there was ample supply,” the bench asked advocate Nandita Rao, who appeared for the department. “The report is not worth the paper it is written on. This is trash...there is no legal basis to it,” the high court said, slamming the department for saying the drug was not in short supply. The high court added, “You want us to shut our eyes. You think you would get away with this? You can't take us for a ride. If you think we are so gullible, so naive, we are not. You better do your job. If you can't do your job, tell us, we will have you suspended and let someone else do your job”. The high court also took exception to Gambhir’s statement in the media that he will continue doing such work. “We want to curb this malpractice. This is a pernicious activity. This tendency of people taking advantage and then trying to appear as a saviour when they themselves created the problem has to be denounced. And then, the person goes around saying he will do it again. If he does, we know how to deal with it,” the high court warned. The court was irked that the drug controller didn’t investigate if Gambhir’s foundation had licence to procure medicines in such huge quantities from a dealer and rejected the report. “We are rejecting your (drug controller) report. Our confidence is shaken. It is entirely up to you to restore it,” the court told Rao. The high court was hearing a PIL filed by Deepak Singh, through advocate Virag Gupta, against political leaders. The court had found a prima facie case against Gambhir over hoarding fabiflu, and against AAP MLAs Priti Tomar and Praveen Kumar over distributing medical oxygen cylinders. On Monday, it expressed satisfaction with the drug controller giving a clean chit to Tomar and ended proceedings against her, while asking for a fresh report against Kumar and Gambhir by Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gambhir-clean-chit-not-worth-the-paper-its-written-on-hc/articleshow/83128106.cms||Abhinav Garg

The therapy had recently got approval from India’s Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO). “A 55-year-old male Covid-19 patient became the first recipient of the ‘cocktail therapy’ in Lucknow on Sunday. He was administered the drug by Dr Ruchita Sharma. The patient has witnessed good reduction in symptoms and viral load. Currently, the cost of the therapy is Rs 60,000,” director, Medanta Hospital, Dr Rakesh Kapoor said. Managing director of Apollomedics Super Speciality Hospital Dr Mayank Somani said, “The monoclonal antibodies cocktail therapy, also known as ‘Trump Cocktail’, is now available at our hospital. The method of treatment is effective in mild or moderate Covid-19 in which oxygen support is not required. A patient should be given the therapy within 10 days of testing positive for the infection.” Experts said the cocktail therapy was administered through a drug, Regeneron, a combination of two artificial antibodies – Castrivimab and Imdevimab – developed in labs. It has been found that the cocktail of antibodies block the entry of novel coronavirus in human cell, thus preventing it from replicating and damaging the cell before moving on to other cells in the body. The drug is administered in the body of a patient through intravenous method which takes around an hour. The patient is then kept under observation for one hour before being sent home, if there are no complications. The therapy is generally given to patients with comorbidities in whom the possibility of Covid-19 turning severe is high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/trump-cocktail-therapy-for-covidtreatment-available-in-two-city-hosps/articleshow/83099055.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Varanasi||Varanasi-Hanumana highway mired in controversy||VARANASI: The Varanasi-Hanumana (MP border) highway, part of Varanasi-Kanyakumari national highway-7, is mired in controversy these days. The problem arose when the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) conducted the destructive testing on a bridge road constructed over the Belan river. It triggered an uproar in local circles with BJP leaders claiming that the newly-constructed bridge has suffered extensive damage. Refuting these charges, the NHAI has clarified that the confusion is caused due to debris left on the project site during the process of destructive testing which is a routine process conducted before opening the road or bridge for the people’s use. However, taking note of the BJP leaders’ allegations, divisional commissioner, Mirzapur, Yogeshwar Ram Mishra has set up a team to probe the matter. The Rs 2,100 crores NH-7 project has to be completed in three phases by May 2022. Following the non-destructive testing, load testing and destructive testing conducted by the NHAI on the newly constructed bridge on the Belan river in Lalganj-Hanumana section of the project recently, the local BJP leaders started claiming that road of the bridge has suffered damage. BJP’s state working committee member Manoj Srivastava said, “I had written to Union surface transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and commissioner on Saturday and demanded a probe into the matter. It is possible that carelessness during the testing process caused the damage.” However, NHAI project director, Mirzapur, RS Yadav said that “a construction company which had constructed the bridge had asked NHAI on May 18 to conduct the non-destructive and destructive tests which are mandatory before opening it for the public use.” The confusion started when engineers after conducting the tests on the Belan bridge left the debris on the road, he said and added that seeing the debris the locals started claiming that the newly constructed road had suffered damage. Yadav said that the testing usually took a month’s time and parts which got damaged during the destructive testing are repaired by the working agency. When TOI contacted commissioner, he said, “After receiving the complaints I formed a team of technical experts to probe the matter. This team inspected the site and has not found anything wrong.” According to Yadav, Varanasi-Hanumana highway, which is part of Varanasi-Kanyakumari NH-7, is being converted into four and six lanes over 125-km stretch from Tengra Mod (Ramnagar) in Varanasi to Hanumana on MP border. The Rs 2,100 crores project is being executed in three phases, including Lalganj-Hanumana phase-III of Rs 677 crores.

Investigations revealed that he had seven children from his first marriage to a Muslim woman in Azamgarh. Lodging an FIR with the Indiranagar police, the complainant alleged that the accused, Abid Hawari, who posed as a police officer Aditya Singh, sexually exploited her and extorted Rs 16 lakh from her.

He introduced himself as Aditya Singh from the crime branch of UP police. He told her that he was a widower and had a child from the marriage. She alleged that Abid played an emotional card inveigled her into love. A couple of months later, Aditya revealed his real identity as Abid Hawari and asked her to marry him as per his religious customs.

Oil removal started after 1,000 litres leaked into the sea, which was contained using booms within a radius of 400 metres around the barge. The oil was stored in the barge as lubricant for machinery. Diesel too was stored on the vessel for operations like generating electricity. The barge is about 2 km from Palghar’s Wadrai Coast, where the depth of sea is up to three metres at places. Fifteen tanks of capacity 1,000 litres each have been sent to the location for oil removal, and 70 more will reach within three days, said a shipping industry source. The tanks are being hauled by small mechanised boats. No oil spill has been reported onshore yet. “Neither has a breach of the oil tanks aboard the barge been reported. Work is on to recover the spilt oil, which has been contained around the grounded barge with the help of booms,” a source from the Directorate General of Shipping told TOI. The oil captured within the boom radius is being removed by absorbent pads. The barge’s operator had hired it from Tirupati Vessels and has engaged Smit Salvage and the firm Seacare for removal of oil from the barge. “POL (petrol, oil, and lubricant) onboard is 79 KL, which will be pumped into plastic tanks of 1,000 litres. A total of 85 tanks will be used to transport the barge’s POL,” said an official. “The Coast Guard is closely monitoring the situation and the district administration has been alerted for immediate clean-up if any oil reaches the shore,” said a spokesperson. Meanwhile, DNA reports are still awaited for identifying 29 deceased crew of the sunken barge P-305. The vessel’s captain is among the 29. The Yellow Gate police, probing the barge’s sinking in the cyclone, in which 75 crew died, has handed over 53 bodies to next of kin till date. ONGC teams have visited the site and interacted with Smit engineers. An ONGC official said, “The oil company is working in close coordination with the vessel and the chartered company and is fully committed to extending all required help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-85-floating-tanks-to-remove-79000-litres-of-barges-oil/articleshow/83098181.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Lucknow||BJP ‘Sewa’ campaign to lend healing touch, blunt Opposition narrative & get grassroots feedback||Lucknow: BJP’s decision to mobilise its cadre across the country on Sunday — a move coinciding with PM Narendra Modi’s seven years in office — to lend a healing touch to Covid-hit families is part of its aggressive strategy to counter the Opposition narrative of pandemic mismanagement. A top UP BJP leader confirmed to TOI that the campaign, ‘Sewa hi Sangathan’ was indeed aimed to dispel apprehensions fuelled by Opposition parties on handling of the pandemic by the BJP government. In case of UP, senior BJP leaders, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath along with his cabinet colleagues, MPs, MLAs, MLCs and party organisational leaders were roped in to carry out relief operations in 20,326 villages. While MPs, MLAs and organisational leaders were asked to personally supervise relief in the rural heartland, CM Yogi and a host of ministers virtually uplinked to villages. “The idea was not only to send a message to the grassroots about BJP doing its bit to help people in crisis, but also to seek feedback on existing loopholes in the system and correct them accordingly,” the BJP leader said. Party sources said, the campaign was the brainchild of BJP national president J P Nadda after the party decided against celebrations on completion of PM Modi’s seventh anniversary in office in wake of a lethal second wave. Last year, on the sixth anniversary of BJP government, the party released a nine-minute video highlighting achievements of PM Modi’s government. “This year, after the debilitating second Corona wave, the party decided to go to the people while observing Corona protocol,” he said. BJP’s in charge of the campaign in UP and state general secretary, Govind Narayan Shukla said, cadre is equipped with various relief materials, including ration kits, medicine, sanitizer and masks for being distributed to people in select villages. “We were able to achieve our target,” he said. This came a day after the state unit organised blood donation camps in districts. The campaign also comes after the chief minister went into an overdrive and personally toured all divisions to step up relief measures, essentially in rural areas. He later held a virtual interaction with gram pradhans apprising them about his government’s step to mitigate the pandemic, which spread out in over 30% rural areas in the state. BJP sources said, the campaign was also aimed to motivate the flagging morale of party workers and direct their energy for a cause ahead of the high-stakes assembly elections next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-sewa-campaign-to-lend-healing-touch-blunt-oppn-narrative-get-grassroots-feedback/articleshow/83099131.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Lucknow||It’s a raging battle on multiple fronts for elderly patients||The elderly population is most vulnerable to any infection, be it cacterial, fungal or viral. What makes them an easy target to such infections is decreased immunity, ageing body vital organs, reduced resources both in terms of social support and financial constraints, lack of health insurance mediclaim policies for super senior citizens and burden of various longstanding metabolic diseases like diabetes mellites, blood pressure, chronic kidney and liver diseases, auto immune diseases etc. The corona virus infection has been classified into mild, moderate and severe. Majority of Covid infection in elderly population is mild and takes two to three weeks to settle and is generally dealt under home isolation. But in certain cases, the disease is moderate or severe which may attack the vital organs like lungs, kidney, heart and even brain. Such patients may need intensive care, use of high-flow oxygen, ventilators and other treatments to manage these complications. In this ongoing pandemic for more than a year now we have noticed that even when the elderly patients becomes Covid negative, the post-Covid care is very important for next three to four weeks post hospitalization to prevent secondary infections, as the body gets so weak during two weeks of hospitalization and aggressive intensive care treatment that it gets predisposed to various infections, both hospital-acquired and commonly found in our surroundings. Thre are simple things one can do to help our elderly recover fast. Keep them well hydrated, give them small meals frequently rather than giving routine three meals and make them do chest exercises. Spirometry and rehabilitation play a very vital role in increasing the vital lung capacity; early mobilization and physiotherapy are important to maintain the tone of muscles; strict control of common metabolic illnesses like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypothyroidism is very vital, we should have special emphasis on the mental and psychosocial health of the elders as most of them suffer from common issues like isolation, depression, anxiety and insecurity. We have to keep a close eye on the vital signs like monitoring of pulse, oxygen saturation, temperature, etc. and any change in parameters or showing of new symptoms like unexplained headache, blurred vision, fall in oxygen saturation, sudden swelling around nose, eyes should be urgently discussed with your doctors. Geriatric post-Covid rehabilitation centers are of great help for those elderly patients who have not recovered completely and even after three to four weeks of aggressive medical treatment in hospitals and still require oxygen or ventilator support to maintain their oxygen saturation, long-term-care rehabilitation centers would be right choice for such patients, where the emphasis is to strengthen the functional capacity of the declining organ, so that the patient can become self-sustaining. We should not forget that the elders generally don’t present with classical symptoms of their illness, so we as caregivers should keep a close eye on our elders so that we can provide medical assistance before things worsen and we should spend more time with them.

The police also seized 96,000 vehicles for violation while 52 lakh persons were booked for not wearing the mask. Each UP district has created a unit to enforce Covid protocols on the directive of CM Yogi Adityanath. ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar said more than 64,000 FIRs have also been registered since March 2020 against the violators. “Nobody would be allowed to flout the rules to check the spread of coronavirus,” he said. Police are also clicking photographs of violators through body-worn cameras in commissionerates of Lucknow, Noida, Kanpur and Varanasi, the officer said. ADG added that police force is also providing food, water and other basic needs of sustenance to the needy in the curfew. Cops have been told not to harass public in the name of enforcing the curfew. Counselling sessions have also been held at UP 112 for cops on behaviour management. Kumar said police have framed a two-pronged strategy — macro level containment zone management and micro containment zone management — for enforcement of Covid protocols in the state. “There are 24,804 containment zones in the state in which 30,000 cops have been deployed,” the DG added. On the directions of DGP HC Awasthy, cops above 50 years have also not been deployed in the containment zones. Instead, additional 120 companies of PAC have been deployed in the containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-4l-booked-in-state-for-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/83099110.cms||---

The SAD chief was here to attend a function to mark the birth anniversary of Sri Arut ji Maharaj, the founder of the Arora Samaj, along with senior leaders Rajinder Deepa and Dr Mohinder Kumar Rinwa. Asserting that the Arora community had played a big role in strengthening the economy and producing stalwarts like Hargobind Khurana, Kalpana Chawla, Lt Gen J S Aurora and Amrita Pritam, Sukhbir announced that once the SAD formed the government in the state, it would construct a befitting memorial in the name of Sri Arut Maharaj. Sukhbir said the government had reduced power tariff for consumers who had 2kw connections and consumed less than 200 units. “This category should be supplied power free of cost as was done earlier during the erstwhile SAD-led government,” he said. “It is shocking that instead of giving relief to the common man as well as trade and industry by waiving power bills for a six-month period, the state government is resorting to cheap gimmicks by projecting a relief where none has been actually given”. The SAD chief also allghed that a ‘goonda raj’ had been prevailing in Abohar by Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and consoled a family which approached him to state that Jakhar was protecting people in his native village against whom a murder charge had been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-claims-on-reducing-power-tariff-false-sad/articleshow/83098158.cms||Dinesh K Sharma

Speaking at a memorial in remembrance of Sorabjee, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said the contribution of Sorabjee in the evolution of Indian jurisprudence is immense which could not be described in a few words. Terming him an “epitome of grace, modesty, humility, integrity and kindness”, CJI Ramana said Sorabjee inspired him to continue in the profession. “He was a man with an unflinching faith in the constitutional ideals, particularly those relating to the freedom of speech and human rights. He was a defender of civil liberties during the tough Emergency era. He played a crucial role in some of the most iconic cases which have defined the legal landscape of this great nation. He assisted Nani Palkhivala in the Golaknath and Kesavananda Bharati cases. As a counsel, and subsequently the attorney general of India, he argued many landmark cases such as Maneka Gandhi, D C Wadhwa and S R Bommai. It can be said in unequivocal terms that he played a pivotal role in crafting our country’s jurisprudence. He brought honor and glory not only to himself, but to the institution as a whole,” Justice Ramana said. SC judge Justice D Y Chandrachud said he agreed to accept judgeship only on Sorabjee’s advice. “When I was asked to be a judge, I turned to Soli for advice. Soli said ‘you have to answer the call of service’. I accepted that advice of my mentor,” he said. Justice U U Lalit said Sorabjee excelled in all branches of law and had always been a champion of human rights and rights of minorities in his life and one area which was very dear to him was freedom of expression, free press and Article 19(1)(a).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judges-lawyers-pay-tribute-to-rights-crusader-soli-sorabjee/articleshow/83101948.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Beer sales soar, India Made Foreign Liquor sales dip in price-sensitive Bengal||KOLKATA: There has been a massive dip in India Made Foreign Liquor demand while that for beer has witnessed a jump in the state even though liquor was perceived to be less price sensitive than petroleum products. The demand for beer and IMFL for the last four months clearly shows that even during the pandemic beer consumption in the first four months of 2021 has increased almost three times. On the contrary, the consumption of IMFL in the state in the last quarter of 2020-21 (January-February-March 2021) was down by 28% compared to the same period of 2019-20. The trend continued in April this year as well. The price of IMFL has increased by almost 40%-50% in the last year while that of beer was slashed by 20%-30%, depending on brand, in October 2020. An executive of a top beer company said there has been a robust growth in beer demand since the fall in price last year. “We are getting an encouraging response,” the executive said. Going by the figure available in January this year, beer demand was 7.4 lakh cases from 3.7 lakh cases in January 2020. In February, too, there was a growth while in March and April this year, which are among peak seasons for beer, the growth was three times — from 6.3 lakh cases in March 2020 to 16.7 lakh cases this March and from 2,875 cases during the lockdown in April 2020 to 16.7 lakh cases this April. The detailed May figure was not available, but it was much higher than last year. In case of IMFL, the available data said the consumption in January-March this year was 2.5 million cases while for the whole fiscal of 2020-21, the consumption was a little over 10 million cases, which also witnessed a decline of around 30%. Bengal has an annual market of 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer. In the first four months of 2021, beer consumption crossed 50 lakh cases, almost 60% of the annual consumption in the state. Considering the fact that March to August is the peak time for beer, the three more peak months left may see beer consumption cross 1 crore cases in Bengal. The director general of Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, Vinod Giri, said that the trends confirm that alcohol is a price-elastic product. According to him, the inclination of some states to impose high taxes on alcohol, assuming it will yield greater revenue, is greatly misplaced. “As the data shows, fall in sales on account of higher taxes negates expected increase in governments’ revenues. Higher prices on account of higher taxes not only lower case sales, but also force consumers to downgrade to cheaper options,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/beer-sales-soar-imfl-sales-dip-in-price-sensitive-bengal/articleshow/83096667.cms||---

Build Covid care centre||Thiruvananthapuram: The state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) has mandated setting up of a Covid care facility at 1% of total project cost as one of the conditions for the environmental clearance (EC) for a multi-level car parking (MLCP) facility project of a luxury hotel in the city. EC has been issued for the MLCP building with a floor area of 10,046/26 sq.m for 5 years. “Considering the pandemic situation in the state, the project proponent shall carry out certain activities under corporate environmental responsibility (CER) leading to creation of temporary Covid care facilities and other related activities connected with managing Covid-19 in the state. This will be done in consultation with local self-governments and as per an action plan approved by district collector and State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC). The indicated cost for this component will be one percent of total project cost for which the present EC is given,” says one of the conditions mandated by SEIAA. In addition to this, usual conditions like housing of construction labour with necessary infrastructure and facilities planting tree saplings on the land boundary have also been included. Killiyar rejuvenation is another condition for EC according to which it should be implemented within three years in consultation with the city corporation. Recently, a realtor was also asked to prepare an action plan for Killiyaar rejuevenation as part of granting EC for a housing project in the city. The project proponent----a major hospitality group---submitted application for EC for the MLCP building within the existing hotel in Thycaud village. The hotel is spread over 19.665.37 sq.m while the proposed MLCP building measures over 10,000 sq.m The project cost for the existing and the proposed buildings has been pegged at Rs 300 crore. Owing to the difference in dates of construction of the hotel building and the MLCP, the authority assessed the requirement of EC as two different components and the state expert appraisal committee cited that there is no need to consider the present project as an expansion of the existing project for which the EC was not given by SEIAA. But the authority observed that an EIA (Environment Impact Assessment) report and EMP (Environment Management Plan) were prepared combining both the projects and EC was sought for a total area of 29,711.63 sq. m. as it exceeds the prescribed limit of 20,000 sq. SEAC had recommended for issue of EC for the total area of 29,711.63 sq. m, but SEIAA decided to issue EC only for the MLCP building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/need-green-clearance-build-covid-care-centre/articleshow/83096664.cms||Aswin J Kumar

A total of 30 farm organisations are jointly staging protests at nearly 100 places across the state. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) is doing so at about 40 places. Toll collection companies have suffered heavy losses on account of the protests. According to an estimate by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), toll collection of nearly Rs 700 crore has been lost. Because of the revenue loss, a number of temporary and contractual employees of these companies have lost their jobs while a few regular employees have not received salaries. For the last eight months, farmers have been reaching protest sites in large numbers every day and returning in the evening. “Despite many farmers camping at Delhi borders, these protests have not lost its sheen,” said BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) state press secretary Balwant Singh, who was sitting at Barnala railway station protest site. BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) district Bathinda general secretary Resham Singh Yatri said, “Our protests are unabated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/8-months-on-farm-protests-rage-in-punjab/articleshow/83098246.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Kolhapur||Congress condemns, BJP hails Modi govt||Kolhapur: The seven years of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre received mixed reviews from politicians in Kolhapur. While, understandably, the local BJP workers showered praises, the Congress workers criticised the central government’s failures. BJP workers, led by state president Chandrakant Patil, hailed the last seven years of the Modi government as “the government of the poor." Chandrakant Patil gave certificates of appreciation to the ASHA workers for their work during Covid and offered them gifts on the occasion. The BJP is celebrating the day as ‘Seva Hi Sanghatan’. At the same time, Kolhapur district guardian minister and district Congress president Satej Patil led a protest at the party’s office. Everyone had tied black ribbons to their arms as sign of protest. Also, placards with Modi’s image with different failed policies were put up on the premises. Satej Patil said, “During this unprecedented pandemic, the Modi government has failed to provide any relief to the citizens. The farmers have been protesting against the Acts passed by the government in Parliament. However, Modi did not shed a tear. Only when the Covid situation spiralled out of control did he shed tears. For the first time, inflation has reached such a high, petrol prices have crossed the Rs 100-mark and unemployment too is at its highest in the country.” Chandrakant Patil said, “In the past seven years, we have seen unprecedented development across India. We are celebrating the day in 400 villages in Kolhapur district.” On allegations that the Centre is responsible for petrol prices crossing the Rs 100-mark, Patil said let the state government first reduce taxes to bring down the prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/congress-condemns-bjp-hails-modi-govt/articleshow/83092600.cms||---

We have staff deployed on the ground and data shows that to avoid deaths people need to get vaccinated. Therefore, I urge the citizens to bring the elders in their famiy to vaccination centres at the earliest,” he added.Desai also rubbished the claims made by many opposition leaders stating that the district tops in mortality rate. “Around 3,000 patients who are actual natives of the district have succumbed to the infection. Currently, Kolhapur district has a mortality rate of around 3.90% which is much less than many districts in the state. Also, we have around 700 deaths per million population. Many districts in the state and country have same proportion around 1,100 to 1,200 deaths per million population,” Desai said.“Kolhapur stands on top in vaccination proportion. Over 65% of the district population above the age of 45 have been vaccinated. The administration has set a target to vaccinate around 15 lakh people and recently district has crossed 10 lakh vaccinations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-vaccination-key-to-reduce-fatalities-kolhapur-collector/articleshow/83092573.cms||---

According to the health department data, 39% of the population of the district has received the first vaccine dose. It’s almost a similar scenario in Udham Singh Nagar where just 35% of the population has been administered the first dose of the vaccine. All other districts have performed better in terms of inoculation. Among the nine hill districts of the state, eight have managed to administer the first dose of the vaccine to 70% of their population while in Pithoragarh, 59% of the population has taken the first dose. Notably, 93% of the population of Bageshwar above the age group of 45 years has been given the first dose. This is the highest by any district in the state. This district has fully vaccinated 37% of its population. This, again, is the highest by any district in the state. Meanwhile, commenting on the poor performance of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts in terms of vaccination, Dr Saroj Naithani, director of National Health Mission (NHM), said that both these districts have been sent multiple reminders to pick pace but to no avail. In the meantime, health watchers have expressed concern over the pace of the vaccination drive in Uttarakhand. “If we continue with the current pace, 70% of our population would be fully vaccinated only by the end of 2022,” said social activist Anoop Nautiyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccine-drive-haridwar-us-nagar-worst-performers/articleshow/83087308.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||India was home to a variety of sea cows millions of years ago, only one variety survives now: Study||DEHRADUN: A study done by IIT Roorkee on sea animals and mammals like whales and sea cows has found that India was home to at least four varieties of sea cows, or dugongs -- an endangered species of herbivorous marine mammals — some 34 to 56 million years ago during the geological period called Eocene epoch. “Only one of these varieties survives in India’s marine waters currently although there was an amazing diversity of these creatures in India in the prehistoric past,” said Sunil Bajpai, professor at department of earth sciences, IIT-R, who has authored the study along with his students. He added that India in recent years has contributed significantly to the research on the Order Sirenia (sea cows) using traces of fossils (mostly skulls) found from the country’s oceans, especially Kutch in Gujarat. Presently, the sea cow population in the country is concentrated in the Gulf of Kutch, the Gulf of Mannar, Palk Bay (Tamil Nadu) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands  “There is serious danger of these sea cows becoming extinct if concerted efforts are not made for their conservation. The World Dugong Day is celebrated every year on May 28 to create awareness about this growing threat to sea cows by human activities such as the destruction and modification of dugong habitats, rampant illegal fishing activities, pollution, vessel strikes, unsustainable hunting or poaching, and unplanned tourism,” Bajpai said. The four dugong varities that were present in the pre-historic past in the country are believed to be Bharatisiren Indica, which lived 20 million years ago, Domningia sodhae, which lived 20 million years ago, Bharatisiren kachchhensis, which lived 20 million years ago and Ashokia antiqua, which lived 42 million years ago. “It is exciting to see fossil evidence that suggests India was a cradle of evolution and biodiversity in the past,” said Ajit Chaturvedi, director, IIT Roorkee, while commenting on the study conducted by the department of earth sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/india-was-home-to-a-variety-of-sea-cows-millions-of-years-ago-only-one-variety-survives-now-iit-r-study/articleshow/83094551.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||‘Ulhasnagar civic body should pay for structural audit’||ULHASNAGAR: The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) has issued notices to over 990 buildings asking the residents to get a structural audit done within 15 days, but residents say that they have been hit financially by the Covid-19 pandemic and cannot afford the fees for it. They say the UMC should bear the expenses now and recover the money from them by adding it to their property tax bill. The residents say structural auditors in the city charge between Rs 80,000 to Rs 2 lakh for a structural audit, depending on as the size of the building. The UMC started issuing the notices after the Mohini Palace building collapse on May 15. Only four buildings have applied for a structural audit since. BJP corporator Raju Jagiasi said he met municipal commissioner Raja Dayanidhi and presented him the residents’ demand. In a related development, Dayanidhi held an online meeting with all ward officers and deputy municipal commissioners and asked them to identify dangerous buildings afresh, as both buildings that collapse in the past fortnight were not on the UMC list of dangerous buildings. “I have given instructions to all our civic officers to identify those building which are dangerous and for same have asked them to take help of old records, especially buildings on which partially action was taken during the 1990s ... and also buildings which were constructed in the year 1994-1995 using inferior quality of sand, so that such buildings can be evacuated on priority basis,” Dayanidhi said. The UMC is also planning to use vacant isolation wards for Covid-19 patients, halls and dharmshalas for temporary rehabilitation purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ulhas-civic-body-should-pay-for-structural-audit/articleshow/83098334.cms||Pradeep Gupta

---||Kochi||Corp faces new hurdles in the way of project implementation||Kochi: Kochi corporation council is meeting on Monday to give its nod for plan fund projects. The local body authorities had failed to secure approvals for the projects from the council as well as from the district planning council (DPC) before March when the model code of conduct came into force and it led to stalemate in project implementation.Even though the corporation council is set to give its approval for the projects on Monday, there are many hurdles in the way of project implementation. “There are a total of 866 projects which are to be cleared. These projects include many important works like that of the new shed to house the windrow compost plant at Brahmapuram. Once the projects get approval from the DPC, we will be able to start the works,” said corporation development standing committee chairman P R Reneesh.At the same time, many of the local bodies, including Kochi corporation, are yet to name their nominees in the DPC. “The corporation’s nominees in the DPC are yet to be selected. Even if the council gives clearance for projects, it will take quite some time for the projects to get the approval from the DPC. This will further delay the project implementation,” said opposition leader Antony Kureethra. “The government had given instructions to the local bodies to complete all formalities and secure a nod from the DPC for the projects before March when the model code of conduct came into force. But the corporation authorities failed to complete the formalities prior to sending the projects to DPC approval. So, implementation of the projects, including many key ones, have been pending for the past three months,” Kureethra said. Even if the projects get the approval from the DPC, the works related to containing waterlogging and road projects can’t be started soon. “The onset of the monsoon will occur in a couple of days. Then, the roads work and projects to contain waterlogging can’t be started. Such works can be started only after the monsoon subsides in September,”Kureethra said. The corporation is already facing fund crunch as the government deducts funds the local body owes to various government departments. “Of the Rs 66 crore allotted as plan fund, the corporation will get only around Rs 17 crore after all deductions. The amount required for paying enhanced compensation for the owners of land taken over for setting up the solid waste treatment plant, emoluments for Asha workers, KWA bill arrears, etc. are the main deductions,” an official with the corporation said.Given the fact that the existing shed which houses the windrow compost unit at Brahmapuram may collapse anytime, the construction of a new shed assumes much significance. The construction of the plant for treating leachate from the windrow compost unit, where the entire solid waste generated in Kochi corporation and neighbouring local bodies are treated, should also be completed on a war footing. In February 2019, the national green tribunal (NGT) had ordered the corporation to set up a leachate plant urgently. In the absence of the plant, leachate from the windrow compost plant is percolated in the ground and later being drained out into the nearby Kadambrayar river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-faces-new-hurdles-in-the-way-of-project-implementation/articleshow/83096672.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Dehradun||Kumbh numbers not downgraded, claim Uttarakhand officials||DEHRADUN: Senior officials of Uttarakhand police have discounted reports which claimed that the pilgrim headcount of shahi snans was revised from 49 lakh to 21 lakh as claimed in some media reports recently, saying that “once an official estimate is released, it cannot be revised.” Denying making any downward revision of the number of people attending Kumbh Mela, Sanjay Gunjyal, Inspector General (IG), Kumbh, said, “The three shahi snan days that fell during the notified period of the one-month Kumbh this year saw over 34 lakh people taking a holy dip in Ganga." Providing a breakup, he said that 21.2 lakh people bathed in the river on April 12 on Somwati Amavasya, 13.5 lakh on Mesh Sankranti on April 14 and over 25,000 people on Chaitra Purnima on April 27. When asked about the procedure used in counting the number of pilgrims, Gunjyal said that “an artificial intelligence solution equipped with sophisticated cameras, along with a count of the tentative number of vehicles at border check posts and parking lots, was used for undertaking the head count.” The government’s denial came after some media reports claimed that the official attendance figure for the period between April 12 and 14 – when two major shahi snans took place -- was significantly less than what was claimed by the mela administration at that time. As per official data, endorsed by Kumbh Police, pilgrim footfall was 21.2 lakh on April 12, 4.5 lakh on April 13 and 13.5 lakh on April 14. The mela administration however had claimed soon after the shahi snans that 31 lakh people (not 21.2 lakh) took a dip on April 12. Commenting on the disparity in figures for the April 12 shahi snan, DGP Ashok Kumar said, “It seems that the figure of 31 lakh released on April 12 was a combined figure of the number of pilgrims gathered in Haridwar on April 10, 11 and 12. However, this would not result in any change in the overall figure of pilgrim headcount released by the government for the Kumbh Mela duration.” Efforts were made to contact Deepak Rawat, Mela Officer, whose office had released the footfall figures soon after the shahi snans but he could not be reached despite several attempts. Meanwhile, Gunjyal also claimed that “an analysis of the data pertaining to Kumbh numbers and Covid-positive cases doesn’t lend any credence to claims that the Kumbh Mela acted as a super-spreader event.” “Haridwar district conducted 8.91 lakh RT-PCR tests from January 1 to April 30, out of which only 1,954 (0.2%) were positive,” he said, adding that “out of the over 16,000 police personnel deployed in the Kumbh Mela area --who were in direct contact with pilgrims -- only 88 (around 0.5%) tested positive till April 30.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-numbers-not-downgraded-claim-ukhand-officials-day-after-reports-that-shahi-snan-figures-were-revised/articleshow/83094579.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Kolkata||Eggs get expensive due to low supply in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Price of eggs in Kolkata markets is going up at a time when dressed chicken is being sold at Rs 200 per kg. The retail price of an egg a week ago was around Rs 6 in most markets and now rose to Rs 7. On Sunday in the wholesale market there was a drop of 44 paise, said Sumit Deb of Kolkata Egg Merchants Association. From Rs 5.82 per egg the price has gone down to Rs 5.38, so the retail price too might go down in the next few days, Deb said. However, that would hardly get reflected in the price. He said a number of factors, including low production and supply from states like Andhra Pradesh are linked with price rise. Moreover, he said that due to extreme heat in summer the egg production also goes down. He added that some states are buying eggs to increase the protein intake of Covid patients so there is also a supply crunch for Bengal. The rise in fuel price and less supply of fish in Kolkata markets following the cyclone has led to the growing demand for eggs. Deb said the cost of an egg in Sealdah wholesale egg market was around Rs 5.9 a couple of days ago. So, in the retail markets, eggs were sold at between Rs 6.50 to Rs 7 per piece. A dozen is priced around Rs 78 to Rs 85 now. But even 10 days ago in retail markets, a dozen eggs would cost between Rs 68 to Rs 72. Kankurgachhi resident Tamal Das said in order to get a discount, he used to buy 30 eggs at once. Last week it was Rs 170, but on Sunday it was Rs 180.  Madan Mohan Maity, regional chairman of National Egg Coordination Committee said the increased cost of poultry feed is because Centre is exporting poultry feed without considering domestic demand. Also due to the cyclone poultry farmers sold chicken at a low price, so in Kolkata markets chicken price is between Rs 180-200.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eggs-get-expensive-due-to-low-supply/articleshow/83096673.cms||Debasish Konar
---||Chennai||Metro functions not for public, but to keep trains operational||Chennai: Metro rail services may have been suspended due to lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 during the second wave, but trains are being operated twice daily to keep them in good condition. Officials said two to four trains-each having four cars- are operated across both the corridors covering 45km early in the morning and late in the evening during the lockdown period. An official said they are operating it based on instructions from the ministry of housing and urban affairs to all metrorail services in the country. Also it was the only way to ensure the trains are kept ready for operation when services resume. CMRL operated trains across the corridors daily during the nearly five months of lockdown in 2020, before services were resumed in September 2020. Now, they are following the same procedure for the upkeep of their fleet.“We cannot keep the trains idle for a long time. Normally, when they are idle for a month, many of its parts like axle bearing and gear box get damaged or turn faulty due to the grease and oil present in it,” an official said. “Some time ago, Delhi metro kept new trains they procured idle for nearly six months because the line was not ready. Due to the pressure, the bottom edge of the train wheels began to flatten. Though such things happen only if the trains are kept idle for a very long period, we want to ensure our trains are in good condition,” the official said.At present, two trains each on the up line and down line are operated on two corridors twice a day. They stop at every station just like they would do during regular operations. The staff at every station is present during this operation.“We also operate the train in the train wash plant at the depot once in three days to clean the exterior. So, trains are running there too,” an official said. “Otherwise the scheduled regular train maintenance work is being undertaken during this period. No additional work is planned,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/metro-functions-not-for-public-but-to-keep-trains-operational/articleshow/83096670.cms||---
---||Bareilly||UP: Woman stopped from performing last rites of her husband as she didn’t have Aadhaar card||BAREILLY: A woman was stopped by a village head and a graveyard caretaker in Bareilly district from burying her husband as she didn't have an Aadhaar card. Hours later, it was only after help from a local social worker that she could bid goodbye to her dead husband. Police have now ordered a detailed probe. In her 30s, Shabnam hails from Kanpur district and used to lead a nomadic life with her husband, Zubair, and four little children. They travelled mainly in rural Uttar Pradesh selling knives and other small items. Shabham and Zubair took a brief break and were staying with their children inside a tarpaulin tent on the outskirts of Abhaypur Keshopur under Bhojipura police station limits. Her journey came to a tragic halt at the Bareilly village when her husband took his life after they had a "minor quarrel". Police investigation ruled out any foul play and the body was handed over to her after autopsy. On Friday, when Shabnam tried to bury her husband’s body in Bhojipura graveyard, she was denied permission. The caretaker asked for her Aadhaar card. And she had none. Even the local village head turned her away. The young widow with four minor kids and her dead husband by her side sat numb. A local social worker came to her rescue. Her husband was laid to rest at the private graveyard of an NGO, 'Awam-e-Khidmaat'. On Sunday, Shabnam told TOI, “We used to travel a lot. I don’t know why Zubair took this extreme step. He may have been under the influence of alcohol. Without an Aadhaar card, I wasn't allowed to give him a respectful burial. A social worker then took up my case.” Shakir Khan, the local social worker, said, “The woman is very poor. She can't afford to pay a donation for the grave. This is not the first such incident here. With God's grace, her husband has been buried with all the rituals at our private graveyard now.” When contacted, Bareilly ASP Rajkumar Agarwal said, “The man's burial was denied inside the local graveyard by the village head and others. We are investigating the matter and will take necessary action, if needed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-stopped-from-performing-last-rites-of-her-husband-as-she-didnt-have-aadhaar-card/articleshow/83092736.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||77 fresh cases of mucormycosis recorded last week across Pune district||PUNE: A total of 77 Covid-recovered patients were diagnosed with mucormycosis in Pune district last week, the district administration said in a report. The number of people diagnosed with the invasive fungal infection in the region has gone up to 694 — within the last two months. A total of 48 patients have succumbed so far and 126 have recovered from the infection, which mainly attacks the sinuses. At least 520 are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district. Doctors said shortages of critical anti-mucormycosis drugs like liposomal amphotericin B continue to hamper disease management. “Cases of mucormycosis are adding up each day and drug shortages are growing acute. We could distribute 100 vials of liposomal amphotericin B on Sunday among treating hospitals,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drugs), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune branch. A patient with mucormycosis treatment needs five to seven vials per day over 42 days or six weeks — that's about 250 vials per patient. For 502 patients currently undergoing treatment, the district will need about 2,600 vials daily if daily requirement per patient, per day, is pegged at five vials. Treating doctors, until recently, were relying on lipid emulsion or conventional amphotericin B and oral anti-fungal tablets to overcome shortages of liposomal amphotericin B. “But these basic drugs, including oral tablets such as posaconazole, are also now scarce,” said maxillofacial surgeon JB Garde. Oral tablets like posaconazole reduce the need for amphotericin. “But the posaconazole tablet has continued to remain in short supply in Pune,” Garde said. Over 11,700 cases of mucormycosis have been detected in India as of May 25. Going by this number, the required number of vials for the six-week treatment course would be over 29 lakh. Even with imports and boosted domestic production, what could be available may be much lower than demand, experts have said. Doctors have said that early warning symptoms of mucormycosis include stuffy nose, blackish discharge, pain and numbness over half of the face, swelling and loosening of teeth. A blackish discolouration on the tip of the nose or on the palate and blurred or double vision would be late signs, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/77-fresh-cases-of-mucormycosis-recorded-last-week-across-district/articleshow/83098335.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Chennai||Two new snake species take Tamil Nadu’s number to a century||CHENNAI: Two new species of non-venomous snakes have been found in Tamil Nadu, taking the number of snake species in the state to 100. Pratyush P Mohapatra, a member of the team of researchers from the Zoological Survey of India which found Joseph’s racer snake and Deepak’s wood snake in the Western Ghats area of Kanyakumari district and Srivilliputhur Meghamalai tiger reserve, said the first named was mistaken for another species due to its body pattern and movement before the five-year-long research established its distinctive identity. On Deepak’s wood snake, Pratyush said the species earlier found in the state was the Aanamalai wood snake. Most species are restricted to a narrow distributional range among the high reaches of the Western Ghats, but, Captain’s wood snake and the recently identified one named after Deepak have a wider distribution in the low to mid-elevations regions of the western flanks of the southern Western Ghats, he said. The current study found that Deepak’s wood snake was the only species to occur in the far southern end of the Western Ghats, where it is restricted to low and mid-elevations of the south-western slopes of the mountain range. Melpuram, Pathukani, Ambadi estate, Ashambu hills, Kulashekaram, Keeriparai and Thadikarankonam in Kanyakumari district are where snakes of this species have been seen, particularly in banana, coconut and rubber plantations, he said. The second species was recorded in the southeastern part of the state, said Surya Narayanan, another researcher, adding that it was given the name as it was first sighted by Naveen Joseph of Tuticorin. It closely resembles the banded racer, a species widely distributed in the country, and is also found in southeastern TN with a range overlapping northeastern TN. It is a harmless terrestrial reptile, distinguished from banded racer by patterns on the head and body. It grows up to less than a metre in length and feeds mainly on geckos, lizards and small rodents, he said. These snakes face a number of threats across their distributional range due to habitat destruction, with many being run over by speeding vehicles. In Tuticorin, a team is working on the rescue of this reptile from road-kills, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/2-new-snake-species-takes-tns-number-to-a-century/articleshow/83096675.cms||P Oppili
---||Kochi||‘Ernakulam may see 50 black fungus cases in three weeks’||KOCHI: District health authorities expect 50 more mucormycosis cases in Ernakulam in the next two- three weeks. As many as 10 cases were reported in the district till Saturday. Three cases were under treatment on Sunday. Of the 10, eight were diabetic patients. To the worry of healthcare workers, two of the 10 cases did not have any reported comorbidities. Another factor posing a challenge to the doctors is that mucormycosis (black fungus) is reported among active Covid cases too. Of the 10 cases, seven were active cases and three post-Covid patients. All the 10 cases fall in category C of Covid infection. It has also been noted that all the 10 patients are above 45 years of age. As Covid affects the immunity of the person, healthcare workers expect more cases in the coming days. “We had 1.3 lakh Covid cases in the past one month and many of them are at risk of getting black fungus infection. We are hopeful that we can manage the situation. Earlier is better since the patient may need surgical resection to remove the fungus and the infected parts. Doctors are aware of the infection since it was present even before the pandemic. If patients come to the hospitals, we have hope. Those with symptoms of the infection should approach the nearby hospital facility or post-Covid clinic,” said a district health official. At the time of discharge, patients have been sensitized to report symptoms of black fungus infection to healthcare workers even after full recovery from Covid. Meanwhile, doctors said there is adequate stock of the medicine in the district to treat mucormycosis infected patients. “We often see the infection in cancer patients or those undergoing treatment in a ventilator. Diabetes, lack of hygiene, and continued use of the same mask for days will lead to the fungal infection. We administer anti-fungal medicine for the treatment of the infection at better facilities as the patient should be under strict monitoring. There are many side effects for the anti-fungal medicine as it sometimes leads to kidney failure requiring dialysis. So, the patient should be under the utmost care of doctors. Some medicines like steroids increase blood sugar levels in Covid patients. If the patient is infected with black fungus while undergoing treatment for Covid, steroid is given minimally and the treatment is given along with Covid treatment. The patients, who have been under oxygen or ventilator support for long, are at high risk,” said another health official. However, all the 10 cases reported in the district so far were not under oxygen therapy. Health authorities are keeping their fingers crossed as more mucormycosis cases are expected in the district, which has witnessed more than three lakh Covid positive cases. “It is too early to comment about the outcome or other complications,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-may-see-50-black-fungus-cases-in-3-weeks/articleshow/83096686.cms||T C Sreemol

Nandini had won gold in the 53kg category, while Swati bagged the bronze in the 50kg category at the national championship. Because of the gold, Nandini emerged as a back-up to India’s top woman wrestler Vinesh Phogat who has qualified for the Olympics.However, over the past one-and-half years, both Nandini and Swati have been facing financial constraints. Due to the pandemic, the corporate support by way of Corporate Social Responsibility funds has been on and off. At the same, there have been no dangals — wrestling bouts that have handsome prize money — held anywhere in the region. The prize money from these dangals usually help wrestlers sustain themselves while they prepare for larger national competitions.Dadasaheb Lavate, Nandini and Swati’s coach, is leaving no stone unturned to prepare them for the coming national and international championships. The Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games are the international championships to be held next year. “Nandini, despite being out of the game for over a year due to knee injury, made a stupendous comeback and clinched a gold at the national championship. We are managing funds from one or another source. However, the funds required for the diet that the wrestlers need to prepare for big games is huge. Without a quality and adequate diet, it is futile to participate. We need continuous financial support to ensure that both wrestlers not just get the dietary support but also high-grade training from ace trainers.”Nandini lives with her mother and brother. Her father died when she was a child. Her mother works as a farm worker, sometimes as a domestic worker and also sells vegetables in the weekly markets. Swati’s father had been handicapped following an accident. Everyone in her family does their bit for survival. However, to pursue one’s passion requires much more than mere survival, said Lavate.Nandini, speaking to TOI, said: “The prize money I got from local dangals was of big help. Nowadays, there are no dangals held because of the pandemic. Whatever we — Swati and I — had, we invested that to prepare for the national championship. Both of us won medals and expected to get sponsorships. However, we are struggling to keep up with the level of training we need due to dietary limitations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/medal-winning-wrestlers-struggle-to-meet-dietary-needs/articleshow/83092733.cms||---

According to the PMC, there has been a 20% drop in early vaccination due to Covid. “Many parents avoided visiting hospitals due to fear of contracting Covid. But they should finish schedules, ahead of the monsoon,” said Anjali Tilekar, ward medical officer of the PMC. Tilekar added that there has been a small rise in routine vaccinations due to the drop in Covid cases. She urged parents to ensure at least the booster shots are given to children as soon as possible. Suryakant Deokar, immunization officer with the PMC, said, “The situation was the same during last year’s peak Covid phase. There was a drop in children’s vaccination through April and September 2020,” he said. An average of 2.5 lakh doses are given every year to children and infants. The PMC estimates a 20% drop in this number — across private and civic-run health units. “The drop in vaccinations is not a good sign. There are chances of flu-like symptoms and illnesses during the monsoon,” said Rajeev Joshi, a paediatrician.Joshi said routine vaccinations will ensure there’s no added concern for children’s health during Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-estimates-20-drop-in-routine-vaccinations-among-kids-this-year/articleshow/83098386.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Alternative healing methods aid in dealing with stress and emotional issues brought on by pandemic||With the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic leading to greater levels of stress and anxiety among people, many are switching to alternative healing methods — like pranic healing, reiki and numerology — to seek comfort. Pranic Healing, which works on the principle that the body has the innate ability to heal itself, has seen a lot of people being drawn towards it during the pandemic. World Pranic Healing Foundation, the body which oversees pranic healing practitioners, has been holding free online sessions since the beginning of the pandemic, which are being attended by numerous people. Mondreeta Sengupta, a pranic healing therapist, who alternates between Dehradun and Mumbai, said, “The practice of pranic healing has helped many people recover faster from the Covid-19 infection. Pranic Healing is a scientific modality inspired by nature and helps us keep our vibrations high, which in turn, doesn’t let the virus affect us deeply.” Those who have benefited from these therapies say that they feel they have had a positive effect on them. Tushar Gaur, who works at a multi-national company in Gurgaon, said, “My mother is an asthma patient and often faces breathing issues. I found that these healing therapies had a soothing effect on her and she is continuing with them along with her medical treatment.” In a similar vein, Varun Kukreja, a resident of Punjab, said, “Almost all the members of my family were experiencing anxiety and stress for the past few months as we had to sell some of our assets to recover the losses in the wake of the Covid-induced lockdown.” He added that “while searching on the internet for help, I stumbled upon numerology and reiki and took professional consultation from their practitioners which helped us get over our anxiety and we feel more at peace now.” Speaking to TOI about the rise in queries that she is getting ever since the pandemic broke, Shireen S Agarwal, a numerologist based in Bareilly, said, “People have been consulting us mainly on issues related to depression, anxiety and mental health problems. We are surrounded by numbers every minute of our lives and through the power of these numbers, we are helping people deal with stress.” Another numerologist, Ansshu Jain, said, “The pandemic has made people anxious. Almost everything - from health, job, business to mental peace is at stake. As numerologists, we are helping them with unique codes which are designed to heal specific areas of life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/alternative-healing-methods-aid-in-dealing-with-stress-and-emotional-issues-brought-on-by-pandemic/articleshow/83094660.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The auction was stopped at all APMCs in Nashik was halted for 11 days — from May 13 to May 23 — due to severe restrictions imposed by the district authorities for breaking the chain of Covid-19 infection. The auction resumed at Lasalgaon APMC from May 24, but only 500 trucks of onions were sold instead of over 1,500 vehicles before the restrictions. The daily arrivals of onions reduced by around 50% at Lasalgaon due to APMC’s decision to have limited auction of onions. This also led to rise in average wholesale price of onions. On Saturday, the average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 1,650 per quintal. The minimum and maximum wholesale prices of onion were recorded at Rs 800 and Rs 2,021 per quintal, respectively. Currently, the onions arriving at the APMCs are summer onions harvested in the month of March and April. Unlike kharif and late kharif onions, the summer onions have a shelf life of five-six months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them with a hope of getting better price for their produce. According to APMC officials, farmers have stored good quality onions wit them and are bringing only medium quality produce into the markets to meet their requirement. However, drop in supply has led to rise in average wholesale onion prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/average-wholesale-price-of-onions-up-37-in-a-week/articleshow/83092771.cms||Tushar Pawar

The patient, a resident of Ozar in Pune district, was admitted to the hospital last year. “The hospital charged him a total of Rs2.5 lakh towards ventilator, ICU, medication and allied charges. An audit conducted by a panel under Chakan rural hospital superintendent Nanda Dhavale revealed that the bill amount was Rs1.5 lakh more than the actual cost,” assistant inspector P K Rathod of the Chakan police told TOI on Sunday. He said the authorities were since pursuing the matter with the hospital authorities to return the excess money to the patient but to no avail. “Eventually, the Chakan rural hospital superintendent on Saturday lodged a complaint against the four doctors and the FIR was thus filed,” said Rathod. “We have booked the four doctors under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 188 (disobedience) of the Indian Penal Code,” he added. The patient and his relatives suspected that they were overcharged by the hospital. “They approached the local government body and filed a complaint, following which, the rural hospital in Chakan carried out an inquiry. The audit confirmed that the hospital had indeed charged the patient Rs1.5 lakh more,” Rathod said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-doctors-booked-for-overcharging-corona-patient/articleshow/83098352.cms||---

The civic bodies are aiming at completing these work in the next three months before a predicted third wave of Covid-19.

These two wards will have 90-100 beds. “We were carrying digging work followed by a plan to renovate the roofs at these ward facilities. Since it’s part of essential medical services, construction activities was not discontinued during the lockdown. But the pace of work got affected due to insufficient labourers. We will complete construction work in 15 days,” said mayor Nirmal Jain. The corporation has also floated tenders to lay pipeline till the maternity and childcare ward of the hospital from an upcoming oxygen plant. “We are aiming to complete the work in the next two to three months.

Thorat, former president of state Congress unit, said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Gujarat after cyclone Taukte and offered help of Rs 1000-cr to the government there. The BJP leaders from Maharashtra made no attempt for any kind of relief for the people affected by the cyclone in Maharashtra,” Thorat, who was in the city to attend an agitation organized by the party, said. Speaking about seven-year completion of the BJP-led central government, Thorat said, “Seven year’s rule has been not of the party but of a single person, Narendra Modi, and he has tarnished the image of the country like never before.” He added, “Even after seven years, unemployment is increasing, there is no trace of Rs 15 lakh promised to the citizens, corruption is scaling to new highs, price of edible oil jumped from Rs 80 per litre to Rs 180 litre and petrol price has crossed Rs 100-mark when the prices across the globe are being reduced. People are crying on the seventh anniversary and the BJP is celebrating it,” Thorat claimed. Thorat also claimed that the government led by the PM has also failed to arrest the growth of Covid and make timely treatment available to the people that lead to lots of deaths. He also alleged out that the government fooled the people saying ‘Vaccination Festival’ had begun from May 1 when the vaccination centres are left high and dry due to lack of stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/explain-failure-in-getting-cyclone-relief-says-thorat/articleshow/83092795.cms||---

Registrations can be done on the civic body’s indigenous ‘Mi Jababdar’ mobile application. Additional municipal commissioner Vikas Dhakane said they were testing the app and that the necessary changes would reflect by Monday. “We are committed to vaccinating the bedridden citizens at the earliest and the registration data will give us a fair idea on how to go about it,” he said. Dhakane added they were also about to finalize the location for drive-in vaccination. “We have shortlisted a few locations across Pimpri Chinchwad. We need a location that can accommodate many vehicles and is within reach for vaccinators and beneficiaries,” he said. On Monday’s drive, Pune Municipal Corporation said only Covaxin sessions would be held across 15 centres in the civic limits. “We do not have enough Covishield stock, so there will not be any Covishield sessions,” a PMC official said, adding only those Covaxin beneficiaries who received their first dose on or before May 3 would be eligible for the second. PCMC, through a statement, said it would offer Covishield at 28 centres and Covaxin at eight centres in its limits on Monday.

The deceased, Nitin Shah (50), a public works contractor, died on the spot after the trailer, which was taking a turn, hit his bicycle on the Kharghar creek bridge, dragged Shah over a distance of 20 metres, the police said. The cyclists were headed to Lonavla, the police said. The trailer driver abandoned the multi-axle vehicle and escaped. A criminal offence has been registered against the absconding driver. Mumbai’s bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh said that recent incidents in Mumbai region show that casualties with cyclists took place mainly when traffic on the streets is minimal and it’s easy for vehicles to zip past. “The reason cyclists don’t face more mishaps when traffic is heavy [after 8-8.30 am] is that we share the road space. I am never threatened when I am commuting during that time as the average speed of a cyclist is 10-15 kmph, like other vehicles. But during the early morning hours [5-7 am], the road is open for all and the speed of a motorist could be 45-100 kmph while that of a cyclist could be around 35kmph...,” she said. To prevent accidents, cyclists’ groups have proposed dedicated bicycle lanes. The government has proposed cycling tracks, but it is yet to be seen how this will be implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trailer-drags-parle-cyclist-20mt-kills-him-on-spot/articleshow/83098474.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The move is aimed at strengthening the rural Covid-19 infrastructure and avoiding an oxygen crisis like the one faced in April. “The oxygen deand during the second wave was extremely high and meeting it through private suppliers was a problem. We are installing the plants to avoid a repeat,” Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of Pune zilla parishad, told TOI. “All state-run hospitals in rural Pune would become self-sufficient once they have in-house oxygen supply,” he said. About 20 of the plants were sponsored by various corporate companies, said Prasad. “A deputy engineer in each tehsil has been tasked with regular maintenance of these plants,” he said. Ambadas Deomane, the in-charge of Manchar SDH, said that their dependence on private supplies would soon come to an end. “We are totally reliant on a private agency. When cases rose significantly in April, our oxygen stock would last 20-22 hours. With the plant, we would be able to cater to 60 Covid patients comfortably,” Deomane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-sub-district-hospitals-get-oxygen-plants-24-more-rural-health-centres-in-the-pipeline/articleshow/83098413.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Delhi||Decide who needs drug more, says Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday made it clear to the Centre and Delhi government that they would have to take the “cruel decision” on a clear policy for distribution of black fungus drug by excluding certain categories of patients based on age or chances of survival. “That’s a bullet you have to bite. You have to take this cruel decision”, which is not at all an easy task, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked, while stressing that it should not be misinterpreted to mean that the life of any person is less important than another. The court was dealing with shortage of Amphotericin B used for treating black fungus patients. The bench pointed out the quandary — “you don’t have enough vials for everyone, there is acute shortage. Why leave it to the doctor on the ground to decide if an 80-year-old patient who has lived his life should get it or a 35-year-old man with two children should get it? Today everybody is suffering from this scarcity because if someone needs six vials, you distribute two and it doesn’t help any patient.” In a brief hearing, the court said neither the Centre nor Delhi government could “duck this” and said it was a decision that the “political leadership has to take in consultation with the medical fraternity” and form a clear policy. “We are faced with a situation where the drug is not available enough. You will have to say that as a matter of policy, we will have to exclude. You have to take a call and get a policy in place and prioritise who is eligible, who isn’t eligible, since their adequate vials as per demand are not there. Make that list of priority,” the bench told the counsel for both governments. Due to paucity of time, the court will take up the matter on Tuesday and asked both lawyers to come with instructions, while indicating that the court may pass an order on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decide-who-needs-drug-more-says-hc/articleshow/83128455.cms||Abhinav Garg

So sisters Antara, the elder daughter of writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Nandana, the younger, quite naturally levitated towards reading and writing. On Sunday, the two sisters came together to chat about their mother in an online programme organized as part of a festival of art and ideas — Nabanna. The two sisters described how they grew up in the all- women family of their grandmother, illustrious writer Radharani Devi, their mother and them. “We just didn’t think that there could be any limiting experiences as women. With dimma (grandmother) and Ma around, the world was full of possibilities. When my mother would be away at college, my dimma was around to buoy us,” remembered Nandana. Feminism was ingrained in the household. Radharani Devi remains an enigma, a child widow, who remarried at a time when this was legal but sneered at by the society and then taking to the pen and becoming a poet and writer. Antara, who read out an English translation of her mother’s work, ‘Monsieur Hulo’, reminded the audience how seamlessly Nabaneeta traversed between different genres — from children’s writing to feminist writing to poems, novels and back. “She worked fast, edited her pieces and was so fastidious that she would sometimes drive her editors to tears. She would say she worked hard with writing,” said Nandana who has translated some of her mother’s works in her published book ‘Acrobat’ that was started when her mother was still alive. “I imagined how she would have wanted to have these works translated and I tried to do my best,” Nandana said after reading out parts from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/daughters-pay-tribute-to-nabaneetas-legacy/articleshow/83096757.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Police said Hussain was on way to his home at Saguna Haveli when the incident occurred. Hussain, who received bullet injuries in one of his arms, chest and abdomen, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in serious condition. SHO of Danapur police station Ajeet Kumar Saha said Hussain is also a lawyer. “It is still not clear how many criminals were involved in the incident. Police will record Hussain’s statement after his condition improves,” the SHO added. The SHO said Hussain and his son Saddam were named in a scuffle case registered against them in February this year. “Hussain had also lodged an FIR against four youths of his locality in the same case and accused them of thrashing him and his son. One of the accused in the FIR lodged by Hussain was arrested and forwarded to judicial custody,” the SHO said. He added Sunday’s incident was probably the fallout of the scuffle between Hussain’s son and local. “One Vicky Kumar is the prime suspect in the case pertaining to attack on Hussain,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-secy-of-jdus-minority-cell-shot-at/articleshow/83095653.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar to give Rs 1,500 per month to kids orphaned by Covid||PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Sunday announced a new scheme, ‘Baal Sahayata Yojana’, to rehabilitate children orphaned by Covid-19. The CM said the state government would provide monthly stipend to the bereaved children and boarding facility to those who have no caretaker besides giving special impetus to the education of orphan girls. “The boys and girls who have lost their both parents (at least one of them due to covid) will be given Rs 1,500 per month by the state government till they turn 18 years under the Bal Sahayata Yojana,” Nitish said in a statement. He added, “Boys and girls who have no guardian or caretaker will be provided shelter at the ‘children’s homes, while the orphan girls will be admitted at the Kasturba Gandhi residential girls’ schools on a priority basis.” The Bihar CM’s measures for rehabilitating the orphan children came a day after his counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Assam made similar announcements on Saturday. While the UP government has announced to provide a monthly grant of Rs 4,000 per month to each orphan child under the ‘Mukhya Mantri Bal Sewa Yojana’, Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin has decided to create a Rs 5 lakh deposit in the name of each orphan child who has lost both parents due to Covid-19 and pay their tuition and hostel fees till graduation. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, on the other hand, has said his government would provide Rs 3,500 per month per child till his/ her employment, if the child has lost either both parents or the sole bread earner of the family due to Covid. According to data available with Bihar’s social welfare department, around 50 children have so far been orphaned in the second wave of Covid-19 in Bihar while more than 1,480 have lost one of their parents due to the virus. “We are still in the process of collecting updated data of such children from some districts. As death due to Covid is still being reported, we have to update the data with latest feedback from the districts,” a state government official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-to-give-rs-1500-per-month-to-kids-orphaned-by-covid/articleshow/83095806.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Deaths in villages home to protesting farmers have increased 5-fold, claims Manohar Lal Khattar||CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday again blamed the farmer agitation for the surge in Covid-19 cases, claiming that deaths in villages having those agitating against the Centre’s agri-laws had increased five-fold compared to last year. Khattar made the statement while referring to the role of opposition during the second wave, alleging the parties were using the farmers’ agitation as part of their politics. “Farmers’ agitation has emerged as one of the major factors behind the peak. Due to the failure of adherence to Covid-19 behaviour, the infection has spread fast. Deaths in villages that had farmers frequently participating in the protests increased five to six-fold than others, or as compared to overall data of natural deaths, which is hardly 1%,’’ Khattar said. “It is amply clear that this factor too has played a role. So, we have made a deployment of 8,000 teams to screen the rural belts,” he said. Khattar was referring to the role of opposition during the pandemic and countering the allegations of the opposition of not convening an all-party meet on the issue. “The opposition does not have any intention of teaming up with the government to fight the pandemic. Last year, they joined an all-party meeting and gave useful suggestions. But this time, they have largely resorted to the politics of criticism for their political motives,” Khattar claimed. “They want to achieve their political motive through farmers, Hence, they are encouraging them. Let me tell you they are largely banking on farmer leaders who actually have a handful of following,” Khattar said. At the virtual press meet, Khattar also read out the contents of an open letter by former CM and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, slamming him for his reference to farmers related to Covid-19 behaviour. “Hooda said farmers will not follow Covid behaviour and we should not attempt. I want to ask him when did they make an appeal to farmers. It was only to cover up their wrongs that Hooda wrote a decent open letter for the masses of Haryana,” Khattar said. ‘Kejri playing vax politics’ Khattar slammed Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for his outbursts against the Centre, accusing him of playing politics in the name of vaccination. “Delhi is getting more vaccines than Haryana but still he is behaving like this. Instead, he should follow other states who have started making their arrangements through global tenders,’’ Khattar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/deaths-in-villages-home-to-protesting-farmers-have-increased-5-fold-claims-khattar/articleshow/83098481.cms||Manvir Saini

In Ray’s centenary year, Centre for New Media (CENEMA) under TCG CREST of The Chatterjee Group is bringing to life the Kheror Khata devoted to this film. Ray’s son Sandip is the principal collaborator and adviser of the project while Mrinal Sen’s son Kunal is its technical adviser. Sandip said, “This is the first time Kunal and I are working on a project.” Being a technologist and executing similar content-driven large projects, Kunal said, “I was excited when a friend requested me to join this complex and challenging project. Now, after seeing the ongoing work, I feel proud to be part of it in a small way.” Ray’s storyboard of ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’.Over 900 pages from the two books with more than 1,500 elements are being presented along with more than 500 movie snippets, 100 audio snippets and 70 newly recorded piano renditions of the original notations by an expert pianist. Unseen detailed recorded notations penned by Ray, the sketchbook of the film drawn by him, production stills, detailed coverage of the publicity and release, and other aspects of the film are also being included. Technologist Ayananshu Banerjee, an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur who has directed a film titled ‘Bodhon’, is heading the projects and digital initiative of TCG CREST. “This was a great opportunity for me to use my technology background with my passion for movies. Discussion with Sandip Ray began last December. We felt that doing research like this for a popular film like ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ will be appreciated,” he said. Character sketch of the king of Shundi from Ray's Kheror KhataAttempts are being made to extensively annotate the elements on the pages, with descriptions, deciphered texts and cross-references with the script, digitized movie segments, music snippets and other information and insight from sources based on research. “The songs, background music scores and iconic scenes are also being presented by linking them to the Kheror Khata elements. People can access Kheror Khata by browsing the pages and also get references of costume, character, dialogue, storyboards, sets, production and post-production notes,” said Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, director, TCG CREST. Character sketch of the king of Shundi from Ray's Kheror KhataAccording to Banerjee, no attempt had earlier been made to trace the journey of the red books to understand what went on in the mind of the director when he made the film. “First, Ray wrote the story line in English with the song lyrics and notations. Some sketches of the characters and sets were also included. Some 250 pages later, he started writing the storyboards with sketches and dialogues,” Banerjee said. The first book has all the content till the completion of the shooting. The second book is devoted to the dance of the ghosts and post-production notes. “This is a work in progress. I am glad that such a project has been conceived. On Sunday, I was shown portions of the website and suggested some changes. Once these restrictions are over, I will want some ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ experts to take a look at the site and give their opinions,” Sandip said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centenary-celebration-rays-notes-on-goopy-gyne-bagha-byne-to-go-online/articleshow/83096765.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

In Coimbatore and neighbouring Tirupur, people have been pitching in to distribute food and grocery items, set up helplines to support Covid patients and address other issues like lack of milk for children and transportation facilities. Among the good samaritans is 36-year-old Y Sirajdeen, an auto driver from Devarayanapalayam in Tirupur. He has volunteered to transport Covid-19 patients and those with symptoms to Tirupur city from Avinashi. He has helped more than 70 such people in the past couple of weeks. “I sat idle at home for the first two days of the lockdown. Suddenly, the plight of Avinashi residents, who have been travelling to Tirupur city even to get a CT scan in the absence of sufficient health infrastructure, struck my mind. So, I decided to operate auto for them free of cost,” Sirajdeen said. Explaining that he would attend at least five calls a day, he said he has been taking all the necessary precautionary measures to safeguard himself. “I wear a personal protection equipment kit and fumigate the vehicle immediately after dropping a patient.” Sirajdeen operates at least 10 trips between Avinashi and Tirupur city, which are located at a distance of more than 15km. Rotary club has sponsored about 50 litres diesel, appreciating his good work. Several others have also come forward to sponsor the trips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/there-is-always-a-helping-hand-for-the-needy/articleshow/83098545.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Surgeon’ roped in 1st time to check tree-fall risk||MUMBAI: The BMC will, in a first, carry out a scientific risk assessment of trees next month to assess the precarious condition of trees to mitigate risk of a fall and consequent damage to life and property. This comes in the wake of the number of lives that have been lost due to tree fall. The BMC is enrolling arborist Vaibhav Raje for the job and a pilot project will begin in south Mumbai’s D ward — Malabar Hill, Tardeo and Gamdevi. An arborist, or a tree surgeon, is a professional in the practice of cultivation and management of trees. Until now, the task of pruning tree branches was given to contractors who have no expertise in tree-cutting. Over 2,000 tree fall incidents were reported in the city on the day of cyclone Tauktae. Two people died due to tree fall incidents on May 17. Since 2012, at least 40 have died due to tree fall incidents in the city. A scientific risk assessment of trees will be carried out and a survey of the trees will be carried out using a resistograph — an instrument used to check structural stability of trees. It can detect wood decay, stages of rot, hollow areas and cracks in trees.  The survey is expected to take around two weeks from its commencement and will cover around 100-150 trees in the D ward. Assistant municipal commissioner of this ward, Prashant Gaikwad, said that the pilot project will give an insight into the trees at risk of falling during monsoon and how they can be protected. “A visual survey does not allow you to gauge the health of trees. Once the arborist submits his report, we will get the trees trimmed accordingly,” said Gaikwad. The arborist who runs an arboriculture firm, said that he had used a resistograph to check the structural stability of trees in Colaba last year. “Certain trees needed trimming to reduce the load and more space at the roots. These findings were based on resistograph tests done on the trunks,” said Raje. He, however, clarified that the resistograph will not be used on all trees. “A detailed visual survey will be done first and only those trees which are found to be vulnerable will be studied further,” he added. Raje further said that once a proper risk assessment plan for trees is put in place, the city’s green cover can be saved. “If we give value to the trees, we can save green cover worth crores of rupees. We hope to finish this survey in two weeks and submit the report to the BMC,” Raje said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-surgeon-roped-in-1st-time-to-check-tree-fall-risk/articleshow/83098532.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Ahmedabad||40% govt department buildings in Gandhinagar sans fire NOC||AHMEDABAD: The state government appears to be the biggest defaulter in the state capital in implementing fire safety norms, with over 42% of total buildings that house government departments found without any fire no-objection certificate from the Gandhinagar civic body’s fire department. The details, including names of the buildings, were revealed by Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation’s (GMC) fire officer in an affidavit filed in the Gujarat high court on Saturday in response to a PIL filed by advocate-petitioner Amit Panchal seeking implementation of the Gujarat Fire Safety Act. The petition was filed after a fire tragedy took the lives of eight Covid-19 patients in Ahmedabad’s Shrey Hospital on August 6, 2020. GMC has stated that its fire department has not received applications for fire NOC from 16 buildings from where the government departments operate. They are Birsa Munda Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Census Bhavan, Old Sachivalya Block 1-18, STC Staff Training College, Gujarat Water Works Department, New Sachivalaya Block 1-7, New Sachivalaya block 8-14, Patnagar Yojana Bhavan, Circuit House, Vishram Gruh, Dandi Kutir, GPSC Bhavan, Police Bhavan, Krushi Bhavan and Madhyamik Sikshan Board. Even a research institute like Gujarat Forensic Sciences Laboratory does not have fire NOC, and the process for the same is under way. Those 22 government buildings that have valid fire NOC include the Assembly building, Swarnim Sankul etc. The fire officer has claimed that notices have been issued to “concerned owners/office bearers instructing them to take necessary actions promptly for compliance of norms laid down for the fire safety system and obtain NOC”. The corporation contemplates further action against those who do not comply. The affidavit shows that compliance for norms in having a fire prevention system is relatively better in private buildings than in big government establishments. As against 42% of non-compliant government buildings, there are 27 residential buildings out of total 77 structures falling in this category which do not have fire NOC, which is nearly 35%. Among 22 Covid hospitals functional in Gandhinagar municipal limits, all were found complying with the fire safety norms. One of these Covid hospitals does not have proper Building Use permission. So all other hospitals in the capital were found fire-safety rule compliant, though 17 of them have got BU permission for residential purposes. All 120 hotels and restaurants mentioned in the report have fire NOCs, so do all 31 industrial units, 22 banks, 18 petrol pumps, five malls and six cinema halls that exist in the city. The city has 58 commercial buildings high enough to require fire NOC, and 56 of them have already obtained it while two buildings are under process of obtaining it. Out of 35 gymnasiums, 33 have got the certificates and two cases are under process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/capitals-babudom-biggest-defaulter-in-fire-safety/articleshow/83096770.cms||---

Around 2,000 vials of the injection have been distributed in the past 24 hours,” said Ranjan.According to sources, six Indian companies have got licences for the production of Liposomal amphotericin B injection and within two weeks 5-6 lakh vials of the drug will come to India through imports. The state government has also placed an order for Posaconazole, a substitute drug for Liposomal amphotericin B injection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/black-fungus-injection-now-an-essential-drug-in-raj/articleshow/83096763.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

Moreover, the high fuel prices in the state have made them compete with vehicles from other states where diesel is cheaper due to which the outside state trucks are charging less for transportation.Jaipur Transport Operators Association president Anil Arora said, “Since the pandemic hit, we have been facing huge losses and it has reached to such an extent that now we are forced to reduce transportation cost so that we get at least some business. For example, if previously we were charging Rs 20,000 from Jaipur to Agra, now the fare has been reduced to Rs 17,000. Moreover earlier, we would get products transported on return trips as well but nowadays trucks at times have to return empty as there is no production so raw materials are also not being transported.”The transporters claimed that the business has been reduced to just 35% and the increasing fuel prices are also putting additional pressure on them. “Each vehicle’s per day cost comes around to Rs 5,000 and with increasing diesel prices, we have no option but to reduce the transportation fare as it is better to have vehicles on the job rather than being parked. In fact, more the number of the heavy vehicles a transporter has, more will be the loss because EMIs for each truck also have to be paid every month irrespective of the fact that there is any business or not. Besides this, we also pay at least six types of taxes like road tax, goods tax, green tax and others which further puts a dent on the profit, especially during this time,” added Arora.Transporters had also written to the state transport minister asking to be declared as frontline workers since movement of heavy vehicles is still allowed with no restrictions despite lockdown in the state. They said most of them were yet to be vaccinated and requested the government to facilitate the same for them as they were at risk of exposure to the virus because of the nature of their work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transporters-reduce-fares-as-business-goes-down/articleshow/83096767.cms||---

The MPA, an independent body that has been formed as per the recommendations in the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (2034), will regulate on-street and off-street parking in the city. While former bureaucrat Ramanath Jha has been appointed as an advisor of the MPA, BMC has appointed Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) as the consulting agency for taking inputs from urban planners, traffic experts and local governance experts to help with MPA’s work. “The MPA proposes to look into how to provide parking as a component of a city’s public infrastructure for ensuring convenient, safe, affordable parking in the city, along with the regulation that reasonably restricts parking on public spaces. It also envisages to introduce parking management strategies based on land use categories, road characteristics and congestion degree through zoning to facilitate contextual variable pricing, park only streets, no parking, pedestrian only zones, etc. The MPA shall prepare a digital GIS map of all parking spaces, develop regulations and SOPs for management of parking spaces,” said a senior civic official. Officials said the MPA had 9 key tasks, like legal setup of MPA within BMC laws to plan, regulate, fine, evict and introduce new concepts; ward wise holistic plans and parking management; and deputing parking marshals for enforcement along with the traffic police, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-oks-formation-of-mum-parking-authority/articleshow/83098591.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||India||In letter to education minister, FICC chief urges govt to cancel class XII board exams||NEW DELHI: The Federation on India Chambers of Commerce and Industry has written to the central government to cancel the class XII board examinations, cautioning that the current situation due to Covid-19 is not conducive for conducting physical examinations. Meanwhile, according to CBSE officials though all the three options have been under consideration — exams in major subjects or truncated exams in major subjects and even cancellation — the board is more inclined towards Option A, expecting that the situation will be conducive for preparation by mid-June. FICCI president Uday Shankar in his letter to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said that an alternate solution should be devised to determine academic progression instead of conducting physical or online examinations. He said that a delayed examination schedule will not only affect those students seeking admission in Indian higher educational institutions, but also jeopardise the dreams of especially those aiming to pursue higher education overseas. “Covid cases in the country are still very high... As such, the current situation is not conducive to conduct in-person examination and holding online examination is impractical given the lack of infrastructure; most importantly, any further delay will lead to distress among students. Against this backdrop, FICCI strongly recommends that Class XII board examinations should be called off,” said Shankar. More than five lakh Indian students go abroad every year and over two lakh have confirmed offers of admission this year. While there had been a broad consensus among states/ UTs about conducting class XII board exams and Pokhriyal said that an “informed, collaborative” decision will be taken by June 1, according to a senior CBSE official, “As of now no final decision has been taken. At CBSE however we are inclined to have the exams in case the situation is conducive. And we are expecting the situation to improve by mid-June. In case situation remains grim the option of further postponing or cancellation is always there and alternate assessment will be rolled out.” Shankar however said that foreign universities are unlikely to relax their timelines in order to accommodate a delayed examination schedule and due to this students who have secured admission in those universities will be left in the lurch if the process is drawn out. “It is imperative, therefore, that the Class XII evaluation process is completed by mid-July so that there is a smooth transition to higher education for all students,” wrote the FICCI president, while suggesting that the CBSE should allow schools to take into consideration marks scored in several tests/ exams conducted during the academic year 2020-21 and assign appropriate weightage in order to arrive at the marks for each student. A review committee headed by the principal should be formed at the school level which shall also include two external education experts apart from select teaching staff to prepare fair and unbiased results of the students, which should be in sync with the historical performance of the school. He suggested that if a significant number of students are not satisfied with the internal grades, the government may consider giving them an opportunity to sit for an exam to be held at a later date when the situation is more conducive. “As such, a once in a century pandemic calls for an out-of-the-box solution which is in the best interests of students who have already been subjected to a lot of stress and uncertainty,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-letter-to-education-minister-ficc-chief-urges-govt-to-cancel-class-xii-board-exams/articleshow/83102087.cms||---

---||Delhi||AAP claims scam behind Covid vaccine shortage||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Sunday alleged a “vaccine scam”, claiming the central government was not providing vaccines to state governments inoculating people for free but giving sufficient supply to private hospitals and even five-star hotels immunising people at high rates. Atishi said that for a week, the vaccination of youth for free at Delhi government schools is halted due to scarcity of vaccines and they are getting vaccinated at private hospitals at rates ranging between Rs 900 and Rs 1,400 per dose. Five-star hotels are also providing packages that includes luxury of their hotels, she added. “What kind of a connivance is this of the Centre with the private hospitals and hotels?” she said. “Why is it that the vaccines approved by WHO are being approved by all countries except for India? This includes Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccines,” she said, alleging “connivance” of the Centre with the vaccine manufacturers. In Delhi, 3.5 lakh doses of vaccines are available only for those aged 45 years and above, including 40,000 doses of Covaxin and 2.75 lakh doses of Covishield, said Atishi, adding that Covaxin is now administered only to those who need a second dose. A total of 53.4 lakh people have been vaccinated, including more than 12 lakh people who have got both doses. Atishi also claimed that a call record had been detected of a private hospital pertaining to a BJP MP and his relative where the hospital reportedly said the vaccines were being administered at high prices because the rate of commission was to be given to the MP’s office. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said both vaccine manufacturers had assured that supply would be normal in 10-15 days. “Despite this reassurance, one fails to understand why every day AAP leaders like Atishi play their recorded statement on vaccine shortage and need for allowing import of foreign-made vaccines. It seems they are campaigning for highly priced foreign-made vaccines’ manufacturers,” he said. “They campaign for import of highly priced imported vaccines that no government can provide for free.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-claims-scam-behind-covid-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/83096800.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||With cases on wane, owners urge Delhi govt: Give our hotels back||NEW DELHI: Hotelier Kapil Chopra, who also runs NGO Charity Beds which provides hospital beds for the poor, has been regularly posting personally verified leads of hospital beds in the city. But he insists that among the correct measures taken by Delhi government to fight the coronavirus, attaching hotels to hospitals was not one of them. Dismissing it as a “diversionary tactic”, Chopra pointed out that a hotel room could, at best, be a quarantine convenience, not an ICU facility requiring the presence of doctors and nurses. “Of all the oxygen beds that were announced last year at various centres, not many became functional. You need doctors and nurses to make them operational and there is a huge shortage with that,” he said. “The focus should be on increasing ICU and oxygen beds across the city and ensuring they are ready to be used when needed by the patients.” To cope with the relentless rise of Covid cases, Delhi government had announced the conversion of some hotels and banquet halls into Covid facilities linked with a hospital. Last year, there were hardly any patients in these hotels, though there were a few patients this year. Apollo hospital that had Crowne Plaza Okhla attached as an extended facility treated a total of around 130 patients at the hotel. These patients were primarily stable Covid-positive individuals with controlled or nil comorbidities and with minimal oxygen requirement. Max Hospitals, which oversaw the facility created in Svelte Hotels, treated 135 patients there. Shilpa Gopalka, GM, Max Multi-Speciality Centre, Panchsheel Park, explained that after screening and based on the individual's condition, the patients were referred to the hotel. There was a resident doctor and a nursing team present for monitoring the patients, while a senior doctor visited daily. Mid-May onwards, no patients have stayed at Svelte. From Taj Vivanta, Dwarka, hosting 60 patients from Venkateshwara Hospital to ITC’s WelcomHotel Dwarka with some patients from Manipal Hospital, they had Covid patients with mild symptoms. Nishant Negi, GM, WelcomHotel Dwarka, said people contacted the hotel for oxygen or ICU beds, they could only take in people referred by the associated hospital. The hotel hasn’t had patients for the last few days, and Vivanta's website shows all 60 beds available. With most Covid-designated rooms unoccupied, the hotels suffered losses, claimed Greesh Bindra, VP (operations), The Suryaa, which had 200 rooms attached to the nearby Holy Family Hospital. He also said that there haven’t been patient admissions in most hotels in the last two weeks and they are bearing unremunerative costs while operating as Covid facilities. A sales manager at a hotel maintained that the decision to attach hotels with hospitals adversely affected employees. A majority of the staff was sent on leave without pay. Their colleagues in other hotels, in contrast, still had some operations or services such as home delivery, long-term guests or accommodating big crews. Chopra said that with many Delhiites contracting Covid and recovering, there is hope that most of them would have antibodies to protect them from infection for at least the next few months. These months, Chopra suggested, should be used to ramp up the vaccination exercise, operationalise all the planned hospital beds and enforce strict mask and social distancing rules. He elaborates it has been evident that the city cannot handle more than 5,000 active cases and all attempts must be made to contain the spread than come up with knee jerk reactions like turning hotels into Covid facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-cases-on-wane-owners-urge-govt-give-our-hotels-back/articleshow/83128524.cms||Amin Ali

After recovering, patients have to keep monitoring the parameters such as oxygen saturation, blood pressure and sugar levels. “People need to take care of health even after recovery from the virus. The most common complications which we are witnessing post recovery are related to respiratory system such as Interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchitis. Besides, a lot of people are coming with increased levels of sugar, and also depression, anxiety and panic disorder. Also, in some cases, neurological complications have been reported,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS hospital. The SMS hospital, government-run Jaipuria hospital and most of the private hospitals have now started psychological and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities for the recovered patients. Even after recovery, a few patients need care in ICU for pulmonary rehabilitation as they develop fibrosis in lungs. Besides, doctors are claiming that those who had co-morbidites at the time of getting infected from Covid, such as diabetes, kidney, liver or disorders related to heart or cancer and having undergone organ transplant are always at higher risk of post-Covid complications. Among the post-Covid complication, which has now become a cause of concern for the health authorities is mucormycosis, also known as black fungus. The health department has set up separate OPD and IPD for mucormycosis patients in identified government and private hospitals.BOX:Some of the post-recovery complications - Cough, fever, fatigue, chest pain, joint pain, difficulty in breathing, headache, depression, anxiety and stress- Doctors prescribe blood thinner drugs, as they claim that there is risk of blood clotting even after recovery- Due to blood clotting, a patient has risk of thrombo embolism, heart attack and stroke-- Most common post-Covid complications are related to respiratory system as few patients complain of lung fibrosis||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-cases-going-down-govt-shifts-focus-to-post-covid-care/articleshow/83096778.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 84-year-old Fr Stan Swamy tests positive for Covid, in ICU||MUMBAI: Fr Stan Swamy, 84, shifted from Taloja jail to Holy Family Hospital on Friday night, has tested positive for Covid. He has been placed in ICU and is on oxygen support. The high court had on Friday directed that Fr Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, be shifted to the private hospital for 15 days after hearing his counsel Mihir Desai and additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA, which arrested him last October. Fr Swamy’s lawyer communicated his positive status to the prison superintendent. The prison official informed TOI that after getting a call from the lawyer, two inmates including Arun Ferreira, who were Fr Swamy’s attendants, were tested. Both came negative on antigen tests on Sunday. They had tested negative earlier too, as had Fr Swamy, the official said, adding that Fr Swamy was vaccinated at a prison camp on May 18. A vacation bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar had clarified it was passing the order in “peculiar facts and circumstances of the case” on NIA counsel’s submission that sending Fr Swamy to a private hospital of his choice may set a “wrong precedent”. NIA had arrested Fr Swamy from his hometown, Ranchi, last October, accusing him of being a Maoist. Desai had argued that the urgency to shift him to hospital arose as Fr Swamy was “unable to stand, eat or visit the toilet”. Desai informed HC that Fr Swamy’s attendants at the prison had said his “health was extremely precarious with reduced oxygen saturation and acutely fluctuating blood pressure”. On May 21, Fr Swamy in a virtual interaction with a vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade, who noted he was physically weak, had refused to be shifted to any hospital, saying he preferred to await his death in prison. The bench had then permitted Desai to approach the HC before June 1 if the priest was convinced by then to be shifted to Holy Family. Fr Swamy filed an affidavit on May 28 affirming that he was ready to be shifted. The HC had called for a report from JJ Hospital on May 21 and it had said that he was normal and responsive but had severe hearing loss in an ear, unbalanced gait, lower limb problems and general weakness. The HC had directed the hospital to provide Fr Swamy with an attendant and to allow one police constable since he is an undertrial. It also allowed Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, former principal of St Xavier’s College and now a parish priest of St Peter’s Church, Bandra, to meet Fr Swamy at the hospital subject to protocols. Last October, the special NIA court had rejected Fr Swamy’s plea for medical bail. He appealed against the order before the HC in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-84-year-old-fr-stan-tests-positive-for-covid-in-icu/articleshow/83098636.cms||---

A seven-member gang had decamped with 1,500 liquor bottles worth Rs 1.50 lakh from shop 1570 near the Coimbatore International Airport on May 27. The Peelamedu police arrested three people in connection with the case on Saturday. They are on the lookout for four more people. “The outlet is in an isolated area and there was no CCTV camera. We had instructed the shop supervisor to install cameras a few months ago,” a police officer said. Deputy commissioner of police E S Uma said that 30% of Tasmac shops lack CCTV facility. “We have advised Tasmac authorities to install cameras, which would help us identify culprits.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Karnavati is crossroads king of car traffic||AHMEDABAD: Which is the only junction in the city where an Amdavadi is likely to encounter a car among every two vehicles? You may have guessed it by now — Karnavati Club junction. Recently, a civic survey of 50 major traffic junctions in the city which observed up to 3,000 passenger car units in an hour found that 48% of the vehicles that passed by Karnavati Club were cars of all sizes and shapes. The second-highest four-wheeler density being at Ahmedabad-Vadodara expressway where nearly 40% of the vehicles that pass by are cars. But on the flipside, the junction where one is more likely to encounter two-wheelers is the Stadium junction in western Ahmedabad with 64% of the vehicles being two-wheelers. Similarly, the next highest two-wheeler density can be witnessed at Parimal Crossroads with 58% of the vehicles being two-wheelers. The report was prepared as part of the new AMC parking policy In 2019, the AMC and Ahmedabad-based Institute of Infrastructure Technology Research and Management (IITRAM) had surveyed 20 major junctions that witness traffic jams during peak hours. This particular survey revealed that every minute some 142 to 420 vehicles pass by them during peak hours. These junctions include Vadaj, Sattadhar, and Shastrinagar in the western parts of the city while four of the junctions are in the eastern parts of the city. AMC officials claim that the Vadaj junction witnessed the maximum traffic movement during peak morning hours, close to 417 vehicles per minute , while Panjrapol was the least busy with 129 vehicles per minute. Analysis revealed that Vadaj junction saw an average rise of 50% in vehicle movement during evening hours as compared to peak morning hours. Traffic rises between 6pm and 7pm and eases by 9pm. The analysis of the nine junctions was conducted for prospective flyovers or underpasses. According to another AMC Smart City study, some of the junctions in the western part of the city also witnessed the maximum traffic violations. “Busy traffic junctions in the western Ahmedabad also witnessed maximum traffic violations. In a year, Shyamal Crossroads had 2.13 lakh traffic violations, followed by Shastrinagar with 1.6 lakh violations while Sardar Patel statue junction recorded 1.59 lakh traffic violations,” claimed a senior AMC official in the smart city department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/karnavati-is-crossroads-king-of-car-traffic/articleshow/83096796.cms||---

Against the 20 tonne earmarked quota, the city needs between 15 and 19 tonne. Significantly, the requirement of all three government hospitals has come down — for instance, Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 did not take oxygen thrice last week as the oxygen from its plant was sufficient for the patients of the hospital. Chandigarh administration has withdrawn restrictions on quota of oxygen for private hospitals. They can now take oxygen according to their requirement. Sources in the UT administration, revealed that since the things have normalised, they are not checking oxygen supply agencies as well. “Since the government hospitals have sufficient oxygen and some have been fulfilling the requirement from their own plant, the private hospitals are taking oxygen as per their wish and we don’t have any issue now. In the last one week, out of earmarked 20 tonne of oxygen, many times, government hospitals did not require more than 15 tonne per day. We are still keeping the record of oxygen supply to both private and government hospitals,” an official said. The Chandigarh administration has also decided to close down Sector 48 based hospital in a week or 10 days. The order issued by Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for Covid management and CEO of CHB, reads “Considering sharp decrease in the number of Covid patients and more than 100 oxygen beds being vacant, some of the Covid wards will be closed down in a gradual manner, based on the patient load, clinical requirements and logistics. No new Covid patient to be sent to the hospital at Sector 48 until all the beds in Covid wards/Covid ICU are full in GMCH-32. We may also keep a buffer 10 vacant beds in GMCH-32 to take care of emergencies. In this way, initially one wing in next few days and then the whole hospital of Sector 48 may be close down in next about 10 to 15 days. The facility to be kept in standby mode so that it can be put to use again in a very short notice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/citys-o2-requirement-drops-ut-relaxes-rules-on-pvt-consumption-quota/articleshow/83098701.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||World||Scores of children abducted from Islamic seminary in Nigeria||KANO, Nigeria: Gunmen kidnapped scores of children from an Islamic seminary in central Nigeria, officials said, the latest in a string of such incidents plaguing the populous African nation. Some 200 children were at the school in Niger state on Sunday during the attack, the local government tweeted, adding "an unconfirmed number" were taken. The abduction came a day after 14 students from a university in northwestern Nigeria were freed after 40 days in captivity. Niger state police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said the attackers arrived on motorbikes in Tegina town and started shooting indiscriminately, killing one resident and injuring another, before kidnapping the children from the Salihu Tanko Islamic school. One of the school's officials, who asked not to be named, said the attackers initially took more than 100 children "but later sent back those they considered too small for them, those between four and 12 years old". The state government, in a series of tweets, said the attackers had released 11 of the pupils who were "too small and couldn't walk" very far. In a later Twitter thread, the state added the governor Sani Bello had directed "security agencies to bring back [the] children as soon as possible". Armed gangs are terrorising inhabitants in northwest and central Nigeria by looting villages, stealing cattle, and taking people hostage. Such seizures have become a frequent way for criminals to collect ransoms. Since December 2020, before the attack on Sunday, 730 children and students had been kidnapped. On April 20, gunmen known locally as "bandits" stormed Greenfield University in northwestern Nigeria and kidnapped around 20 students, killing a member of the school's staff in the process. Five students were executed a few days later to force families and the government to pay a ransom. Fourteen were released on Saturday. Local press said that the families had paid a ransom totalling 180 million naira ($440,000) for their release. Africa's most populous country has been plagued by kidnappings for years, with criminals largely targeting the wealthy and prominent. But more recently, the pool of victims has expanded with the poor now also taken for ransom. Earlier this month, hundreds of protesters partially blocked a motorway into the capital Abuja after a spate of kidnappings in the area. Marching along the highway, a dozen young men chanted: "We won't accept this, kidnapping must stop!" The criminal gangs maintain camps in the Rugu forest which straddles northern and central Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states. Their motives have been financial with no ideological leanings, but there is growing concern they are being infiltrated by jihadists from the northeast waging a 12-year-old insurrection to establish an Islamic state. The kidnappings in the northwest are also complicating challenges facing Buhari's security forces, battling a more than decade-long northeast Islamist insurgency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/scores-of-children-abducted-from-islamic-seminary-in-nigeria-authorities/articleshow/83102253.cms||---

---||Delhi||Nadda targets AAP govt over mohalla clinics, health infra||New Delhi: BJP president J P Nadda on Sunday took a dig at the Kejriwal government and claimed that AAP had been making baseless allegations against the Centre after its tall claims about hundreds of mohalla clinics and huge improvement in Delhi's health infrastructure lay exposed. “Today is ‘seva diwas’ and I don’t want to comment taking names, but there are certain people in Delhi who have been continuously defaming India for vaccines, they were making tall claims over mohalla clinics, were boasting about good administration and holding press conferences regularly,” Nadda said. Although the BJP chief didn’t take the names of CM Arvind Kejriwal or his party, there were few doubts as to who the comments were aimed at. “However, when the pandemic hit Delhi, they left everything to the Centre and did nothing to control corona," he said, focusing on mohalla clinics, one of AAP's successful planks for the 2019 polls. Nadda's remark came in the wake of AAP attacking the government over pandemic management and vaccination. Returning the fire, Nadda slammed “Delhi’s hindrance creators". He said the sole agenda of certain naysayers was to misguide the people and defame the country. “But BJP workers are mature, serious and sensitive and risked their lives to serve the people continuously,” he said, while flagging off vehicles laden with relief material managed by BJP workers for other parts of the country. Nadda urged BJP workers to continue working with dedication and said politics was a medium to serve the people but certain individuals tried to create hindrances in the way of those committed to the service of humanity. “There are doers, who believe in working relentlessly whereas those hell bent on creating hindrances will do so and Delhi is no exception. There will be hindrances on your way even in Delhi but we have to remain firm on our path as we are doers and not hindrance creators,” Nadda said. Referring to opposition parties’ bid to corner the government over the vaccination drive, Nadda said these were the same parties that had questioned the efficacy of Made in India vaccines and were now making noise about the same vaccines. “As many as 13 companies have been given permission to manufacture vaccines in the country and soon the number of such companies will be 19,” Nadda said and reiterated the government’s commitment to vaccinate the entire country by the end of the year. Aam Aadmi Party reacted strongly to the comments. It said in a statement: “It is extremely unfortunate that BJP is doing cheap politics in this hour of pandemic. What is the crime of the CM? That he asked for oxygen when there was shortage in Delhi? And because of his efforts, the people of Delhi got oxygen. He is now asking for vaccines for Delhiites. Is it a crime to ask for vaccines? And when he asks for vaccines, all BJP leaders abuse him day in and day out. Right from the BJP president, everyone calls him names. But the CM will continue demanding vaccines for his people. We urge BJP govt to provide vaccines and stop this name calling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nadda-targets-aap-govt-over-mohalla-clinics-health-infra/articleshow/83096825.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Absconder caught with Rs 30 lakh in fake currency notes||AHMEDABAD: A 40-year-old man from Mansa of Gandhinagar was caught in the net of cops with fake currency notes of Rs 30L face value, mostly in denomination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500, said officers. He had allegedly printed the currency notes to repay bank and individual loans. Inspector Jatin Prajapati of Mansa police station said that the accused Santosh Raval, resident of Panchalpura village was stopped by his team at Gram Bharti Crossroads when he was passing from there on his motorcycle. He said that Raval had been held earlier by Gandhinagar police in 2016 and 2017 cases in which his bail was cancelled as he did not pay certain amounts as instructed by the local court, and he had been absconding since then. When cops checked the bag that he was carrying on his motorcycle, they found that it was stuffed with currency notes. During prima facie inquiry, cops came to know that all the currency notes were fake and printed by the accused himself. Cops said that Raval had 1,137 notes in denomination of Rs 2,000 (total Rs 22.74 lakh); 1,204 notes in denomination of Rs 500 (Rs 6.02 lakh) and 1,240 currency notes in denomination of Rs 100 (Rs 1.24 lakh) in the bag. Prajapati said that they called forensic experts and a bank manager who confirmed all the currency notes were fake. Raval had cheated a large number of people. He had also taken personal loans from bank to pay that amount. But he kept taking new loans to pay previous debts and ended up with a debt close to Rs 40 lakh. To pay this amount, he decided to print currency notes but was caught before he could use them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/absconder-caught-with-rs-30l-in-fake-currency-notes/articleshow/83096814.cms||---

Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said on Sunday as top health experts have predicted the arrival of the third wave, there is a need to be even more vigilant. She said that it was very important to wear a mask to stay away from the disease. “Residents should not step out of homes needlessly and if there is an urgent need to move out, face should be covered with masks and necessary distance from each other should be maintained. It is also important to wash hands frequently with soap and water,” she said. The civil surgeon has also asked people to do more online transactions to pay for water, electricity, mobile, cylinder refill and other bills, instead of going to the market and offices for the same. She said shops should not be crowded with customers and social distance should be maintained in all circumstances. Hands should be washed when entering and leaving the store. She said wearing masks at public places has already been made mandatory in the state and those defying the rules and guidelines are being challaned. "The lifting of curfew or relaxations in lockdown does not mean that the disease has been completely eradicated. If we adopt a careless attitude and do not use precautions, the disease can strike us again in a more dangerous way,” said the civil surgeon. She added that while travelling in scooters, motorcycles, cars, jeeps, and buses, the face should be covered. She said people should visit hospitals in case of serious problem only. “They can contact the health department's helpline 104 for expert advice,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/doctors-say-stick-to-covid-guidelines-even-if-new-cases-are-falling/articleshow/83098749.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctor body comes forward to inoculate kin||KOLKATA: Various doctors’ organisations have been demanding vaccination for their immediate family members on a priority basis. Many doctors and other healthcare workers, along with their parents, have been vaccinated with the second dose. But majority of the family members in the 18-44 age group are still yet to get inoculated. On Sunday, Protect The Warriors (PTW), a doctors’ body, organised the first camp to vaccinate the family members of doctors. “I have got both the doses of the vaccine. The vaccine will protect me from a severe disease. I might get infected since I am regularly seeing patients, some of whom are Covid infected. My concern is that I might carry the virus back home and infect my family members who are yet to get the vaccine,” said physician, Ayan Mukherjee. Mukherjee’s concern was taken care of on Sunday when his sister, the only one left in the family who had not received the vaccine, got her first jab at the camp at Apollo Hospital. “I had tried through Co-Win but each time I was unable to book a slot for myself. I am grateful to PTW for this initiative. I finally got the shot that I have been trying to get since I became eligible,” said Ananya Mukherjee, a digital marketing executive from Tollygunge. One hundred recipients belonging to the family of 92 doctors got the vaccine shot at Apollo on Sunday. Titled Sanjog, the umbrella organisation of doctors across Bengal, will be reaching out to more in the fraternity in the coming weeks for these special inoculation drives. “We have tied up with hospitals like Apollo, RN Tagore and EKO HCG Cancer Centre where we would be holding eight more camps within the second week of June to cover the family members of 900 doctors and other healthcare workers,” said ENT surgeon, Abhik Ghosh of PTW. The organisation has pulled up its team for this vaccination drive that includes doctors Suman Mukherjee, Sourav Dutta , Abhik Ghosh, Anirban Dalui, Avishek Das, Chandrani Mallik, Pritam Roy, Sayan Paul and Rohit Kapoor for better coordination. Talks are also on with a hospital that is likely to get the Sputnik V vaccine by second week for another camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doc-body-comes-forward-to-inoculate-kin/articleshow/83096816.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

It is for the second consecutive year the pandemic cast its shadow on the distribution of the ayurvedic remedy, which is popular among people suffering from asthma and other respiratory issues. Confirming the development, B Harinath Goud, one of the family members, told TOI: “The fish prasadam, which we distribute every year on Mrigashira Karte day in June for lakhs of asthma patients, has been cancelled this year too.” According to the schedule, the Bathini family was planning to distribute the fish prasadam on June 8 and 9. But 10 days ahead of the schedule, they decided to cancel the event. On June 8, the concoction would be distributed among the family members after performing ‘Satyanarayana puja’, Harinath Goud said. However, he clarified there was no proposal to distribute the ‘fish prasadam’ to citizens this year at their Doodhbowli residence as it was a major risk to the family and everyone else involved due to the prevailing situation. Every year, lakhs of asthma patients from all over the country arrive in the city days ahead of the distribution at Exhibition Ground, Nampally. Replying to a query on Nellore Anandaiah’s ayuvedic remedy for Covid-19, Harinath said, “There is no such proposal to prepare a similar concoction by our family, on the lines of Anandaiah’s ayuverdic remedy.

Cautioning that if nothing is done at the earliest by the Centre and the state governments, thousands of units in Ludhiana might shut down permanently. Businessmen are also angry with the GST council for failing to announce any rate cuts on auto parts, paints and consumer durables that have a high tax rate of 28%. According to Jagbir Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, “Many units in MSME sector, which was already hit badly during the first wave of coronavirus, may close down. During the first wave, the Centre took some steps like EMI moratorium, 20% emergency credit facility, among others, to bail out the industry. These measures were not enough, but the industry still managed to sail through as there was uniformity in lockdown unlike this time when every state has its own set of rules.” Sokhi said, “At present, owners of MSME units dealing in sewing machines, bicycles, auto parts and garments, are facing huge financial crisis. Sewing machine industry wants a special financial package, which should include deferment of EMIs on business loans and introduction of interest moratorium for six months.”GS Kahlon, president of Auto Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said their high hopes of relief from the meeting of GST council have been dashed. “The Union and state finance ministries must slash the high GST slab of 28% on auto parts, as it reduces our investment in the business. The government still has time to save the factories from going bankrupt. There have been no sales due to lockdown in consumer states and people are running shops only to ensure their workers get wages. We urgently need deferment of EMIs and interest on the loan by six months. We also need collateral-free loans according to our sales in 2019,” he said.Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of the Knitwear Club, said, “After the second wave of coronavirus, industry will not be able to resurrect without government support. The Centre and the state government should make combined efforts to save the industry passing through turbulent times. The most urgent step that can help industry is giving wages to workers for the next three months from government funds. This can be given as a loan and once the industry is back on the path of revival it will repay the amount.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2nd-wave-has-put-industry-on-last-legs-needs-govt-support-bizmen/articleshow/83095042.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Chandigarh||Despite falling postivity rate, public health experts urge govt not to let guard down||Chandigarh: Public health experts attribute the tremendous fall of positivity rate from 26% to 6% within a month, to the lockdown and containment zones. They believe that the restrictions must be lifted gradually to avoid another surge in cases. Punjab has resumed elective surgeries in all hospitals to make it convenient for the non-Covid patients waiting for their non emergency operations. “This can be resumed after a while here as things are under control only due to the restrictions,” said a public health expert. It is believed that this is the time to start planning to fill up the gaps in the healthcare system. “We need to strengthen our primary healthcare services so that unnecessary referrals can be avoided and tertiary care centres can only manage complicated cases. Also, there must be a buffer of resources like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. In fact, the suppliers must be asked to keep things available before they go out of stock when required,” said the public health expert. Even if the cases are decreasing, public health experts feel another surge can be expected anytime if we are not careful. “We need to enhance vaccination as well so that most are protected. Reinfections are rare and those who have developed antibodies naturally or by vaccination may not get the infection again,” said the public health expert. As far as testing is concerned, experts feel that as the cases decline, the number of contacts also decrease and consequently the testing comes down. Meanwhile, the health department has reduced the RTPCR rates to Rs 450 from Rs 900 and Rapid antigen tests are now Rs 350. Earlier it was Rs 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-falling-postivity-rate-public-health-experts-urge-govt-not-to-let-guard-down/articleshow/83098769.cms||Shimona Kanwar

We can stay at one of my three daughters’ place for a while, but we cannot do that permanently. So, I have decided to rent a house near my daughter’s house and raise the children on my own.” Explaining that she has been managing her expenses with her late husband’s pension (Rs 8,000), she said that she doesn’t know how she is going to take care of the children. “The pandemic is cruel to me and my family,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/in-coimbatore-91-kids-have-lost-a-parent-or-both/articleshow/83098768.cms||---

Dr Bhavesh Oza, resident of Bodakdev, said that he knew the accused Shiva Parmar who runs his tailoring shop beside his hospital. Oza said that Parmar used to consult him for illness. On March 26, Parmar consulted Oza as he had Covid-19 like symptoms after which Oza recommended some tests to him. Oza said that Parmar tested Covid positive but as the infection was not severe, he was advised to stay at home on medication. Oza said that Parmar insisted for hospitalization which he refused as he did not have any major complications. Oza said in the FIR that that a representative of a private insurance company came to visit him on May 4 while inquiring about Parmar. The insurance company representative asked him why Parmar was admitted to his hospital. To this, Oza told him that Parmar was never admitted in his hospital.

So far, 91% of textbooks have been delivered by the printers to the designated schools and godowns across the state. “While 100% of textbooks for Classes VIII to XII have been printed, for other classes a small percentage of books are yet to be delivered. For Classes I and II, most textbooks have been pending due to the complete lockdown. Once the lockdown is lifted, they will be printed and moved to designated schools,” an official from the textbook corporation said. Being an election year, the corporation started printing the textbooks in January. “We moved the textbooks during March and April to the 120 designated centres. Since there were no major corrections, the printing work began well in advance,” the official said. The corporation will take up the printing of a second volume of textbooks for Classes XI and XII in the coming weeks. The textbook corporation also plans to distribute the textbooks to private schools who placed the orders after the Covid-19 cases come down. The textbook corporation also printed the bridge course materials and worksheets for students of Classes I to IX to bridge the gap in online learning. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic, educationists urged the state government to deliver the textbooks at the doorstep of students this year. “In view of the pandemic, the state should take steps to deliver textbooks at the doorstep of children for 2021-22 academic year. Both government and private schools may be asked to deliver textbooks and notebooks through their teachers and take note of the condition of children. The state should provide the logistics, including protective gear like face shields and PPEs to teachers,” said P B Prince Gajendrababu, general secretary, State Platform for Common School System. He further said teachers above 50 years age and with comorbidities can be given stationary work at schools without any public contact. Private schools are also planning to seek permission to take the textbooks from the godowns and deliver it to students. “Students need textbooks to attend online classes. We are planning to ask for exemption from Covid-19 lockdown restrictions for delivering textbooks to the doorsteps of our students,” said N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/despite-pandemic-tn-ready-with-3-8-crore-new-textbooks/articleshow/83096824.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: After Mucormycosis, another fungus in Covid cases||LUDHIANA: Even as the cases of Mucormycosis keep coming in, the district is now also reporting another type of fungal disease in the immune-compromised patients treated for severe coronavirus infection. It’s called aspergillosis. The district has five to six of these cases in its hospitals and they are from both Ludhiana and other areas. Dr Rajesh Mahajan, coordinator of the Covid care centre at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said: "The cases were there even before Covid-19 but after the pandemic, their number has increased. We did receive these cases in first wave as well but in far less proportion. These patients have uncontrolled diabetes and sinusitis." The Covid-care coordinator said whereas Voriconazole is used for treating pure aspergillosis, Itraconazole can be used for the treatment of Mucormycosis and aspergillosis. Ludhiana Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr Saroj Aggarwal, who claims to have heard of two or three of these cases referred from a private hospital in Ludhiana to Chandigarh’s PGI and Patiala’s Rajindra Hospital, said: "Aspergillosis is in the Covid patients who received an excessive dose of steroids besides industrial oxygen, which is not very clean. The non-sterile water used for hydrating this oxygen is also to blame." Health experts said this other fungus can be diagnosed by the biopsy of the lung tissue sample and by even a blood test for fungal molecules, a CT scan of lungs, an X-ray of the chest, and the sputum stain and culture to examine bronchial mucus collected through bronchoscope. They recommend precautions to the vulnerable people (those with weak immunity and lung diseases such as asthma and tuberculosis). Former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati said: "The vulnerable people need to wear the N95 mask when going out and cover their body fully when out on the lawns. It is also advisable to use the steroids with complete caution on those with severe coronavirus infection. Normal saline water is better for hydrating oxygen and even that should be replace regularly."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/after-mucor-another-fungus-in-covid-cases/articleshow/83095053.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Nagpur||NMC notice to cut 4,522 trees for IMS riles greens||NAGPUR: Sunday came as a big disappointment for greens with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issuing a public notice stating that 4,522 trees will be felled for the proposed inter-modal station (IMS) coming up at Ajni. This figure is only for the first phase of the project and thousands of more trees are expected to be felled for other phases. Amidst the on-going lockdown, the civic body has called for objections from the citizens. As reported by TOI earlier, NMC and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which is the implementing agency of the project, had carried out a joint survey which revealed that the actual number of trees that will be felled for the IMS will be three-to-four times more than the figures presented by NHAI earlier. NHAI officials confirmed that 4,522 trees are the ones tha need to be felled for phase-1 of the IMS project. Though officials have reportedly not estimated the total number of trees that will be chopped off for the project, activists say it might be 30-40,000. The thought of losing such a large number of old trees has irked the environmentalists, who are now gearing up to file objection letters. Lawyer and Right to Information (RTI) activist Ankita Shah filed an objection online on Sunday afternoon, highlighting the importance of natural oxygen. “The city has witnessed huge shortage of oxygen, felling thousands of trees having high environmental value will be a big crisis. Compensatory plantations have hardly been successful,” she said. Recently, union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had admitted that not a single road constructed by NHAI was perfect when it comes to roadside plantations. IMS at Ajni is said to be the dream project of the minister. Activists said it was ironical that despite admitting their shortcomings, the policy-makers still want to cut more trees. “In February when NMC asked for objections for trees that were to be felled at Futala lake periphery and premises of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), people submitted a large number of objection letters in spite of lockdown. Yet, no public hearing was conducted and trees were cut. It is evident that authorities don't care about public sentiments and these notices are nothing but formalities,” said environment activist Jaydeep Das. Pointing out that the number 4,522 was much less than the projection given by activists, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “The criteria used during joint inspection for arriving at said figure need to be made public. Further, NHAI also needs to present the compensatory plantation plan, which should have been in place at drawing board stage of IMS project.” The activist further added that Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA) should have been done long back. “Also, transplantation has not been successful in recent past at Nagpur as it doesn't suit the city’s climate. So, transplantation against felled trees should not used as a justification,” added Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-notice-to-cut-4522-trees-for-ims-riles-greens/articleshow/83098025.cms||Manka Behl

Senior BJP leader G Vivek and former TRS MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy, are accompanying him on the trip. Eatala, who had considerable stature with the TRS party was dropped from the cabinet following his alleged involvement in land encroachment for his poultry farm, a charge vehemently denied by the family. Interestingly, on Sunday, the former minister’s wife, Eatala Jamuna, who runs the poultry farms, spoke for the first time to condemn the allegations. Eatala was in consultation with Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee and state BJP unit ever since he was dropped from the cabinet and has not denied speculation of joining BJP. Despite countering the TRS regime on the allegations, Eatala has not resigned either from the party or relinquished the MLA post of Huzurabad in Karimnagar district.

The Improvement Trust passed a resolution to the delight of Adeeb International, which holds functions in Sahir’s memory.Adeeb International chairman Kewal Dhir said: "There was nothing in Sahir’s name in his native city, which was shameful. When Beant Singh was chief minister, I got him to sanction Rs 65 lakhs grant and a land near the Pakhowal Road for Sahir’s memorial and prepared the layout. However, bureaucracy came in the way and the project was shelved. I went to cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and he was kind enough to call up Ludhiana Improvement Trust chairman Raman Bala Subramaniam. It was a pleasant surprise for me last week when I came to know of the sanctioned project, for which the credit goes to Ashu."The chairman said: "The minister and I discussed the details on Saturday. The memorial gets an acre at Satish Chander Dhawan Government College for Boys, where Sahir had studied and from where he was said to have been expelled. A grant of Rs 10 crore will make it a world-class centre with spacious auditorium, seminar hall, conference room, library of high-class literature, art gallery, book shop, pantry, canteen, recreational centre, and park. This is not just mine but entire Ludhiana’s and every Sahir fan’s dream project."Adeeb International plans to install a statue of Sahir Ludhianvi on the site. Minister Ashu confirmed the plan, saying: "It will be a tribute to the great poet. The LIT has sent its resolution for the government’s approval, which we expect in a week. After that, we’ll be able to float tenders."Literature lovers are excited by the news. Poet and art lover Ghulam Hassan Qaisar said: "Sahir was a world-class poet with fans across the globe. He deserved to have a proper memorial and we are happy that it is being done. We want that it completed in the shortest possible time." Abdul Hayee Fazl Mohammad, popular by his penname, Sahir Ludhianvi, wrote Urdu and Hindi songs for the Indian cinema as well. Talkhiyan is his best-known book of Urdu poetry and last year was his birth centenary.In the 1980s, Urdu poet Kaifi Azmi had come looking for Sahir's memorial in Ludhiana and not finding the literary hub he had imagined, done the next best thing—stood on the Jagraon bridge and saluted the poet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sahir-to-get-memorial-place-back-in-college/articleshow/83095134.cms||Shariq Majeed

The department of telecommunications (DoT) had suffered a loss of nearly 7 lakh per day, officials said. The main accused, identified as Owais Alam Malik, was picked up by police along with two other gang members - Pushpendra and Pawan Kumar - from Noida's Sector 62 on Tuesday. Police had found a fake exchange in Noida, and during investigation, they learnt that Malik was running a similar set up from his house in Moradabad. So, a raid was conducted by BSNL officials and Majhola SHO. Seven SIM boxes, VOIP Gateway along with other equipment used to run the telephone exchange were recovered from the house. Malik, who is a resident of Moradabad and in his 30s, is a software engineer and had worked at an IT firm for 10 years. He had also started his own web designing and computer essential supply work, but it wasn't fruitful. His two illegal setups may have caused a "loss of Rs 50 crore to the government". Moradabad ASP Anil Yadav said, “A few days ago, UP police busted an illegal telephone exchange in Noida. Owais Alam was arrested with two others and he told the police that a similar set up was present in Moradabad." "Acting on the information and local inputs, the Moradabad police and officials of BSNL raided a house in TP Nagar and seized SIM cards, computers, SIM boxes, phones and laptops," he added.

The association represents about 300 edible oil producers in the state. “As suggested by all major traders and industry associations, the import duty on edible oils should not be reduced as such step will benefit overseas farmers at the expense of our local farmers,” said Sameer Shah, president, GSEOOSA, in a letter to the Union food and consumer affair ministry suggesting measures to soften high prices of edible oils.’The trade body also suggested banning futures trade in all edible oils and oilseeds as it is dominated by speculators. According to Shah, the volumes in such futures trades are very high but physical deliveries are negligible.

With one forest staff deployed to monitor two tigers in an approximately 30 square kilometre area, the protection of tigers has become an uphill task. As per the data, Ranthambore which has 52 tigers and 14 cubs is grappling with acute shortage of vacancy with 70 posts yet to be filled.A source said, “There are 53 forest guards against the sanctioned posts of 123 forest guards. Out of this, 20 staff are deployed for work including tourism, rehabilitation and rescue. Moreover, the 14 women forest guard can be deployed in inside chowkis of forest for monitoring. Technically, one forest guard is keeping a vigil on two tigers.”After the poaching debacle in the state tiger reserves, the standing committee on wildlife recommended two guards on every forest beat. “In an ideal situation, Ranthambore requires a staff of 250. There are 102 beats at the reserve and as per text book rule; there should be 204 beat guards and 50 additional staff for other works. The present is far too less.”A forest guard deployed on two posts said, “My duty is to alternatively patrol the area falling under two posts. The task is to monitor tigers and simultaneously prevent grazing and mining in the reserve which is challenging.”A senior forest official said vacancies for forest guards who are essential for wildlife conservation, grassland management and rigorous protection from poaching and illegal tree-fellers are lying vacant. “The proposal has been sent to the subordinate service board and state government should consider the recruitment at the earliest.”The tiger reserves are just not home to big cats but also to rich bio-diversity and a considerable wildlife population, including big predators like leopards and faunas which need conservation and protection from wildlife smugglers. Green activist Tapeshwar Singh, said, “Till the time staff is recruited, the department should seek participation of locals and villagers to conserve the forest and tigers. The hiring should be done on continuous basis and procedure should be simplified.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tiger-monitoring-grapples-in-ranthambore-due-to-acute-staff-shortage/articleshow/83096851.cms||---

The canal had been closed for the last 60 days for renovation and desiltation, which has improved its holding capacity by over 1100 cusecs, preventing excess water from flowing into Pakistan. Though its holding capacity is up to 18,500 cusecs, it was holding 11,500-12,000 before renovation. Decades of non-stop water operations had damaged badly the lining in several places resulting in huge wastage of water due to seepage. Additionally, waterlogging at several places had been damaging crops and livestock every year at several places along the 500km stretch in the state. “This is for the first time that renovation of 97km has been done in one phase enhancing the holding capacity required to meet the ever-increasing drinking water demand of 22% of the population in the state,” said Naveen Mahajan, principal secretary, water resources department. The canal at present provides drinking water to 1.75 crore people living in 7,500 villages in 10 districts - Hanumangarh, Sri Ganganagar, Bikaner, Churu, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Nagaur, Sikar and Jhunjhunu. Additionally, the water will provide irrigation to villages even for kharif crops in May and June, which is a rarity as the region falls in the water-scarce region. He said it would increase the yield per hectare of crops with incessant supply of water. “Its far-reaching impacts would be from better health and hygiene to economic prosperity. The farmers can have three crops a year at some places while surplus water will save women from the misery of fetching water from far off places,” said Mahajan. “Surplus water from Ravi and Beas rivers, which goes to Pakistan, will be utilised here with the increase in the holding capacity of the canal,” said Mahajan. The move will also fulfill the commitment of the Union government which had announced after the Pulwama attack in 2018 that no excess water will be given to the neighbouring country. The project was to initiate in 2020, but due to Covid, it was postponed. “Work can only be executed after complete closure of IGNP. Closure in an irrigation system is only possible in the period after the end of the Rabi crop and before the start of the Kharif crop, i.e between late March and end of May,” said Mahajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-renovation-ignp-ready-to-ferry-irrigation-water-to-villages-in-10-dists/articleshow/83096856.cms||Shoeb Khan

The government had promised to refund almost 90% of the fees charged in private medical colleges where they secured admissions with some conditions. A total of Rs 32 crore was supposed to be allocated towards their medical education in private colleges. While the decision was taken by the Fadnavis-led government in 2019, the current state cabinet under the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government approved the allocation in August last year. A fresh government resolution was issued on October 9. Since then, the students are waiting for the money to be disbursed to their respective colleges. They are now being pressurised by the colleges to pay the tuition fees for the second year. Ashok Kherajani, a parent of a medical student from a private college in Navi Mumbai, said that it is almost two years now. “When the cabinet approved it in 2020 after a delay of one year, we were relieved. But the relief was short lived. There has been absolutely no communication after the October GR was issued,” said the father. He said that the students had to pay the first-year fees and now colleges are pressing for the second-year fees too. Affected students have taken to social media. “Almost two years has passed, but not a single penny paid for the education of open category students… The government has not yet notified the colleges regarding the rebate…” tweeted a student. Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said that the funds have already been sanctioned by the state. “There was a question on how to disburse this scholarship amount — through Maha DBT (direct benefit transfer) or through DMER. It has been sorted and the DMER will now reimburse the money in two weeks,” said Lahane. Some parents have paid Rs 90,800 this year, which was the cost of MBBS in government colleges in 2019. The government was planning to reduce this amount from the total fees of the respective private colleges while reimbursing. With varying fee structure at colleges, the amount ranges from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 40 lakh per student for the four-and-a-half-year course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-years-on-maratha-quota-hit-medical-students-yet-to-get-refund-from-state/articleshow/83098865.cms||Yogita Rao

Even after receiving permission from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to shift tigress T-124 named Riddhi to Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), the department is in no mood to implement it. “They have asked for a timeline to shift the tiger. We have to send the plan for approval,” a senior official said. Siblings Riddhi and Siddhi are constantly engaged in territorial fights for suzerainty in the reserve. In January, a proposal was floated after Riddhi suffered grievous injuries and received 14 stitches on the tongue. Riddhi had also killed the nine-month-old female cub of T-102. “We received permission to shift the tiger nearly three weeks ago. We have to also relocate some young tigers to a safe habitat as they could die in territorial fights,” said a source. The recent proposal to relocate six young tigers, aged between 2.5 to 4 years, is also gathering dust. Three tigers and three tigresses were zeroed in for shifting and the proposal sent to the chief wildlife warden (CWLW). The list consisted of male tigers T-113, T-121 and T-123 and female tigers T-119, T-124 and T-126. Park managers are anticipating fatal fights as many of these young tigers are venturing into dominant male territories. “Three-year-old male tiger T-120 has been spotted near Goolar, which is a dominant male’s T-86 territory after it was pushed away from Lahpur. In the same territory, tigress T-102 is living with her young cubs. We fear that either T-120 could kill the cubs or itself be killed by T-86,” the source said. Officials say there are 52 adult big cats (30 tigresses and 22 tigers) in RTR-1, the highest in its history. As per estimates, 7-8 adult tigers are jostling for space in less than 100sqkm area. “Out of the total 934sqkm area of RTR-1, only 700sqkm is used by tigers. As per a rough estimate, a male tiger requires an area of approximately 25sqkm and a female about 15sqkm. This shows how the big cats are cramped for space,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/relocating-t-124-forest-dept-drags-feet-yet-again/articleshow/83102494.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Sardar Patel set up VS Hospital after Ahmedabad hit by influenza, plague||AHMEDABAD: After having witnessed people in cities and small towns suffer repeated episodes of plagues and influenza between 1917 and 1921, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel felt that a robust health infrastructure was vital for urban well-being as dwellings were denser. The establishment of VS Hospital in the early 1930s was Sardar’s efforts towards meeting the emerging health crisis in the city — a facility managed solely by the people of the city. Before this effort was made, very few know that Sardar sought a desperate takeover of the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital first. However, it was the British government’s insistence that, municipalities do not run hospitals, which led to the formation of VS Hospital. In October 1924, the British government asked every municipality to contribute 4% of its income towards government health infrastructure. But that same year, Sardar Patel — who was then the sanitation committee chairman in the Ahmedabad burrough municipality — gathered support in the following months to take over Civil Hospital (at Gheekantha) seeking from the British government in April 1925. “Sardar moved a resolution in the general board in December 1925 which read that the British government should allow the Ahmedabad municipality to run the hospital for two years for ‘aazmaish’ (trial) as there is nothing more important or vital than health and that the municipality was ready to spend not 4% but one-fourth of its income to maintain the health facility. The British government refused,” says historian Rizwan Kadri, who has a copy of the general board resolution. In March 1926, an even more determined Sardar Patel, got a resolution passed in the municipality to first run a nursing home with Rs 50,000 as fund from Chunilal Nagindas Chinai, which was executed by his son Chimanlal Jivanlal. Once the precedent was set, that same year, Sardar approached another philanthropist Sheth Vadilal Sarabhai, who had committed his wealth for public purposes, and appointed Sheth Mansukhlal Chanalal from Bombay as executor. “Sardar knew Sheth Mansukhlal, and the latter agreed. On October 5, 1926 the municipality passed a resolution to set up the VS Hospital trust. In December, another resolution was passed to acquire and a 21-acre plot for Rs 1.28 lakh for which funds were made available. On December 13, 1931, the VS Hospital was inaugurated,” says Kadri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sardar-patel-set-up-vs-after-city-hit-by-influenza-plague/articleshow/83096903.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad schools open heart and purse for Covid-19 orphans||HYDERABAD: Often drawing flak for fee hikes, schools in Hyderabad are providing a healing touch by offering fee waivers to students who have lost one or both parents to Covid-19. Many students have got a full fee waiver till the completion of Intermediate. After losing her husband, who was a scientist at Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, to Covid-19 in August last year, Sunitha Bathula was concerned about the education of her two sons. “I don’t have any employment, and I even lost my parents in the last one year. Worried about who would pay the fees for my sons, I reached out to Hyderabad Public School (HPS), Ramanthapur administration, who readily waived off Rs 1.2 lakh and informed me that they’d take care of their education,” said Bathula, who has one son is Class IX and another in Class I. HPS, Ramanthapur has extended such relief to eight other students who lost their parents in the past one year. The situation was much the same for A Anwitha, a Class V student of Pallavi Model School. After her family paid Rs 23 lakh towards hospital bills for both her mother and her father for Covid-19 treatment, it was a struggle to pay school fees for the academic year 2020-21. “After the child lost her father, the mother reached out to many seeking financial help to clear hospital bills. Later, paying the school fee emerged as a major challenge. Help came when the school administration waived off the fees for the child,” said Vamsi Priya, the student’s aunt. Jubilee Hills Public School (JHPS) extended fee concessions, homeschooling option and waivers for those who were affected severely due to Covid-19. “We are extending a full fee waiver for children who are orphaned as long as they continue to seek education from our school. In some cases, where a parent has died, we have refunded the fees and have helped single parents wherever we could,” said Murli Mukund, chairman, JHPS. Many other school managements have decided to extend relief to those who have lost a parent or both parents to Covid-19. “This waiver will be till Class IX in order to lend a supporting hand to the bereaved families during this time of the extended situation of trauma and grief,” read a letter issued by B Chandra Sekhar, administrator of Johnson Grammar School. In Silver Oaks International School, more than 300 families who suffered personal loss or business loss have been extended relief through concessions, extended time to may payments or partial or full fee waivers. Bhadruka Junior College for Girls has also announced free two-year intermediate education for eligible students orphaned due to Covid-19. “All the details on how to avail admission in this category will be furnished in the official website,” said Abhirama Krishna, director-general of the institution||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-schools-open-heart-and-purse-for-covid-19-orphans/articleshow/83100896.cms||Preeti Biswas

The process for the civic elections if it is to be held has to start in the next couple of months. The likelihood of an extension in the current ‘break the chain’ restrictions and talks of a third wave may create obstacles in the start of the election process. Not only Pune but also Mumbai, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik, Solapur, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur will also go to the polls in February 2022. These cities will also be affected by the pandemic. According to experts in municipal law, a postponement is possible. The civic administration gets an extension, but elected members don’t play any direct role in such a period. The tenure of the elected members is ceases after the term ends . The operations of the civic administration are carried out through an administrator. “The process of conducting elections and the preparation prior to it is lengthy. At least nine months to a year is needed to complete the whole formalities. Most of the staff involved in the election-related work at civic administration level needs to do these works along with their routine duties. So, adequate time should be available in their hands for preparations,” Sunil Parkhi, former municipal secretary of PMC, told TOI. According to him, the elections for the elections to be conducted in February 2022, the procedure should have to start by now. The PMC elections have been postponed before too in 1990, but was conducted in 1992. The declaration of the panel system has to be done. The last elections were held with a four-ward system. Now, there is a demand that each panel should have only two wards. The state government declares the panel system. “The elections should be held on time. The ruling state government should not misuse the Covid situation as an opportunity to serve their purpose and delay the elections,” Ganesh Bidkar, leader of house in PMC, said. Deepali Dhumal, leader of opposition in the PMC, said they will take a call at the party level soon. “If things improve soon on the Covid -19 front, then the polls are possible. But, if the situation worsens, we will have to postpone the elections. We are prepared for both situations,” she added. Issues like the merger of 23 villages have to be considered first. “We will have to complete all these processes at the earliest before the poll process,” Aba Bagul, leader of the Congress in PMC, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-polls-in-feb-but-covid-delays-process/articleshow/83096899.cms||---

This will enable the state bus corporation to up its revenue -- from Rs 56 crore annually to upto Rs 250 crore. ST trucks are actually buses modified into trucks to transport essentials and non essential goods across Maharashtra and can be booked by any government or private agency. This innovation was introduced during Covid pandemic by MSRTC in a bid to earn more revenue. Said a senior MSRTC official, “It is a huge benefit for our bus corporation which has been incurring losses during the pandemic. Our core business which is passenger transport has been badly hit.” Of the total fleet of 18,000 less than 2,000 public transport buses are on roads today. The government departments which will give 25% transport business to ST-trucks include: Industry, energy and labour, Urban development, Tribal development, Social justice, Women and child welfare, School education and sports, Cooperative, Agriculture, Animal husbandry and dairy, Planning and Finance departments.

Several organisations had demanded compensation to families who have lost members due to Covid -19 or related complications, asserting that it was due to the state government’s negligence. Holding the state administration responsible for Covid mismanagement leading to deaths due to oxygen-related issues, the South Goa advocates association had even approached the high court. Political parties such as Congress, Goa Forward and AAP had demanded that compensaton be paid to families whose members died due to Covid. Meanwhile, Sawant said that from June 3, vaccination for the 18-44 age group would start, but only for parents who have a child below two, persons with comorbid condition, persons with disabilities, and seafarers. “They have to show the necessary documents to get vaccinated,” Sawant said. During his Statehood Day address, Sawant said that Covid cases are on the decline in the state, and that the positivity rate has also gone down. He also said that Covid deaths have decreased. “We will overcome this Covid situation and make Goa Covid-free,” he said. Sawant said that the state government cannot compensate for loss of life due to Covid, but that it is committed to complete vaccinating 100% of the 45+ age group. He also said that the 18-44 vaccination drive will prioritise those registered with the transport department like motorcycle pilots, cabbies and rickshaw drivers. Sawant thanked doctors, nurses and frontline workers working on Covid management. Referring to the announcement by PM Narendra Modi about the scheme for children who have lost their parents to Covid, Sawant said that a monthly stipend would be given to children through the chief minister’s anath aadhar yojana, which will be run by the department of women and child development. “We will implement all the schemes for orphan children in Goa,” he said Sawant also said that laptops would be given to orphans studying in SSC and above. He added that the state government has extended financial assistance to childcare facilities that take care of youth in the 18-21 age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-give-rs-2l-to-ews-families-that-lost-earning-member-to-covid-sawant/articleshow/83098874.cms||---

From the time the pandemic hit Telangana on March 2, 2020 when the first case was recorded, the virus has claimed 3,247 patients so far. Of these, 1,634 deaths were recorded between March 2020 and February 2021. On the other hand, in the last three months alone, Telangana recorded 1,613 deaths up to Friday, almost matching the count of the 12 months prior to that. While the number of deaths reduced to less than five daily at the beginning of 2021, by the time the second wave hit the state, on March 1 this year, a sudden spike in cases was seen. “If we see, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the state has not changed much over the last couple of months but it is the sheer number of infections which have increased the number of deaths. Since the virus has spread rapidly during the second phase, more vulnerable people were exposed to the virus,” said a senior official from the state health department. The CFR in the beginning of February this year was 0.54% while it is currently 0.56%, registering only a minute change. However, what has been different is that unlike the first wave when majority of the deaths were seen in patients over 60 years of age and patients having cormorbidities, this time a large number of deaths were seen in the 30 to 50 age group. This, experts say, is because of the circulating variant of the virus. “While death rate is almost the same in Telangana even now, the number of deaths increased in the three months of the second wave. It is due to the rapid spread of variants of concern. The B.1.617 (double mutant) version of the virus is responsible for the rapid spread. In fact, one in three samples sequenced in Telangana in April and May belong to B.1.617 Lineage 2,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2nd-wave-death-toll-nears-last-years/articleshow/83096890.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana PHCs given target of 250 daily tests by health department||HYDERABAD: The state health department has given its highest-ever testing target to primary healthcare centres (PHC) since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. PHCs have now been told to conduct 250 antigen tests daily. It had reached its lowest daily testing at just 40 tests per day recently. While local authorities have been asked to conduct as many tests as they can, this is the first time an official target of 250 daily tests has been set. If most PHCs in the state manage to achieve the new daily testing target, the state will reach a testing rate of over 1.5 lakh tests per day. Following a recent cabinet meeting over increasing the tests, the state health department had boosted the number of tests from an average of around 60,000 tests per day to almost 90,000 tests per day on average. According to highly-placed sources within the health department, the new target is aimed at achieving at least one lakh tests per day till the end of June. After that, a discussion on new testing targets will be taken up and a decision will be taken in accordance with the prevailing situation. Apart from fixing a new daily testing target for PHCs, another major change has been initiated in the pattern of testing. Earlier, people would approach the identified testing centres in PHCs to get tested but now testing will be carried out based on the findings of the fever survey. Those identified as symptomatic during the survey will be divided into small groups and then taken to select locations for their Covid-19 tests. “Each Asha worker and ANM has been given a target of identifying a fixed number of symptomatic persons. They (the symptomatic persons) will be brought to the designated place with assistance from local technicians and their tests will be performed. These tests will fall within the daily target set for PHCs at 250,” informed an official from the state health department. Speaking to TOI over the increased rate of testing, state public health director Dr Srinivasa Rao said the objective behind the move was to ensure that no one is denied testing in the state. “There is abundant availability of antigen kits in the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/phcs-given-target-of-250-daily-tests-by-health-dept/articleshow/83096878.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||India||Overall failure, 7 years of immeasurable pain and suffering for people: Congress||NEW DELHI: The Modi government had been an overall failure, had caused immeasurable pain and suffering to Indian people and betrayed their trust, Congress said Sunday as the NDA government completed seven years in office. Listing out seven “blunders” by the government, from a failing economy to the mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic, paucity of oxygen, rising unemployment and the government’s inability to rein in foreign incursions on Indian soil, Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala said the seven years accounted for “immeasurable pain, insurmountable devastation and unfathomable agony and anguish for a nation of 140 crore people”. “Time has come to ask who is responsible for insurmountable devastation, agony and anguish and unfathomable pain that has been inflicted on the people of India and that is why it is time for stock-taking,” he added. Congress also released a seven-point chargesheet in which it accused the Modi government of abdicating its responsibility to people. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi slammed the government for its alleged “misgovernance” over seven years. He said the government needed to have the right intention, policy and determination to fight the pandemic, not just “monthly Mann ki Baat”. Congress also defended its poor performance in elections and said while it was persisting with its duty as a responsible opposition, the party’s priority was to save the nation from the “Modi-made disaster” to protect the poor and vulnerable. Congress released a seven-point chargesheet in which it accused the Modi govt of abdicating its responsibility to people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/overall-failure-7-years-of-immeasurable-pain-and-suffering-for-people-congress/articleshow/83102148.cms||---

Fifty members of the community, including 27 from the transgender community, got their first shot in a special camp organised by Prantakatha and Techno India DAMA Hospital, two days ahead of the Pride Month.  Bappaditya Mukherjee of Prantakatha said there is also a vaccine hesitancy among the trans community that, he feels, is obvious when many don’t even avail of basic healthcare facilities for the kind of harassment they face. “The pandemic has the community even more marginalized. From being forced to stay with homophobics, transphobic families, leading to abuse, depression, job loss and no access to Covid vaccines have made their lives even more pathetic,” said Mukherjee, who himself was among the 50 who took the jab on Sunday. “We need more such community-friendly special camps where recipients are not subjected to bully and harassment by the society. This will encourage more people from the community to get themselves vaccinated,” said a transgender activist, Ranjita Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-from-lgbt-community-receive-their-first-shot/articleshow/83096928.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Hyderabad||Quit smoking to prevent lung damage, say experts||HYDERABAD: On the occasion of World Tobacco Day on Sunday, experts stressed on the need to quit smoking and using tobacco in other forms to prevent further damage to lungs. The theme for this year is ‘Quit Tobacco to be a Winner’. While tobacco is known to cause majority of the cancers, its impact on lungs has become even more significant during the ongoing pandemic as patients having chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) due to tobacco use are at a risk of severe disease. “In light of the present pandemic, smokers also have a 50% higher chance of developing severe issues due to the novel coronavirus with increased risk of hospitalisation and need for ventilator,” said Dr P Vijay Karan Reddy, consultant radiation oncologist, Apollo Cancer Institute. Tobacco products may also aid transmission of Covid-19. “Tobacco usage increases the chances of getting Covid-19 through cigarettes, hookah water pipes, bidis, cigars and heated tobacco products, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers and possibly contaminated cigarettes with the lips, and this increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth although there have been contradictory reports of incidence of Covid-19 among smokers,” said Dr Nagendra Parvataneni, head of department of surgical oncology, KIMS hospitals. The two main complications of Covid-19 are amplified due to the use of tobacco. “One is the deterioration of the status of the lung health making smokers highly vulnerable to severe Covid-19 infection. There is also the increased tendency for blood clotting as the effect of smoking can have more disastrous consequences,” said Dr Geetha Nagasree, consultant surgical oncologist, Care Cancer Institute. The earlier the exposure to risk factors like smoking, the greater is the level of decline in lung function. “Quitting smoking or using tobacco in any form can reduce the number of hospitalisations and improve lung function. The earlier you quit, the better you can manage the disease and save your lungs,” said Dr Vishnu Rao, senior consultant in allergy and asthma, SWASA Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/quit-smoking-to-prevent-lung-damage-say-experts/articleshow/83096907.cms||---

---||Goa||Poor planning, no local body involvement trips Tika Utsav||Panaji: The response to the government’s Tika Utsav has been underwhelming, with most vaccination sites inoculating fewer than 100 people each per day, betraying a lack of effort and strategy from the state government to push the drive. “The government is carrying out these drives, but not with the same fervour it has at the time of elections,” a doctor said. “Booth-level officers could play a huge role by just ticking off names of people already vaccinated from the list of electors. The local ward representatives should have been roped in to see why people are hesitant to get vaccinated, and to mobilise them.” Village panchayats that asked their health centres for a list of those vaccinated have been told these were not available. Also, the belated announcement of the latest tika utsav, without taking local bodies into confidence, has resulted in the poor turnout, they say. At the Carmona panchayat, only 33 persons showed up for tika utsav on May 27, and in Sancoale, just eight persons showed up on May 29. Centres have a capacity of inoculating over 300 persons a day. Carmona sarpanch Allwyn Jorge told TOI that this was a waste of time and energy for the vaccination team, who sat from 9am till 5pm. The problem would have been solved if panchayats were involved in the planning. “Nothing has come to us from the government regarding vaccination,” he said. “We are not kept in the loop, and only learn about these drives through unofficial channels. We were told about the tika utsav two days earlier, and then suddenly, with a day’s notice, we were told we would get another session, leaving us with little time to mobilise people.” Without data in hand, it’s not easy to ascertain who hasn’t taken the vaccine to convince them, experts said. “We are wasting valuable time at the pace at which we are going,” the sarpanch said. “Some have taken a decision not to take the vaccine, and we cannot force them. Others may need transport or some help or convincing, which can be done by the local bodies, if we are taken into confidence.” State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar admitted that the tika utsav numbers are “low”, and attributes it to “vaccine hesitancy”. However, he says this is due to a combination of factors which could also involve a large section of the population testing positive recently and not being able to get vaccinated at this point. A vaccination officer blamed the low turnout to poor advocacy, leaders not taking the vaccine initially, and religious leaders not being roped in. Bicholim based activist and retired teacher Ramesh Gauns said that the government that uses all its machinery from panchas and booth-level officers to ZPs during electioneering has failed to do so for the “very serious cause” of vaccination. “The Goa government is taking the vaccination of its population very casually,” he said. “They preach to and teach every ZP and panchayat member during elections, and vigorously campaign and mobilise people during elections, but this is not seen during the pandemic, which is sad.” The government could have roped in social workers, balwadi and anganwadi workers, and capitalised on its entire workforce, he said. “It seems like they are running short of ideas despite having the entire state machinery and money power with them,” he said. Meanwhile, parish priest of Chicalim church, Fr Bolmax Pereira, said that more volunteers need to be involved officially to reach more people. “There has been a lot of misinformation on social media, and people are afraid,” he said. “The government’s apathy in handling the situation has worsened that fear.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poor-planning-no-local-body-involvement-trips-tika-utsav/articleshow/83098934.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The UFERWAS, an apex body of resident welfare associations in the Greater Hyderabad limits, had tied up with Apollo Hospitals to take up vaccination drives in various colonies and gated communities. “Close to 10 colonies and gated communities in each zone have been identified where the vaccination drives will be taken up. Priority is being given to those who are 18+ and are yet to take their first dose,” said BT Srinivas, general secretary, UFERWAS. The UFERWAS is also in the process of developing its own app that will enable residents to register as well as book slots on the CoWIN app. “Using application programming interface, we will launch a third-party application that will enable our residents to not only register through CoWIN but also schedule an appointment and manage Covid-19 vaccination directly from their end,” said Srinivas. Several independent gated communities in areas such as Kokapet, Nallagandla, Gachibowli, Narsingi, Kukatpally among others have tied up with hospitals to conduct vaccination drives. “We have got 1,000 residents who will be getting their first shot on June 1. Our community has tied up with a nearby hospital that is enabling the vaccination drive within our premises,” said Vinod Agarwal, resident of a gated community on the outer ring road in Kokapet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-50k-residents-to-rev-up-vax-drive-in-city-colonies/articleshow/83096929.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata ATMs under sophisticated hacking attack||KOLKATA: Man in the Middle (MiTM) ATM hacking in which cyber fraudsters secretly intercept the two-way encrypted messaging and data transfer between an ATM and its bank servers and manipulate it to prompt ATMs to spew cash have hit Kolkata for the first time, police said on Saturday. The bank or its customers do not lose money in these cyber-attacks, but the ATMs run dry of cash. The highly sophisticated cyber-attacks have been officially reported from three ATMs in Jadavpur, Cossipore and New Market in which ATMs have already dispensed around Rs 40-lakh cash. Detectives suspect multiple ATMs, which have not updated their operating systems, may have been hit and the losses can run into crores. According to sources, the attacks in Kolkata ATMs have been physically orchestrated reportedly by two persons — who have been caught in CCTV footages — between May 14 and 22. These persons, police suspect, are runners. CCTV footages also show them opening the ATM control panel and inserting a “black box” like device. They seem to have inserted cards, stayed for about 30 minutes to an hour, and walked away after pocketing the stolen cash. According to investigators, preliminary probe indicates the pathways between the ATM switch (the control panel in the ATM) and the bank servers have been breached in two ways. In the first, the fraudsters have set up proxy bank servers in a manner that the encrypted messages from the ATM switch never reached the bank server, instead reached these proxy servers. The fraudsters inserted dummy or stolen cards to withdraw cash. When the card details were subsequently relayed by the ATM switch to the bank server it should have otherwise declined such transactions as “unauthorised transaction” but the proxy servers allowed it, prompting the ATM to dispense cash. In the second, the fraudsters tampered with the ATM LAN (Local Area Network) in the ATM’s control panel itself. The bank’s command servers had originally turned down or declined the unauthorised transaction. But these encrypted messages from the bank server were intercepted and manipulated by the external device and changed to allow the transaction before it bounced back to the ATM switch. “Such sophisticated ATM hacking has not been reported in Kolkata before. Such cases have been reported in Delhi, Bangalore, Gurugram, Noida and Jalandhar before, some even as recent as this month,” an officer said. The RBI in a 22-page advisory in February 2021 had specifically asked all stakeholders to upgrade their ATM security to thwart such MiTM attacks. “We have taken over the probe and the bank fraud section are working with bank officials to develop leads,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The first FIR was drawn up at New Market PS on May 25. The other two FIRs — one at Jadavpur PS and the other at Cossipore — were drawn up on May 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-atms-under-sophisticated-hacking-attack/articleshow/83096894.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘It is easier to climb Mount Everest than overcoming red tape’||AURANGABAD: A few days ago, Sambhaji Gurav made Maharashtra proud by becoming the third policeman from the state to scale Mount Everest. But even as police naik Rafiq Shaikh, the state’s first policeman atop Everest, raised a toast to Gurav’s feat, he could relate his continuing wait for service benefits and funding promised by the state government in recognition for his achievement in May 2016. “Climbing Mount Everest was easier than overcoming red tape,” rues the 35-year-old Aurangabad policeman, who lost three of his toes to frostbite while descending. The chief minister’s office (CMO), by tagging then CM Devendra Fadnavis, had tweeted on June 12, 2016, that the state government would bear the complete cost of Shaikh’s expedition. Shaikh, who met Fadnavis personally, was also promised service benefits in the form of departmental promotion. “In November 2017, the official process began for seeking my service record and expedition details to facilitate the departmental promotion. I was to get Rs 52 lakh as funding for the expedition. But I was later told that some technical issues came up. I have since met several political leaders, including former home minister Anil Deshmukh, but only got hollow promises,” Shaikh said on Sunday. On 31 July, 2019, the state home department had written to the Maharashtra director general of police highlighting issues in funding Shaikh’s expedition as there was no “budgetary head” for such an allocation. It had also said the desired release of money cannot be done through the CM’s relief fund either given a pending litigation in the Bombay high court related to the use of the corpus for purposes other than medical or accidental deaths. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil and Aurangabad guardian minister Subhash Desai could not be reached despite repeated attempts to contact them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-it-is-easier-to-climb-mount-everest-than-overcoming-red-tape/articleshow/83098949.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Demand has taken off for aircraft parking slots||AHMEDABAD: Flight movements have drastically reduced as the number of people preferring air travel has sharply dipped due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The wave has gradually begun receding now. But with reduced demand, a large part of the aircraft fleet of every airline tends to remain idle, pushing up parking occupancy at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad. At any given point, at least 7-8 aircraft operating scheduled flights are seen parked at the city airport. This is over and above the state-owned, privately owned, and other non-scheduled aircraft parked here. Increased parking occupancy at SVPIA has been seen since mid-April. “At least 50% of the fleet of each airline is lying idle. The demand has taken a major hit due to the second wave and the restrictions imposed to curb the virus spread,” said a senior official of an airline. “While corporates have imposed restrictions on travel, leisure travel has also nosedived because of a slew of territorial shutdowns, restrictions, and the protocol mandating travellers to show the negative RT-PCR report while entering the state.” The official said that often it is not viable for airlines to operate flights. “With few flights operating, aircraft are bound to remain idle and parked,” the official explained. “While airlines tend to prefer airports in metros such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru due to the easy availability of maintenance services, aircraft operating scheduled flights are also parked at other airports.” Sources in the aviation sector said that the situation is similar at other airports such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. Earlier this year, SVPI airport operationalized an additional eight parking stands, taking the total number of aircraft parking stands to 42. Sources said that the fleet of aircraft for intra-state flights is also idle as intra-state movement has gone down drastically and a part of the fleet is parked at the city airport. Typically, more aircraft are seen parked late at night. Apart from aircraft on scheduled flights, state-owned aircraft as well as private aircraft are parked at the city airport. However, that is a permanent affair. These include at least 10 aircraft owned by business conglomerates, pharma companies, and real estate players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/demand-has-taken-off-for-aircraft-parking-slots/articleshow/83096931.cms||---

In a series of tweets hours before the state cabinet led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao met here to take a call on the extension of lockdown, Owaisi said, “As data shows, Covid-19 cases are reducing much before lockdown was imposed on May 12. It’s clear it’s not lockdown that helped. It’s also clear that Covid-19 can be combated without lockdown.” He strongly urged the chief minister’s office (@Telangana CMO) not to extend the lockdown. “If the goal is to reduce crowding, then we may consider evening curfews from 6 pm onwards or mini lockdowns in Covid-19 clusters,” he tweeted. He said that lockdowns give a cruel choice to the poor: poverty, police atrocities or pandemic. He said one can combat Covid-19 only by educating the public about Covid-19 precautions and tweaking policies to enable such lifestyle change. Owaisi also tweeted in Telugu urging the CM not to extend lockdown and received huge response from Twitterati who appreciated it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdowns-cant-combat-covid-owaisi/articleshow/83096947.cms||Roushan Ali

One of the arrested accused is brother-in-law of the main assailant Anuj Gujjar. Police claimed to have got vital clues on the whereabouts of the accused and are hopeful of making arrests in this connection. The doctor couple, Sudeep and wife Seema Gupta, accused in a case of setting on fire a woman (Deepa Gurjar) and her six-year-old son in 2019, were shot dead in Bharatpur on Friday afternoon by two bike-borne assailants. Primary investigation revealed that Sudeep was in an illicit relationship with Deepa and she was later set on fire. Thereafter, in a vengeful act, the assailants shot the couple dead. “On Sunday, we arrested two persons for harbouring the assailants and we found that they also involved in the planning and conspiracy. The accused were identified as Daulat Gujjar, 25 and Nirbhan Singh, 22. Daulat is the main accused Anuj’s brother-in-law,” SP Devendra Bishnoi told TOI on Sunday.

Several daily wagers said that they were satisfied with the government’s decision. “The life of the common man had come to a halt due to the lockdown. The extended relaxation period gives some relief, but the government should help those who are financially weak,” said Syed Saddam, a vendor in Old City. Further, the financial crisis and challenges in payment of house rent, electricity and water bills and the daily expenses have forced many to borrow money on high interest rates. “I do not know how to deal with the mounting monetary issues as my savings have dried up. Last month, I was told by my college management that there would be no payment during the lockdown period,” Hafiz Jameeluddin, a teacher at a private college, said. Several citizens also pointed out that the ‘huge’ challans have added to their woes. “The government must ask cops to be lenient when so many are suffering financially,” an Old City resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/extension-of-relaxation-time-brings-respite/articleshow/83096964.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Producers stick to shooting from home, seek CM’s help||Kolkata: The Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP) issued a statement saying for the greater good of the industry, it is imperative that the ‘show goes on’. “We shall continue work from home so that the broadcasters, viewers and technicians are not deprived of revenues, new episodes and income,” the statement read. The association also requested the chief minister to allow shooting at home with limited technicians. The statement mentioned that WATP’s decision to continue with the shoot from home arrangement directly falls in line with the vision of the chief minister who has also encouraged work from home. “We have been working in this industry for long and have established ourselves by dint of hard work. We will want to work respectfully and not have anyone throwing his or her weight around and asking us to stop work,” the statement read.  Meanwhile, Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) president Swarup Biswas claimed that WATP members are flouting the strict Covid restrictions that have been extended in Bengal till June 15. “We have been following our chief minister’s advice of maintaining social distancing and not stepping out of home unless there is an emergency. That’s how the numbers have come down,” Biswas said. He referred to an episode of Snehasish Chakraborty’s ‘Khelaghar’ that was telecast on Saturday. “It showed scenes from an actor and an actress shooting together. This only means that either of the actors has gone over to the other’s place. No social distance was maintained in the shoot since the episode showed that the actors sitting in close proximity. This is a complete violation of the chief minister’s advice. They are flouting the norms she has set about not stepping out of home unless there is an emergency,” he said.  He also alleged producers had begun shooting at home without even informing the technicians. “It is only after we raised objections that they are now talking about not depriving technicians. This is not professionalism at all. Why are they not talking to us directly instead of issuing press statements?” asked Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/producers-stick-to-shooting-from-home-seek-cms-help/articleshow/83096962.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Pune||Cops ask societies to verify caregivers, domestic helps||Pune: The Chatushrungi police have written to 15 prominent housing and bungalow societies in Aundh, Baner, Pashan and Senapati Bapat Road areas, asking them to verify the credentials of caregivers, maids, nursing staff, gardeners and caretakers working with elderly people, who are staying alone. The move comes in the wake of recent incidents — at Panchavati society in Pashan and Sindh housing society in Aundh and another bunglaow at Sinhagad Road — wherein former caregivers and their aides targeted vulnerable couples by assaulting and robbing them of cash and valuables. In the first week of May, the police arrested an eight-member gang (headed by Sandeep Bhagwan Hande) who would seek help from nursing bureaus to get himself employed with elderly couples as caregivers and would later target them for robberies. Hande was a former caregiver at the bungalows targetted in Panchavati and Sindh society, the police probe revealed. He was affiliated to 15 different nursing bureaus in the city and took work assignments from the bureaus only for senior citizens. His verification was not done despite a criminal background, police said. “Many elderly people, either couples or single, are staying in these societies and we expect the societies to follow some basic security rules so that the elderly couples or lone persons can be secure,” said senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police. “We will soon send similar letters to other housing/bungalow societies which have not been covered in our first letter,” he added. He said, “We have asked the societies to install CCTV cameras at the entrance and other strategic points, maintain a register of workers, collect copies of their ID cards (Adhaar/ PAN Card etc.), log visitors’ entries and take details of the caregivers if employed by the elderly persons or lonely individuals. We have asked the society office bearers to approach us if a caregiver is employed by the elderly couple or a lone person, for character verification. Police will do the character verification for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-ask-societies-to-verify-caregivers-domestic-helps/articleshow/83097010.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Doctor helps patients beat Covid-19 at home, with just Rs 10 fee||HYDERABAD: Kamalamma, 65, a resident of Boduppal, who recovered from Covid-19 in home isolation, is all praise for Dr Victor Emmanuel. Many recognise the doctor as a life-saver for Covid-19 patients when several hospitals are struggling with shortage of beds and oxygen cylinders. “To me, doctor saab is like God and my wife recovered from Covid-19 within a week with his medication. I have had to spend only Rs 40,000, which is quite affordable for the treatment,” Kamalamma’s husband K Yadagari told TOI.  P Janaki Ram, an employee of Centre for Good Governance (CGG), whose seven family members recuperated after testing positive for Covid-19, spent only Rs 10,000 for the treatment. All the seven members were treated in home isolation under the doctor’s supervision. “If I had admitted my seven family members to a private hospital, the bill would have crossed Rs 25 lakh,” said Janaki Ram. Hundreds of families have recovered from the disease during the first wave and current wave under the doctor’s guidance. Dr Emmanuel, a general physician, runs Prajwala Clinics at Boduppal. His clinic is always packed with Covid-19 patients as the consultation fee is just Rs 10. “I treated nearly 20,000 to 25,000 people having Covid-19 symptoms at an affordable rate. Another 500 patients were treated in the Covid-19 Isolation Centre. An old Medipally police station at Peerzadiguda was converted into a 30-bed isolation centre,” said Dr Emmanuel. Dr Emmanuel said that so far, all his patients have recovered from Covid-19. “The Almighty has given me an opportunity to serve the needy. Most of them are struggling financially due to the lockdown. My consultation fee has been fixed at Rs 10 for a few families and is free for many poor families,” he said. On an average, 70 to 100 people visit the clinic every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doc-helps-patients-beat-covid-19-at-home-with-just-rs-10-fee/articleshow/83096983.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Aurangabad||5 years on, first Maharashtra cop on Everest still awaits assured benefits||AURANGABAD: A few days ago, Sambhaji Gurav made Maharashtra proud by becoming the third policeman from the state to scale Mount Everest. But even as police naik Rafiq Shaikh, the state’s first policeman atop Everest, raised a toast to Gurav’s feat, he could help but relate his continuing wait for service benefits and funding promised by the state government in recognition for his achievement in May 2016. “Climbing Mount Everest was easier than overcoming red-tapism,” rues the 35-year-old Aurangabad policeman, who lost three of his toes to frostbite while descending. He says four policemen from Maharashtra have received service benefits for excelling in sports such as wrestling and kabbadi, but his case is simply not making progress. The chief minister’s office (CMO), by tagging then CM Devendra Fadnavis, had tweeted on June 12, 2016, that the state government would bear the complete cost of Shaikh’s expedition. Shaikh, who met Fadnavis personally, was also promised service benefits in the form of departmental promotion. “In November 2017, the official process began for seeking my service record and expedition details to facilitate the departmental promotion. I was to get Rs 52 lakh as funding for the expedition. But I was later told that some technical issues had cropped up. I have since met several political leaders, including former home minister Anil Deshmukh, but only got hollow promises,” Shaikh said on Sunday. On 31 July, 2019, the state home department had written to the Maharashtra director general of police highlighting issues in funding Shaikh’s expedition as there was no “budgetary head” for such an allocation. It had also said the desired release of money cannot be done through the CM’s relief fund either given a pending litigation in the Bombay high court related to the use of the corpus for purposes other than medical or accidental deaths. “It was the state government which had, on its own, announced the funding, followed by initiation of the process of collecting my service record and expedition details,” Shaikh said. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil did not respond to text messages or phone calls made to him by TOI on the issue. Aurangabad guardian minister Subhash Desai could also not be reached despite repeated attempts to contact him. NCP spokesperson Vikas Lawande said his party would take steps to ensure Shaikh got his dues. “We will take up the issue with the home minister and ensure all possible help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/5-yrs-on-1st-maha-cop-on-everest-still-awaits-assured-benefits/articleshow/83093537.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Amid pandemic curbs, marital discord cases pile up at Sharia courts in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The lockdown-like curbs in the wake of the second Covid wave has pushed many a marital discord to further turmoil with Idara-e-Sharia or Sharia/qazi courts closed and cases piling up. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board runs nine qazi courts in the city. Each court has a mufti or qualified qazi who plays the judge with a team of counsellors, both male and female, to facilitate the redressal of grievances. “Before the lockdown, we would get four-five cases a day. Now applications are piling up, but we can’t call the parties for hearing,” said activist Saeed Khan, who volunteers as a counsellor at a qazi court in the basement of a Nagpada building. Mufti Faiyyaz Alam Qasmi, the qazi at Nagpda Darul Qaza, said first efforts are made to bring reconciliation between the man and woman locked in marital discord. If all efforts fail and it seems separation is the only way out, the court decides khula or talaq. He added that qazi courts are sanctioned by the Muslim Personal Law Board, but the cost to run them are borne by the local committees. Each litigant is charged Rs 1,000 as processing fee. “For speedy disposal of cases, each ar-ea should have a qazi court that could operate from mosque premises and be funded through donations,” said Aligarh Muslim University executive council member Mohammed Asif Farooqui. The Bandra (E) office of Auraton Ki Sharia Adalat, a Sharia court for women run by Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, is closed but its volunteers reach out to ‘sisters in distress’ through phones, “Cases of harassment and domestic violence against women have gone up during the lockdown,” said BMMA co-founder Noorjahan Safia Niaz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-pandemic-curbs-marital-discord-cases-pile-up-at-sharia-courts-in-city/articleshow/83099038.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Goa||Goa Board to look at Class IX marks while calculating Class X score||PANAJI: Following marathon meetings over the weekend, Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has finalised a draft policy for tabulation of marks for Class X students, after their public exam for 2021 was cancelled. As per the draft, students will be assessed based on four internal tests held by their school and, out of the 80 marks, 20 will also go to the students’ Class IX performance. The Goa board will declare the results by July 10. The board has decided that students, who are not satisfied with their assessment, will be given an opportunity to appear for an exam “when the conditions are conducive”. The draft, which is yet to be approved by the government, states that the exam could be either conducted by the board or school concerned. The board said that each school will form a result committee headed by the school headmaster with at least eight teachers as members. “Minimum six teachers from the school should be from mathematics, social science, science and three languages, and two teachers from neighbouring schools should be co-opted by the school as external members of the committee,” the board said. Students will be assessed out of 20 marks each for the formative I and II internal evaluations carried out by the school. A weightage of 10 marks each will go to unit tests and preliminary examinations conducted by the school and 20 marks’ weightage will be given to the students’ Class IX evaluation. “If a school has conducted two or three pre-board exams it may decide to take an average of the three exams, take the best performance in the three tests or give a weightage to each exam as considered suitable,” the Goa board’s draft states. The board said that if any school has not been able to conduct some of the internal assessment tests or if some student has not appeared for it, the result committee of the institute will have to draw a rational criteria of assessment. The school will have to document how it has assessed the students in such cases. The board said that schools will have to moderate the marks based on its past performance at the Class X public exam. “The historical performance of the school, in terms of the best overall performance in the previous three years’ board examination, will be taken as the reference for moderating the marks assessed by the school for 2021,” the draft states. For example, if in a specific school, the overall average marks of students in 2017-18 is 72%, in 2018-19 is 74% and in 2019-20 is 71%, the school will use the subject-wise averages of 2018-19, which are the highest, for moderation. “The subject wise marks assessed by the school for 2021 should be within a range of + 4 marks obtained by the school in the subject in the reference year,” Goa board said. The school results committee will have to submit the marks on an online portal provided by the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/board-to-look-at-class-ix-marks-while-calculating-class-x-score/articleshow/83106176.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||India||Spirit of ‘seva’ the guiding light for Modi govt: Amit Shah||NEW DELHI: When Narendra Modi completed seven years as Prime Minister on Sunday, it was a record by a non-Congress CM. But with the country still facing the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, BJP chose to mark the achievement in a low-key fashion. Party brass declared it an occasion to help with Covid prevention and send relief to affected families. Senior party figures — defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda — listed the achievements of the Modi government and termed them as flowing from the party’s commitment to the country. PM Modi’s NaMo app shared a brief account of key achievements of the government in the past seven years titled ‘India’s Vikas Yatra’, starting from “ease of doing business” to the country’s fight against Covid-19, farmers’ and women empowerment, eliminating corruption, etc. “PM Modi’s vision of doubling farmers’ income by 2022 can be seen in the initiatives taken by the government. With focus on farmers, this government believes in empowering annadatas in every way possible,” an article shared on the app, said. The app quoted Modi, “We decided, right from day one, to attack the menace of corruption. Someone had to make a start somewhere, we decided to do this, without caring for political consequences.” Shah said, “PM Modi has always made it clear that his aim as well as the government’s purpose is to serve 135 crore Indians. The spirit of ‘seva’ has been a guiding light for the government.” “In the past seven years, the Modi government has written a new chapter in the country’s development, good governance and laying infrastructure. Modi’s guidance is ushering a new era of empowering the poorest of poor,” Rajnath Singh added. In a series of tweets, Nadda said Modi’s leadership and guidance had paved the way for “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. “Today, crores of our workers will do public service in 1 lakh villages,” he tweeted. NDA came to power in 2014 with BJP winning 282 seats. Riding on the work of its first term, the BJP-led NDA government was re-elected in 2019 with BJP winning 303 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/spirit-of-seva-the-guiding-light-for-modi-govt-amit-shah/articleshow/83102500.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Vaccination for 18-plus may not happen till June 10 in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The inoculation drive for those in the age group of 18-to-45 years is likely to be halted till June 10 in Uttarakhand due to a shortage of vaccines. In fact, the vaccination centres in a majority of rural and hill areas remained shut last week due to the unavailability of vaccine stocks. The health department data underlines how the pace of the vaccination drive in the state has slowed down. In the last week (May 24 to May 30), only 36,253 people in the age group of 18-45 years could be administered a vaccine dose in Uttarakhand. "On Saturday, we vaccinated 4,887 people and on Sunday, the number reduced to just 2,435. On an average, we inoculated 5,000 people in the age group of 18-to-45 years per day. This is too low for a state where 50% of the population is in the age bracket of 18 to 45 years," said a senior health official. Notably, the state was left with just 4,050 vaccine doses — allocated for the 18-plus category — till 10 am on Sunday. Meanwhile, the health department is mulling to use the vaccines allotted for 45-plus category for those in the age group of 18-to-45 years as the next lot of vaccines is not expected to arrive before June 10, added the health department official. "In an official communication, the Serum Institute of India in Pune has clarified that they will not be able to send us any new stock of vaccine before June 10. Thus, we are mulling to use the vaccines meant for the 45-plus category for the 18-plus category as we received 1 lakh vaccine doses for the 45-plus category on Saturday. This will be a loan from the stock of the Government of India. We will return the vaccines when we receive our stock," said the official. When asked about the shortage of vaccines, secretary (health) Amit Negi said that the state has already made payments to the Serum Institute to procure 2 lakh vaccine doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccination-for-18-plus-may-not-happen-till-june-10-as-vaccines-are-almost-finished-in-ukhand/articleshow/83095416.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Kolkata||Padma awardee’s help from US in Bengal Covid fight||Kolkata: Fifty BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machines will be reaching Kolkata in about a week. Nothing special about the much needed machines during Covid treatment in this second wave, but the shipment will come all the way from 13,000km distance packed with much love from a Bengali-American settled in North Carolina. Padma Bhusan awardee Swadesh Chatterjee, who originally hails from Sonamukhi in Bankura, had migrated to the US years ago. But his love for Bengal remains firm years down the line. Right from raising fund for Amphan-affected people of Bengal to extending help during this Covid crisis, the son of the soil has been constantly giving it back to his birth country for three decades. “I keep track of happenings in Bengal through family, friends and the media. When I heard about the second wave I felt an obligation to assist my birth place. After all I was raised and educated in Bengal and whatever I have managed to achieve today is because of my home community. I may not be in Bengal right now but Bengal and India always stays close to me,” Chatterjee told TOI via an email communication. An instrumentation and electronics graduate from Jadavpur University with MBA degree from North Carolina State University, Chatterjee travels to India two to three times a year. And he tries to visit to his native village in Sonamukhi each time. “I am also working hard to encourage the Biden administration to ship more vaccines to India, including Bengal. I would like to see the government help reach every Indian including those in the rural areas that lacks basic infrastructure,” said Chatterjee, who is close to the US president. Hehad been instrumental in advocating US-India civil nuclear deal in 2008 in which the role of Biden, a Senator at that time, was essential to reaching that agreement. In addition to the BiPAP machines Chatterjee had mobilised fund to send oxygen concentrator to West Bengal Liver Foundation (WBLF) about a week ago. “When a person from more than 10,000 km away says he is with it means a lot. We will be sharing the BiPAP machines with the state government,” said hepatologist Abhjit Chowdhury, chief advisor to WBLF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/padma-awardees-help-from-us-in-bengal-covid-fight/articleshow/83097094.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Now, KIIFB to focus more on project implementation||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) that was showcased by the LDF government as a prestigious and effective solution for the state’s infrastructure woes, is set to change its focus as the government steps into its second innings. According to highly-placed government sources, KIIFB, which cleared various proposals on a war footing with 903 projects cleared under its belt, would now slow down with regard to taking up more projects. Instead, it would focus on the implementation of those in the pipeline, after weeding out the non-starter ones. “Yes, there is some thinking along those lines. Also, its large portfolio means KIIFB needs to consolidate and focus on implementation hereafter. Better and faster implementation is in any case the crux of the state’s challenge in increasing its capital expenditure,” a top official said. The agency has begun the process of weeding out those which have not yet taken off, despite the administrative clearance. “There will also be non-starter projects which will have to be dropped, thus providing room for a limited number of new projects. In fact, a list of such projects is being prepared,” sources added. KIIFB has so far approved 903 projects with an outlay of Rs 63,224.4 crore. These projects comprise both physical and social infrastructure across a range of sectors, including hospitals and health centres, schools and colleges, roads and bridges, water supply and sanitation, electricity and communication networks, industrial parks, cultural complexes, etc. Of these, 488 projects worth Rs 21,309.7 crore have been tendered and 27 projects worth Rs 732 crore and 160 project components worth Rs 560.3 crore have been commissioned. The agency — its creation and role in borrowing funds from the market— has been a serious bone of contention between Centre and the state government in its previous tenure, including during the recently-concluded assembly elections. The tensions between Centre and the state over KIIFB had reached such a boiling point that comptroller & auditor general (CAG) had flagged KIIFB’s mode of raising funds from the overseas market, and Enforcement Directorate (ED) had registered a case against KIIFB citing violation of foreign exchange management act (Fema) while raising money through masala bonds from abroad. In addition to Rs 2,150 crore that was raised through masala bonds at an interest rate of 9.7%, KIIFB had also availed long-term loans from Nabard (Rs 565 crore at 9.3%), State Bank of India (Rs 1,000 crore at 9.15%), Indian Bank (Rs 500 crore at 9.15%) and Union Bank of India (Rs 500 crore at 8.95%). All these loans were secured for 10 years and 12 years with a repayment period moratorium of two years. As per the KIIFB (amendment) act, 2016, the government set apart 10% of motor vehicle tax in 2016-17, increasing it by 10% every year until it reaches 50% in the fifth year. The cess levied on petrol and diesel is also to be given to KIIFB, before December 31 every year and paid on an escrow basis from the state treasury to KIIFB accounts automatically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-kiifb-to-focus-more-on-project-implementation/articleshow/83095510.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Two Covid-free villages feel their immunity due to bhui neem||NAGPUR: Two non-descript hamlets, Tumdi and Junapaani, are among the 59 villages in Nagpur district that have remained Covid-19 free so far. The residents of Tumdi and Junapaani believe it is the blessing of ‘bhui neem’, a herbal plant on which they bank upon for home remedies. The rural areas of the district have registered more than 1.41 lakh Covid cases in the first and second wave, with 2,708 patients still under treatment. The infection is yat to spread to about 4% villages, as per the district administration data though neighbouring places within couple of kilometres have been hit or even seen deaths due to the disease. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar has lauded the people for their efforts that have kept the virus from entering their villagers. Cutting across age groups, people of Tumdi and Junapaani in Nagpur tehsil have unshakable faith in Bhui neem, scientifically known as Andrographis Paniculata. They give it more importance than wearing mask, sanitization or physical distancing, measures recommended to avoid exposure to the novel coronavirus. When team TOI visited the villages, mostly inhabited by tribal community, there was no strict adherence to Covid norms. They collect the Bhui neem from forest and drink its juice or kadha (liquid of boiled fresh or dried and grinded leaves) on empty stomach in the morning. Many researches worldwide have acknowledged the anti-inflammatory and immunostimulant properties of bhui neem. It helps in tackling infection in the upper respiratory tract, as per research. In absence of Bhui neem, the Tumdi and Junapaani villagers rely on leaves of the neem tree. “The fresh air near the Neem tree is enough to make one feel energetic,” said 58-year-old farmer Manohar Lakha from Junapaani, around 50km from Nagpur while explaining the possible reasons for the virus not affecting any of the 40 residents there. “The next important aspect is Bhui neem plant which we use as medicines in different forms. Be it fever, cough or cold, we consume bhui neem kadha for relief,” said Manohar who has not felt the need to get tested or vaccinated so far. “The vaccination centre at Dongargaon is 12km from here. The government officials had informed us about testing and vaccination but the centre is too far,” said Manohar whose father-in-law had died due to Covid in Kuhi tehsil. He had attended the funeral too. “Forget corona, even development does not visit our village. There are no roads or proper electricity too,” said another resident Rajesh Lakha. The residents of Tumdi, around 30km from Nagpur, were more cautious about Covid. None of the 150-odd residents of the village has suffered from the disease. Mangrud, just a km away, has reported Covid patients. Though there had been cases of jaundice, the villagers said they were fortunate (and also strong) enough to remain Covid-19 free. “Anyone coming to our home from outside has to take proper bath before stepping in. The visitors do come but not frequently. We also ensure they leave early after meal,” said Umesh Wadme. He added that having bhui neem and kadu neem empty stomach for cold, cough, fever and such symptoms helped them avoid visits to hospitals or doctors. Former sarpanch Sudhakar Wadme, also a farm labourer, said ginger kadha followed by tea have also helped him recover from cold, cough and fever symptoms. “We travel less to city and even fewer visitors come to our place. Even this could be one of the reasons behind not getting infected,” said Wadme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-covid-free-villages-feel-their-immunity-due-to-bhui-neem/articleshow/83097150.cms||Soumitra Bose

The special operations group and local police had received information about seven quacks operating in Vapi, Valsad, Kaprada and Sarigam based on which raids were conducted along with district health officials. The seven accused nabbed have been identified as Amrendra Sinha, Debashish Biswas, Niranjan Vishwas, Nihar Biswas, Pappu Prajapati, Ratankumar Dey and Tribhuvandutt Tiwari. The accused are natives of West Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan. Police said that none of the accused has a medical degree or registration papers of Gujarat Medical Council. Prajapati had a certificate of community medical services, however, that was not enough to practice as a doctor. Cops seized allopathic medicines and different injections in large quantities from the seven accused. “We are investigating since when these quack doctors were practising and how many patients they have treated,” said a police official. Offences against the seven accused were registered under the Gujarat Medical Practitioners’ Act at Vapi Town, Valsad Town, Valsad Rural and Bhilad police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/seven-quacks-nabbed-in-a-day-in-valsad/articleshow/83095540.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: NHAI extends bidding date for Rs 17k cr RRR project till June 2||HYDERABAD: The Rs 17,000 crore regional ring road (RRR) project to be taken up beyond the outer ring road (ORR) in Telangana is right on track. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited tenders from expert consultancies to prepare a detailed project report for the northern half of the 340-km access-controlled expressway. Though the last date for opening of technical bids was May 25, the NHAI extended it up to June 2 keeping in view of the Covid-19 situation following requests from the bidders. The new expressway, touted to be country’s largest ring road connecting a majority of the districts in Telangana, is planned to be developed in two parts under the government’s Bharatmala Pariyojana phase I at an estimated cost of Rs 17,000 crore. The Bharatmala project envisages development of 26,000 km length of economic corridors, which along with Golden Quadrilateral and north-south and east-west corridors are expected to carry majority of freight traffic on roads. The Telangana government will bear 50 per cent of its land acquisition cost and has allocated Rs 750 crore towards the project in its 2021-22 budget. The semi-greenfield expressway is initially planned to have four lanes and later expanded to six lanes depending on future vehicular traffic. The northern half of the project extends up to 180 km and is estimated to cost Rs 9,500 crore. It will connect Sangareddy, Narsapur, Toopran, Gajwel, Yadadri, Pragnapur, Bhuvanagiri and Choutuppal urban clusters. The southern part of the expressway extends up to 160 km and is estimated to cost Rs 6,480 crore and will connect Choutuppal, Ibrahimpatnam, Kandukur, Amangal, Chevella, Shankarpally and Sangareddy. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is personally monitoring the project. He said the RRR will provide better access to farmers to sell their produce and also to the government and private players to set up cold chains, agro-processing units, IT parks and new townships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nhai-extends-bidding-date-for-rs-17k-cr-rrr-project-till-june-2/articleshow/83099197.cms||Roushan Ali

The announcement to observe ‘Sampoorna Kranti Diwas’ was first made by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions protesting at the Ghazipur (near Delhi) border. During the ‘Sampoorna Kranti Diwas’ protest, farmers will be burning copies of the central farm laws in front of the offices of the BJP MPs and MLAs, according to the farmer leaders. Karm Singh Padda, state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said that after observing a successful 'Black Day' on May 26, the farmers are now more committed to carrying on the protest till the black laws are not repealed and minimum support price (MSP) for crops is not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, spokesperson of the SKM, said, “On June 5, 1974, Jayaprakash Narayan had declared ‘Sampoorna Kranti’ and launched a mass movement against the then central government. We are doing the same now. Last year, on June 5, the government promulgated these anti-farmer laws as ordinances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/terai-farmers-to-observe-june-5-as-sampoorna-kranti-diwas/articleshow/83095495.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Pune||Cops bust dance party at Bhor farmhouse; Six women among 13 booked||Pune: The Rajgad police in rural Pune booked seven men and six women on the charge of violating the Covid-19 restrictions by partying at a farmhouse in Kelwade in Bhor taluka off the Pune-Bengaluru highway in the wee hours of Saturday. This is the fourth incident of its kind over the last fortnight. Earlier, the police had busted similar parties at farmhouses in the areas nearby Khadakwasala dam backwaters and near Donje at the foothills of the Sinhgad fort. Around 2am on Saturday, the police got the tip that a party was going on in the Kelwade farmhouse. After reaching the spot, a police team comprising of inspector Sandeep Ghorpade, sub-inspector Shrikant Joshi and others, found that blaring musing was playing with lights emitting from the two-storey farmhouse. The police found that the 13 men and women, residing in Dhankawadi, Ambegaon, Nanded Phata, Warje and Vishrantwadi areas of Pune, were dancing to the blaring music and were partying. “The youths, in their 20s and 30s, were taken into custody and a case was registered against them for violating the Covid-19 norms and for an unlawful assembly,” Dhananjay Patil, deputy superintendent of police, said. Police registered the offence under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 144 (Unlawful assembly), and 269 (Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code. According to police, the gathering was held to celebrate the birthday of one of the men’s assembled. All men do menial jobs while the women are stage show artists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-bust-dance-party-at-bhor-farmhouse-six-women-among-13-booked/articleshow/83097111.cms||---

Too bad, as you won’t be able to dodge penalty with “not carrying enough cash” alibi too! Now, city police have launched an online payment system wherein citizens will be able to pay fines digitally. With this, traffic cops have started collecting payment through point of sale (POS) machines from Saturday. “The idea is to bring in more transparency in the system. Also, it will make penalty payment easier for the citizens as well as the police,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. Traffic cops have been allotted 120 POS machines that will cover about 60 different points in the city. So, ‘no cash’ excuses crash on the plastic faces of debit card, credit card or even mobile payment apps. “Gradually we will remove all the challan books and use the POS machines to make challans and give receipts too. The digitisation will help us keep a record of all such fines,” Singh added. The traffic cops have been trained to use the POS machines and issue challans quickly. The money collected from online transactions will be deposited in the bank account of traffic police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/armed-with-pos-machines-cops-take-fines-in-digital-mode/articleshow/83095233.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rotational support staff check in at high-rises||Kolkata: Many housing complexes in the city, that had arranged for support staff to stay back on campus till Sunday — the deadline for the first restrictive phase — had a change of guard, with fresh people coming in to relieve those who had been on duty all this while. Most of the support staff who went back home had been vaccinated by the complexes. However, individual households did not find it easy to hold on to the maids, caregivers and babysitters who used to come to work daily earlier but had agreed to live in with families for the first phase of restrictions. Many were contacted by their families in the districts and asked to return home. This has created a problem in households where both spouses are working from home and finding it difficult to look after all household chores. Housing complexes got all the living spaces, vacated by the first batch, sanitised before the second batch came in. Some, like South City Residency, have arranged for cars to ferry the rotational support staff. Fresh stocks of ration have been brought in and many residents have started offering additional meals to keep those staying on campus feeling “at home.” “From June 1 we are holding a special vaccination camp for our support staff. They should feel just as included,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of the complex. At Upohar, some from the old group have agreed to extend their stay for this phase too. “This phase has brought in a rare bonding with our staff. We have had a resident donating 100 kilos of rice, dal, potatoes etc. Another resident is sharing his birthday meal with the entire team by sending mutton and fish!” said Sudeep Ganguly, vice-president of the complex. Manav Mehera of Siddha Pines said an incentive has been announced for all housekeeping staffers who are providing doorstep service to Covid families. However, for Satyendra Prasad and wife Rusha, both working professionals, they will now have to let go of their babysitter since her family has been demanding that she come back for a while.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rotational-support-staff-check-in-at-high-rises/articleshow/83097165.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Non-essential shops can open on alternate days||MUMBAI: The BMC on Monday issued orders allowing shops selling non-essentials in Mumbai to stay open from 7am to 2pm from Monday to Friday. TOI had reported on Monday that non-essential shops in the state could open from June 1. However, standalone shops that have been permitted to open in the city do not include salons, beauty parlours and gyms. Also, in line with the state government’s orders, the BMC has allowed delivery of non-essential goods for e-commerce along with that of essential products, reports Richa Pinto.Shops selling non-essentials would have to follow an arrangement wherein, in the first week, shops on the right side of a road would stay open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while those on the left would be allowed to stay open on Tuesday and Thursday. The order would be reversed in the following week so that all shops get to stay open on an equal number of days, BMC officials said. On Saturdays and Sundays, though, non-essential shops have to remain shut. The same arrangement would have to be in place week after week till lockdown-like like restrictions are in place, said officials. The BMC order came a day after the state left it to the local disaster management authority to decide whether to keep non-essential shops open. Shops selling essentials would be allowed on all days from 7am to 2pm, said the civic order which followed the state’s ‘break the chain’ order. On April 20, the state had issued a notification restricting timings for shops selling essentials (grocery shops, medical stores etc) from 7am to 11am. All shopkeepers will need to continue practising social distancing, wear masks, use sanitisers and follow all other Covid prevention protocols for themselves as well as customers. In case they are found violating norms, action can be taken against shopkeepers, said the civic order. The BMC sent out a message late on Monday asking all its ward- level officers to specify at the earliest the two sides on which shops would be allowed to stay open on alternate days in order to avoid confusion among citizens. Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, said, “This alternate-day order allowing opening of shops for only a few hours is not acceptable and not practical. If Covid cases in Mumbai are declining, why this stepmotherly treatment towards traders? This will benefit e-commerce.” MLA Rais Shaikh said that with many shops selling non-essentials currently open unofficially in some areas, the order only regularises what was going on. “However, the authorities still need to be very careful as the Covid situation has just about stabilised,” Shaikh said. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria asked who would decide the left and right sides. “There may be chaos on the ground on Tuesday when non-essentials are allowed, so instructions should have been given earlier in the day on Monday for arrangements to be made from Tuesday onwards,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-essential-shops-can-open-on-alternate-days/articleshow/83130082.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||Delivery staffers battle odds, health risks to be on job||Dehradun: The community of delivery personnel has been working tirelessly since the outbreak of Covid-19 last year as the demand for home deliveries – from food to groceries — has increased exponentially. In the process, they encounter several challenges — like staying safe from Covid-19, rude customers, harassment by police personnel, among others — but are continuing with their jobs rather doggedly. “Recently, I went to deliver a food packet to a customer who was not willing to pick up the order from the colony’s main gate. I insisted that he pick up the order from the security guard at the main entrance as he was under home quarantine but he forced me to come to his flat’s entrance. Such behaviour increases the chances of transmission of the virus,” said Vijay Kumar, a delivery executive of a popular food aggregator. Adeep Pradhan, another delivery boy, who is also associated with a food delivery app, told TOI that he became a delivery agent after his food joint was shut due to the Covid-19 lockdown. “I had been running a food joint for seven years but I had to shut operations due to the financial losses in the wake of the pandemic. As the sole earner of my family, I had to pick up the job of a delivery agent. I work for 10 hours now but the money is nowhere close to what I used to make earlier," said Pradhan. He added, “We don’t have an employee union to address our issues. It is difficult for a single person to argue with the management of a big company.” When asked about the suggestions to improve the condition of delivery executives, Garvit Gupta, owner of Dehradun-based Suvidha Supermarket, said, “I understand that policemen are only doing their duty but they should not harass our delivery executives since they have valid IDs and are helping out the needy residents. This unnecessary checking gets the delivery agents late in delivering their order. Also, I urge people to not violate lockdown restrictions but instead try and buy their daily essentials and other items online and get them delivered at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/delivery-staffers-battle-odds-health-risks-to-be-on-job/articleshow/83095544.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Thiruvananthapuram||A, I groups lobby against Sudhakaran as KPCC chief||Thiruvananthapuram: Lobbying has become intense in Congress to prevent K Sudhakaran from becoming the KPCC president. Group managers in the party have come up with several campaigns against Sudhakaran before the Ashok Chavan committee and also the AICC. Even though Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala decided that they would not recommend or support any names as a mark of protest, they have given silent support to the campaigns against Sudhakaran. Their group managers have suggested that they would support anyone except Sudhakaran as state party president, and they have preferred Kodikkunnil Suresh for the post. However, AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and opposition leader V D Satheesan are backing Sudhakaran as KPCC president since he has a tremendous mass following. “The A and I groups in the party do not want Sudhakaran as the party president since their leaders are sure that they would lose all the grip in the party if he comes. That was the reason why they are opposing him. After a new opposition leader they do not want another powerful leader to head the party,” said a senior party leader, who has been campaigning against groups in the party. With Mullappally Ramachandran requesting the AICC to appoint a new party president at the earliest, a decision is expected this week itself. The AICC is also likely to collect the opinion of the present KPCC president in the selection of a new president. Chandy and Chennithala are not directly getting involved in the appointment of the new party president since they are upset with the way the AICC leadership had appointed the new opposition leader. Both the leaders had stood together in preventing Satheesan from becoming the opposition leader but AICC was not ready to accept their demands. Rahul Gandhi was firm in appointing Satheesan and this had strained the relations of these two senior leaders with the party high command.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-i-groups-lobby-against-sudhakaran-as-kpcc-chief/articleshow/83095570.cms||---
---||Jaipur||250 weddings cancelled in Jaipur due to lockdown in April-June quarter||JAIPUR: Around 250 weddings with budgets of over Rs 25-30 lakh each have been cancelled or postponed in the April-June quarter, according to estimates by the hospitality industry in Jaipur. While the lockdown in the state has been extended to June 8, weddings are prohibited till June 30. The three months (April-June) had over 30 days of auspicious dates for weddings. On an average, hotels and resorts on the city outskirts, in the Kukas area, get over 40% of their revenues from weddings, while for some individual properties, the segment contributes as high as 70% of their business. Chandrasekhar Joshi, general manager of The Leela Palace Jaipur, said, “The industry had a pretty decent recovery, primarily riding on the weddings that started from October last year till March this year. But April-June quarter has been a washout due to the second wave of the pandemic. In all likelihood, the industry might have lost about 250 big weddings.” In value terms, Joshi said, conservatively, the revenue loss could be Rs 100 crore. Many hotels and resorts have come up on the city outskirts to leverage the city’s popularity as a wedding destination. “Weddings in a tourist town like Jaipur add some extra romance to the experience. It’s not only weddings but honeymoons and anniversaries also that drive some demand. There is nothing much we can do about the current situation but hope that we don’t lose the dates in July,” said Jean Luc Benheim, promoter of Buena Vista Luxury Garden Spa Resorts in Kukas. July has six auspicious dates and after that the hotels will have to depend on domestic tourists as there is no clarity on when the foreign tourist movement, corporate travel and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) activities will restart. Akash Agarwal, director at Rajasthali Resort and Spa, said, “We get 65% of our business from weddings. It shows the loss of business opportunities we have suffered. Even though there are no weddings and no tourists, we pay salary to 30 people to maintain it. Covid has hit the hospitality industry hard.” In fact, in the absence of tourists, many hotels which were not highly dependent on weddings changed their strategy. Joshi said, “That strategy helped them to stay alive. In fact, they did well last year to recover substantially.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/250-weddings-cancelled-in-city-due-to-lockdown-in-apr-jun-qtr/articleshow/83097208.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid spawns wave of crime, tech comes to aid||NEW DELHI: Neha Sharma (name changed) was frantically searching for an oxygen cylinder as her husband was sinking when she came across a number on a WhatsApp group.  It was the last ray of hope for the 27-year-old as she had been unable to find a hospital bed. To her surprise, the caller agreed to supply the cylinder at home. She paid Rs 7,500 through Paytm on April 30 morning and kept waiting for help, but it never came. Her husband passed away in the evening on May 1. Sharma was one of the hundreds of people who were hit by the double whammy of Covid-19 and fraudsters over the past one month. When the second wave of the pandemic hit Delhi in April, it led to an extraordinary spurt in demand for oxygen cylinders, remdesivir, ambulances, concentrators, etc. In an urban set-up like Delhi, thousands took to social media to seek help. Initially, good Samaritans either helped them directly or shared details of credible suppliers. People called them and, in several instances, received assistance. However, it didn’t take long for cyber fraudsters to spot an opportunity to cheat people on the pretext of supplying these commodities. They deceptively pushed their phone numbers on social media posts. For better visibility, they used popular and trending hashtags. This resulted in a large number of people losing not only their hard-earned money, but precious treatment time too. Covid-related cyber fraud, hoarding, over-charging and black-marketing saw a sudden increase at the end of April. The situation seemed to be spinning out of control. Delhi Police, however, was quick to stand up to the challenge and commissioner SN Shrivastava launched an all-out war against these fraudsters. A core team analysed the trends emerging from the complaint data, social media and cheating cases registered during the first Covid wave in 2020 and a series of measures were launched to counter this rapidly growing menace. “The capacity of the Covid helpline 011-23469900 was augmented overnight for easy and direct reporting of fraud cases. Simultaneously, awareness campaigns were initiated requesting citizens to lodge complaints on www.cybercrime.gov.in, cyber financial fraud helpline 155260 and dedicated email IDacp-cybercell1@delhipolice.gov.in,” said Shrivastava. In all, 796 complaints were received from April 25 to May 24 and 596 FIRs were subsequently registered. The callers’ locations revealed that most of them were based out of Delhi. As many as 51 raiding teams from cyber cell, crime branch and local police were formed and sent to different places to arrest the cheats. The police chief himself contacted the DGPs of the states concerned for local support. Delhi Police also reached out to Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) of the Union home ministry and through it contacted the national banking and financial sector, regulators of the telecom industry and leading private players and operators to mount a multi-pronged attack on the scamsters. The SIMs used by the fraudsters were procured through an organised supply-chain network with West Bengal, Assam and Delhi-NCR being the main suppliers and south Bihar, Jharkhand and Mewat as the main consumers. The callers were mostly located in a small belt falling in districts like Nawada and Nalanda, which are in close proximity to the Jamtara Belt — Devghar, Giridih and Hazaribag districts of Jharkhand. This new hotspot in south Bihar suggested that cybercrime as a cottage industry had fanned out to the neighbouring region. Investigations revealed that the kingpins had received hands-on training from their peers in Jamtara. Bank accounts were opened in different parts of the country, but money was withdrawn by the fraudsters in the hotspot areas. Moreover, the fraudsters had adopted a new strategy of opening bank accounts in one location and then transferred them online to branches in other parts of the country. In many instances, they gave the IFSC code of a Delhi-NCR branch for receiving advance payment to trick victims into believing that they were genuine suppliers based in Delhi-NCR. The scamsters also hacked netbanking details of genuine people to re-route the defrauded money. “After analysing their modus operandi, the entire network was attacked by obstructing supply lines, which involved getting the beneficiary accounts frozen, SIM cards suspended pending KYC re-verification and blacklisting the phone IMEIs. Coordination with TrueCaller helped tag the numbers as ‘Covid scam’, thereby alerting people about it,” said an officer. As a result, 366 people were arrested, 482 bank accounts blocked, Rs 1.2 crore frozen, 1,158 SIMs reported to DoT for suspension, and 233 numbers were tagged as ‘Covid scam’. The scale of this crackdown has been termed as unprecedented in Delhi Police’s history of cyber crime investigation. Among those arrested included the conmen from Nalanda who had duped Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-spawns-wave-of-crime-tech-comes-to-aid/articleshow/83097188.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Nagpur||10% mortality in post-Covid serious patients seen: Doctors||NAGPUR: Lack of proper monitoring of health parameters after discharge is leading to post Covid fatalities, doctors have observed. Some patients have passed away on 10-12th day after returning home mainly due to laxity in controlling oxygen parameters, blood sugar and lung physiotherapy. Internal medicine specialists said around 10% to 20% of their patients have died in the recent past as they allegedly lowered guard assuming full recovery. “Getting discharged is not the end of treatment. Patients need to periodically visit their doctor and keep monitoring all parameters for up to 4 months. We are issuing this advisory more often this time as the virus is wreaking havoc,” said Dr Manoj Purohit, internal medicine specialist. Dr Purohit added around 80% of the patients had to be discharged with the advice to continue oxygen support at home. The oxygen saturation level (SPO2) of such patients also remains between 90 and 93 for nearly a month after treatment. An SPO2 level of above 95% is considered good. Increased heart rate around 100 to 110 has been seen in patients. “This should not go beyond this and if it shoots up to 120, urgently see a doctor,” he said. Chest physician Dr Vinit Niranjane pointed out the change in norms due to which there is no record available. “There is no data, but post Covid mortality remains undermined. Many Covid patients are shifted to different hospitals during the course of treatment. When they test RT-PCR negative, they are considered non-Covid even if they had been on ventilator during the infection. If patient comes out, it is counted as recovered,” he said. Internal medicine expert Dr Mohan Nerker said at their hospital due care is taken to ensure patients and relatives are well aware of the risk factors. “We are getting a lot of referral patients and those treated at other places but needing re-admission with post Covid complications, especially those who had longer stay, needed O2 and ventilator beside being diabetic, pregnant or having renal issues,” he said. Dr Nerker said they had been advising daily sugar level monitoring of recovered patients. “My team keeps counselling the patients. If patients need O2 at home, we ask them to use distilled water as humidifier,” he said. Dr Niranjane added that those who had severe Covid pneumonia have increased anxiety level and fear of death. Their SPO2 level too takes a month or two to get restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/10-mortality-in-post-covid-serious-patients-seen-doctors/articleshow/83097250.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The city would experience cloudy condition in the evenings, with thunder activity and lightning. On Sunday, overcast conditions prevailed over the city since the morning. Several areas of the district received rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning, said met officials. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecast division of the IMD, said, “There is no strong active system present over the state currently. But moisture incursion is taking place due to the influence of Westerly Winds across all four meteorological divisions — Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa, Marathwada and Vidarbha. As a result, the entire state is expected to get light rainfall for the next few days.” “Pune district is expected to experience cloudy conditions in the evening hours. The cloud cover may increase on some days in the evening hours. As a result, the day temperature is likely to remain in the range of 35-36°C. On some days, the district may experience gusty wind conditions with wind speeds reaching 30-40km per hour,” he added. On Sunday, Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded maximum temperatures of 34.1°C and 34.7°C, respectively, which were below normal by 1.9°C and 1.3°C respectively.

The couple — Monimohan Pal, a retired school teacher and his wife Meena (68) — used to live at a third floor flat of the HIT Abasan near Dumurjala stadium in Howrah for the last several years, while their only son lives in Kolkata with his family. Police said the woman was suffering from kidney ailments for several months and was under regular sessions of dialysis. “Neighbours have told us that the man was also sick and visibly suffering from depression off late. He was extremely worried about his own and his wife’s health,” said a senior officer of Howrah City Police. Though cops have seized some documents from their apartment, no suicide note was found. Cops, however, have sent both the bodies for post mortem to find the exact reason and time of their deaths. On Sunday, a domestic help first raised the alarm when none opened the door in spite of repeated knocks on the door. The woman alerted the neighbours who first banged on the door after which they called the Bantra PS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/elderly-couple-found-dead-in-howrah/articleshow/83097257.cms||Rupak Banerjee

Residents of this area have been complaining about the growing number of stray animals. Jitendra Singh, resident of ward 27 of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC)-Heritage, said that stray cattle that are left free on the road belong to illegal dairies functioning in the area. “You can find cows everywhere. The moment we get outside the house we find cows sitting there. Not only this they have also injured old people and kids,” said Soni. The councillor of the ward, Bhagwati Devi, told TOI that they have filed complaints many times, but the municipal corporation employees work in connivance with these dairy owners. “The animals are found in the entire Walled City area. After several complaints the municipality vehicles arrive to catch the cattle, but the workers call up dairy owners beforehand who quickly take away their cattle,” said Devi. Councillor Lalita Jaiswal of ward 72 describes the miserable condition of the one ‘Heritage Walk’ that the city has. “Only one heritage walk which is on Jaipur’s tourist map is conducted. But if you come here, you will find pigs and cows all around. They have injured many people, especially commuters. We have filed complaints hundreds of times, but it falls on deaf ears,” said Jaiswal. Replying to the rising problem of stray cattle, deputy mayor of JMC-Heritage, Modh Aslam Faruqqi said, “I have not received any such complaint but if I do then I will take immediate action. JMC-Heritage vehicles are always on the lookout for such animals. We will look into the issue.” Dairy business has been going on in the entire city which has been termed illegal by the high court. As per HC’s orders, dairies are to be shifted outside the city but due to vote bank politics they are still functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/stray-cattle-menace-haunts-walled-city/articleshow/83097239.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Residents worried over rerun of nightmarish floods in 2020||HYDERABAD: Notwithstanding the last year’s floods which exposed the city’s urban infrastructure, development and maintenance of drains, which is crucial for preventing floods, is progressing at a snail’s pace. With hardly any time left for the monsoon to arrive, residents are worried about a rerun of the 2020 flood situation. In Toli Chowki’s Nadeem Colony, which bore the brunt of all the major floods in recent years — 2000, 2008 and 2020 — residents continue to live amidst overflowing drains, choked outlet channels, blatant dumping of debris and narrowing of inlet and outlet channels due to rampant constructions and encroachments. Mohammed Iqbal (57), a resident of the colony, said: “In October last year, the rains increased water level in the inlet nalas and Shah Hatim talab (lake) as the entire water from the upstream flowed down here. Our houses got flooded as the water rose to the ceiling, almost 10-12 ft high, causing massive destruction. With intermittent rains in the last few days, the drains in the area are once again overflowing.” Keeping in mind the destructive floods of last year, the residents expected the authorities to take stringent measures to avoid flooding. “While the nala desilting work is happening at a snail’s pace, the civic body is lagging behind in executing the stormwater drain project,” said Iqbal. A few kilometers away, in Baba Nagar’s B-block, Intermediate student Fatima Sultana said: “My family had to spend three days on the terrace after the entire house was submerged in water last year.” SNDP chief engineer C Vasantha said, “Although we are heading towards monsoon, it will take some time since we have to do the technical study, estimation, procurement of material, etc, for implementation of the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residents-worried-over-rerun-of-nightmarish-floods-in-2020/articleshow/83097275.cms||Moulika.KV

Campaigners used hashtags, including #TogetherWithLakshadweep, #RecallAdministrator , #SaveLakshadweep, etc. to protest against the recent controversial decisions of the administration. The tweets by the campaigners had called for a Twitter storm by tweeting in protest against the administration’s action from 4pm to 9pm and mass mailing to the President of India. Many on Twitter had changed their profile picture to a black image, reading, May 30-Black Day. Campaigners had changed their display pictures in other platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp, as well. The protests are against the action of the administration, including a few draft regulations that are set to be implemented in the islands. These include Draft Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, Draft Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, Draft Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation and the Draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation. Meanwhile, MP Elamaram Kareem tweeted on Sunday that the administration has told them to postpone their visit to Lakshadweep citing the pandemic. “A delegation of CPM MPs of Kerala has decided to visit Lakshadweep to understand the current situation. Today, the ADM informed us to “plan the proposed visit on a later date” considering the Covid situation. They wanted to delay our visit and avoid the world from knowing the ground reality,” Kareem tweeted. SFI all-India president V P Sanu alleged foul play in the stand of the administration. “The Lakshadweep admin does not want Parliament members from Kerala to visit the island. Suddenly, they got a ‘revelation’ about the Covid scenario in the country! Didn’t they know this when they destroyed the peace and livelihood on the island? Why be scared when questioned?” Sanu tweeted. The island administration had on Saturday issued a circular, further restricting the entry and exit from the island citing the rise in Covid cases. As per the circular, the additional district magistrate will be the single point authorized for issuing entry permits to the Union territory. Save Lakshadweep Forum convener and Congress leader UCK Thangal said that AICC leaders who wanted to visit the islands were also told to delay the travel citing Covid protocol. Meanwhile, a delegation of the BJP, including BJP Lakshadweep president C Abdul Khader, has gone to Delhi in connection with the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-campaigners-organize-black-day-protest/articleshow/83095611.cms||---

Residents of wards 88 and 91 in Sanganer zone of JMC-Greater are facing an acute water crisis as there is hardly any pressure in the water pipeline because of which filling even one bucket is difficult. Aalochana Devi, a resident of ward 88, said people in the area are living in miserable conditions. “In winters, we get water for half-an-hour, but haven’t got supply for last one month. Sometimes, government supplies water through tankers, but this is not a permanent solution. Last week, all the women of the colony went to the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) office, but we were given just assurances,” said Devi. Residents speakAnother resident of the area and president of Kailashpuri Vikas Samiti Bhagchand Indoriya said, “This is a long-standing issue, but officials have no solution. We have written to all the officials, but none has any solution. There is no water in the area despite a pipeline. Even if water is supplied, timings are undecided. Sometimes, it is supplied at 11pm or at times even at 12.30am. Government should resolve this issue soon.” Assistant engineer of PHED said, “We are looking into the issue. We have received complaints but in summers due to high demand this problem arises. We are supplying tankers wherever necessary.” Ward 91 is facing a similar issue. Akash Meena, a resident of the area, said the problem had escalated so much that they have stopped using coolers and watering the gardens. “When there is no water for drinking, how are we supposed to take care of any other need. Officials just give false assurances,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acute-water-crisis-in-2-wards-of-sanganer-zone-in-jmc-greater/articleshow/83097280.cms||---

Those donating Rs 6,000 a year will be provided free treatment at the hospital. The hospital will be set up in central Kerala subject to availability of free land. Fr Chiramel said he will need 25 acres for building the hospital and has sought people’s support for the initiative. “One individual has promised to give 50 acres while another person has agreed to hand over 22 acres, both in Wayanad, free of cost. But, we want land somewhere in central Kerala,” Fr Davis Chiramel said. “The project, which is driven by humanitarian concerns, aims to provide free treatment to the poor in the wake of private hospitals exploiting patients and charging exorbitant bills for treatment. The idea is to provide free treatment to up to 4 lakh people who donate Rs 6,000 a year. We will be constituting a trust for running the hospital. We require 100 expert doctors who would volunteer for the project. Many doctors who have worked in the US and other developed countries have already pledged their free service. The doctors will be given free accommodation attached to the hospital,” Chiramel said. A person can register for the services by paying Rs 500. He will be provided insurance coverage and the cost of the premium will be borne by the hospital management trust. “After conducting medical a check-up which is required for the insurance, he will be asked to pay Rs 500 a month for the next 11 months for availing free treatment throughout the year. Our plan is set up a 500-bed hospital with all modern facilities,” Fr Chiramel said. The plan is to complete the construction of the hospital within one-and-a-half years of starting the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fr-chiramel-to-set-up-hosp-to-treat-poor-free-of-cost/articleshow/83095648.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

According to state load dispatch centre (SLDC), Kalamassery, the power generation is at the peak in small hydel projects after heavy summer rains and as a result of Cyclone Tauktae and Cyclone Yaas. According to officials, the water levels in most of the hydel dams remained high after heavy rains in May. The generation was increased to a great extent in major hydel projects Sabarigiri, Idamalayar, Sholayar, Pallivasal, Kuttiyadi, Panniyar, Neriamangalam, Lower Periyar, Peringalkuthu and Sengulam power stations. The power generation at Sabarigiri on Saturday was 6.77mu and at Moolamattom power plant in Idukki it was 7.975mu. “Power generation was increased in small hydel dams with the aim of reducing water levels before the arrival of monsoon. In May, we received excess summer rains, and two cyclones caused water to rise more in small hydel dams,” said Supriya S, KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP). “In Idukki, the water level is at a low position and there is no need to increase the generation to full capacity,” she added. According to officials, after the lockdown, power consumption in the state was reduced by over 10mu. Also, due to repeated rains, the consumption reduced over 17mu per day, in comparison to previous years. Meanwhile, the water levels in hydel dams on Tuesday were 36% and which was above 8.5% compared to the previous year. The water level in Idukki reservoir on Friday was 2339.46ft, which is 37% of the total storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-raises-power-generation-in-small-hydel-projects-to-cut-water-level/articleshow/83095697.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Nagpur||Drives in localities, villages help many but fail to up vax numbers||NAGPUR: Launched even before the Centre’s Near To Home Covid Vaccination, Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s Vaccination In Your Locality and Vaccination In Your Village by the zilla parishad have helped many get the jab near their home, but it failed to increase the number of overall vaccination numbers significantly. Now, the civic body is planning to provide inoculation at flat schemes and housing societies with a motive to cover remaining unvaccinated population. With the decline in the pace of vaccination and a large number of people still unvaccinated, the NMC had launched Vaccination In Your Locality for 45-plus on May 24. On the same lines, ZP had started Vaccination In Your Village in rural parts of the district. The Centre had on May 29 suggested Near To Home Covid Vaccination for elderly and differently-abled persons. Between May 24 and 29, total 25,200 healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and 45-plus had taken the first and second dose in the district for a daily average of 4,200. Between May 17 and 22, 41,706 were jabbed for a daily average of 5,958. Total 22,591 were administered vaccine on May 13, followed by 12,180 on May 14 and 24,379 on May 15. Since then, the number of beneficiaries is going down and dropped below 5,000 per day. On Sunday, only 1,209 took the jab in the district. The number of vaccinations per day dropped by almost four times in fourth week of May compared to the second week. Thus, it is clear that the initiatives of the NMC and ZP have helped in preventing drastic reduction in the numbers, but the drives failed to increase the number of overall beneficiaries. As per data of state’s public health department (PHD), estimated population of the district is 52,72,665. The government had estimated around 30% (15,81,800) of total population in above 45 years age group. 8,01,175 (50.65%) people from 45-plus age group have taken the first dose as on May 29. Thus, 7,80,625 eligible people are yet to be vaccinated. The NMC had also launched two Drive-In Vaccination centres and special days for some selected sectors. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “Vaccination In Your Locality will be continued as it helps people get the jab in their vicinity as per their convenience. We are planning to also facilitate vaccination in flat schemes and housing societies. Efforts will be taken to ensure all eligible are vaccinated.” CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar said, “Earlier, vaccination was facilitated at public health centres. We will continue vaccinating people by setting up centres at all villages. We are identifying HCWs, FLWs and villagers who have taken both the doses and were safe during the second wave. We will promote them as brand ambassadors in villages where there are apprehensions.” Ruling party leader in NMC Avinash Thakre said, “Around 8 lakh people from 45-plus took the jab. Vaccination went down after interval between two doses of Covishield increased. Around 3.3 lakh people from the district were tested positive in the second wave from March to till date. Majority of people among these are from 45-plus age group. Therefore, not many eligible people have been left without vaccination, barring a few from slum areas and a community.” Former MLC from NCP Prakash Gajbhiye said, “There is no hesitation for vaccine in slum areas. Vaccination centres should be set up in slums. As the duration between two doses of Covishield, which is available at almost all centres, has been increased to 12-16 weeks, many are waiting for other brands to be available which do not require such a prolonged wait. I don’t understand why the central government is not bringing other brands.” Congress corporator Manoj Sangole said, “NMC should vaccinate people working as domestic help. These people are already facing serious financial problems due to lockdown. Because of their daylong work schedule, they are unable to visit vaccination centres.” Shiv Sena youth leader Nitin Tiwari said, “Vaccination In Your Locality could not click due to BJP corporators who planned centres as per their vote bank and not as per the convenience of unvaccinated population. NMC should launch an app where live status of availability of vaccine and location of centres are available. All want to take vaccine and the NMC in unable to reach to the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drives-in-localities-villages-help-many-but-fail-to-up-vax-numbers/articleshow/83097333.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kochi||Monsoon onset in state by Thursday, says IMD||New Delhi: Monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place by June 3, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday, while updating its prediction factoring in the latest meteorological indications. The IMD had on May 14 predicted it to be around May 31 with model error of +/- 4 days. Though the private weather forecasting agency, Skymet Weather, claimed arrival of monsoon over Kerala on Sunday itself terming it a “slightly mild” onset, the IMD preferred to stick to all the defined parameters/criteria for onset of monsoon over the state. “At present, the criteria are not fully satisfied. Conditions will gradually become favourable from June 1. It may lead to onset over Kerala around June 3,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD. Citing an example, he said the rainfall over Kerala decreased along with weakening of westerly winds on Sunday. “Also, the depth of westerly winds did not increase up to 4.5km against the expectation. The convective cloud development leading to enhancement of rainfall activity over Kerala in such a scenario is not expected at least up to June 1,” said the IMD chief. The IMD has been issuing operational forecasts for the date of monsoon onset over Kerala from 2005 onwards. It claimed that the operational forecasts of the date of monsoon onset over the state during the past 16 years (2005-2020) were proved to be correct except in 2015. The national weather forecaster had last month predicted ‘normal’ monsoon rainfall in India during the June-September period. It had said that the monsoon seasonal rainfall was likely to be 98% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of +/- 5%. The LPA of the seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1961-2010 is 88 cm. The rainfall to an extent of 96-104% of the LPA is considered ‘normal’. The IMD is expected to come out with its second stage monsoon forecast either on Monday or Tuesday, issuing a probabilistic forecast for the monsoon core zone (rainfed agriculture region), based on a new model - called the Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) forecasting system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monsoon-onset-in-state-by-thursday-says-imd/articleshow/83095688.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Similarly, desilting works at various nalas ahead of the monsoon are taken up by the Cantonment authorities. The SCB’s health and sanitation wing got into action to desilt the open nalas. “Removal of silt at Trimulgherry lake is also taken up and work is on a brisk pace,” said an official. Ahead of the desilting works, officials identified key nalas, which are likely to cause inundation in residential colonies like Chinnathokatta bridge, CBN Nagar at Rasoolpura, Viman Nagar bridge. “We assessed the damage during the October 2020 floods and built retaining walls at some of the open nalas to prevent overflowing in the ensuing monsoon,” a senior official said. In last year’s flooding, over half a dozen colonies were inundated with flood waters along with sewerage water rising up to a height of 5-7 feet. Officials pulled down unauthorised structures constructed on the nalas to prevent flooding after residents kicked up a furore. Two major nalas — Hasmathpet nala and Picket — cover 10 km length in the Cantonment limits and are connected to Hussainsagar lake. At the century-old Ramannakunta lake, laying of sewer trunk lines is nearing completion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-undertakes-desilting-of-nalas-ahead-of-monsoon/articleshow/83097324.cms||Sunil Mungara

The airport, ranked 110th in the final quarter of 2020, stood 154th — among facilities with passenger traffic of 5-15 million — in the latest rankings for the Asia Pacific region, released by the Airports Council International (ACI). The airport was ranked 61st in 2019 and 97th last year. Airports are rated on 33 parameters based solely on passenger feedback. Pune airport lost points in every category, bar two. “This indicates that basic facilities being provided at the airport need improvement ,” Pradeep Sharma, a frequent flyer, told TOI. Some of the parameters are parking facilities, efficiency of check-in staff, waiting time in queues, staff helpfulness, waiting time in security checks, ease of making connections with other flights, restaurant services, Wi-Fi access, availability and cleanliness of washrooms, comfort in waiting areas, and speed of baggage delivery. The parameters in which the airport gained were availability of bank/ATM/moneychangers and comfort of waiting areas. At the moment, the airport has a daily average passenger traffic of 1,200-1,800, with 38 flight movements. “Right now, the number of flights and passengers are low, and this time can be used to fix these basic issues,” another frequent flyer said. Experts said the slide in rankings was troubling. “This again underlines the need to improve passenger facilities and amenities. Lohegaon airport has its limitations and will not be able to cater to the needs of a growing city.

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Action on hospital for charging patient under CM’s scheme||JAISALMER: The state government has directed officials to take action against a private hospital for charging beneficiaries under Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana - a scheme that treats patients free of cost. This private hospital was selected by the state government to treat such beneficiaries. A resident of Jaisalmer had complained about a private hospital in Jodhpur for not getting benefit of the scheme. Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi, taking cognisance, sought complete information of the case and directed assistant director (public services) to act against the hospital. Modi said that complainant Loonkaran Rathi, a resident of Phalsoond lodged a complaint with state health insurance agency that Shubham Hospital in Jodhpur had asked him to pay the bill at the time of discharge. When he told the hospital staff about the scheme, they said they had not received any order and told the patient to make the payment. When the patient showed the slip of the insurance scheme then too the doctor clearly refused to give any benefit after which payment was made. Modi said that the complainant was inspired to lodge the complaint on an online portal. Now the state complaint redressal committee of the scheme will take action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/action-on-hosp-for-charging-patient-under-cms-scheme/articleshow/83097355.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Artificial water sources quenching the thirst of wildlife in forest of Rajaji Tiger Reserve||DEHRADUN: Erratic weather patterns have been hitting the natural sources of water in forests for years now, forcing wild animals to move out of their natural habitats in search of water. This would often lead to human-animal conflict incidents in Uttarakhand. To address this issue, the state forest department, sometime ago, started a massive drive to arrange artificial water sources for wild animals in the reserved and protected forest areas, including Rajaji Tiger Reserve and Haridwar forest divisions — where the cases of human-animal conflict deaths were going up. This year, the Rajaji Tiger Reserve has recorded just one human-wildlife conflict incident whereas no such case surfaced in the Haridwar forest divisions till May 25, according to the forest department. This is indicative of the success of the forest department’s initiative, say officials. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand’s forest department, told TOI, “Earlier, the animals, especially elephants, used to cross human habitations to reach the Ganga, leading to conflict incidents and crop damage. Now, we have managed to restrain their movements by making water holes and developing artificial ponds.” In the run-up to Haridwar Maha Kumbh, the forest department intensified its efforts to restrict elephants within their habitats. To this end, the exercise of radio-collaring jumbos was initiated. Also, walls were erected to block the routes through which elephants would enter human habitation. However, habitat rejuvenation helped the most in changing the situation, say officials. “During the Kumbh, we succeeded in keeping the elephants and other wild animals such as leopard and deer within their habitats by replenishing artificial sources of water in the forests. The water sources are being rejuvenated through three primary ways — water pipelines, tankers and drilling a bore into underground aquifers,” added Suhag. Notably, Uttarakhand is home to 2,026 elephants, according to an estimation done by the forest department in 2020. A majority of these jumbos are found in the Shivalik Elephant Reserve, which is spread across more than a dozen forest divisions and protected wildlife areas of Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/artificial-water-sources-quenching-the-thirst-of-wildlife-in-forests/articleshow/83095679.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Kochi||Eligible teachers await posting||Kochi: The delay in completing the appointments of teachers, who have already received the advice-memo from the government, is giving a hard time to eligible teachers during the pandemic. Though the government has said that the new academic year will begin on June 1 and the classes will be held online, no decision has been made on appointments. Over 1,000 teachers, who secured the eligibility to be appointed as LP teachers by qualifying the public service commission’s exam, are yet to receive the jobs they deserve as the education department cites the closure of schools due to the pandemic as a reason for the delay in doing the appointments. According to Kerala Chapter of All India Save Education Committee (AISEC), around 1,672 LP teachers are awaiting appointments despite having received the advice-memo months ago. Some of them have received the advice-memo over a year ago. These teachers, who have been working in various schools for daily wages or on contract basis, are desperate as the government has not taken action despite their repeated requests. M Shajar Khan, general secretary of AISEC, said many of the teachers have already received posting orders but those orders remain unimplemented. He said the number of teachers, whose appointments are pending, is over 3,000 if upper primary and high school too are considered. AISEC said that the government should complete the appointments at the earliest. “For many teachers, this job is the only hope to lead a better life and some of them are even struggling to pay for their kids’ education. There are several vacancies in schools but the government is not ready to make appointments. LP schools are already facing shortage of teachers and hundreds of schools are functioning without headmaster/headmistress. The empowerment of the education sector will not be possible if teachers are not appointed to fill in vacancies,” said Khan. Many schools are running understaffed and with the government having modified the online classes for the students by including school-level digital classes, the shortage of teachers will be a major challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/eligible-teachers-await-posting/articleshow/83095778.cms||---

In another development, the civic body will start special vaccination centre for persons with disabilities, at Yashwant stadium on Monday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that a few students who have got admission in foreign universities and completed VISA formalities are approaching for vaccination as it is mandatory in some countries. “We will facilitate vaccination of these students at two centres for two-three days in a week,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said NMC will provide an email ID on which the students can send detailed information and copies of admission and VISA. “A Google sheet will also have to be filled,” he said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari suggested allowing walk-in vaccination for these students. He also asked the administration to facilitate jab of both Covishield and Covaxin as the rules are different for every country. The central government had permitted vaccination of 18-44 years age group from May 1 but asked states to procure vaccines and inoculate the beneficiaries. The state launched vaccination for 18-44 age group at limited centres on May 1 but stopped on May 12 citing shortage of doses. A few private hospitals in five districts of the state are vaccinating people in this age group after procuring doses directly from the manufacturers. Three private hospitals in the city are also likely to begin vaccination from June 1. Meanwhile, the NMC in association with Composite Regional Centre for Skill Development, Rehabilitation and Empowerment of Persons With Disabilities will begin vaccination specially for persons with disabilities at the latter’s centre at Yashwant stadium. Centre will run from 9am to 5pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-going-abroad-for-edu-to-get-jab-at-2-centres-in-nagpur/articleshow/83097423.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||Eatala air-dashes to Delhi, wife does fire-fighting in T||Hyderabad: After a brief lull, politicking resumed on Sunday with former health minister Eatala Rajender air-dashing to Delhi, while his wife Jamuna held a press conference at their Shamirpet residence to clear the air on land grabbing and other charges levelled against the family. Though she never came into the public view, Jamuna, who manages the family’s poultry business, is said to be harbouring political ambitions. The couple had reportedly sent a proposal — Rajender willing to contest Lok Sabha election and she from Huzurabad assembly seat—during the 2018 election to TRS bosses, but it appears that they did not evince interest. She did not contest any election so far. Like Rajender , Jamuna was also an activist of Progresive Democratic Students Association (PDSU), a left student outfit. One of the reasons Eatala reportedly not keen on joining the Congress could be getting no assurance on Huzurabad ticket in case of a byelection. Sources close to him say that though ideologically he was more inclined towards the Congress, with no ticket assurance and BJP being in power at the Centre, he was pushed towards the saffron party. Though there has been speculation that Eatala might seek Rajya Sabha nomination, BJP sources denied any such moves. “BJP never works on assurances, and also the party does not have too many vacant seats. If his wife wants to contest Huzurabad, the party may not say no,” a top leader close to the developments had said. BJP sources said Rajender might join the party on June 6 and before that he may quit TRS.  A section of BJP wants Rajender to resign from TRS, but continue as an independent unattached member in the assembly, countering the TRS government on the lines of BJP. A clarity might emerge on further course of action after Rajender’s Delhi, trip, the sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-air-dashes-to-delhi-wife-does-fire-fighting-in-t/articleshow/83097364.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: 13 nurses given 230 remdesivir doses to be administered to patients in MDM Hospital||JODHPUR: A total of 230 remdesivir vials meant for administration to Covid patients in MDM Hospital earlier this month have come under probe lens. An inquiry committee constituted by the hospital administration has named 13 nurses who had been issued these vials. Though the nurses haven’t been considered as suspects and the hospital has advocated the need of further investigation into the matter. It is alleged that the vials, which had been issued in the name of certain patients, some of whom who did not even exist, had made their way to the black market. Hospital superintendent MK Aseri said the committee had given these 13 names based on the record showing them as recipients of these vials, but they could not be termed as suspect. He further added that a fresh committee was being considered for detailed investigation into the matter, which could possibly comprise a representative from the district administration. The committee, which had named these 13 nursing staff in its report, has also advised the need of further inquiry by increasing its scope in order to get to the bottom of the alleged misappropriation of the vials. On the other hand, the named nursing staff members met Aseri on Sunday and presented their side after they found their names in the report on Saturday. “These nurses met me on Sunday and termed themselves as innocent. They said they are ready to give the names of the patients for whom they had been issued the vials”, said Aseri. While claiming innocence, these nurses mentioned the name of some doctors who had received a few vials. However, Aseri declined any such mention. According to information, a complaint of black marketing of remdesivir vials at the MDM Hospital had been received by the hospital administration and a committee had been constituted to probe the veracity of the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/13-nurses-given-230-remdesivir-doses-to-be-administered-to-patients-hosp/articleshow/83097398.cms||---

On the allegations of amassing huge wealth and properties, Jamuna said she worked hard as a woman entrepreneur to manage their poultry business and came up in life. “Is this the way this government is encouraging women entrepreneurs?” she questioned at a press conference. “How many properties were owned by us in 2004 and how many they (KCR family) owned then. We are ready for a judicial inquiry. As Eatala was becoming popular, they started mudslinging on him so that there is no threat to the family on political front,” she said She took care not to name TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his family members. She referred to them as “they” and said the entire episode of allegations of land grabbing against Eatala and his family members was a “sketch” prepared at Pragati Bhavan. “Is this for which we fought so hard to achieve Telangana, sold our properties to bring out students from jail during agitation. They are trying to implicate even our son, Nitin Reddy, in the land grabbing case. A godown, we had rented out to a brewery, was vacated under pressure from the government. They are trying to hit us economically too,” she alleged at the media conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prove-allegations-eatalas-wife-jamuna/articleshow/83097401.cms||---
---||Kochi||Opening of colleges in coop sector: HC sets aside GO||Kochi: The Kerala high court has set aside a state government order that allowed only cooperative institutions to start new colleges for non-medical and non-engineering streams. Justice Anil K Narendran set aside the order dated August 20 last year and the notification issued by the Kannur University that restricted applications for new colleges for academic year 2021-22 from the cooperative sector alone. After considering a petition (WP-C No. 28874/2020) filed by Malabar Educational and Charitable Trust through advocate K Mohanakannan, the court held that the government order and the university’s notification are liable to be declared unconstitutional as they violate the right to equality under Article 14 and right to carry on a trade or business under Article 19(1)(g). The court ordered the Kannur University to allow the petitioner to submit an application for starting a new college during academic year 2021-22 within two weeks. In the original petition, only the notification by the university, which allowed only cooperative institutions to start new colleges, was challenged. However, when the university contended that its decision was based on a government order, the petitioner had amended the petition to challenge the government order also. The government had contended before the court that its decision was based on the report by Kerala state higher education council following a study on measures to be adopted for improving the quality of higher education in the state. It is a policy decision of the government and it should not be interfered with by the court, government had argued. The court held that the government can have a policy but such policy cannot be in violation of the fundamental rights available under the Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/opening-of-colleges-in-coop-sector-hc-sets-aside-go/articleshow/83095845.cms||---
---||Udaipur||Udaipur: Chittor village hit by virus turns into Covid care hub||UDAIPUR: Sometimes, every small step taken has a major impact. Converting a non-functional government school building into a multifunctional Covid care centre and imposing strict restrictions for stipulated period has brought good results for residents in Gadola village of Chittorgarh district, so much that now ‘Gadola model’ is being replicated in other villages for Covid management. The village that was hit with fear and panic when 87 residents tested positive and 17 lives were lost in the second wave, and no one was even willing to get tested, not only outgrew their fear, but emerged as winners with not a single active case here at present. Chittorgarh collector Tarachand Meena had visited the village as the reports about reservations of the locals about testing and treatment spread. Medical teams’ efforts to convince people failed and the fear of the contagion increased since people refused to go to hospitals on developing flu-like symptoms. “It was a challenging situation and we had to reinstate faith among the public, hence I asked them if they would prefer an all-facility-Covid centre in the village itself and the response was in affirmation,” Meena said. Without wasting time, the administration chalked out a plan. The government senior secondary school building, which was not in use due to school closure, was acquired. Classrooms were converted into hospital wards with beds, medical equipment, oxygen cylinders, ventilators, ambulances and medical staff made available here. As many as 58 people, who tested positive and were in need of medical care, were admitted here. While the administration took care of the working of the Covid centre, Rasali Devi, the sarpanch, took upon herself the responsibility of imposing strict restrictions of lockdown and made sure residents adhered to the corona protocols. Panghats were closed down and women folk were warned not to collect water from community wells and hand-pumps. Instead, she ensured water supply to every home, and distributed ration kits to needy families. The entire village was sanitised and sanitation workers were asked to maintain cleanliness in the area. The integrated efforts of the authorities, public representatives and the residents themselves paid off and now, there is not a single active case in Gadola. Encouraged by the results, the district administration announced plans to replicate the Gadola model in every panchayat samiti. Rs 10 lakh for setting up of Covid care facility in each panchayat samiti has been sanctioned and each municipal body in the district has been given Rs 5 lakh each for such centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/chittor-village-hit-by-virus-turns-into-covid-care-hub/articleshow/83097462.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC asks Centre to consider FCRA relief for Covid-19 aid||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to treat as a representation a PIL seeking to exempt foreign contributions or aid, such as oxygen concentrators and medicines received for Covid-19 management and treatment, from the ambit of Foreign Contribution (Regulations) Act (FCRA) 2010 during the pandemic. If the representation is made, the government will take a decision in eight weeks, the court said. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh directed the Centre to take a decision in accordance with the rules and the government policy applicable and as early as possible and practicable. The court disposed of the plea by charitable organisation Shri Sai Kirpa Society, which manages a medical centre at Sai Akshardham in Greater Noida, with assistance from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and National Heart Institute. In its petition, filed through advocate Gaurav Gupta, the society said a person of Indian origin in the US had wanted to send oxygen concentrators and life-saving drugs for Covid patients. But accepting it without any relief will violate FCRA, it added. Meanwhile, a plea to give priority in Covid vaccination to NRIs and students who have to go for studies abroad has been moved in Delhi High Court and may be heard on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-centre-to-consider-fcra-relief-for-covid-19-aid/articleshow/83097442.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Ambulance operators lock horns with Auranganad admin||Aurangabad: While the district administration has asked ambulance operators to charge Covid patients and their families as per the rates fixed in July 2020, the ambulance operators have defied these orders stating that their expenses have gone up due to frequent sanitizations and fuel hike among other reasons. As per rate approved by the district transport authority (DTA) on July 9 last year, any normal ambulance should not charge more than Rs 600 when transporting patients to and from within 25 km of Aurangabad. The rate for larger ambulances and cardiac ambulances was fixed at Rs 800 and Rs 1,500, respectively for service within the similar jurisdiction. A charge Rs 8 per km and Rs 10 per km for offering services beyond the limit of 25 km was fixed for normal ambulances and larger ambulances, respectively. The rate is Rs 25 per km for cardiac ambulances. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan has warned all ambulance operators that they would face action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, if found overcharging. “Citizens can lodge grievances related to overcharging by contacting the district administration on 0240-2331077 or the regional transport office on 0240- 2331133 or sending a mail to mh20@mahatranscom.in,” the collector has said. Sanjay Halnor, the leader of the ambulance operators’ association, said it was not right of the district administration to continue the charges framed last year to the current year without consulting the operators. “Besides the hike in fuel prices, there has been a surge in the cost of spare parts and overall maintenance of the vehicles. Our expenditure has gone up also due to Covid safety norms including spending on PPE kits and regular sanitizations,” he said, seeking a revision of the fares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ambulance-operators-lock-horns-with-auranganad-admin/articleshow/83095773.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Hosp proposes, insurer disposes: Cos reject nearly 50% of charges paid by patients||Nagpur: Dinkar Garg and his wife were admitted to a private hospital near Wadi after contracting Covid in March. For nine-day stay, the couple was handed over a joint bill of Rs6.78 lakh. This included over Rs2.23 lakh towards room rent alone at Rs12,400 a day, for each of them. The insurer reimbursed a little over Rs2.18 lakh for both. The insurance company covered room rent only for four days out of nine. The reason cited was the stay for another five days was not needed, yet the hospital kept them. The hospital had charged Rs28,800 for PPE kits, which was totally rejected by the insurer. Only Rs16,000 was reimbursed out of Rs42,000 as doctor’s charges. In case of a 45-year old man getting admitted to an upmarket hospital in October last year, nearly half of the over Rs4 lakh bill was rejected. The bill included Rs1.57 lakh for room charges, Rs40,000 towards miscellaneous expenses, Rs3,000 a day as consultation charges and Rs2,000 towards resident medical officer’s (RMO) fees. The insurer reimbursed only half of the room rent, miscellaneous expenses were completely disallowed along with RMO charges and Rs1,000 a day was allowed for consultation fees. As TOI analysed half a dozen bills from different hospitals, it was seen that as much 50% of the expenses were rejected by insurers. More than half of the bill amount was towards room charges, followed by disposables, apart from a separate head of miscellaneous charges which had hefty amounts. The RMO charges were also in the range of Rs1,000 to Rs2,000. Insurers generally did not allow more than Rs6,000 a day as room rent, as expenses under a whole gamut of heads are totally rejected. Here is one more example. A patient was charged Rs15,000 a day for nine days towards room rent, though he was kept in general ward. The hospital billed over Rs37,000 for PPE kits apart from Rs4,500 for masks separately. During the nine days, the patient was charged Rs1,050 for four PPE kits in a day. The cost of mask was Rs100 each. Out of the total bill of Rs2.93 lakh, the patient was reimbursed Rs1.34 lakh. This includes Rs25,000 received after an application to reconsider the case was made to the company. TOI accessed another bill which has not been settled yet. The patient was admitted for five days in April. The Rs3 lakh bill included Rs70,000 towards consultation charges. Two doctors charged Rs7,000 each for five days. The room rent, nursing charges and RMO fees clubbed stand at Rs1.4 lakh. In a couple of bills of over Rs1 lakh, Rs60,000 to Rs65,000 were allowed. One of the patients got full reimbursement of Rs20,000 as room charges, the other got Rs7,200 as against Rs9,200 charged for a day. Health insurance consultant Manoj Aya said, “The bills have heavy charges towards room rent, disposables, nursing or RMO fees. Some hospitals are including biomedical disposing charges too. Most insurance companies are allowing room rents only up to Rs6,000, while totally rejecting a number of components. This has created disputes between companies and clients. The bills are approved by a team which includes doctors from the companies’ side. Disputes can be raised with the insurance ombudsman or consumer courts, said an advisor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hosp-proposes-insurer-disposes-cos-reject-nearly-50-of-charges-paid-by-patients/articleshow/83097493.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Rajkot||After fungi, bacteria preying on Covid-recovered patients||RAJKOT/VADODARA/ SURAT/AHMEDABAD: First the virus, then fungi and now bacteria. Recovering from Covid-19 doesn’t seem to be a relief as doctors across the state are now reporting rising cases of several bacterial infections. Doctors across Gujarat are getting cases of patients with infections caused by bacteria like pseudomonas, klebsiella and acinetobacter, which are mostly causing secondary lung infections 20-25 days post recovery and in some cases, even after 40 days. “I am treating four patients with post-Covid secondary lung infection. Those patients who were prescribed immunosuppressant drugs during Covid, have co-morbid conditions or existing lung-ailments are vulnerable to bacterial and fungus infections,” said Dr Jayesh Dobariya, Rajkot-based critical care specialist. Pulmonologist Dr Milan Bhanderi explained, “We had seen this kind of bacterial infection in post-swine flu cases when patients were developing secondary lung infection within 8-10 days, but now we are diagnosing people with similar condition even 30 days after Covid recovery.” Much like mucormycosis (black fungus), Covid patients with uncontrolled blood sugar, low immunity caused by steroids, other medications or exisiting ailments, are more susceptible to bacterial infections. Vadodara-based infectious disease specialist Dr Hiten Kareliya said, “We are seeing bacterial infections in lungs, urine and blood in Covid-19 recovered patients. Some patients are developing these infections even while they are hospitalized.” “Predominance of gram-negative pathogens could be due to the invasive device-associated infections during hospitalization due to mechanical ventilation and central venous catheter implantation in these patients,” said Interventional pulmonologist Dr Amit Dave . Dr Maharshi Desai, Ahmedabad-based critical care specialist and member of state-appointed Covid task force, said that there are two categories of patients that come with fungal or bacterial infection. “The first category is of patients who are still in hospital but are technically non-Covid with negative RT-PCR. Another category is those already discharged and come back to the hospital with infections. In both these categories, we see infections due to weakened immune systems,” he said. A majority of these patients already have an underlying illness such as diabetes or a heart ailment among others, said infectious diseases specialist Dr Swati Gohel. “While occurrence of such infections is more among serious patients with prolonged hospitalization and age factor, we are also seeing a rise in infection among young patients with no history of oxygen dependency or steroids. This is pointing towards Covid’s role in attacking the body's immune system,” she said. “In ICU there are more invasive procedures and use of steroids which causes the secondary infection,” said Dr Samir Gami, Surat-based pulmonologist, adding that fatality due to secondary infection is high as multiple organs like lungs, kidneys, liver and heart get affected.

---||Pune||Free dialysis service by Pimpri facility comes to the aid of needy patients||PUNE: ANP Care Foundation, founded by Adwani and Pherwani, launched an initiative to provide free dialysis for needy patients two months ago at their facility in Pimpri. “During the last six months, I was informed about many cases wherein people who lost their livelihoods could not afford dialysis, which resulted in multiple fatalities. Several dialysis centres were shut because of the pandemic, which made it even more difficult for patients to avail the treatment. Some NGOs and charitable trusts are offering this service at reduced charges of Rs500-600 per session, but even that amount is proving to be hefty for patients. We thus thought of taking up this issue and offering free treatment to them,” said Manohar Pherwani, co-founder of the foundation. “Several dialysis centres have been affected by the pandemic. Starting this initiative to offer prompt service for dialysis patients with all necessary safety precautions in place was the need of the hour,” said Suresh Jethwani, a trustee with the foundation. Currently, the facility has four machines, while seven are supposed to be installed within a few weeks. “So far, we have treated over 200 patients ,” he added.

After Alia Bhatt, Janhvi Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan and Amitabh Bachchan, actor Ajay Devgn has also invested in a plush property. Devgn is believed to have bought a sprawling bungalow in Juhu for around Rs 60 crore. The bungalow spread across 590 sq yards is not far from the actor’s existing bungalow, Shakti, situated in the Kapole Co-operative Housing Society Ltd in Juhu. Devgn’s spokesperson confirmed to TOI that the actor has purchased the property located in the very lane where he currently resides. However, the price of the bungalow was not revealed by him, but real estate sources. The locality is home to other celebrities, including Hrithik Roshan, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra and Akshay Kumar. Sources said that the Devgns were looking for a new home for the past one year. The deal was struck last November-December and the Kapole Co operative Housing Society transferred the bungalow in the joint name of Veena Virendra Devgn and Vishal alias Ajay Devgn on May 7. The bungalow was earlier owned by the late Pushpa Valia. Real estate sources said that the existing rate of the bungalow is around Rs 65 to 70 crore, but due to the pandemic Devgn may have bought it at a discounted rate. Sources said that Devgan took possession of the bungalow and has even started renovation work as he wants to redevelop his existing bungalow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-devgn-buys-second-home-in-juhu-worth-rs-60-crore/articleshow/83099475.cms||Ahmed Ali

According to data available with the state adoption resource agency (SARA), 58 boys and 62 girls from Kerala were adopted in 2020-21 after the central adoption resource agency (CARA) under the ministry of women and child development (WCD) issued directions to resume the adoption processes online. While 120 children were adopted by couples in Kerala, 13 children—-six boys and seven girls—-found a new home with NRI parents. This is against the 111 children who were adopted in the state in 2019-20. These included 52 boys and 59 girls while 13 others were adopted by NRIs in the same year. Officials said since there was a waiting list of couples with all the paperwork completed, the rest of the process was conducted online and that it was all a matter of just following up with timely submission of documents. “Under the new system, reminders of various deadlines will be sent to the prospective parents and they have to ensure that they upload all documents on time.” Ever since the lockdown kicked in, the social workers associated with the childcare institution from where the child is being adopted, have been doing online verification and conducting discussions with the prospective parents on possible difficulties they might face. According to the amended procedures in the wake of the pandemic, the social worker visiting the prospective parents should follow social distancing norms and as far as possible, give a post-adoption feedback online through video calls. SARA has been asked to initiate talks with the juvenile justice courts to speed up adoption cases by conducting hearings online through video conferencing to prevent the risk of infection to the child. As of now, 1046 couples are in the waiting list to adopt a child from Kerala, including 27 couples from abroad. While these are those couples who have registered for adopting children from Kerala, there are several couples who have registered for adoption in other states because of the long waiting list in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/133-kids-adopted-from-state-in-2020-21-as-against-124-last-year/articleshow/83095862.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Churu remained the hottest clocking a maximum temperature of 45.6°C, the Met department said. Attributing the continued rise in the mercury to active northerly winds, Jaipur Met office said a minor respite would be witnessed from Tuesday onwards when cloudy conditions are likely to prevail in some of the districts. People in Jaipur woke up to another warm morning with a minimum temperature of 27.2°C. It was followed by a scorching afternoon with a maximum temperature of 41.8°C. Weathermen said the city had witnessed 45°C in May last year, but this year has been cooler due to various cyclonic effects. Churu was followed by Bikaner and Phalodi where a maximum temperature of 45.4°C was recorded, Sriganganagar (45°C), Sawai Madhopur and Pali 43.7°C each, Pilani (43.1°C), Kota (42.2°C), Barmer (42°C), Ajmer (39.6°C) and Udaipur (37.4°C).

Days after the incident in Nandigama, the man’s father alleged on Sunday that the person who shot the video may have done so with an intention of killing his son. Nandigama police said that the man, Jagan, and his friend Shiva had consumed alcohol after which they decided to shoot the video. The aim was to make it look like Jagan was trying to hang himself but given his intoxication he actually ended up throttling himself unconscious. Initially, Shiva who was capturing the video thought Jagan was acting dead but as there was no response from the latter for several minutes, Shiva realised that Jagan was actually unconscious. He was rushed to a hospital and luckily survived. Police said the video was originally meant to be shared with Jagan’s wife to convince her as she had been refusing to come back from her mother’s house. Officials informed that Jagan’s father had lodged a complaint against Shiva alleging that he had deliberately captured the video with an intention to kill Jagan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mans-suicide-act-nearly-ends-in-death/articleshow/83097474.cms||---

Faisal Patel, the general secretary of the Federation of Haj Pilgrims’ Social Workers Maharashtra, said the Saudi Arabian government has decided to allow only 60,000 pilgrims for haj this year, including the quota of 45,000 pilgrims from the rest of the world. “The quota for Indian pilgrims is yet to be declared and we expect a favourable announcement by the first week of June ahead of the scheduled start of the holy pilgrimage in July. The pilgrimage has been planned by both Indian and Saudi governments keeping in mind the Covid safety requirements,” he said. Patel said no pilgrim above the age of 60 years is allowed to undertake the haj this year due to the pandemic. “As per the health advisory issued by Saudi Arabia, desirous haj pilgrim should get vaccinated for Covid-19 before embarking upon the journey. As the vaccination for the beneficiaries in the 18-44 years category has been halted in India at present, we have demanded that the Centre carry out a special vaccination drive for haj aspirants,” he said. During the pre-Covid times, nearly 24 lakh pilgrims from across the world used to participate in the haj. India had a quota of around 1.7 lakh pilgrims each year. Almost 70% haj aspirants in India plan their journey through the Haj Committee of India and remaining 30% opt for private tours. As per the health and age-related guidelines issued by Saudi Arabia, the Haj Committee of India has appealed to all haj applicants in the 18-60 years age group to upload/fill their details of Covid vaccination on the official website (www.hajcommittee.gov.in). If the applicant has taken only one dose of the vaccine, then he/she should also upload the same information and try to take the second dose as soon as possible, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-7000-register-for-haj-from-maharashtra/articleshow/83095799.cms||Prasad Joshi

As per data available on government beds on the BBMP website, the situation is far better among Covid general beds than other categories of beds. Of the total 7,195 general beds, 5,624 (or 78.1%) were available by 3pm on Sunday. In high-dependency units with oxygenated beds, 2,098 (or 42.4%) of 4,945 beds were available. But the situation is not the same with ICU beds and ICU beds with ventilators. As per the website, only 20 (3.3%) of 589 ICU beds and just 10 (or 1.5%) of 637 ICU beds with ventilators are available. While six ICU beds with ventilator were available in Rainbow Children’s Hospital and one each was vacant in government hospital, Anekal; KC General Hospital, Oxford Medical College Hospital and Research Centre and Dr BR Ambedkar Medical College Hospital.

---||Delhi||Unlocking: Corporations to speed up pending plans||New Delhi: With construction activities being allowed in the first phase of the gradual unlocking in Delhi, the municipal corporations have asked contractors to push pending projects, many of which have already missed several deadlines. The civic polls are due next year. South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s long-awaited Bharat Darshan Park, the north corporation’s Chandni Chowk car parking project and the east corporation’s Shahdara Jheel-cum-recreational park project are among the prominent ones where work have stopped due to the migration of workers during the lockdown. An SDMC official said the replicas of 17 renowned monuments had been almost complete at Bharat Darshan Park, which was to be ready by March 31. “We have also finished the horticulture work and now need to build pathways, toilets and entrances. Due to the lockdowns in two consecutive years, the project got delayed a lot, but we are sure to complete it in the next two months,” the official said. The corporation has also asked all contractors to adhere to all Covid-19 safety norms. To check the status of the Shahdara Jheel project, east corporation mayor Nirmal Jain has called a high-level meeting with the engineering department on Monday. “We can’t keep people waiting for this park, considering that this would be the first such space in the area. The waterbody work is over, but the same for electrification and tiling are pending,” said Jain. The north corporation claimed to have completed 90% work at the Kishanganj rail underbridge before the lockdown. “The railway had installed three boxes and we were simultaneously constructing roads. But migrant labourers then left for their hometown. We had a September deadline, but it has been shifted to November-end,” said mayor Jai Prakash. The status of work at the Chandni Chowk project will be verified soon. “Since the project is given to a private concessionaire, it is supposed to be completed in a time-bound manner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlocking-corporations-to-speed-up-pending-plans/articleshow/83097510.cms||Vibha Sharma

On Sunday, the actor made a video call to state labour minister Tika Ram Jully and expressed his gratitude towards the minister who arranged injections for a patient admitted at AIIMS, Bhopal. The minister also assured him of all possible help in future, be it in Rajasthan or any other place. Jully got the call on Saturday when the actor requested if he can arrange some injections for a patient under treatment for black fungus in Bhopal. During the call, the actor also maintained that he knew Madhya Pradesh was not his territory, but still requested. “Acting on his call I had called up a few doctors and my contacts in Bhopal and after some attempts we managed to arrange for the required injections for which Sonuji had requested. He has been doing phenomenal work and has proved that to help somebody you just need a will,” Jully told TOI on Sunday. Sharing his interaction with the actor, the minister, said, “He expressed his gratitude to me. I also congratulated him for all the pain he is taking in helping others. Also, I assured him that I am always ready and open to help him out in case he finds any such requests in Rajasthan or elsewhere.” It may be recalled that early this week the actor had sent 10 injections for a 62-year-old patient undergoing treatment for black fungus in Sriganganagar and had helped many other people in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Ajmer for their emergency needs of oxygen, Remdesivir and other items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/actor-sood-calls-labour-minister-to-thank-him/articleshow/83097513.cms||Ashish Mehta

The planned surgeries and non-Covid medical work are set to gather more pace next month following likely relaxations in norms,” said surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar of Galaxy Care hospital. The hospital has wound up its 40-bed Covid ward in the wake of over 80% drop in Covid admissions “We expect to begin non-Covid medical services, including planned surgeries, in full swing now,” Punetambekar said. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “There is almost 40% rise in elective surgeries at our hospital. We noticed quite a few patients who opted for planned surgeries were also vaccinated against Covid-19.” Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “The planned surgeries will gather more pace after relaxation in current lockdown-like restriction.” Medical expert Ketan Apte, head of Sahyadri hospital, said, “Elective surgeries are slowly on the rise after Covid cases started declining from mid-May. We have recorded a 20% rise in elective surgeries.” “We are also prioritising planned surgeries related to cardiac, urology, general surgeries, and neurosurgeries. In addition, ENT surgeries are also on the rise because of mucormycosis cases, primarily seen in post-Covid patients,” Apte said Surgeon Shashank Shah, head of the Lapro Obeso Centre, said, “Elective surgeries, including weight loss surgeries, reduced significantly. But emergency admissions went up by almost 200 percent during the second wave of the pandemic.” “We tackled many emergency complications related to hernia, gall bladder, and intestinal obstructions when Covid was peaking in Pune. Many of these patients had been postponing approaching hospitals out of fear. Some had to be rushed in when they landed in complications,” Shah said. District administration ordered 80% reservation of beds for Covid patients at private hospitals after cases started peaking from mid-March. “The beds earmarked for Covid patients have not been released yet despite a decline in cases. Hence, the increase in elective surgeries has remained low,” said Naresh Dave of Poona Hospital and Medical Research (PHRC). Delaying medical care may increase medical complications. Hence, people should seek medical care in time, experts said. “We have all infection control protocols in place. Hence, citizens who are advised elective surgeries by their consultants should get themselves operated at bigger hospitals in time where utmost care is taken,” said Vinod Sawantwadkar, chief executive officer, Jehangir hospital. Graphic Gathering Pace *After the first round of pandemic, non-Covid healthcare services had picked up to almost pre-Covid levels between October 2020 and February 2021 following a lull in Covid cases in Pune *However, they started declining again from mid-March in the wake of rising cases *The city hospitals had recorded a significant drop in non-emergency elective surgeries after a fresh spike in Covid cases and the subsequent lockdown *After the steep decline in cases since mid-May, hospitals have primarily started prioritising patients needing planned surgeries for a range of health issues concerning urology, gynaecology, orthopaedic, cardiac, neurology, ENT, ophthalmology and dentistry *Besides, medical services in terms of maternal, child health, and routine immunisation have also started gaining momentum Badly hit during second wave *The largest drop in planned surgeries related to orthopaedic surgeries like knee replacement, planned arthroscopies along with cardiac, urology and other general surgeries *With a large population like those from the IT sector moving back to their hometown during the second wave, hospitals have recorded a drop in gynaecological surgeries *All paediatric corrective surgeries for congenital conditions, including congenital heart diseases, were put on hold *Physiotherapy for chronic diseases/conditions had gone for a toss *Cosmetic procedure, day care treatment for blood disorders/cancers already hit *Follow-up monitoring of many chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney or liver disease, diabetes had been disrupted||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elective-surgeries-slowly-picking-up-pace-following-steep-decline-in-covid-cases/articleshow/83097484.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This was our solemn resolve when we gave to ourselves the constitution that we secure for us, our people the Justice, liberty, and equality, he said.

When we downloaded the certificate of vaccination, it was issued in the name of the late Hardas Karangia. How can this be possible?

In a statement, office secretary Kunal said that the workers of the party observed protests across the state to vent their ire against the “undemocratic” move of the government and instead demanded to extend the term of the outgoing representatives for six months. The office secretary of the party said that the elected representatives were closely associated with the people and aware of ongoing development works in the respective panchayats. Moreover, they have played an important role in awareness about Covid-19 pandemic in rural areas. “Under such a situation, handing over the charge to administrators will prove suicidal,” Kunal said, adding that the vaccination drive would meet with complete success only with the active support of the elected representatives of the three tier panchayati raj institutions. The press statement issued by the party claimed that several MLAs of the party and other senior functionaries took part in the protest marches in different districts. Earlier, similar demands were made by HAM(S) president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and VIP chief Mukesh Sahani. The state president of Bihar Rajya Mukhiya Mahasangh Ashok Singh had urged the CM Nitish Kumar to extend the term of the outgoing representatives by bringing about a special ordinance. The Sangh's demand was also supported by former union minister and BJP MP from Patliputra Ram Kripal Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-ml-demands-extension-of-term-of-panchayat-members/articleshow/83095873.cms||Ramashankar

A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said that “under the garb of a review, a party cannot be permitted to re-open the case and gain a full-fledged inning for making submissions.” It said the review of an order does lie merely on the grounds that it may be possible for the court to take a view contrary to what had been taken earlier. “Even the judgment given subsequent to the decision in a case can be no ground for entertaining the review. Review lies only when there is error apparent on the face of the record and that fallibility is by the over-sight of the court,” the bench said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid-19 relief work hit as FCRA rules choke grants to small NGOs||MUMBAI: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, small NGOs working at the grassroots level have been dealt a double whammy. At a time when their intervention could play a significant role in tackling the crisis, amendments in the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) have cut them off from funding. Sarswathi Padmanabhan, founder-director of Diya Ghar, an NGO that runs pre-schools and daycare facilities in the backward areas, said community classes at their centres have come to a halt due to the Covid situation. A shift to the online mode could have been an option, but a crippling funds crunch poses a hurdle as bigger NGOs that get foreign funds are unable to allocate the grants to them. The same is the case with Anubhuti Trust, which works for the welfare of NTs, SCs and STs. Despite work that brought international acclaim, its managing trustee and founder-director Deepa Pawar says the new regulations have cut off access to foreign funds. Mumbai-based The Young Whistleblowers’ Foundation had planned to file a PIL on compensation to the families of farmers who committed suicide. “All our plans are stuck due to negligible support from big NGOs or philanthropists in the absence of a favourable foreign funding clause,” says founder-director Jitendra Ghadge. As per amended FCRA regulations of October 2020, Indian non-profits are not allowed to re-grant or sub-grant the foreign funds they receive. This means funders who currently use FCRA-registered non-profits as a re-granter to support other Indian non-profits can no longer do so. Also, Indian non-profits who serve as lead implementers on projects can no longer create sub-grant relationships with other non-profits using foreign funding. A silver lining has emerged, though, with a few big NGOs, trusts and foundations coming forward to help. “Partners like Mariwala Health Foundation, CII Foundation, CLP India, Youth Feed India, BTS Army, Samarpan, Rotary and Rotaract Clubs of Dombivali, Dasra and others have supported our Covid relief work,” Anubhuti Trust’s Pawar said. “With Rs50 crore of our target of Rs75 crore raised, Dasra is continuing its efforts to mobilise support for its local community-based NGO partners. Immediate relief funding for frontline NGOs leading the fight against Covid-19 will continue to be the need of the hour,” said Deval Sanghavi of NGO Dasra. Raj Mariwala of the Mariwala Health Initiative said all big donors, philanthropists and CSRs should give more thrust to funding smaller NGOs that offer Covid relief at the grassroots level, but do not have access to foreign funding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-19-relief-work-hit-as-fcra-rules-choke-grants-to-small-ngos/articleshow/83099587.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

This year’s theme is ‘Tigers as flag-bearers for ecological restoration’. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the commemoration of 75 years of India’s Independence on March 12, 2021. Under this campaign, the CZA has started a massive outreach campaign titled ‘Conservation to co-existence: The people connect’. Tigers in the wild signify healthy livelihood as they protect genetic diversity, and are the guardians and an indicator of a healthy forest. The tiger is at the top of the food chain. Therefore, healthy presence of the tiger population indicates healthy forests. Nature is thus balanced with a unique prey-predator relationship that helps in maintaining the health of our ecosystems. India, with more than 2,967 tigers and 51 tiger reserves, has spearheaded the tiger conservation movement in the world. It is now home to 70% of global tiger population. The campaign aims at generating awareness for conservation priority identified 75 wild animal species through continued public engagement across 75 weeks, starting from March 12, 2021, and concluding on August 15, 2022. One species is being celebrated each week showcasing its uniqueness along with information on its conservation status. The six-day events will be inaugurated on Monday at PCCF office in Civil Lines. It will be addressed by PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar, FDCM managing director N Vasudevan, Mafsu vice-chancellor Dr AM Paturkar and CZA member-secretary SP Yadav. Several experts on various topics will guide the participants at the virtual event. The six-day events are packed with webinars on topics like saving tigers in human-dominated landscape, tiger conservation and veterinary intervention, wildlife forensics, management of large felids in zoos and protected areas, conserving India’s tigers – achievements and challenges among various other topics.

---||Nagpur||CBSE threatens disaffiliation to schools over data disclosure||NAGPUR: CBSE has threatened schools with disaffiliation for ignoring its policy requiring mandatory publishing specific details on the institute’s website. Schools have been given till third week of June to upload all the required data and make it easily accessible from their home page itself. CBSE’s academic director Anurag Tripathi, in a circular issued this week, has warned that schools will face action if the deadline to comply with norms is breached. Though the policy has been around for sometime, a majority of the schools in the country do not comply with it in toto. Since the disclosure list is very long, a majority of the schools put only some of the data on their website. This way they can technically get away by mentioning that “public disclosure” has been done. CBSE’s secretary Tripathi wrote, “it has been observed that in spite of clear instructions from the board, some schools are not following these provisions. It is therefore reiterated that it is imperative on the part of the school to comply with norms of not only the state school education department but also provisions of the Affiliation and Examination bye-laws of CBSE.” Schools have to upload various documents and information related to the school’s management, various committees, staff and infrastructure. There is no need to upload verified copies on the website, however, any false information will lead to action against the school. Making such information available to the public will help increase transparency and avoid problems later. Parents or vigilant citizens who spot discrepancy in the information put out by the school can bring it to the notice of CBSE. Contact information for the board is available on their website. The ‘problem’, is something which state education department too learnt the hard way. Last year, a city school started operations without the paperwork being cleared by the state government. Immediately after that, the district education officer Chintaman Vanjari made it mandatory for all schools, regardless of the board, to display their U-DISE number at the entrance gate. A U-DISE number is like an Aadhaar number for schools. For at least the last two years, all CBSE schools mention their affiliation number at both the website and even admission advertisements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-threatens-disaffiliation-to-schools-over-data-disclosure/articleshow/83104802.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

But recent experience has shown that this particular coronavirus is unpredictable. Instead of being complacent about testing, there is a case for carrying out more Covid tests than ever, particularly among children, the unvaccinated group that is believed to be at a higher risk. Delhi’s healthcare system is poised at a critical moment, the experience of a ruthless infection period behind it but a possible new wave just ahead. A government official admitted at the peak of the current surge in Delhi, Covid testing began declining, apparently because the manpower engaged in conducting tests themselves became infected. In fact, a major diagnostic laboratory that processed thousands of samples every day reported that 40% of its staff was hit by Covid, seriously curtailing their ability to finish the testing processes. Statistics show that on April 11, there were 1,14,288 Covid tests conducted, including 76,954 gold standard RT-PCR tests and 37,334 rapid antigen tests, that returned a positivity rate of 9.4% (10,774 positive results). On April 20, when the city recorded the highest single-day rise in new cases, only 86,526 tests were conducted, of which 28,395, or 32.8%, proved to be positive. On May 11, 70,276 samples were processed and on May 20, just 58,744. Devising an equitable, cost-effective and scalable Covid response alongside vaccination, global advocacy Rockefeller Foundation has suggested smart testing and tracing measures not only to control the infection, but also to manage future waves. In its report, the foundation has advised intensifying testing for all populations, including the vaccinated, developing a cafeteria approach to testing (that is, making available a diverse portfolio of tests with clear guidance), undertaking well-designed seroprevalence surveys, and expanding genome sequencing efforts. Dr Navin Dang, consultant microbiologist and founder of Dr Dang’s Labs, rued that with infections declining, people were becoming complacent again. What happened just before the second wave occurred — people ignoring safety norms, markets opening, social gatherings taking place — is happening once more, he noted. “People are under the impression that since cases are declining, they do not need to get tested,” said Dang, “but the strictness imposed during the peak of the current wave must be maintained even now.” He also emphasised the need for everyone to get vaccinated. “Vaccines work, trust your doctors, trust your scientists,” he said. Dang also advocated Covid tests among unvaccinated children with a history of close contact with infected individuals or who exhibited Covid symptoms. Dr Suneela Garg, director-professor of community medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College, and member, vaccination task force for India, opined that the expected third wave might not come if the country was proactive in its strategy. “It is a matter of preparedness. On average, 30 contacts of each Covid-positive individual must be tested,” she said. The Rockefeller Foundation also advocated demand forecasting to ensure that test kit suppliers are response-ready. It is necessary to undertake scientific demand projection for Covid tests every quarter, its report says. The current wave, at its peak, overwhelmed the existing testing infrastructure, curtailing the number of daily tests the city could carry out. At one point, home collection of samples became next to impossible, and RT-PCR results took three-five days to be ready. Dr Anil Gogia, senior consultant, internal medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, concurred and said, “We should have some method of making forecasts of a surge and at that point ramp up testing by utilising the requisite manpower and infrastructure.” He said that the test results should come faster or as early as possible and disinclined people encouraged to undertake tests. Experts suggest that the government must ensure there is steady supply of test kits and manpower to prevent testing capacity dwindling should the demands rise again. They said that testing should be encouraged as part of the general pandemic surveillance once the lockdown is relaxed and movement of individuals increases, even if rapid antigen tests are employed rather than RT-PCR. As the Rockefeller Foundation reports suggests, “Frequent use of affordable, simple-to-use rapid tests at scale for populations without symptoms will mitigate outbreak, even if their analytic sensitivities are inferior to those of benchmark tests.” It also explained that with schools planning their reopening without vaccines being an option for children, such tests could become commonplace as periodic checks to ensure safety from the virus. Dr Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council, added that parents must get themselves vaccinated because they are the one who had to provide care to their children if the latter were to get infected. Costing should also be part of the strategy to keep Covid at bay. Though the government has capped the rates of some Covid tests, they are still unaffordable to underprivileged people. The socially and economically disadvantaged group have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and need greater support in fighting the coronavirus infection right from testing. Because of the price of the tests, the poor are inclined to dodge testing even when they develop symptoms, some of them becoming super spreaders because they work in markets, use public transport and use common public spaces. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and public health expert, also underlined the need to redistribute tests and cover rural areas where test facilities are far fewer than in urban centres. “I would suggest redeployment of testing with a focus on rural areas,” he said. “Adopt the mobile vans approach to connect remote locations and make testing accessible, affordable and available.” Lahariya also advised genome sequencing to determine which mutation of the coronavirus was spreading and tackling it accordingly. Delhi government has started increasing the number of daily Covid tests, with the focus in some districts being rural areas. On May 24, labs conducted 61,506 tests, which rose to 73,406 on May 25 and 77,103 tests on May 26. A Delhi government health official claimed that tests were increasing across the districts. “Diverse groups of people are being tested, including residents of slums as well as planned colonies and societies,” said the official, optimistically predicting that the number of Covid tests would increase in the coming days.

The body seen being lifted by two men, one of them in a PPE kit, and thrown into the water from the parapet of a bridge on Saturday turned out to be of Prem Nath Mishra, a resident of Shohratgarh in Siddharthnagar district. The occupants of a car passing by apparently recorded the 39-second clip that was circulated on social media, prompting the administration to institute an inquiry by Balrampur chief medical officer Dr VB Singh. “Prem Nath had been admitted to the L2 district hospital on May 25. He tested positive for Covid-19 and succumbed to the infection on May 28,” Singh said. According to hospital records, ambulance driver Rampreet had handed over Prem Nath’s body to his nephew Sanjay Kumar at Sisai Ghat on Saturday. The CMO said the body was wrapped in a protective kit, as per Covid-19 protocol. “In the video, a man in a PPE kit is seen with another person in a black shirt and blue jeans, holding a body wrapped in a PPE cover. They open the cover and throw the body into the river at a place under Kotwali Dehat police station,” SP Kutiyal said. Based on a complaint by the ambulance driver, the police lodged an FIR under the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act against the kin and arrested Sanjay along with his alleged associate Manoj late on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-held-for-dumping-covid-dead-in-river/articleshow/83102576.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Kallathu Kombai, located on the foothills of Pachamalai hills, is a village with about 50 tribal families. Agriculture is one of the major occupations of the villagers and some of them also rear cattle for livelihood. After some of the people complained of fever, a public health team visited the village and took 150 swab samples. As 17 of them tested positive, a team went to the village on Saturday and referred seven to the government hospital for treatment and the rest to isolate themselves at home. A public health staff said that they are closely monitoring the health condition of those under home quarantine. The health staff added that they have decided to test a few more who were left out three days back to ensure that all the villagers are screened and also gave adequate instructions to the villagers to ensure that others are not infected. The major roads leading to the village have been blocked, including the one from Puliyancholai along the Masi Periyanannsamy temple. He said this this measure was necessitated as these isolated groups of people were infected from some outsiders or those who went out, got exposed and came back to the village. “We have also instructed for the isolation of villagers if they come from outside so that they don’t spread the virus to others in case they are found to be carriers,” said the public health staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/village-isolated-after-17-test-ve/articleshow/83099563.cms||---

He was speaking at the eighth and ninth annual convocation of Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Trichy on Saturday.He said the pandemic has caused serious disruptions but also created new opportunities, ideas and concepts. It was shocking to find that the country did not have the capacity to produce enough oxygen concentrators. “It isn’t a very complicated device and we should be able to make them. But most of them were imported from other countries to meet the demand,” he said. Similarly, vital medicines and vaccines are also being imported. “For a country of our size which is capable of creating management schools like IIM, we ought to have capacity to build all these,” he said.Vembu said that the pandemic has dangerously exposed us in terms of our capabilities where we don’t have all the things in place. “We can have a resilient economy at the local level, the pandemic has exposed the lack of resilience and the need for the resilience. The last 30-40 years of B-schools did not emphasise on it but we argued for hyper specialisation. That notion is being challenged now,” he said. The PM announced Atmanirbhar Bharat last year which is very vital for our future where we must be much more self-reliant in our capabilities. Stressing on the need to build a resilient economy on war footing, he said post-pandemic reconstruction of the economy should emphasise on resilience and building capabilities domestically as themes. 500 graduate received their degrees at the convocation which included 24 medals winners. In the postgraduate programme in management (on campus), 175 of 2020 batch and 237 from 2021 batch were given degrees. In the PGPBM, for working professionals, 43 graduated from 2020 batch and 35 from 2021 batch. Ten students were awarded doctorate in management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/zoho-founder-questions-focus-of-b-schools/articleshow/83099595.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

To ensure that poor people apart from elders and differently abled are not left hungry, the district administration has started a scheme called ‘Thalapathy Kitchen’ through which food will be served three times a day the doorstep of the scheme’s beneficiaries. Those who would like to avail this facility can pre-register by making a call to 9498747644, 9498747699. The scheme was inaugurated on Sunday in Karur, by minister for electricity, prohibition and exercise V Senthil Balaji based on the directions of chief minister M K Stalin. The CM had asked to ensure that none should be left without food during this lockdown. He said people can make calls a few hours ahead to enable workers to serve the food on time. “People can also request for three meals a day throughout the lockdown so that they don’t have to make calls every time they need food,” said Senthil Balaji. He said a total of 3307 people had requested for food by making calls to the numbers and it will be delivered at their doorsteps. Apart from Thalapathy Kitchen, the minister has been serving meals to the needy from his MLA office over the last 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thalapathy-kitchen-to-serve-food-to-the-needy-in-karur/articleshow/83099576.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Many of those who received vaccination claimed that they might be going abroad for work for which the vaccination certificate is mandatory. As persistent complaints were raised by people who did not receive any acknowledgment, Trichy corporation through data entry operators and field workers, launched two helplines, including 82204 29418, to resolve the issue. “Through the CoWIN portal, we resolved the discrepancy. In a span of 10 minutes maximum per caller, we managed to record the details of the beneficiary and the certificate was sent to their registered mobile number instantly,” a source said. A few who were handed over certificates with misspelt names also received a revised provisional certificate. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-issues-vax-certificates/articleshow/83099610.cms||---
---||Pune||After Covid, wait 6 weeks for non-urgent surgery: Experts||PUNE: Nandini, 47, recently wanted to undergo surgery to remove a diseased uterus (hysterectomy) after a full recovery from Covid-19. Her surgeon asked her to undergo an RT-PCR test before the procedure, which came back as positive. As a sizeable number of people who've recovered from Covid now opt for non-urgent or elective surgical procedures — for everything from gynaecological to orthopaedic and urological problems — treating surgeons are insisting on repeat RT-PCR/antigen tests as part of preoperative protocols. But experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research and the national Covid task force have advised against repeating these Covid tests within 102 days of recovery, citing presence of 'non-viable dead-virus particles' that stay on for a while even after full recuperation. Similarly, the experts said surgeons should consider performing a non-urgent surgery on a Covid-recovered patient only after six weeks of recovery to ensure faster healing and convalescence post surgery. “Presently, Covid reinfection is confirmed only after 102 days of diagnosis. So retesting as a preoperative protocol within this timeframe is not advisable,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Task Force for Covid-19. “Also, a minimum period of six weeks prior to non-urgent surgery is recommended for Covid-recovered patients who were symptomatic. As for emergency surgeries in recovering or recovered patients, these must be done immediately with due precautions,” Pujari said. But he added that if a patient experiences recurrence of symptoms after Covid recovery, re-testing and consultation with an infectious disease expert can be considered. Experts said a Covid-recovered patient's preoperative risk assessment should be individualized, by factoring in surgical intensity, co-morbidities and the risk-benefit ratio if procedure is delayed. “Residual symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain are common in patients who have had Covid-19. These symptoms can be present more than 60 days after diagnosis,” Pujari said. Covid may also have long-term effects on heart function. A thorough preoperative evaluation, scheduled well ahead of surgery with special attention given to cardiopulmonary systems, should be considered in patients who have recovered and especially in those with residual symptoms, guidelines by the American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) have stated. Surgeon Sanjay Kolte, president of the Poona Surgical Society said, “Retesting recovered patients within 102 days from Covid diagnosis only adds to anxiety and is a wastage of money. Importantly, surgeons should adopt universal precautions while performing elective surgery rather than insisting on RTPCR reports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wait-six-weeks-for-non-urgent-surgery-after-covid/articleshow/83097634.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Being at the frontline of man-animal conflicts in Wayanad, Kumar’s life was saved by a whisker in the two tiger attacks he faced during the past 10 months. While a tiger sank its teeth through the helmet to bite on his head in the first attack at Panakolli near Pulpally in October 2020, in the second attack Kumar’s shoulder bones crumbled after the tiger bit deep into his left shoulder in January. Kumar now has a steel plate on his shoulder after the second attack that left him hospitalized for 25 days. The first attack took place when he, along with a team, went to drive away a tiger after it strayed into a compound of a house. “We drove the tiger around 200m into the neighbouring forest but in a flash the tiger charged and pounced on me. I fell down and the last thing that I clearly remember was the tiger biting into my helmet. I thought it was the end of my life when the tiger started dragging me and I blacked out. Luckily, driver Manuel George suddenly tried to drive the animal away, following which it went after him and I had a narrow escape. George also was injured after the tiger bit his boot,” Kumar recounted. Just months after the first incident, Kumar was attacked by another stray tiger on January 10, 2021, at a coffee plantation in Kolavally near Mullankolly panchayat. Kumar fell on the ground during the attack and the tiger bit his shoulder. He had a narrow escape as forest staff and residents screamed aloud, following which the tiger ran away. “Doctors said it would take some more time for full recovery and I am still doing physiotherapy. In man-animal conflict hotspots like Wayanad, forest officials don’t have many options other than to hit the ground with limited resources to mitigate the conflict,” he said. While the forest department paid the hospital bill, the follow-up treatment expenses, including the ongoing physiotherapy, is borne by him. Kumar also had a narrow escape when a wild elephant attacked him near Panamaram while on duty. He said that the priority should be to provide protective gear and equipment to all frontline staff, participating in such operations. Kumar, who believes that sustainable solutions are needed to tackle these conflicts, hopes to undertake conservation activities and also continue his activities in the pain and palliative sector. He started his career as a forest guard with the department at Kuttiady range in Kozhikode and had won Wildlife Service Award of Sanctuary Nature Foundation for his anti-poaching efforts, including being part of the team which seized over 60kg ivory from Perikalloor in Wayanad. He also received the award instituted by the Wildlife Protection Society of India. Kumar, who hails from Pantheerankavu in Kozhikode, is currently settled near Sultan Bathery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/forest-officer-who-survived-two-tiger-attacks-hangs-up-his-boots/articleshow/83095999.cms||---

However, the MLA’s bodyguard, Anil Ram, was injured in the attack. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said an FIR was lodged against three people, including Rahul Yadav (32) and Mohammad Monazir (37), and 24 unknown people in connection with the attack. “Rahul and Monazir were arrested on Sunday. Preliminary investigations revealed that the incident was the fallout of a road rage case,” the SP said. Dhillon said Rahul’s wife had died a few days back and her ‘shraadh’ rituals were performed on Saturday. “Rahul’s brother-in-law had gone to the market in a car for some work. His seven-year-old son was also accompanying him. The MLA’s SUV was parked on the road in front of the CPM office. Rahul’s brother-in-law honked several times and requested the MLA’s men to clear the road. The two sides later entered into an altercation,” the SP said. He added Rahul’s maternal aunt, Soni Devi, has lodged a counter FIR against the MLA’s bodyguard and driver, alleging that they thrashed the child and Rahul’s brother-in-law. SHO (incharge) of Samastipur Town police station Sunil Kumar said the polve have started an investigation into the incident. Meanwhile, CPI and CPM supporters blocked Patel Chowk in Samastipur on Sunday for more than two hours to protest against the incident. CPI state secretary Ram Naresh Pandey has condemned the attack, saying law and order has collapsed in the state. This is the second attack on the MLA in a month. On May 2, he had lodged an FIR with Ujiyarpur police station in Samastipur against two persons, accusing them of trying to attack him after intercepting his SUV in Jogipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cpm-mla-survives-murderous-attack/articleshow/83095951.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While the first round of screening was conducted by more than 200 Anganwadi workers, now the corporation has engaged paid volunteers for the job.Though the Anganwadi workers have covered 7.82 lakh people in the city, mostly in the vulnerable wards, around 650 volunteers will cover all the 65 wards including those covered by the workers in first-level screening.According to Trichy Corporation, 337 teams have identified 796 fever cases and 82 people having saturated oxygen levels below 94. The teams equipped with pulse oximeters and thermal scanners had covered only the most vulnerable and moderate vulnerable wards. As all the 65 wards started recording multiple cases in the past week, the civic body launched the second round of screening. The volunteers will cover the vulnerable streets on priority followed by other localities. One ward each in all the four zones will be covered every day by volunteers who are divided into 20 teams per zone.“One volunteer will cover 50 houses each day. Sanitation officers will intervene and check the vitals of the residents if they were not cooperating with the volunteers,” R Vinoth, assistant commissioner, said. The civic body has arranged a vehicle to shift the residents with symptoms to the Covid care centre at Sethurapatti.As the Anganwadi workers, mostly women, were from rural areas and were without personal vehicles, the screening process was slow, officials said. They will be paid Rs 500 per day as an incentive.In the first level screening, a maximum number of fever cases were identified in the Srirangam zone (464 cases), while the K Abishekapuram zone identified a maximum number of cases with low oxygen level (50 cases). Across Trichy district, similar doorstep screening has identified 120 potential positive cases. A total of 1,604 teams surveyed 14 rural blocks in the district in the last two weeks. Health officials said that screening in remote hamlets helped early detection of cases during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-to-screen-one-ward-in-a-zone-daily/articleshow/83099604.cms||Deepak Karthik

We should be prepared to face such an eventuality. Hence, we have urged the Centre to grant permission to commence vaccine production at the Integrated Vaccine Complex (IVC) in Chengalpet,” he said.Accompanied by health minister Ma Subramanian, Stalin, who inspected Covid treatment facilities in Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore, told reporters they are awaiting response from the Centre on operationalising IVC set up by HLL BioTech, a central PSU.Reiterating his request to grant permission for vaccine production by TN government at the IVC, Stalin said that they have urged the Centre either to commence vaccine production or handover it to the state government. “The Centre said they will respond in a week.”Stalin visited a Covid ward at ESI Hospital donning a PPE suit and interacted with patients earlier in the day. The government is handling the Covid crisis in an efficient manner and has kept the daily cases at a maximum of 36,000 compared to Karnataka, which peaked with 50,000 cases and Kerala with 44,000 cases, he said. TN has the highest number of oxygen-equipped beds and the vaccination pace is also the highest, Stalin said. “Because of the tight lockdown, Covid cases have come down. Particularly in Chennai, there is a significant drop while in few more districts, it’s coming down gradually.”Noting that Coimbatore overtook Chennai in new daily cases, Stalin said that because of the government’s efforts, Covid numbers are coming down in Coimbatore also. He attributed interstate movement of people in Coimbatore, presence of numerous industries and a large number of guest workers for the high number of cases here.Stalin strongly rejected the charges that Coimbatore is being given step-motherly treatment. “The highest number of vaccinations – 5.85 lakh - were done in Coimbatore, next to Chennai. This government will work for those who voted for us and those who didn’t,” he said adding that he had visited Coimbatore twice in the last 10 days and the health minister was camping here for the last two days. There are 4,009 oxygen beds in Coimbatore and more Covid care facilities are being created, he added.Health minister Ma Subramanian who accompanied the CM said the state is running short of vaccines. “So far, we have received 96 lakh vaccine doses, of which 83 lakh were provided by the Centre meant for those above 45 years of age while 13 lakh doses were procured by TN for those in the 18 to 44 years age bracket. We administered 86 lakh doses so far. For those under 44 years, we sought 25 lakh vaccines and paid money. Of that, we received only 13 lakh,” he said. The state is left with only one-and-a-half lakh doses meant for those above 45 years, the minister said. “As and when the Centre sends stocks, we will distribute to all districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/awaiting-centres-permission-for-vaccine-production-stalin/articleshow/83099645.cms||---

Chandrashekar Reddy, father of two and the family’s main breadwinner, is barely able to sit up now after over a month. Doctors say a complete recovery could take more than six months, a second brain surgery and intensive physiotherapy. Reddy’s case, however, is not rare. Doctors have increasingly been seeing cases of stroke and heart attacks in patients who are recuperating or have recovered from Covid. In the second wave, doctors are particularly seeing a delayed presentation of these complications — sometimes up to 2 months after the patient has been discharged from hospital. Worryingly, neurologists say the high incidence of stroke is also seen in patients battling mucormycosis, the invasive fungal disease. The state Covid taskforce has also asked doctors to focus on post-Covid cerebrovascular complications. Dr Viswanathan Iyer, a brain and spine surgeon who operated on Reddy, said it was his fourth such surgery since the end of April. In Reddy’s case, he had to perform a decompression surgery since there was a large clot on the right side of the brain. The surgery is done to remove the bone and give space to accommodate brain swelling. “The systemic inflammation sends the body in some kind of hypercoagulable state, where the blood thickens, making the patient prone to suffer from a stroke,” he said. Covid pandemic in India live updatesAt KEM Hospital, neurologist Dr Nitin Dange said they have seen over 20 cases of strokes, heart attacks and aggravation of deep vein thrombosis in patients who have recovered from Covid. “We have seen it mostly in those who had moderate to severe Covid, but even people without comorbidities and from younger age groups have come after 2 months of recovery from Covid,” he said. At KEM, he said, a big percentage of mucormycosis patients have come with stroke. “Eizther the fungus itself messes with the blood circulation. Or once it reached the carotid artery (neck vessel), it compresses it causing a stroke,” he said.

A surgery was done to relieve the swelling, but he went on ventilator subsequently and succumbed two days later. Cardiologist Dr Brian Pinto recalled the case of a nonagenarian priest who suffered from a heart attack a few months after recovering from Covid. “We have seen at least 20 such cases since last year. The inflammation caused by Covid takes long to settle during which patients need the support of antiplatelet and anticoagulants for at least 2-3 months,” he said. Head of cardiology at KEM Dr Prafulla Kerkar said those who had moderate to severe Covid with elevated CRP, D-Dimer and IL6 levels should get anticoagulants and antiplatelets post-discharge.

The students said they did not have the textbooks to prepare for the exam and their process would start with purchasing the books if they were to appear for the exam. Students also said the state board should announce a proper module based on which the questions in the entrance test would be conducted. The state board students will have an upper hand against non-state board students, school teachers felt. Arnika Sheth, a CBSE student of Std X, said, “There has to be some uniformity in conducting the exams. The board has academic experts and they can mix and match syllabus or use NCERT books for framing the entrance exam questions. It is not fair to the non-state board students.” Kaushal Thakre, another CBSE class X student, said, the aim of the entrance exam is to bring all students at par. “But, this exam looks very biased as the state government has already declared that the exam will be the basis of the SSC syllabus. There is no parity . I might as well take admission in my own school,” he said Many students from other boards have already confirmed their admissions in their schools for the junior college . A school principal said, “The schools that have junior colleges have already started confirming admissions and many students have also paid the fees. The entrance exam decision has not gone down too well with these students so they preferred to continue with their schools. I fear the number of students migrating to state board junior colleges from CBSE, ICSE and other boards will be lesser compared to the previous years.” Anandita Banerjee, a parent of Std X ICSE student, said, “We decided to confirm the admission for our son in the same school he was studying in as the process for the state board admissions will take very long. Their results will be declared after one month and post that the process will be scheduled. His school will begin classes in a few days.” Another parent, Rashmi Kale, said her son was studying in an ICSE school in the city and the school had conducted an entrance test for Std XI admissions based on the same syllabus he had studied in Std X. “If he decides to shift to the state board college he will have to undergo the hassle of studying SSC syllabus and he is in no mood. So it was best to confirm the admissions with the school because its time saving and online everywhere,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-syllabus-for-fyjc-test-worries-other-board-pupils/articleshow/83104614.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Lifting of Chanda liquor ban prompts similar debate in Gadchiroli||NAGPUR: Lifting of the six-year-old liquor ban in Chandrapur district has triggered a debate around the suitability of a similar action in tribal-dominated Gadchiroli. In 1993, liquor was banned from Gadchiroli following a prolonged mass movement. State relief and rehabilitation minister and Congress MLA Vijay Wadettiwar has now stated his intention to lift the liquor ban in Gadchiroli too. He was the key force behind revocation of the prohibition order in Chandrapur earlier this week, which had been brought into force by the preceding BJP-led government. Wadettiwar said the liquor ban in Gadchiroli was being supported by activists driven by vested interests. “These social workers do not have the masses’ support and have not contributed in any way towards the progress of the district,” he said to a media channel. “The guardian minister must constitute a committee to assess the ground situation and try to pay heed to the public opinion on the ban,” Wadettiwar said in the interview. Padma Shri and Maharashtra Bhushan Dr Abhay Bang said Gadchiroli, Wardha and Chandrapur constituted a zone where liquor was banned. “The prohibitions in the three districts were introduced following a lengthy mass movement as men got drunk and women suffered. The tribal people of Gadchiroli and Chandrapur had demanded the liquor ban for the protection of women and welfare of their families,” he said. Bang, who is the founder of ‘SEARCH’ NGO in Gadchiroli, added that surveys showed there was a reduction in the consumption of liquor by 70%, saving around Rs80 crore of the tribals’ money every year. “The prohibition was enforced in Chandrapur only half-heartedly. In order to earn Rs200 crore revenue, the people of Chandrapur will now be made to cough up Rs2,000 crore through legal and illicit liquor sale,” he said. Dr Bang and his team had been vigorously campaigning for an alcohol-free society in the tribal district. Activist Devaji Tofa, who had championed the gram sabha movement in the district, said lifting the ban would only fill the coffers of the politicians and liquor businessmen but will do no good to the tribal. “The women would face the brunt of liquor being freely available,” he said.  Senior Congress leader Saguna Talandi said liquor consumption is an established tradition in tribal culture, especially during crucial events and celebrations. “Illicit liquor trade and black-marketing is increasing. There is least domestic violence in the tribal society under the influence of alcohol,” she added. Former medical officer at the Gadchiroli government hospital and incumbent BJP MLA Dr Deorao Holi said black-marketing of liquor is a genuine issue. “A study group must be formed to analyse the implementation of the liquor ban and its outcomes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lifting-of-chanda-liquor-ban-prompts-similar-debate-in-gchiroli/articleshow/83097730.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Ahmedabad||To quell mucormycosis fear, 80-year-old kills self in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: An 80-year-old man from Paldi, who had contracted Covid four months ago, has committed suicide by consuming poison because he was terrified of getting mucormycosis. According to Paldi police, Niranjan Patel died on Saturday, two days after he took poison on the terrace of his flat in Aman Apartments on Narayannagar Road in Paldi on May 27. That was the day he turned 80. Inspector J M Solanki of Paldi police said that Patel was living with his wife Pushpa, 78. Their two sons — Bhavesh and Utsav — have been living in Mumbai and the US respectively for around a decade. “He got infected with Covid about four months ago and recovered in a month or so,” said Solanki. “As he was also suffering from diabetes and had cholesterol problems, he feared he would not survive a mucormycosis attack.” Solanki said that this tormenting apprehension emerged after Patel found some white spots and fungal infection on his scalp which he self-diagnosed as mucormycosis. “After he consumed a pesticide, he was taken to a private hospital in Paldi where he died on Saturday,” said Solanki. He said that a complaint of accidental death has been registered with Paldi police and further investigation is under way. The investigating officer of the case, head constable Jagdish Chaudhary, said that a suicide note has been recovered from Patel’s pocket. It said that the reason behind the suicide was the terror of the prospect of getting mucormycosis. Chaudhary said that Patel’s son Bhavesh has rushed home for the last rites of his father. Mucormycosis has emerged as one of the most dreaded diseases amid the corona pandemic, especially in the second wave. According to the latest available records, Gujarat has the second highest cases of mucormycosis in India, at 2,800. Maharashtra has the highest tally of cases and deaths. Experts say that mucormycosis has unleashed a wave of anxiety and panic among corona patients due to its high morbidity and mortality. Patients have to undergo painful eye removal, jaw removal, and sinus surgeries. Medication for the fungal disease is also extremely expensive with a basic three-week treatment course running into Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. Ultimately, with surgery and hospital bills, patients stare at lakhs of rupees in bills and months of extreme suffering. “Many Covid patients call us asking if they are at risk of getting mucormycosis and desperately seek measures to prevent it,” said a senior doctor. “There is extreme panic associated with the disease.” Dr Bela Prajapati, head of the ENT department at Civil Hospital and a member of the state-appointed task force on mucormycosis, said that mucormycosis should not be the reason for someone to end life. “The key is to identify the onset early, and start treatment immediately. The recovery rate is low, but on the other hand many get discharged with recovery, too. Kindly don’t diagnose it yourself and take an expert opinion,” she said. Dr Girish Parmar, dean of the Government Dental College and a member of the mucormycosis task force, said that on Sunday they discharged nine patients. “Multiple factors contribute to the severity of fungal infection, and its impact is not uniform for all. Rather than being afraid of it, the need of the hour is to be aware of its symptoms and take due precautions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/to-quell-mm-fear-80-year-old-kills-self/articleshow/83097756.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Focus on kids: Ahmedabad gets ready for possible third wave||AHMEDABAD: As Ahmedabad continues to grapple and come to terms with the onslaught of the Covid second wave, the spectre of a potential third wave affecting children is haunting city doctors and the administration. The Academy of Paediatrics, Ahmedabad, and the state government in its road map to meet third wave emergencies is setting up a control room and a dashboard exclusively for children to help parents navigate the pandemic — right from availability of beds, Covid medicines, oxygen cylinders to concentrator availability. “The control room will be managed by a non-government organization along with government officials and the admission will be done by this control room only so that the parents do not have to run from one hospital to another,” said Sunil Patel, the president, AOP, Ahmedabad. He further said that the control room will have real time data of the availability of the beds in the hospitals. In the private hospital set up, there are 20 hospitals with paediatric units that are equipped with 100 ventilators, 200-odd ICU and about 500 NICU. In the municipal set up, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials claim that Shardaben Hospital alone has 60 paediatrics beds and 15 NICU beds, while LG and SVP also have 90 paediatrics beds each. Sources in the AOP said that about 0.3% children in the first wave by September were tested positive and in the recent wave, this number increased to around 3%. However, the mortality among children was much less as compared to adults. A senior AMC official told TOI that along with private hospitals there will be around 1,200 to 1,300 beds in the ICU and NICU. The control room will ensure that parents will be advised hospitals which are in close vicinity of their homes, only in the case of emergencies will a child be admitted to a hospital in another area. Patel said that as soon as the control room gets a call, AMC-run Sanjivani vans will be sent to the residence and the child will be checked and, if required, the doctor accompanying the van will recommend the control room for admission and if not the parents will be counselled and assured. Dr Hetal Vora, who is a paediatrician and superintendent of Shardaben Hospital, said, “90% of the children are asymptomatic and the remaining too have moderate symptoms. Only one percent have severe symptoms which is quite less as compared to adults. The city has about 15% to 20% population who can be categorized in the category of paediatrics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/focus-on-kids-ahmedabad-gets-ready-for-possible-third-wave/articleshow/83097949.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM asks people to create, expand Covid-free zones||MUMBAI: Anticipating a third wave of Covid-19, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that lockdown-like restrictions would continue till 7 am on June 15. Considering the high positivity rare in rural parts, Thackeray launched an initiative called ‘Covid-free village’ for rural areas and ‘Covid-free house or settlement’ for urban areas. “In this, we have to work hard to make every house, settlement, village, taluka, district and subsequently the state Covid-free,” he said. He urged the Centre to arrive at a uniform policy for Class XII exams as it was an important stepping stone for higher studies. In a 45-minute address to the state, the chief minister touched on various issues, from the current situation in the second wave to the anticipated third wave and how it would affect children, from vaccination programmes for the age group of 18-45 to HSC exams, and from education amid the pandemic to the need for lockdown-like restrictions. The chief minister said Covid-19 cases were under control but had not yet vanished. He said there were 24,886 new cases detected in the state during last year’s peak from September 17 to 19, while this year the number of cases registered on May 26 was 24,752 despite the daily case count having dropped from its high of over 70,000. “A good sign is that the recovery rate was 78% last year while now it is 92%. Though the cases in urban areas are reducing, the cases in rural parts are a cause for concern. And the experts are anticipating the third wave. In this situation it is very painful to impose the restrictions, but it is a tough and unpleasant decision I had to take,” said Thackeray.

---||Pune||Collaboration is key, Pune model for Covid-19 response shows how||From the Wright brothers to Watson and Crick who studied the structure of the DNA, collaborations have always played an integral role in development. In a pandemic such as Covid-19, it is imperative to have collaboration between governments, between sectors and between all stakeholders as it is the key to progress. The Pune Platform for Covid Response (PPCR), also based on collaboration, is among the unparalleled initiatives providing quick solutions to support the government in containing the Covid-19 virus. The platform, anchored by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), comprises over 250 private and government hospitals, 10 government offices, 150 corporates and 50 members from the non-profit sector. It has worked with government officials at the local, state, and national level since the outbreak and through the second wave to reduce the distress patients, their families, and the healthcare system faces. The group identified the availability of doctors and other healthcare personnel, well-managed and equipped hospitals, service to society and philanthropy from citizens and organizations as key to managing a public health crisis. Dialogue is key to collaboration. Boundaries must be broken for open discussions and teamwork encouraged. The role of the government must be that of an enabler, and the power of citizens and NGOs must be harnessed. In the past 14 months, the platform raised funds, channelled resources, distributed ration kits, arranged for ventilators, BiPAP machines, trained medical staff and counseled citizens, filling the gaps in the healthcare system. It helped increase the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients by 60% and trebled the number of ventilators available. Twelve oxygen generator plants with a combined ability to produce 12 tonnes a day were facilitated, helping Pune, one of the worst-hit cities, manage the oxygen shortage situation. This contribution ensured that there were no accidents or deaths due to lack of oxygen. Pune’s capacity of ventilators, ICUs, and Covid-19 beds in hospitals now equals that of Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai despite the low number of government hospitals and state-run facilities. The group has helped arrange for 1,000 ventilators, 150 high flow nasal oxygen machines, 12,000 units of blood through donation drives, 53,000 oximeters, 50,000 PPE kits and 3,20,000 masks till date. Two Covid-care facilities with a combined capacity of 1,000 patients, and support management of a 24-hour call centre for patients and families, bed management software, and the distribution of 14.71 lakh meals was also initiated by the platform. Pune is among the cities with the highest number of Covid-19 beds recording a 700% increase in capacity and a 435% increase in ventilator capacity when compared with the last year. Today, Pune district is able to cater to thousands of patients from rural and peripheral areas as well. As the impact of the second wave worsened across the country, the platform launched ‘Mission Vayu’, one of the largest civic-led initiatives, supported by MNCs, foundations and members. It helped procure and donate BiPAP machines and oxygen concentrators to the worst-hit areas across the country. Along with several national and international partners, the group deployed 7,800 oxygen concentrators, 875 ventilators and 50,000 oximeters to other districts in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, West Bengal, and Karnataka. We could also deploy equipment worth Rs 200 crore across India since the pandemic broke out. Over the last three months, these efforts have expanded from Pune to 30 other districts in Maharashtra and now supports many other states. The group hopes to make Pune the country’s first Covid-19 death-free city by getting the eligible population vaccinated with a target of inoculating one lakh individuals every day. Pune was among the first cities to reach 87,000 vaccinations a day and to immunise 70% in the 45+ age group. We plan to procure 50 lakh doses for those in the 18-44 age group soon. We hope to overcome the remaining challenges of the second wave and prepare for a potential third wave. A proposal on several factors has been made. The government’s policies on vaccination strategies, lockdown and movement guidelines, testing strategy, and supply chain must be looked into. More research on new variants, long-term protective immune response and vaccination is necessary. Strategies on manufacturing liquid oxygen plants and tankers, O2 concentrators, O2 cylinders and BiPAPs should be developed. A focus on makeshift hospitals, ICUs, vaccination centres, and cold storage for vaccines is needed. The safety of the frontline personnel and children and the impact on their education and mental health should be ensured to minimize the damage. Pune’s success in creating the largest bed capacity in the country is due to the addition of hundreds of private hospitals who joined forces to fight Covid-19. We encourage other districts to bring stakeholders together to manage the pandemic. The pandemic is here for a long time, and such models must be replicated in every city and by every state to fight it. Our platform’s strategies addressed its immediate and short-term impacts, introducing interventions for resilience in the medium to long-term. Such models and efforts ensure better facilitation of resources by mobilising all the stakeholders to protect lives and livelihoods.

The Pune cantonment digitized records from June 1, 1960, while its Khadki and Dehu Road counterparts have done so for the period between January 1, 1981, and April 30, 2021. The defence ministry had told all 62 cantonment boards to carry out the exercise. The certificates would be made soon downloadable for the residents in need of the documents for various purposes.Pune Cantonment Board chief executive officer (CEO) Amit Kumar said, “We have digitized over 2 lakh certificates and another 20,000 are being digitized before the June 15 deadline, when we plan to start online issuance of these documents. An applicant will have to submit specific information on the website, make an online payment of Rs50 and then download the certificate.”He added, “Since our physical records till 1960 are in good condition, we digitized additional documents. We had to rope in private staffers to complete the task.” Khadki Cantonment Board CEO Pramod Kumar Singh, “The digitized documents will not only be useful for the civil population but also for the armed forces personnel who continuously get transferred. They face a lot of difficulties in getting these certificates, especially birth certificates of their children.” The Khakdi Cantonment Board has digitised over 60,000 such certificates till date. R Haritwal, CEO of Dehu Road Cantonment Board, said, “We have digitized over 40,000 certificates and completed the task before the deadline. People need these certificates for various purposes.”Meanwhile, citizens have said the system needed to be foolproof. Rajabhau Chavan, a resident of the PCB area, said, “The system will certainly provide respite to thousands of people in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-cantts-digitise-over-3l-birth-death-certificates/articleshow/83097867.cms||Sandip Dighe

A total of 253 beds in 20 hospitals will cater to paediatric cases. These include two hospitals in Bavla, five hospitals each in Dholka and Daskroi, three hospitals in Sanand, four in Viramgam and a hospital in Mandal taluka. In all, 50 ventilators and 50 BiPAP machines are provisioned along with portable X-Ray machines for each of the taluka medical circle. A panel of 14 paediatric experts will be attending to cases, including cases making doctors apprehensive like the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). These doctors will be assisted by 36 AYUSH doctors that have been line-listed and will be trained in basics. “Another crucial task apart from infrastructure is that our paramedics will be trained by child specialists to treat children with Covid,” says DDO, Ahmedabad, Arun Mahesh Babu. he adds, “Since children can’t be left alone and need attendants or either of the parents, it is important that a facility with enough space is available, which is also a concern for us,” explains Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/next-6-weeks-crucial-abad-district-shoring-up-defences/articleshow/83097916.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: We get 2-3 black fungus cases daily, says ENT surgeon||MUMBAI: ENT surgeon Dr Nishit Shah has underscored the need to ramp up the supply of anti-fungal medicines to tackle the escalating cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, in the city. “The situation is deeply worrying. We get two to three cases every day at our centre (in Bombay Hospital) that need to be operated upon, and phone calls are far too many,” Dr Shah told TOI on Sunday. Till last week, the disease has affected close to 5,500 peop-le across the country and claimed 126 lives, including 90 in the state, according to reports. Urging Mumbaikars not to panic, Dr Shah said, “Scanning of patients...and medical follow-up will help tide over the crisis. Surgery is as important as medication to contain mucormycosis.” Citizens should promptly seek medical assistance in the wake of symptoms like cheek swelling or pressure on eyes, he added. Describing the sudden upsurge in mucormycosis as “astonishing”, Dr Shah said, “It’s a tad strange that black fungus is confined to India.” Pointing out that the disease was detected chiefly among Covid-19 patients who may have been administered steroids not under medical supervision, he said: “Heavy steroids and high sugar level is a lethal combination. It could trigger black fungus. The authorities need to ensure that steroids are administered under strict medical supervision. Also patients’ sugar level should be closely monitored.” Stating that Maharashtra government and BMC were “adequately responsive” to the enormity of mucormycosis, Dr Shah said shortage of medicine was a matter of concern. The Maharashtra government has urged the Centre to provide adequate quota of anti-fungal injections to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-we-get-2-3-black-fungus-cases-daily-says-ent-surgeon/articleshow/83099872.cms||Ambarish Mishra

Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja on Sunday said that it was clear from the facts revealed about the medical kits being given to Corona patients that there is a something dubious in the announcement made by the government. The government should make complete details and accounts of medical kits public, she said. Selja said that on May 8, the Haryana government had announced that a medical kit worth Rs 5,000 would be given to patients who are undergoing treatment in home isolation. She said the Sirsa administration is also distributing medical kit is priced at Rs 815. Selja also alleged that the medical kits, which are being distributed by the government, are not reaching the patients. If this medical kit was reaching the patients, social organisations would not have to distribute the medical kit to Covid patients, she said. The Congress leader also accused the state government of directly benefiting Patanjali, when questions were already being raised on its kit. When the BJP-JJP government in Haryana has already said that Covid cases are decreasing rapidly, then why is it buying so many kits, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-kits-are-not-reaching-patients-in-haryana-says-congress/articleshow/83097880.cms||---
---||India||IIIT-D students’ app boosts chances of getting a jab||A bot developed by two students of the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology in Delhi, sends alerts to users about open slots on the CoWin app, thus improving the chances of successfully booking a slot. Launched on May 4, the bot has garnered 60,000 users since. Developed by Rohan Rajpal and Paras Mehan, ‘CoWin Alerts’ is a Telegram bot — therefore, can only be used with Telegram app — that alerts you whenever there is an open vaccine slot for your dose and age group. When the government opened registrations for vaccination of 18-44 age group on the CoWin app, users faced a lot of technical challenges in booking a slot. Since the volume of users was so high, slots were getting filled within seconds of opening up leaving users frustrated. The trick was knowing when a centre would open up slots and book it right then. “I decided to develop an alerts bot when I faced problems booking slots on the CoWin app once the vaccination for 18+ started on May 1. I was spending my entire day on the site to book a slot but with no success. “That’s when I thought why not have a system that will send you an alert every time a slot opens up,” said Rajpal, who has just finished his fourth year B.Tech computer science and will soon join Goldman Sachs. Rajpal started work on this potential solution, developed the bot in two days, and released it on May 4. Mehan joined him once the user base started to increase. “This app is a Telegram bot which asks you questions like which district you want, what’s your age, it’s like filling a Google form. It takes in this information and notifies the user when the slots are available,” explained Mehan. TOI tried out the app and started getting periodic alerts about open slots in different centres in a given pin code. Like CoWin Alerts, there are more Telegram bots that are helping users book their slots by sending alerts. Rajpal and Mehan said that one of the technical challenges they are facing right now is that the CoWin app is not getting updated in real time. “In Delhi, the government is closing vaccination but the website is taking time to get updated. It’s still showing available slots. So, the bot keeps sending alerts for slots which are not there. Some of our users are booking and getting cancellation notice,” said Rajpal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iiit-d-students-app-boosts-chances-of-getting-a-jab/articleshow/83102523.cms||Shobita Dhar

Senior police inspector Meghshyam Dange of Kothrud police station said, “We have registered a NC under section 507 (Criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of Indian Penal Code. Prima facie, it is suspected that the duo prepared fake social media accounts and then posted threats against him.

The activist has questioned shortage of doses and paid inoculation when the government is yet to spend 87.18% of the funds. A resident of Mahal, Jabalpure had sought information related to payment disbursed to the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for procurement of vaccine doses under the RTI Act on rtionline.gov.in on May 27. He received information from the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on May 28. In its reply, the MoHFW said, “Initially, the government had procured vaccine from SII and Bharat Biotech under the PM Care Fund. 5.6 crore doses of Covishield at the rate of Rs 210 (Rs 200 for vaccine and 5% GST) and 1 crore doses of Covaxin at the rate of Rs 309.75 (Rs 295 for vaccine and 5% GST) were procured. The Union budget had made a provision of Rs 35,000 crore for vaccination in the 2021-22 fiscal. Rs 4,488.75 crore has been released for procurement of the Covid vaccine to HLL Lifecare Limited (Procurement agency for MoHFW) for 21 crore doses of Covishield from SII and 7.5 crore doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech at the rate of Rs 157.5 per dose (Rs 150 for vaccine and 5% GST). The process of procurement of Covid-19 vaccine and inoculation is going on.” Meanwhile, talking to TOI, Jabalpure said, “The Centre had announced vaccination for the 18-44 years age group from May 1. Thousands of people like me are eagerly waiting to take the jab to protect ourselves from the deadly disease. A few youngsters without any comorbidities died. The Centre had time and again announced that there was no shortage of doses in India. At the same time, the Centre spent only 12.82% of the total budgetary provision. Why is the Centre not utilizing the remaining funds and providing vaccine to all.” People in the age group of 18-44 years are paying around Rs 1,000 per dose and taking the jab at private hospitals in a few districts of the state. “Why is the Centre not utilizing the remaining funds and providing vaccine to all free of cost,” he said. Presenting the budget on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a provision of Rs 35,000 crore for the Covid vaccination programme. In a statement on May 3, the MoHFW said that the government paid Rs 2,520 crore of which Rs 1,732.50 crore to SII and Rs 787.50 crore to Bharat Biotech for supply of doses in May, June and July. As on May 28, the government had stated that it disbursed Rs 4,488.75 crore to HLL Lifecare Limited for procurement of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs4-5k-cr-of-rs35k-cr-spent-activist-questions-lack-of-doses-paid-jabs/articleshow/83097875.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The daily positivity rate continued to hover over 4%. In comparison, Delhi’s positivity is now down to 1.19%. Mumbai’s overall caseload has now reached 7,04,622. Civic officials said that nearly 25,000 tests were carried out on Sunday. On a positive note, deaths continued to slide, with 22 fatalities recorded on Sunday, down from 25 on Saturday and 30 on Friday. The city has lost 14,797 people to Covid since the start of the pandemic. State officials said that the decline in cases was seen despite over 2.52 lakh tests being carried out on Sunday. Maharashtra has carried out over 2.6 lakh tests on an average daily in the past week, although in several districts the proportion of antigen tests has steadily risen to 70%. Active cases in the state have dropped under 2,71,801, while in Mumbai to 28,000. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that though Covid cases are currently under control, every precaution must be taken to avoid a surge.

Though the cases in urban areas are reducing, the cases in rural parts are cause for concern,” he said, adding that discharges have crossed 53.62 lakh. The CM said that since experts are anticipating a third wave, some restrictions will have to continue. “It is painful to impose the restrictions, but it is a tough and unpleasant decision I had to take,” said Thackeray. Deaths continue to be a cause for worry, say experts, who add that attention must be paid to post-Covid complications. As many as 402 deaths were reported on Sunday, while another 412 previous unreported deaths were added to the cumulative Covid toll for Maharashtra that now stands at 94,844. This was the eight day in a row that the state added old deaths that occurred weeks ago. Of the 412 such deaths, 68 were from Pune, 54 from Latur, 40 in Palghar, 29 in Nashik, among others.

However, only the boy lost his life. Jubilee Hills police said that the 17-year-old boy recently married the woman, who is associated with film industry. On Friday night, the couple consumed alcohol and decided to kill themselves as they felt that they were unable to do justice to their marriage. In the end, only the boy died by suicide as the woman backed out due to fear. The boy had recently visited his parents in Andhra Pradesh, and were reportedly upset about his marriage. Following the wedding, the boy moved into his wife’s house in Yousufguda, where the incident took place. The boy’s father did not prefer lodge a complaint against the woman.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Recording of ICU sounds signals survival||AHMEDABAD: Umang Shah still remembers the Covid ICU to which he was admitted, at a Vadodara hospital. He recalls the dimmed light. “The only sounds you hear, even when you are not able to move, are of the fellow patients’ laboured breathing and the beeps of ventilators and the occasional cries for help,” says Shah, an Ahmedabad-based award-winning industrial products designer. “I had recorded those sounds. Whenever I feel low, I listen to them to remind myself that I have come back from the brink, and this is a new beginning.” Shah goes on to say: “I would always wear masks and would be finicky about cleanliness.” He says the fastidiousness was necessary to protect his 71-year-old mother and three-and-a-half-year-old daughter back home. “But I tested positive on April 18. Subsequently my mother and wife Khushboo tested positive the same week,” says Shah. “My daughter was sent to my in-laws’ residence as a precaution. She also developed fever but it was controlled through medicines.” From April 25 to 28, Shah stayed at a Covid care centre in Ahmedabad, but with his oxygen levels dipping below 85% and IL6 as high as 71, he was recommended critical care treatment immediately. As his mother also showed 40% infection in the lungs, his friends and family frantically searched for two beds. Nothing was available in Ahmedabad. A Vadodara hospital came as a lifeline. “It’s on the mechanical ventilation that I saw my life in perspective,” Shah says. “I have several projects that have received national and international acclaim and I am also associated with names such as CIIE.CO at IIM-A and NID in different capacities.” He adds: “But at that moment, what kept me going was the yearning to get back to my family, especially my daughter.” After spending four days in the ICU, he was shifted to a normal room where he recuperated slowly for six days before he could head back home. His wife lived alone in isolation, praying for all family members — including her own parents who had tested positive. “We did not bring my daughter back for a week even after my return on May 6 fearing for her health,” says Shah. “She matured overnight to understand what was going on, and supported us fully.” Life has changed for Shah after the Covid experience. The focus is on the family. “I now consciously delegate duties, earmark family time, and also concentrate on my health,” he says. “The pandemic experience has also made me more compassionate and thankful to my friends and family members who stood by me during the most difficult of times.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/recording-of-icu-sounds-signals-survival/articleshow/83097910.cms||Parth Shastri

Based on the complaint of the girl’s parents, police have registered a rape case against the accused on Sunday. At 7 am on Saturday, according to police, the girl came on to the street. The accused, who befriended her during the past week, called her to his house offering a chocolate. “After the girl entered the house, the accused raped her. When the girl started screaming in pain, the accused quickly sent her out of his house. The victim who suffered pain through out the day, told her mother in the night about the rape. The victim’s mother confronted the accused and lodged a complaint with us on Sunday morning,” informed Saidabad inspector K Srinivas. The survivor’s mother works as a labourer and, based on her complaint, a case was registered against the accused under Section 376-AB of the Indian Penal Code, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC&ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

The civic body had on Friday announced that students who have been accepted to foreign universities can get vaccinated at three designated centres. The three centres, however, will be vaccinating merely a total of 150 people on Monday. Civic officials on Sunday announced that 50 doses each have been set aside for students at Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli, RN Cooper in Juhu and Rajawadi in Ghatkopar. Students can walk in from 10am to 3pm. They will have to produce an admission certificate and forms I-20/DS-160. Students took to Twitter seeking clarification on the 84-day gap between doses since many said their classes would start from August. Many questioned the decision to allocate only 150 doses. A civic official said the number could be increased looking at the response and stock position. On Monday, walk-ins will resume for the 45-plus and the differently-abled. BMC will also give the first dose to lactating mothers, who will have to produce documents with date of delivery. BMC is yet to clarify if those in the 18-44 age group, who are eligible for their second shot, can walk-in as well. The state on Saturday administered 2,99,571 doses, taking the total doses given to 2.2crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pupils-going-abroad-must-be-from-city-to-take-jab/articleshow/83099953.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Citizens buy delivery boy bike to replace torched one||PUNE: When life goes downhill, helping hands clear the path even in these unprecedented Covid-19 times, as Madhav Gaikwad (26), a food delivery executive, experienced. For no apparent rhyme or reason related directly to him, his motorcycle was set on fire on May 18 by a man in a case of mistaken identity. On Saturday, he got a brand new motorcycle when some Good Samaritans raised funds online in just two days to help Gaikwad earn a living. On completing the documentation and other formalities, Gaikwad was handed over the motorcycle in 10 days after his motorcycle was consumed by fire. TOI on May 21 had published a detailed report about how Gaikwad’s motorcycle was ravaged by the blaze. “I am happy that I can start work again now,” he told TOI. On May 18, Gaikwad had gone to a food joint to pick up his orders. At that time, he noticed a man arguing with a delivery person associated with the company where he works. An hour later he went back for another pick-up. While he was inside, the unknown person set his motorcycle on fire. Gaikwad filed an FIR with the Hinjewadi police. On reading about Gaikwad’s plight, Abhishek Bakshi, who works as a freelance corporate trainer, immediately started an online crowdfunding campaign. Another resident, Shehazad Lakhani, arranged for a motorcycle for Gaikwad to start his work till he got his new motorcycle. Bakshi told TOI, “I contacted Gaikwad to know the make of his damaged motorcycle. I then spoke to a few dealers and found out the cost of a new one. I appealed to people via the crowdfunding campaign. In just two days we could collect the amount required for purchasing the new motorcycle. It took two more days to complete the documentation and RTO formalities. On Saturday, we handed over the motorcycle to him.” Gaikwad thanked everyone who had helped him. “I have also got the box from the company to keep food parcels. On Sunday, we will perform the ‘puja’ and from Monday, I will be back at work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-buy-delivery-boy-bike-to-replace-torched-one/articleshow/83097989.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Delhi||Delhi: Corporations prepare groundwork for unlock||NEW DELHI: The civic bodies carried out intensive sanitisation drives in industrial areas during the weekend, prior to the opening of these areas on Monday as part of the gradual unlocking of the city. Teams of the maintenance department were given specific tasks to cover all industrial areas under their jurisdictions. “While the sanitisation drive will continue, we will conduct meetings with the industrial associations to spread awareness and make sure they follow the Covid-19 norms,” said Jai Prakash, the mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. It has also decided to identify and share a list of labour chowks and loading-unloading points with the Delhi Police so that they can help in preventing crowding of daily wagers or other workers at one point, Prakash added. Teams of domestic breeding checkers have also been formed to spray insecticides and control breeding of mosquitoes to prevent vector-borne diseases. “We started the drive from the Anand Parbat industrial area and covered Wazirpur, Bawana, Narela, Shahzada Bagh and Mundka, among others,” Jai Prakash said. On Sunday, the civic teams also visited some residential areas near Pul Bangash Metro station, carried fogging drives wherever required, met the residents of the area and distributed pamphlets. “We are taking every possible step to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and mosquito-breeding conditions. We are also sanitising residential areas with sprinkler tankers,” Jai Prakash added. In east Delhi, the Jhilmil industrial area was sanitised, while the Okhla industrial area, along with other residential neighbourhoods, were sanitised in south Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corporations-prepare-groundwork-for-unlock/articleshow/83096361.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mayor finds vax stored in ordinary fridge at hotel||MUMBAI: In a surprise check at a hotel offering a Covid vaccination package, mayor Kishori Pednekar on Sunday found vaccines stored in an ordinary fridge instead of specialised cold storage facilities that are needed to store the vaccines. Pednekar has asked BMC officials to check if the vaccination drive complied with all the norms and submit a detailed report. “There is a tie-up between the hotel and Criticare Hospital, which is the vaccinating agency. The hospital bought the vaccine doses as per the Central government rules but the BMC is not aware of this hotel vaccination centre. I’m concerned about the fridge where the vaccines were kept. If the temperature is not maintained, the vaccine may lose efficacy. Cold storage facilities were not properly maintained,” Pednekar said after visiting The Lalit Hotel in Andheri East. She said 500 people had already received their jabs at the hotel. The hotel management did not respond to a query from TOI. A statement issued by Criticare Hospital said the drive adhered to all protocols. “On May 22, we conducted a vaccination camp for employees of ICICI Bank. After attaining all the requisite approvals and permits, along with the mandated CVC code from BMC, we administered the vaccine to 750 employees at Lalit Hotel, a venue pre-decided by the organisation. The camp was organised following the required protocols and was fully equipped with all the necessary medical requirements. The vaccines were carefully carried and given to everyone with all the vital safety precautions. Criticare Hospital was not involved in any vaccination programme carried out in the hotel before or after May 22. As part of the medical fraternity, we understand the impetus to follow all the safety procedures and undertaking,” the statement read. Desperate to give their dwindling business a booster shot, hotels have jumped on to the vaccination bandwagon, offering a range of freebies and packages. However, the Central government has warned them against doing so. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had tweeted: “Hotels offering Covid-19 vaccination packages shall face strict legal action! Such activities are in contravention to rules under the national Covid vaccination programme and must cease immediately.” Pradeep Shetty, spokesperon for Hotel and Restaurant Association Western India (HRAWI) that comprises star hotels, said he was not aware of any member making such an offer.

---||Nagpur||Greens want night traffic ban, Tadoba installing 44 speed breakers to save wildlife||NAGPUR: Taking a cue from the hit-and-run case, in which dominant tiger Khali (T-50) was critically injured recently near Agarzari in the buffer zone of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), the park management is constructing speed breakers to slow down traffic. However, the greens have demanded that the forest officials should ban night traffic on the stretch. The road from Padmapur-Agarzari-Mohurli-Kondegaon is a 26km forest stretch of TATR with a rich wildlife presence. Several fatal incidents have taken place involving tigers, leopards, sloth bears, deer, and other species. The accident on May 8, involving nine-year-old Khali, triggered the decision to install breakers. The tiger was rescued the next day and dispatched to Gorewada Rescue Centre at Nagpur where it is battling for life. Immediately after the tiger case, on May 10, a spotted deer was also knocked dead near Padmapur. TATR deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad confirmed 44 speed breakers of 20cm height are being constructed in the 26km forest patch (one each in 1.6km) to avoid accidents. “Work is already underway. The earlier speed breakers were of 10cm height and not effective,” he said. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre says, “Even if the speed breakers are being built with good intentions, it is not a permanent solution. A few years ago a bison had died in a road hit by a vehicle from a resort on the same road, after which breakers were installed. But still there is no let-up in accidents. It is high time the management bans night traffic on the road between 7pm and 7am. Other measures include installing CCTV cameras at strategic points like Agarzari, Navargaon, and Mohurli so passing vehicles are recorded.” “Traffic can be banned for outsiders. Only bonafide residents must be allowed, besides medical emergencies. Locals should also support the decision in the interest of tigers, especially when tourism is a livelihood for many,” says Suresh Chopne of Green Planet Society, Chandrapur. Earlier, night traffic has been banned in wildlife areas. On July 16, 2015, Buldhana collector had banned night traffic from 10pm to 5am between Buldhana-Warvand-Botha-Khamgaon Road passing through Dnyanganga wildlife sanctuary. In Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR), Bhandara collector had on December 12, 2019, closed three roads passing through Koka wildlife sanctuary between 6pm and 6am. Also, vehicle speed was restricted to 20 kmph on these roads. “Even as wildlife continues to die in road hits, what is stopping Tadoba officials from banning night traffic? Is the resort lobby showing its political clout? When tourism is over by 6pm, why should tourists hang around till late night,” asked former honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel. DyCF Guruprasad says, “Earlier, we tried to close night traffic on the road but there were protests from locals. Besides, bonafide tourists arriving in resorts by late night trains or flights are allowed to enter through Padmapur gate.” “Locals are opposed to banning night traffic. The forest department has STPF and mobile squad, who should check those roaming at night and punish them. We are in favour of a night traffic ban,” said a resort owner from Mohurli. “These speed breakers are unscientific and will damage cars with low ground clearance. Forest officials should also ban eateries set up by locals near Agarzari. Tourists visit these small joints to have food and enjoy night safari,” some resort owners said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-want-night-traffic-ban-tadoba-installing-44-speed-breakers-to-save-wildlife/articleshow/83097996.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Officials on toes to enforce norms as industries brace for challenges||NEW DELHI: After almost a month and a half of a stringent lockdown imposed to curb the exponential growth of Covid cases in Delhi, the gradual unlocking process starts on Monday. After the evening and weekend lockdowns, a complete lockdown has been in place since April 19, which even saw Delhi Metro’s services getting suspended after initial restricted operations. Most restrictions, however, will continue as only factories and construction activities have been allowed to resume. Till 5am on Monday, construction work was allowed only where workers were residing on-site but now full-fledged construction activities can be started and workers travelling from other places will need e-passes to do so. Factories, however, were completely closed and will open after more than 40 days. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Friday that the easing of the lockdown would be carried out slowly and steadily as the Covid-19 situation had somewhat come under control after much effort. “We should not lose all the gains by suddenly opening up the lockdown,” he had said. In an order issued on Saturday, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had directed that the district magistrates should ensure that random RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests were carried out in sufficient numbers at the construction sites and the manufacturing units regularly. District officials said a large number of enforcement teams would also ensure following of Covid-appropriate behaviour by all workers and employees. “Each enforcement team will be responsible for monitoring four-five sites. Consolidated lists have been finalised with details of each site for every sub-division in each district. However, the actual scenario will be visible when things open up,” a district official said. “As more workers and employees will travel to these sites, applications for e-passes will be processed as swiftly as possible but by following the due process. Testing of those coming to these sites will be facilitated by district authorities in the best way possible,” he said. Navdeep Malhotra, president of Mayapuri Industrial Welfare Association, said the relaxation was notional as manufacturers had a limited inventory at the moment and, with retailers and suppliers of raw material, hardware, tools etc. not allowed to open yet, the production at optimum level won’t be possible. “Only 28 authorised industrial areas have been allowed to open and our vendors in different areas across the city remain closed. The markets from where we source different items for manufacturing should have been allowed to open, too, with social distancing in place,” he said. “This is a good step and since everything was closed, now we will be able to fulfil our commitments in a time-bound manner,” said Deepak Kapoor, a manufacturer of sanitary appliances and fittings based in east Delhi. He hoped that there wouldn’t be much problem in applying for e-passes for his workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/officials-on-toes-to-enforce-normsas-industries-brace-for-challenges/articleshow/83096335.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Religious heads guide critical patients on their final journey via video calls||MUMBAI: Death may be life’s eventual closure. But no one wants to die alone; not even those in the critical quarantined wards. With life at its tenterhooks, people have been turning to their gurus, religious heads and leading lights. The lockdown-like curbs have led to the shutdown of shrines and the family may not be by their bedside, but moments before the final goodbye and the eventual passing away are taking place in Zoom rooms. “People are dying alone. Many have unfulfilled desires, unfinished plans. They are scared. I advise them on video calls to maintain samatha bhaav (calm abiding) and ekagatta (tranquility of the mind),” said Jain monk Namramuniji Maharajsaheb. The Jain manglik, the most auspicious chant, is also recited. “I see them smile and many die within seconds. Sometimes I am in the middle of my chanting and the nurse interrupts me and asks me to stop,” he added. Close to 900 people have reached out to this monk for the last prayers over online video meetings. Acharya Vimalsagarji Maharajsaheb, who also receives calls from those who are anxious and unprepared for the impending final goodbye, said: “We make them realise that this is the time to break all bonds, to reflect back and apologise for hatred, revenge and any wrongdoing. They find a lot of peace in the prayers chanted on the call.” Babulal Jain, a veritable fount on information in Jainism, said, “Our monks cannot use mobile phones, but their followers are desperate and reaching out over video calls. With temples closed, monks have risen to this tough time...” The Church too has been receiving calls from families of critical patients. “Our priests have been conducting video prayer calls that are scheduled through the family. An ICU nurse takes the phone in. Some priests are visiting Covid ICUs with PPE kits on. We consider ourselves frontline workers available for the spiritual needs of people,” said Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Bombay. Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, who too gets calls from those nearing life’s closure, advises, “To take away the choppiness of death, one simple thing you can do is to have a lamp—preferably with ghee, but you can also use butter—burning 24 hours of the day next to that person...You can also set up some kind of a universal chant—something like Brahmananda Swarupa—at a very mild volume. A consecrated sound like this in the background will also make sure that choppy withdrawal can be avoided.” Sikhs families with critically ill patients reach out to their religious heads and special prayers are conducted in the gurudwara premises. Convenor of Maharashtra Sikh Association Bal Malkit Singh said, “While there is no video call or Zoom sessions, the family members recite the soothing Waheguru Simran paath.” Maulana Khalilur Rahman Noorie said when the masjid is contacted regarding a critically ill patient, the name is mentioned in the prayers and “dua karte hai ki dava kaam kare”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-religious-heads-guide-critical-patients-on-their-final-journey-via-video-calls/articleshow/83100042.cms||Hemali Chhapia

It had then reserved its judgment on May 17 on the joint plea by Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi, who had contended that the project was not an essential activity and could be put on hold for the time-being.During the May 17 hearing, the Centre had termed the plea as a “facade” aimed at stalling the project and questioned the timing of the move.The petitioners on the other hand maintained they were only interested in the safety of workers at the site and citizens living in the area. Hard hitting arguments against the maintainability of the plea were made during the hearing.Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited, which has been awarded the tender for the project, had also opposed the plea, saying it lacks bonafide and the company was taking care of its workforce.Terming the Central Vista project as “central fortress of death” and comparing it to “Auschwitz”, the petitioners’ counsel Sidharth Luthra had contended that the Centre’s claim on the availability of medical facilities, testing centre and other amenities on the site were all false.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, however, had taken strong exceptions to the project being dubbed as “Auschwitz” and said “one can criticise and be venomous” about it, but such terms should not be used in courtrooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-decide-today-if-work-can-go-on/articleshow/83096381.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Chalk & cheese: Delhi school turns classrooms into Covid care centre||NEW DELHI: To combat a possible third wave of the pandemic, another private school in the city has transformed its classrooms into a Covid care centre for frontline workers, government officers and their families. GD Goenka School in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj has set up two oxygen-equipped beds in each of the 30 classrooms of the junior wing. The school has partnered with NGOs Sewa Bharti and Seema Jagran Manch to manage and run the care centre. Currently, there are five patients under observation there. For now, two doctors and four nurses have been deputed there. Earlier, Mount Carmel School in Dwarka had set up a facility with oxygen-equipped beds after it lost its founder VK William to Covid-19. Nipun Goenka, the managing director of the GD Goenka Group, told TOI, “Our school is fully air-conditioned, so it will be comfortable for patients. We have also provided space for infirmary, cafeteria, 24x7 electricity, water and security service. We also have an ambulance with oxygen support and a driver to help those in need.” The centre is for those showing mild symptoms of Covid and patients requiring oxygen support under medical supervision. “We thank the frontline workers for their untiring efforts in fighting the raging pandemic. They have been performing their duties 24x7, putting themselves and their families at great risk. This is why we have decided to extend our help to them,” Goenka explained. On Friday, a blood donation camp was also conducted at the school in which over 50 units were collected. A team from All India Institute Of Medical Sciences consisting of two doctors, four nurses and paramedics assisted in the initiative. “As true educationists, our management has always taken initiatives to contribute constructively and meaningfully towards the needs of the community and country in the true spirit of service,” Goenka said. Goenka added that, if required, the capacity of the Covid care centre would be enhanced. “Even if the board exams are held, there won’t be any problems. The centre is in the junior wing and it doesn’t seem that classes will resume without the children being vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chalk-cheese-school-turns-classrooms-into-covid-care-centre/articleshow/83096393.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||Smells like team spirit: Chefs prepare a charity mix||NEW DELHI: Chef and food consultant Ruchira Hoon saw a lot of her friends and relatives scrambling for oxygen and hospital beds over last few days. Her social media timeline was also full of NGOs requesting for funds. Hoon felt the best she could do was use her culinary skills to contribute. She started hosting online cooking workshops, teaching people to prepare dishes using her recipes. So far, she has raised Rs 70,000. She eventually hopes to raise over a lakh rupees and donate the same to collectives like Mission Oxygen and Friendicoes. Chef Anahita Dhondy Bhandari felt one of the best ways to celebrate her birthday would be to help people of Uttarakhand as the state is not only battling coronavirus spread badly but so many chefs who work in professional kitchen come from there. Dhondy decided to host an online session where she would teach childhood favourite dishes that her mother would make on her birthday. The class featuring demos and recipes of he Mom's choclate cake, selection of old school sandwiches and Parsi croquettes raised over Rs 1.5 lakh for Kalap Trust in Uttarakhand. Many other chefs and food platforms are conducting online workshops to raise funds for Covid relief. This has become a novel way for chefs to showcase their skills, raise awareness about the pandemic and, in the process, raise funds. For the participants and donors, it is an engaging activity where they learn a new dish or skill and are also able to donate for a cause. Shruti Jain of Kaze Living, an online marketplace for artisan Indian brands that hosted one such workshop, says since they have many homegrown products on their site, they thought it will be a good idea to get some of their partners to host workshops showcasing their craft. Jain says her pasta-making sessions, priced at Rs 1,000 each, had 35 ‘active’ participants seriously sit through an engaging two-hour session, learning new recipes and also contributing to a cause. Buoyed by the response to first session, the proceeds of which went to Hemkunt Foundation, Jain hopes her next session on kimchi will be a bigger draw. “Our aim is to have sessions on making seemingly difficult things, such as pasta and kimchi, with simple ingredients available at home,” she says. In the current backdrop, nutrition consultant and blogger Sangeeta Khanna has seen a keen interest among participants on healthy ingredients. Khanna, who has been conducting regular workshops on handcrafted pasta with whole grains and nutritional ingredients, explains that she has been able to raise Rs 91,000 from 67 participants and donate the same to Hemkunt Foundation, Give India, Goonj and Kalap Trust. She plans to have a few more sessions in June on different culinary topics and contribute some more. From asking people to pre-register and pay in advance to join the live session or sending them their recipe videos for a donation, chefs are trying different ways of raising money. NGOs are also tying up with prominent platforms to help them in this cause. Anjali Batra of popular food platform Food Talk India says she has lined up workshops with chefs on sustainability and lost cuisines, along with holding talks on setting up startups or building new businesses. She feels such sessions are a good way for people to invest in skill development and contribute to charity at the same time. Batra’s next workshop is on food styling and photography with the Open Art Project. Priced at Rs 2,000 per head, Batra says they request people to pay directly to NGOs such as Give India, share a screenshot and receive an email link to join the session. For young chefs, such as Sambhavi Joshi of Caserecce, a handmade pasta brand, these sessions are not just a fundraiser but also a learning experience. Joshi, who had 35 people pay for her session, says all of them were active participants who asked a lot of questions and wanted to learn about healthy cooking. “A session that was to be for an hour went on for over two hours and people had a lot of questions, especially about local flours that are easily available. It was encouraging to see people shift focus to local produce,” she said, adding that being able to raise Rs 35,000 for Covid relief through her cooking skills was quite satisfying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/smells-like-team-spirit-chefs-prepare-a-charity-mix/articleshow/83096411.cms||Amin Ali

---||Agra||After mucomycosis, first case of another fungal infection surfaces in Agra||AGRA: Amid increasing number of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases, doctors in Agra have reported the first case of fungal infection called aspergillosis in the district. It is an infection caused by aspergillus, a common mold (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors, and affects the lungs. However, it can’t spread between people or between people and animals. According to the doctors, the patient – a 40-year-old male from Aligarh who tested positive for Covid earlier – is out of danger. Chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said, “Most people inhale aspergillus spores every day without getting sick. But people with a weakened immune system or lung disease are at a higher risk of developing health issues due to aspergillus. Just like the black fungus, people who have recently recovered from Covid and have a weakened immune system are vulnerable. The problems caused by aspergillus include allergic reactions, infection in body organs, including lungs.” Head of the ENT department at Agra’s SN Medical College, Dr Akhil Pratap Singh, said, “Following biopsy, a suspected black fungus patient has been tested with aspergillosis. The patient had contracted Covid-19 infection earlier. He is diabetic and has low immunity. The patient is being provided with the required medication. A surgery was done to remove the infected tissues from the patient.” Last week, eight cases of nasal aspergillosis, which infects the sinuses, have been reported from two of the government hospitals in Vadodara, Gujarat. The growing cases of fungal infections may be attributed to the usage of steroids for treating severe coronavirus infection as well as the use of non-sterile water for hydrating the oxygen supply. Principal, SNMC, Dr Sanjay Kala said, “We have developed a dedicated ward for treatment of mucormycosis and other fungal diseases. Presently, the ward has 60 beds. We have an in-house facility to conduct all the required tests for detection and drugs for patients available with us. Most patients in the early stages do not know that they have the disease, but the progression is very rapid. For diabetic patients, this is life-threatening. Early diagnosis is important for treatment and better outcomes”. Meanwhile, at least six more suspected cases of black fungus surfaced in Agra on Sunday. Out of the 45 patients of black fungus admitted to SNMC in Agra, six were in a critical condition. In three of them, the infection has reached the brain while the other three are on oxygen support and have a large part of their nose and eyes infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-mucomycosis-1st-case-of-another-fungal-infection-surfaces-in-agra/articleshow/83094113.cms||Deepak Lavania

A probe has been ordered into the matter. Akil’s family alleged that he was brutally beaten up and pushed off the terrace by the policemen during the raid at his residence in Khabish Gyan locality on May 24. Police, however, claimed that Akil, wanted in a cattle theft case lodged against him in 2020, jumped off the terrace to escape on seeing the police team knocking at his door. “Police knocked on his main door during the raid. In a bid to escape, Akil jumped off the terrace from the rear end of the house. Family told us he was not at home. He was later admitted to a hospital by the family with a different name,” said Santosh Kumar, Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police. However, on Akil’s family’s complaint, he has directed Harendra Singh, superintendent of police (rural areas), to investigate the case. Giving a different version of the incident, Mohammed Kaif, 11, Akil’s son, alleged, “The policemen knocked at the main door. Some even climbed up on the terrace from the rear. They asked my father to come along. When we heard cries of help, we ran upstairs. We pleaded with the policemen to let go of my father, but they hit him with a rifle butt on the head and threw him off the terrace.”  Kaif, who has four younger sisters to look after, said, “I want justice.” Having sustained grievous injuries, Akil was taken to a city-based private hospital by his family. After his condition deteriorated, he was rushed to Aligarh and was later referred to a higher centre in Delhi, where he breathed his last on May 27. “If he was a criminal, they could have just arrested him and put him in jail. Court would have decided if he is guilty or not,” said Rizwan, 27, Akil’s nephew who lives next door.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pushed-off-terrace-by-cops-man-dies-kin-seek-justice/articleshow/83094137.cms||Piyush Rai

Suddenly, three to four cars came from Ratauli village side and its occupants started firing at us. We ran towards Pandit’s house. He also came out after hearing the gunshots.

---||India||84-year old Stan Swamy tests positive for Covid, in ICU||MUMBAI: Fr Stan Swamy, 84, shifted from Taloja jail to Holy Family Hospital on Friday night, has tested positive for Covid. He has been placed in ICU and is on oxygen support. The Bombay high court had on Friday at an urgent hearing directed that Fr Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, be shifted to the private hospital for 15 days after hearing his counsel Mihir Desai and additional solicitor general Anil Singh for National Intelligence Agency, which arrested him last October. Fr Swamy’s lawyer communicated his positive status to the prison superintendent. The prison official informed TOI that after getting a call from the lawyer, two inmates including Arun Ferreira, who were Fr Swamy’s attendants, were tested. Both came negative on antigen tests on Sunday. They had tested negative earlier too, as had Fr Swamy, the official said. A vacation bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar had clarified it was passing the order in “peculiar facts and circumstances of the case” on the NIA counsel’s submission that sending Fr Swamy to a private hospital of his choice may set a “wrong precedent”. The NIA had arrested Fr Swamy from his hometown, Ranchi, last October, accusing him of being a Maoist. Desai had argued that the urgency to shift him to hospital arose as Fr Swamy was “unable to stand, eat or visit the toilet”. Desai informed the HC that Fr Swamy’s attendants at the prison had said his “health was extremely precarious with reduced oxygen saturation and acutely fluctuating blood pressure”. On May 21, Fr Swamy in a virtual interaction with a vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade, who noted he was physically weak, had refused to be shifted to any hospital, saying he preferred to await his death in prison. The bench had then permitted Desai to approach the HC before June 1 if the priest was convinced by then to be shifted to Holy Family. Fr Swamy filed an affidavit on May 28 affirming that he was ready to be shifted. The HC had called for a report from JJ Hospital on May 21 and it had said that he was normal and responsive but had severe hearing loss in an ear, unbalanced gait, lower limb problems and general weakness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/84-year-old-stan-swamy-tests-positive-for-covid-in-icu/articleshow/83102637.cms||---

Vaccination drives for people above the age of 18 years remained suspended for the fifth straight day on Sunday. While the district and the state authority is not in a position to say anything on the availability of the vaccine, the unprotected younger generation is worried about how long they will have to wait for the vaccines and how to keep themselves safe from the impending third wave if the vaccines are not made available soon. The health department has fixed a target of inoculating 12,80,443 youths above the age of 18 in Dhanbad. The vaccination drive for this age group started on May 14 and continued till 25. A total of 34, 089 youths have already received the first dose in the district which is just 2.66% of the targeted population. However, vaccination drives for people above the age of 45 years is continuing unabated. When asked, district inoculation officer (DRCHO) Dr Vikash Rana said, “While the Centre is providing vaccines for people above the age of 45 years free of cost, the state is required to purchase vaccines to inoculate youths above the age of 18 years. But it is the Centre which is to allocate vaccines to the states for this age group.” He acknowledged that vaccination drives for the young population above the age of 18 years in the district remains suspended since May 26 and shall resume after ample doses are made available to the district. “The state authorities would decide on the quota for the district once the vaccines are available there,” he added. State vaccination in-charge A Dodde (IAS) also conceded that the vaccination drive for the younger generation above the age of 18 years remains suspended for want of vaccines and informed that the state has sent a requisition for 50lakh doses of vaccines to the Centre. “We are likely to get five lakh doses for the next month but we are not sure when it will reach us,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-crunch-stalls-drive-for-5-days/articleshow/83096749.cms||Anil Ashutosh

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Gumla tops state in anaemia control prog||GUMLA: With a score of 64.9 points, Gumla tops the state in the Niti Aayog's Anaemia Free India Programme for the year 2020-21. Niti Aayog had identified fives districts in the state -- Gumla, Lohardaga, Simdega, Godda and Bokaro - for the programme as they are high anaemic zones. Commenting on the development, DC Shishir Kumar Sinha said, "We topped the programme and we are focused on eradicating the disorder since December last year by regularly monitoring the anaemia control programme." He said the programme assumed significance considering the expected third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which is expected to hit children and pregnant women. "Pregnant women, lactating mothers and adolescent girls are among those who are highly anaemic. They should be free of anaemia to ward off the Covid virus. We have planned measures to treat malnourished children so that they lead a healthy life with a strong immune system to fight any sort of disease, including the Covid virus." Detailing the anaemia control programme, district civil surgeon Vijaya Bhengra said, "ANMs were specially directed to carry out anaemia test on pregnant women and lactating mothers. Frontline workers were provided with digital haemoglobin meters for regular check-ups.” The district anaemia programme manager, Jaya Reshma Khakha, said, "Those who were found with less than 12 haemoglobin level are administered iron folic acid tablets while highly anaemic patients are given iron sucrose injection." She added, “During the health baseline survey conducted two years ago, around 40% women in Gumla were found anaemic. After the launch of the Anaemia-Free India campaign, the district has improved a lot."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gumla-tops-state-in-anaemia-control-prog/articleshow/83096451.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Villagers shying away from Cov tests & vax drive: Survey team||RANCHI: The state government’s aggressive efforts to trace and eventually curb the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas by organising a door-to-door campaign for raising awareness among the villagers regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour has hit a roadblock. Not only are the villagers reluctant to go for Covid tests for fear of being hospitalised, they are not even willing to take the vaccine as they have doubts over its efficacy for many are contracting the disease even after taking the jab. Earlier this month, the government had roped in the health workers, sahiyas and ANMs for the conducting the door-to-door campaign as part of which they were scheduled to conduct Covid tests and encourage the villagers to take the vaccine. However, the task is easier said than done, as pointed out by Ragini Kumar, who is the ANM of Dubaliya village in Kanke block. She said, “The villagers have various kinds of apprehensions, for instance, they think if they test positive, they will forcibly be admitted to hospitals. Even convincing them to take the vaccine is an uphill task. They opined that many are dying despite taking the vaccine, so they are reluctant to take the jab. We are making them aware about the benefits of the vaccine but that it is a herculean task.” Similarly, Reena Devi, a sahiya in Jonha village under Angara block, said, “As part of the healthcare survey team, we have to almost beg people for answering questions regarding their health. Many a times they hide their symptoms due to fear of undergoing an antigen test.” On Saturday, an FIR registered at Mandar police station after some villagers protested against the survey team and chased them away. Taking cognizance of the matter, Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey on Sunday launched an awareness programme in his constituency to make people aware about the importance of vaccination and testing. “It came to my notice during my visit to the rural areas in my constituency that people are unaware about the importance of social distancing and they do not wear mask at public places. There are various rumours circulating in the villages regarding vaccines and Covid testing. I have launched five awareness raths in my constituency which will distribute pamphlets, sanitizers, masks and educate people in Bedo, Itki, Chanho, Lapung and Mandar blocks regarding the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Tirkey said. He added, “It has also come to my notice that villagers are misbehaving with the sahiyas and the ANMs. I have recorded a voice message and circulated it among the villagers, urging them to cooperate with the survey team.” Meanwhile, the survey continued in Ranchi and as per data from the district administration, a total 12,34,44 people have been screened till date and 2,923 RAT tests were conducted on Sunday, of which ten samples came out positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/villagers-shying-away-from-cov-tests-vax-drive-survey-team/articleshow/83096692.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The streets were empty but still a few people could be spotted in the lanes. Three days after the leopard was reported to be seen at a house here, a mixed feeling of fear, excitement and to a certain extent indifference was seen among the locals. They wanted the leopard to be rescued safely as it had caused no harm to humans. A video of a leopard sitting on a wall is doing the rounds in the localities. Some youngsters claim to have themselves filmed the animal, though the clip turned out of to be an old one shot at Katol Road. Just across the road is VNIT campus where the leopard is believed to have gone finally. “There is a scare but I have to carry on the work for a living. Forest department officials had come and asked me to keep an eye. I keep peeping on the other side of the wall to see if anything is there,” says Prakash Wankhade, a street vendor. “I wish I could see it again. It was there, sitting on the wall and every one was shooting videos, so did I,” says a young sugarcane juice vendor. Another youth at the entrance of Gayatri Nagar bragged about a similar feat. Both had the old video. Not due to the leopard, people are already indoors due to Covid, said some of the locals. “My family has not overcome the fear yet. It’s three days and we are still scared of keeping the doors open,” says Narendra Chakole in whose bathroom the leopard was first seen. His father has just undergone a surgery and his mobility is hampered. Chakole describes the whole incident. “I had entered the bathroom and just turned the tap when I saw a leopard next to me. We saw each other in the eyes. I could not spot it while entering as it was dark. I rushed outside, and the leopard followed. It stepped over my left foot and ran again, going towards the bathroom before jumping off the wall,” says Chakole showing certificate of having taken an anti-rabies injection after the injury. He wants the animal to be rescued safely but expresses his anger on the forest department. “They took nearly quarter of an hour to reach. Even after that they did not completely believe me. Their version was that I had claimed to have seen a leopard, and they will have to further confirm it. One of them said it could be a dog,” says Chakole. “No, there is nothing to be scared,” said one of neighbours. “We are careful but there is no panic,” said another. Ankit Dange, an engineering student living opposite Chakole’s house, said his mother keeps awake till late in the night keeping an eye on the surroundings. Earlier, a number of people used to come out for morning walk on the Ambazari lake bund. “I can see the entire area from my terrace. These days only a handful is coming. Parents are also not allowing their children to go out for cycling,” said Satish Verma who lives in a flat here. On the main road on the entrance, Akash Patel, a young fruit seller, says he is not scared but his parents have asked him to be careful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/elusive-leopard-watchful-eyes-an-old-video-doing-the-rounds/articleshow/83098071.cms||Shishir Arya

Hundreds of trucks engaged in transportation of stone chips from Sahibganj district are stranded on either side of the highway as it is the only road connecting the two states. Sources said vehicular movement along the stretch between Barharwa and Farakka remained normal till Saturday afternoon but suddenly the water level of the river rose, washing out a portion of the road. Vast areas are reportedly submerged in Barharwa, Patna, Borio and Barhet blocks of the district due to the incessant rains triggered by the cyclone. The district headquarters of Sahibganj is also affected, said officials. The rain halted movement on the state highway connecting NH-80 since Saturday as a diversion of a bridge between Mathiyo and Bada Bishanpur under Borio block was also washed away. Nearly one dozen villages have been inundated in Borio block due to the flood water, promoting the district administration to launch a drive to shift them to safer places and provide relief materials on a priority basis. “Flood water is still flowing on different roads, including the NH and state highway,” Sahibganj deputy commissioner Ram Niwas Yadav said, adding, there were no loss of life. “Water levels are gradually receding,” he said. On restoration of the road, Yadav said he is in contact with NHAI authorities to renovate the damaged portion of about 25m on a priority. “The rain water submerged different localities of Sahibganj town which was mainly caused by unplanned structures constructed during the course of time by both government enterprises, including railways, and common residents. Improper drainage system turned the situation miserable,” Yadav explained adding that a long term plan would be chalked out to avoid such situation. Yadav further said that the assessment of the loss of crops and property of farmers and businessmen is being made and will soon be sent to the state headquarter for release of compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vehicles-stuck-on-nh-80-after-yaas-washes-away-road/articleshow/83096782.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

According to health department records, 40 sites including district hospitals, medical colleges and a few dedicated Covid hospitals have been identified for the purpose. Talking to TOI, Arun Kumar Singh, the additional chief secretary (health), said: “We have planned to equip all our district hospitals with oxygen plants in the next two months. Till now, more than 50% work has been done at three medical colleges and Garhwa and Khunti have already installed one plant each.” Meanwhile, the state government was also contemplating on providing a one-time grant to private hospitals for installing oxygen plants. “Many private hospitals in Ranchi as well as Jamshedpur are dependent on oxygen cylinders for oxygen supply. So in order to make them self-sufficient before a possible third wave, we are planning to provide grants to hospitals having at least 50 beds,” said a senior health department official requesting anonymity. Of the 40 places identified for setting up an oxygen plant, work was in progress at 19 places across 10 districts. Authorities have also issued work order for the installation of five more oxygen plants in three more districts. A few districts like Latehar, Lohardaga, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Koderma are yet to start work on the plants and they have been asked by the department to issue the work orders soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hosps-asked-to-install-psa-oxygen-plants/articleshow/83096676.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: State orders assessment of Yaas damage before seeking relief package from Centre||RANCHI: The state department of home, jail and disaster management has asked all the 24 district administrations to assess the losses caused to life, property and crops due to cyclone Yaas, which swept through Jharkhand last week and left a trail of destruction in its wake. Vijay Kumar, the additional secretary of the department, has asked the district administration to send a compiled report of the damages that have been caused by the cyclone by May 31. “Based on the assessment of the damages which have been caused by the cyclonic rain, the department will draft an estimate of the compensation which will be sought from the Centre as an immediate financial relief package,” a senior official in the department said on Sunday. As many as four deaths have been documented in Jharkhand due to heavy rains caused by the cyclonic storm, which had set in over the state on May 26. Dozens of homes have been destroyed and bridges and roads have been swept away in the rains. Power outages, snapping of overhead electrical wires and uprooting of trees were reported. Nearly 20,000 people were evacuated from their homes and hamlets across four districts in southern parts of the state. The Union government on Thursday announced Rs 1,000 crore in cumulative financial relief to Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took an aerial survey of the cyclone-battered districts of Odisha. While Odisha was provided immediate relief of Rs 500 crore, funds will be released to Jharkhand and West Bengal based on the extent of the damages. “We will first evaluate whether the damages caused can be compensated from the Rs 800 crore annual allocation for the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF). Only if the damage is beyond the annual allocation approved by the Centre, then additional funds will be sought,” the official said. State disaster management minister Banna Gupta did not respond to calls when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-orders-assessment-of-yaas-damage-before-seeking-relief-package-from-centre/articleshow/83096754.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The leopard was sighted jumping the PDKV compound wall at around 10.30pm by Atharva Pande, a journalist with Mirror Now. Pande said, “I saw the leopard jumping the wall. I was returning home. I couldn’t clearly see its spots but it was big. I’ve informed the police and the forest department.” Earlier, during the day the leopard was not seen in the IT Park area. Hence, the forest officials have decided to scan the Ambazari reserve forest and the nullah adjoining VNIT, which touches the side of the lake. The leopard was sighted by a security guard Omprakash Naidu at 2.15am on Saturday. Nagpur chief conservator of forests (CCF) P Kalyan Kumar visited the IT Park site on the second consecutive day and directed officials to place camera trap at strategic points. Earlier, CCF Kumar had handled a similar situation arising out of a tiger entering MIHAN in November 2019. “No record or pugmark of the animal was seen on Sunday. We suspect the animal may have moved towards Ambazari and must be on its way out. Our teams are also verifying whether the predator had killed any prey in the vicinity,” said CCF Kumar. ACF Surendra Kale said 30 camera traps have been procured and 20 will be put along the nullah side. Besides, a search has also been launched in Ambazari forest and garden on Pandhrabodi end. In December 2019, a leopard was sighted in Ambazari near Little Woods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-enters-pdkv-farm-at-bajaj-nagar/articleshow/83098124.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Lockdown, Covid fear, money matters made many quit smoking||NAGPUR: Celebrities appealing to people to quit tobacco, doctors sharing scary data about how tobacco kills, and associations conducting cancer screening camps have been the most common visuals on World No Tobacco Day since 1988 — the year World Health Assembly resolved to celebrate this day on the 31st of May. But this year, doctors have noted a new trend. People are either quitting or reducing the use of tobacco. “It’s a blessing in disguise,” said ENT specialist Dr Prashant Nikhade, who is also president of the Vidarbha chapter of Association of Otolaryngologists. “The foremost reason is that people are not getting tobacco easily due to lockdown. Secondly, many can’t go out and smoke. Furthermore, with numerous citizens losing their livelihoods, there is no money to spare for such addictions,” said Dr Nikhade. “In many families, youngsters do not smoke at home. This is due to a sense of respect for elders. Moreover, social gatherings and parties are not happening. Offices are closed, so smoking in lunch break with colleagues has stopped too,” said chest physician Dr Manish Thakre. Indian Dental Association, Nagpur branch secretary Dr Poonam Hudiya said many of her patients had stopped chewing tobacco during Covid times. “For some, it’s due to a fear of losing immunity in the face of Covid. For those who have recovered from Covid-19, the fear of weak lungs resulted in quitting tobacco,” the dentist said, adding that quitting tobacco would be the most valuable gift one can give to one’s family amid the pandemic. “85% cases of oral cancer in our study are due to tobacco use,” said Dr Kartar Singh, director of Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Cancer Hospital. “The Covid-19 pandemic has led to millions of tobacco users saying they want to quit. Accordingly, this year’s theme is ‘commit to quit’. Many have successfully quit tobacco during this period too,” Singh added. Entrepreneur Ajay Rathod used to be a chain-smoker till March. “I had bought two cartons of cigarettes before the lockdown. But while at home with family during lockdown, I hardly felt the urge to smoke. Maybe that’s because I don’t want to smoke in front of my kids,” he said. Many like him have quit because they don’t want to smoke in front of children at home. Monty Singh, who works in a multinational company, said work from home had reduced his kharra intake. “I used to get the Nagpur special kharra from Itwari. Shops are closed, but we can still get kharra. However, it’s not that simple to procure it. So, I am trying to quit it now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lockdown-covid-fear-money-matters-made-many-quit-smoking/articleshow/83098137.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

South Korean President Moon Jae-in announced the abolishment of the joint missile guidelines that had limited the country's development of ballistic missiles to a range of 800 km (500 miles) after his first summit with U.S. President Joe Biden earlier this month. North Korea's official KCNA news agency carried an article by Kim Myong Chol, who it described as an "international affairs critic," to accuse the United States of applying a double standard as it sought to ban Pyongyang from developing ballistic missiles. The United States is "engrossed in confrontation despite its lip-service to dialogue," Kim said. "The termination step is a stark reminder of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its shameful double-dealing." The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea's official name. North Korea's target is the United States, not South Korea's military, and it will counter the States on "the principle of strength for strength," Kim said. Kim also criticised Moon for welcoming the termination of the guidelines, calling it "disgusting, indecent." "Now that the U.S. and the South Korean authorities made clear their ambition of aggression, they are left with no reasons whatsoever to fault the DPRK bolstering its capabilities for self-defence," Kim added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-slams-end-to-us-guidelines-limiting-south-korea-missile-range/articleshow/83102640.cms||---

Foresters suspect that the poachers had laid the snare for herbivores. The tigress might have been caught in it but managed to break free. Sources said the tigress was first captured in the camera trap in Salori forest a few days back. The camera trap picture was recovered after two days. An earlier picture gave an impression that some red strip was around the tigress’s neck. Another picture revealed a wire snare. Immediately foresters in Warora and Bhadrawati range were alerted and an operation was launched to trace the tigress. A formal permission has been sought from the PCCF wildlife to rescue the tigress. “The tigress is continuously on the move and is shifting between Warora and Bhadrawati ranges. We have added more camera traps in the area to monitor its movement,” CCF NR Praveen told TOI. He claimed that the tigress was directly sighted by the tracking team on Sunday. “Local foresters are trying to locate the tigress and once its location is finalized, RRT team will be deployed in the area to rescue the tigress and remove the snare,” said CCF Praveen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-moving-with-wire-snare-around-neck/articleshow/83098147.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Nagpur||DCP combines health and policing to tackle super spreaders||NAGPUR: Zonal DCP Lohit Matani has devised a pattern of intense foot patrolling and occasional route marches in congested lanes and slums in the evening hours for dispersing crowds as a guard against super spreaders to enforce Covid restrictions. This action from Matani comes at a crucial junction as the society is witnessing the gradual ebbing of the second wave along with the administration’s preparation to tackle the next one. Based on the novel concept of combining health and policing in the run up to deal with the next Covid challenge, Matani has ensured that officers of six police stations of central Nagpur engage in the foot patrolling or street policing exercises, including him, covering around 10-12 kms in a span of around three hours daily. “With intense foot patrolling, we can harness the positive effects of walking briskly apart from taking action against goons, checking Covid violators and also instilling faith in the public,” said Matani who patrolled the criminal-infested Naik talao and Pachpaoli localities on Sunday. “While Covid violators rectify themselves and goons feel the heat, cops also become fitter and stronger by walking briskly,” he said. “Every day, officers of six police stations under me ensure that 3,000-3,500 loiterers are checked, warned and sent back home with a warning,” said the IPS officer. Matani had been also simultaneously cracking down on goons during patrolling when he and his team managed to land up at their doorsteps before conducting ‘house searches’. The officer has also arrested several goons from their houses during such searches and seized weapons too. During the multi-pronged action, there had been crackdowns on anti-social activities too like gambling, bootlegging and narcotics peddling. “We patrolled dingy lanes and by-lanes of Mominpura and adjoining localities coming down heavily on goons and anti-social elements. Police have been ensuring that the crowd thronging parks, grounds and other public places in the evening leave at once,” said Matani. The IPS officer also said police presence acts as a deterrence against criminals preparing to commit a crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dcp-combines-health-and-policing-to-tackle-super-spreaders/articleshow/83098249.cms||Soumitra Bose

The ALH Mk-III helicopter is based at the Naval air station INS Hansa and is part of the INAS 323 squadron. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) converted the multi-role ALH-III for medevac (medical evacuation) purposes. “The equipment can be installed in two-three hours to convert the aircraft into an air ambulance. This is the first of eight MICU sets to be delivered by HAL,” said the Navy. The MICU has two sets of defibrillators, multipara monitors, ventilator, oxygen support as well as infusion and syringe pumps. It also has a suction system to clear secretions in the mouth or airway of the patient. The system can be operated on aircraft power supply and also has a battery back up of four hours. “The Navy can now undertake medical evacuation of critical patients by air even in unfavourable weather conditions,” the Navy said.Christened the Harriers, INAS 323 squadron was commissioned on April 19 and has been tasked with maritime surveillance, search and rescue operations and even low intensity combat operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-equips-chopper-to-be-airborne-icu/articleshow/83098463.cms||---
---||Goa||87% of last week’s deceased were unvaccinated 45-plus||PANAJI: Except for one, all the 200 people who succumbed to Covid-19 over the past week in the 45+ age group were not fully vaccinated, despite being eligible to receive it. A whopping 157 (87%) of them hadn’t received even a single dose of the vaccine although it has been made freely available, while 25 patients (13%) had received just a single dose. “A sizeable section of Goa’s 60+ population has been vaccinated, but the statistics show that people who have died are the ones who have not taken the vaccine,” a senior doctor treating Covid said. “Very few have succumbed after the first dose of the vaccine,” the doctor added. The government told the high court of Bombay at Goa last week that it has more than 2 lakh doses in stock for the 45+ age group, but people are not coming forward to take it. President of the Indian Medical Association, Goa, Dr Vinayak Buvaji said getting fully vaccinated reduces the intensity and aggressiveness of the virus. “The Covid deaths in people who have been fully vaccinated have been very negligible in Goa,” he said. “We have to vaccinate at least 60-70% of our population for herd immunity to set in. We should complete this within the next two months to be prepared for the next wave. We have already been badly hit by this wave,” Buvaji said. As the adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI) are negligible, he suggested that door-to-door vaccination be carried out to speed up vaccination. “This must be done offline as unnecessary time is wasted on registration on the portal and in poor internet connectivity. The data can be loaded onto the portal at the end of the day. A team must have a ready list in hand and along with ward members move door-to-door for vaccination,” the president of the Indian Medical Association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/87-of-last-weeks-deceased-were-unvaccinated-45-plus/articleshow/83098562.cms||---

He also urged the government to reduce the period between two jabs as has been done in Kerala. AAP further asked the state to come out with a clear SOP for seafarers and to have their passport numbers included on the vaccination certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/glad-govt-will-prioritise-vax-for-seamen/articleshow/83098512.cms||---
---||Goa||TN finmin refuses to apologise to Mauvin||Panaji: A day after Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho claimed that Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan insulted Goans and demanded an apology from him, the latter on Sunday refused to apologise, and hit out at Godinho’s “baseless lies”, comparing the Dabolim MLA to empty vessels that make the most noise. In a statement to the people of Goa, Rajan expressed his “sincere condolences” to Goans for having “such a person as minister”. During the GST meeting chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Godinho was “highly repetitive, largely vacuous, hectoring... supercilious, and devoid of... basic courtesy”, Thiaga Rajan said. “I have done you no harm,” Thiaga Rajan told the people of Goa, and instead said that chief minister Pramod Sawant was responsible for “perpetrating a misdemeanor” by nominating Godinho to represent Goa. “I sincerely request BJP, even across the political divide, to impose some minimal quality control on its ‘MLA acquisition’ procedures,” he wrote. Rajan’s taunt is clearly aimed at Godinho’s chequered past. Godinho left Congress to join BJP days before the 2017 assembly elections. BJP welcomed him into its fold despite former chief minister Manohar Parrikar filing a criminal case against Godinho in Goa’s power rebate scam. Former South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar rushed to defend Godinho. “Godinho, with no generational count, is a six-time member of the Goa assembly. Respect begets respect,” he wrote on Twitter, reply to Rajan’s letter. The tiff between Godinho and Thiaga Rajan appears to have broken out when the TN minister tried to interrupt Godinho’s lengthy speech, which, according to Thiaga Rajan, was “many times the length of the inputs of the UP finance minister, and indeed every other state”. On Saturday, after Godinho’s allegation, Thiaga Rajan tweeted, “Let me say that enduring the noise from this empty vessel yesterday was the worst torture of my political career”. In his statement on Sunday, Thiaga Rajan said he prefers not to “respond to noises emanating from sources that are unworthy of response”, but would make an exception for Godinho, since the whole of India “should know how such individuals impact the quality and output of the GST council”. Rajan said that Tamil Nadu backed smaller states like Sikkim, Goa and Arunachal Pradesh on issues that would lead to loss of potential revenue for Tamil Nadu. Thiaga Rajan said that Tamil Nadu favours the idea of bigger states having a larger say in the GST council, while Godinho was trying to make a case for special preference for smaller states. He said that Godinho “vociferously and repeatedly” opposed a call to lower GST rates on Covid medicines and vaccines from 5% to 0%. “The only question arising from your transport minister’s press conference is whether he is limited in comprehension, in honesty, or both,” Thiaga Rajan wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tn-finmin-refuses-to-apologise-to-mauvin/articleshow/83098726.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Gurgaon||Covid-19: Curbs extended in Haryana, but malls & hotels to open||GURUGRAM: The Haryana government on Sunday extended the lockdown across the state by more than a week till June 7. In an order issued on Sunday, the government said though the positivity rate had come down, the restrictions must continue to bring down the fatalities. In the new set of guidelines, malls have been allowed to open, but with restrictions on the number of visitors. The timings of shops have also been extended till late in the afternoon. However, restaurants and bars will only be available for takeaways and deliveries. Cinema halls will continue to remain shut and so will eateries in the malls. The lockdown order follows an announcement by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar earlier in the day. “That although the Covid positivity rate has come down, however the mahamari alert suraksha Haryana needs to continue to bring the rate of fatality further down,” the order stated. Standalone shops, which had last week been divided into odd and even categories, can stay open through the day except during the night curfew (10pm-5am). Other shops will now be open from 9am to 3pm. Although many shops were allowed to open last week itself, only those dealing with essentials saw some footfall. Sector markets and other commercial areas have continued to wear a deserted look even as some of the relaxations have eased. Malls will stay open from 10am to 6pm. However, only one visitor per 25sqft area will be allowed. The malls have been asked to design an app that will help them regulate the movement of visitors. “Malls shall develop apps to regulate the movement of people,” the order mentioned. Theatres, restaurants and bars inside malls will stay shut. Hotels, too, have been allowed to open, but banquets and conference rooms will stay hut for guests. Restaurants will also not be open for dining, Malls in the city said they would now calculate the number of visitors they can allow according to the area. “We will take the total area and then calculate the number of people that can be allowed inside. We welcome the government’s move and it should not be difficult to implement the rule at all,” said Aman Bajaj, a member of the MGF Metropolitan Mall Association. Haryana has now been under lockdown for around a month. The first lockdown was announced in early May and has since been extended by weeks. The restrictions are being seen as the major reason behind the fall in Covid numbers. On May 1, Gurugram had 38,561 active cases. As of Sunday, the district had 1,727 active cases. Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg said he had directed his team to ensure the restrictions are followed strictly. Like the earlier phases, police will carry out random inspections in the city to ensure people are following the Covid safety protocols. Gurugram police has already booked more than 100 people through May for breaking lockdown norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/curbs-extended-in-haryana-but-malls-hotels-to-open/articleshow/83098677.cms||---

By this principle is he implying that he is empty and therefore pointing fingers at me as an empty vessel?” said Godinho.

Rutash Sarang received her second dose recently, according to Candolim primary health centre (PHC) medical officer, Dr Roshan Nazareth. However, the number of people coming for their vaccination shots at the Candolim vaccination centre which is located at the residence of Nandan Kudchadkar has shown a downward trend lately, he said. “It used to be around 200-300 persons everyday. Now, it’s around 100. That’s because most of the eligible persons in the 45+ age group have already been vaccinated. The rest are those who tested positive and their family members who cannot be given the vaccine for some time,” Nazareth said, adding, “The numbers will pick up again when people start coming for their second shot and the others who are not eligible right now become eligible.” He said the drive under the Candolim PHC has been successful overall. “Our facilities are very user-friendly. We have volunteers who welcome people with a smile and reassure them that there’s nothing to worry about. We’ve also received very good support from everybody, specially the panchayats and the sarpanchs and the MLA,” Nazareth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/93-yr-old-takes-jab-at-candolim-drive-in-centre/articleshow/83098801.cms||---

Two more floating jetties at Chapora and Campal are under construction and could be completed over the next couple of months depending on the monsoons and how the Covid-19 pandemic pans out, said REL Marinetek officials. The floating river jetties will cater to commercial boats and river cruises though fishermen have also been offered the use of the jetties. Mandaviya expressed hope that the floating jetty at Old Goa will prove a game changer for the tourism sector of Goa. “The jetty will offer safe, hassle free transportation to tourists. This floating jetty will bring Old Goa closer to Panaji through waterways and help people avoid traffic,” said Mandaviya. All four jetties, funded by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), were to be installed as part of a Rs 10 crore contract awarded to REL Marintek India. The first concrete floating jetty, and the first in the country, was inaugurated by the Union minister of state for shipping in February 2020. Mandaviya said that the Centre is ready to help Goa with all development projects. The ports minister said that the floating jetties will help decongest the roads and help promote waterways tourism and waterways transport. “The construction is nearly done but the installation of the remaining jetties will depend on the pandemic. Right now things look uncertain but in the next couple of months we hope to finish the project,” said managing director for Marinetek India Gautama Dutta.

Police have claimed that both incidents appear to be cases of grudge assault. In the first incident, Mohammad Arshad Hussain, 56, the state secretary of JD(U)’s minority cell, was shot at by unidentified people on Mainpura Road in western Patna around 11am on Sunday. Police said he was on way home when the incident occurred. Hussain, who received bullet injuries to his arms, chest, and abdomen, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital and is stated to be serious. Ajeet Kumar Saha, SHO of Danapur police station, said Hussain and his son had an FIR registered against them over a case of public scuffle and that the duo had also registered a counter case against the complainants. He said Sunday’s incident was probably the fallout of that. In the second case, CPM’s state legislature party member and Bibhutipur MLA, Ajay Kumar, survived an attack on him at the party office on Saturday. While he escaped unhurt, his bodyguard was injured. Manavjit Singh Dhillon, Samastipur SP, said they have lodged an FIR. “We arrested one Rahul Yadav and one Mohammad Monazir on Sunday. Preliminary probes show the incident is a fallout of a road rage case, where both parties were involved a few days ago,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-veteran-bihar-netas-attacked-police-probe-revenge-angle/articleshow/83102721.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The letter, signed by opposition leader Digambar Kamat and state Congress president Girish Chodankar, said the absence of the constitutional authority has resulted in chaos, mismanagement and misrule by the BJP government. Kamat also said it is unfortunate that as Goa observed its 35th Statehood Day, the state remained without a full-time governor who could proactively address the concerns of Goans. “It appears as if the Centre has ignored Goa or forgotten us,” said Kamat. Congress said Goa is struggling to contain the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and recover from Cyclone Tauktae. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said Goa suffered a loss of Rs 146 crore due to the cyclone. “Although the cyclone had a devastating effect, PM Narendra Modi did not show courtesy to conduct an aerial survey nor announce any package,” said Kamat. The letter said that despite opposition parties submitting memorandums and expressing concern to the governor of Goa and Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the concerns were not addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-wants-full-time-guv-for-state/articleshow/83098973.cms||---
---||India||States distributed about 50% of free foodgrains for May||NEW DELHI: The states and Union Territories have distributed about 50% of the free foodgrains to the poor under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna (PMGKAY) for May. While some states including Karnataka, Gujarat, West Bengal, Jammu & Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh have distributed the allocated foodgrains to 77-81% of the beneficiaries, in states including Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Goa the distribution till May 25 was less than 1%. Officials said the distribution of the free 5 kg foodgrain to each identified beneficiary under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) is less in some states because they had distributed 2-3 months quota of foodgrain in advance to the beneficiaries under NFSA before the PMGKAY-III was announced. Sources said the Centre had allowed the states in April to distribute foodgrains to the beneficiaries for up to six months in advance. “This step was taken as the number of Covid infections started increasing. It was felt that advance distribution of foodgrains will also help reduce crowding and infection. We are confident that the entire allocated foodgrains will be distributed by states by the end of June,” said a food ministry official. The government has rolled out the PMGKAY-III for two months — May and June — which entitles around 80 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA to get 5 kg of foodgrains free of cost. The scheme was successful in bringing relief to people during the first wave of Covid, according to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-distributed-about-50-of-free-foodgrains-for-may/articleshow/83102735.cms||---

The bandh had suffered some damage during Cyclone Tauktae. On May 26, full moon day, the water surged higher than usual causing the bandh to erode. “A 20-m stretch has been affected on one side. We were just preparing to grow our kharif crop,” farmer Milinath Shirgaonkar said. The sluice gate, which regulates the flow of water, has also been damaged. Dongorim and Neura are part of the huge khazan land that stretches from Agassaim to Gaundalim beyond Carambolim. But vast stretches of the once fertile fields that provided the locals with rice, vegetables and fish in a sustainable way, are barren and overgrown with mangroves. A section of villagers in Neura, Azossim-Mandur had even formed a committee, Khazan Action Committee (KAC), to revive agriculture. But failure to repair a major breach to the Ofla-Domzo bundh on the Cumbharjua canal, which is increasing over the years, is the main reason for damage to smaller bundhs. “Massive influx of water is weakening these bandhs. Repairs are a waste of money, as new breaches occur elsewhere,” a tenants association member said. KAC convenor Ramrao Wagh said that revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate has ordered an inspection of the bundh for repairs. The Dongorim farmers initiative to revive farming activities had spurred others to take us agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/breach-to-dongorim-bandh-likely-to-affect-kharif-season/articleshow/83099074.cms||Paul Fernandes

The police said that it wants to reach out to women from lower income group strata. “Sanitary napkins should be available easily to the domestic help, vegetable vendors and those who don’t come from a sound financial background. Their hygiene is important too,” Singh added. The cops have roped in Go Kart racing champ Mira Erda and shooting champion Anju Sharma as brand ambassador for their campaign.

A couple said that it was extremely hot today and hence decided to take in some cool breeze. “Social distancing is not an issue as vast stretches of the beaches had very few visitors,” it said. With shacks folding up their operations in April itself and restaurants shut, there is not much activity making it easier for the people to move around. At Benaulim beach, though police have placed a fibre barricade, there is ample space to maneuver a car through it. A lone policeman was seen convincing people not to go to the beach.

During the second wave of the pandemic, there is a strong need for precise and accurate treatment of patients. Clinicians need to have accurate assessment of a patient’s heart and lung, but this might put them at a risk of contracting the virus. “Keeping that in mind, we introduced the venue family – a group of three ultrasound products that meet all the key needs of clinicians and are equipped with AI features for better treatment of Covid patients,” Ashit Shah, head of ultrasound, GE Healthcare, South Asia, told TOI. The company developed their own platform to virtually launch the product simultaneously in South Asia, including Kolkata and Bengal markets, on May 15 and 16. Asked whether the utility of the tool is restricted to Covid treatment only, Shah explained that after the pandemic gets over, it can be used for critical care, OT, neonatology, musculoskeletal management and pain management among other medical areas. “Clinicians are continuously seeking diagnostic equipment that can help them accurately diagnose and treat patients,” Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-ultrasound-tool-launched-for-quick-covid-scan/articleshow/83097196.cms||Sarthak.G

The work was planned during the previous financial year, but since the PWD’s Goa Scheduled Rates (GSR) were revised, the file is pending for administrative approval. The 8 MLD (million litres per day) of 1.75 MGD (million gallons per day) was constructed during the Portuguese era and was commissioned in December 1957. Acclaimed engineer Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya selected the site and plant design. Since the 350mm diameter AC pipeline has turned very fragile, the water division wants to replace it with a new 508mm diameter MS pipeline. The cost of the project was estimated at Rs 4.3 crore as per the 2019 GSR (buildings) and (PHE). However, since the GSR has been revised, the project needs administrative approval, PWD executive engineer Nivruti Parsekar said. The Opa water works complex was originally an 8 MLD plant, but has undergone capacity expansions four times till now. First was 12 MLD plant in 1967, 55 MLD plant in 1972, 40 MLD plant in 2000 and the latest 27 MLD in 2020. These plants together treat and supply 140 MLD water to Tiswadi and Ponda talukas. This includes Panaji, Bambolim, Taleigao, Ribandar and the entire taluka of Ponda. The Opa weir was constructed in 1972 to raise the water level and also as a storage reservoir during the lean period from March to June. The weir height is 2.42m with a total length of about 82m across the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-65-yrs-opa-water-works-to-replace-its-main-pipeline/articleshow/83099359.cms||---

---||India||‘Zero loss’ of lives during operation Yaas, says NDRF DG||NEW DELHI: Drawing lessons from cyclone Tauktae which left 193 people dead, with an accident involving a large barge resulting in many casualties, the Centre’s disaster management set up along with states set a “zero loss” goal with another cyclone Yaas followed soon after. “Everybody, up to the PM, was keen on ‘zero loss’ (of lives) during cyclone Yaas,” S N Pradhan, director general of National Disaster Response Force, told TOI. The plan finalised saw NDRF overseeing evacuation of more than 15 lakh people in Bengal and over 7 lakh in Odisha, the two states directly in the path of cyclone Yaas, categorised as a very severe cyclonic storm, making a landfall south of Balasore on May 26. “It was a litmus test for us,” says Pradhan while speaking about the ‘zero loss’ target to be achieved in a severe category cyclone. It was nothing short of a miracle as the casualties were down to two deaths reported from Odisha’s Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts, he says. Pradhan said 106 teams of NDRF were used in the six cyclone affected states and Union Territory — 46 teams in West Bengal, 52 in Odisha, eight in Jharkhand and three each in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. One team was also deployed in the Andaman Islands. This was in addition to the involvement of the state disaster response force and troops of the civil defence and home guards from these states/UT. The NDRF DG said emphasis was laid on mass evacuation from coastal districts of affected states and UT. In all high-level meetings, chief secretaries and administrators of states and UT were impressed upon the need to evacuate a large population, he said. “Instructions were to evacuate one lakh extra if need be but ensure zero loss of lives. It is better to overdo the evacuation than underdo and have bodies in your hand,” the NDRF chief said. About the loss of lives during cyclone Tauktae, Pradhan said that there was some miscommunication leading to the tragedy of Barge P-305. According to a post-cyclone assessment report, the NDRF rescued 93 marooned people in Odisha and 873 in Bengal, saving lives. After the landfall, the troops cleared 634 km of roads in Odisha and 206 km in Bengal besides helping the state administration and the state disaster response force in other relief operations. The Yaas landfall came nine days after cyclone Tauktae hit the western coast on May 17 in which at least 193 people had died. Sixty-seven people died in Gujarat, mainly due to wall and building collapses. The highest casualty was, however, reported from Maharashtra where 70 people died on a single Barge P-305, an vessel hired by ONGC that broke anchors, drifted off the Mumbai coast and later sank in the Arabian Sea. Elsewhere in Maharashtra, 19 people died due to the cyclone, 20 in Kerala, nine in Karnataka and three in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/zero-loss-of-lives-during-operation-yaas-says-ndrf-dg/articleshow/83102713.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Now, while they want the same companies to manufacture enough vaccines for every Indian, another veteran demands an audit of these firms,” Puri tweeted. Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Saturday demanded a comptroller and auditor general-driven audit of vaccine production and supply in India to find out the ‘mystery of missing vaccines’. Puri said Chidambaram was a part of the Manmohan Singh government which witnessed dismantling of public sector vaccine manufacturing facilities in 2008. Puri referred to the Manmohan Singh government’s action of suspending production at the Central Research Institute, Kasauli, Pasteur Institute of India, Coonoor, and BCG Vaccines Lab, Chennai, since 15 January 2008 saying they didn’t comply with the good manufacturing practices clause under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, as well as those prescribed by WHO. “Is the suggested action against domestic firms designed to facilitate dependence on imported vaccines?” the minister further questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/union-minister-hardeep-puri-hits-back-as-p-chidambaram-demands-cag-probe-into-missing-vaccine/articleshow/83102769.cms||---

With an eye on 100% electrification, this project will provide power through renewable energy to areas where grid connectivity isn’t feasible. The project is pursuant to an agreement signed by the Goa energy development agency (GEDA) with Convergence energy services limited (CESL). The project Sawant announced would be CESL’s first off-grid engagement, and will install and maintain photovoltaic (PV) systems for five years under the government’s remote village electrification programme. It will be executed through gram panchayats. “It is a proud moment for us to announce that we will achieve 100% electrification for all homes in Goa, and that too with clean energy. We have made policy decisions for Goa to transition to a green state in a fast and concerted way. I congratulate GEDA and CESL for their good work,” said Sawant at the inauguration. “In Goa, we are committed to provide green and clean energy access to every single household,” said power minister Nilesh Cabral. “We are very happy that on Goa Statehood Day, we are flagging off this high-impact and crucial project and that GEDA and CESL are working together towards expanding solar access to off-grid and kachha houses in the state.” Chief secretary Parimal Rai said that remote rural communities will greatly benefit from this programme. “Our national climate goals will get a fillip from state actions, and Goa, with its policies, has increased its ambitions. Our outreach to the remotest corner will strengthen climate resilience of communities and contribute to climate change mitigation,” he said.  Power secretary Kunal said that the programme would improve the economy of rural households, and will contribute to inclusive local growth. “Goa’s villages will benefit from solar lighting, cheaper electricity and this project is important for Goa’s energy transition, and will steer rural development and growth. In the coming days, it will also increase off-grid solar electricity demand in rural area, which will in turn improve services,” he said.  GEDA member secretary Sanjeev Joglekar said that the agency is very happy that CESL has begun work immediately. “The solar lighting programme will contribute to India’s climate action and in achieving the country’s renewable energy targets,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-eyes-100-electrification-launches-solar-power-prog-for-remote-villages/articleshow/83099503.cms||---
---||World||Immediate need to rally democracies together against Covid-19: Congressman Krishnamoorthi||WASHINGTON: There is an immediate need to rally our democracies together against Covid-19 pandemic and for the United States to fulfil its promise of vaccine aid to India while further building on this support, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said on Sunday. Stating that achieving global herd immunity is the right thing to do out of compassion and morality, the Congressman asserted that he approaches questions of policy as an American and as an elected member of the Democratic Party. “I do not support, endorse, or affiliate myself with the views of any political party, individual, or group in India, such as the BJP, Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi, the RSS or any other Indian organisation or individual, any more than I have any affiliation with the American Republican Party,” Krishnamoorthi said. It is absolutely in the interests of all people to make sure everyone gets vaccinated across the United States, India, and the rest of the world, to bring this pandemic to an end, he said. The Democratic lawmaker from Illinois also noted that External Minister S Jaishankar's recent visit to the US served as “another reminder of the immediate need to rally our democracies together against the ongoing pandemic and for the United States to fulfil its promise of vaccine aid to India while further building on this support”. He said he has repeatedly urged the Biden administration to continue and expand its international vaccine distribution efforts in support of India and other nations facing the most serious outbreaks. “It is also why I will soon be introducing the Nullifying Opportunities for Variants to Infect and Decimate (NOVID) Act which would bring global vaccination rates to more than 60 per cent through dramatically scaling up these international efforts with increased aid, expanded private sector production, and enhanced international cooperation. “These efforts would help to save lives in the near term while also building the international foundation we need to truly end this pandemic,” the Congressman said. He also stressed that achieving global herd immunity is the smartest thing to do in the current time. “Achieving global herd immunity is not just the right thing to do out of compassion and morality, it is also the smartest thing to do because the only way to end this global pandemic is through a global approach that ends the outbreaks before they enable the mutations of the virus which could destroy all the progress we have made,” he said. “The success of these efforts depends on international cooperation and the continued success of the US-India partnership in this endeavour, as with so many others, is paramount to the shared interests of our nations and humanity more broadly. “Because of this, it must be beyond politics, and beyond any partisan or ideological affiliation,” Krishnamoorthi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/immediate-need-to-rally-democracies-together-against-covid-19-congressman-krishnamoorthi/articleshow/83102776.cms||---

This was the fourth such incident over the past fortnight. Earlier, the police had busted similar parties at farmhouses in areas nearby Khadakwasala dam backwaters and near Donje at the foothills of the Sinhagad fort. Around 2am on Saturday, the police got the tip that a party was going on in the Kelwade farmhouse. After reaching the spot, a police team comprising inspector Sandeep Ghorpade, sub-inspector Shrikant Joshi and others, found that blaring music was playing in the two-storey, brightly lit farmhouse.  "The youths, in their 20s and 30s, were taken into custody and a case was registered against them for violating the Covid-19 regulations and for an unlawful assembly," Dhananjay Patil, deputy superintendent of police, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-police-bust-dance-party-at-farmhouse-13-booked/articleshow/83102802.cms||---

The staff of Sunderbans Tiger Reserve’s Harikhali camp, parts of which are still inundated and around which the tiger was first seen on Saturday, turned all their attention to rescue and revive the big cat. “They were initially jittery to approach the tiger, that was sitting on the banks of the sweet water pond near the camp. But considering its condition, they braved the situation and approached it on Saturday. They offered it chicken and water, but it didn’t have it,” said chief wildlife warden VK Yadav. It is suspected that the condition of the 11-year-old male tiger, that was already weak, had probably turned worse after it got stuck in tide water on the day of cyclone Yaas and on subsequent days when high tide made the situation worse, with the storm water taking time to recede. On Sunday morning, it looked feeble. “It was unable to move. Our staff reached the spot and provided it saline, water and tried to revive it. But it died around 10am,” said Yadav, adding that it was being brought to Sajnekhali forest camp for further treatment, but it died on its way. The postmortem revealed that it was a natural death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/12-hour-rescue-op-to-save-tiger-in-flood-ravaged-sunderbans-fails/articleshow/83102805.cms||---

This is faster than the average speed of Rajdhani trains. On Saturday, three freight trains ran at an average speed of more than 99 kmph on the 331-km New Khurja-New Bhaupur section, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last December. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation (DFCCIL) said so far 137 trains have attained an average speed of more than 90 kmph on this section. The other section, the 306 km between Rewari and Madar on the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC), was opened on January 7. Till Saturday 4,000 trains were operated on these two stretches. More than 3,000 trains were run on the EDFC. The DFCCIL said there are several factors that have ensured high speed operation of freight trains on these corridors. First, the double line electric track allows higher haulage at higher speeds. Secondly, since the corridors are only meant for freight trains, there is no mixed traffic and there is no speed restriction all along the route. “The curve of not more than 2.5 degrees helps in achieving the speed of 100 kmph,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/freight-train-runs-at-99kmph-pips-rajdhanis-in-average-speed/articleshow/83102834.cms||---

The most popular international destination for Indian travellers, the UAE imposed restrictions on flyers from India from April 25 due to the unfolding Covid catastrophe here and has extended the curbs, from time to time, ever since. To be sure, all the over 20 countries which have imposed resections on travel from India starting mid-April when Covid situation was beginning to get out of hand here — either in the form of flight suspension (like Canada, Hong Kong) or allowing entry to very few categories of visitors from here (like the US, the UK, Germany, and the UAE) — will lift the same only when the pandemic is under control here. “Emirates has suspended passenger flights from India… until June 30, 2021. Furthermore, passengers who have transited through India in the last 14 days will not be accepted for travel from any other point to the UAE. UAE nationals, holders of UAE golden visas, and members of diplomatic missions who comply with the revised published Covid protocols will be exempt for travel,” Emirates said on Sunday. The UAE has in past few days placed stricter rules to prevent the fast-spreading virus mutant playing havoc in India, at the moment, from reaching its shores by tightening regulations. It has barred business jet operators from selling individual seats on charters headed to the country from Covid hotspots, including from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uae-extends-travel-restrictions-from-india-till-june-30/articleshow/83102819.cms||---

However, the relaxation will not apply for Noida, Ghaziabad and 18 other districts that have more than 600 active Covid cases. While Noida has around 1,400 active cases, Ghaziabad has 1,760. As part of unlock provisions in the other districts, shops, markets and supermarkets will start operating between 7am and 7pm while adhering to Covid safety protocols. Malls, clubs, gyms and cinemas will, however, continue to remain shut. Marriage functions will be allowed with only 25 guests in an open space. For cremations, 20 people will be allowed. The order said frontline government departments would start operating with full capacity, while the other offices would function with 50% strength on a rotational basis. Private companies will also function with all safety protocols in place. They will, however, encourage the system of work from home, besides setting up a Covid helpdesk in their office. Banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions will also open. Likewise, industries will also start functioning and their employees will be allowed to move after showing their ID cards. Vegetable markets will start operating and those in highly populated areas will be relocated. School, colleges and other educational institutes will remain shut and online classes will continue. In Noida, officials said active cases were reducing with each day. From 1,000 in the beginning of the month, the district has been reporting 100 fresh cases a day now on an average. “As a society, it is now our responsibility to ensure that the graph does not go up. Cases are reducing, but people should still remain cautious and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Noida district magistrate Suhas LY said. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said multiple steps were being taken to curb the spread of the infection and bring the district out of the lockdown. “We have decided to implement the voluntary community containment programme in urban areas now. It was initially implemented in 41 villages. Its outcome was quite positive. I have held meetings with RWAs and traders’ associations to adopt this programme, which focuses on strict adherence to Covid protocols through residents’ participation. Moreover, I have asked the health department to monitor patients in private Covid hospitals and ensure they are not kept admitted unnecessarily,” the DM added.

Devgn’s spokesperson confirmed to TOI that the star has purchased the property located in the very lane where he currently resides. However, the price of the bungalow was not revealed by him, but real estate sources. The locality is home to other celebrities, including Hrithik Roshan, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra and Akshay Kumar. Sources said that the Devgns were looking for a new home for the past one year. The deal was struck last November-December and the Kapole Co operative Housing Society transferred the bungalow in the joint name of Veena Virendra Devgn and Vishal alias Ajay Devgn on May 7. The bungalow was earlier owned by the late Pushpa Valia. Real estate sources said that the existing price rate of the bungalow is around Rs 65 to 70 crores, but due to the pandemic Devgn may have bought it at a discounted rate. Sources said that Devgan took possession of the bungalow and the actor has even started renovation work as he wants to redevelop his existing bungalow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ajay-devgn-buys-new-home-worth-60-crore/articleshow/83102839.cms||Ahmed Ali

The Andhra Pradesh government laid the foundation stone for the project in March and the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) is now looking to rehabilitate people who are set to lose their homes on account of the project. Monsoon floods on the river Krishna bund from Padmavathi ghat to Yanamalakuduru affects around 55,000 families every year. Homes on the riverbed inundate even in minor floods and civic authorities have to take the flood victims to relief camps. The retaining wall project started back in 2011 but was put aside for a few years due to a lack of funds. Finally, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy sanctioned Rs 125 crore to build a 1.5km-long retaining wall. Meanwhile, families losing their homes to the project have urged the Vijayawada civic body to demolish houses only after relocating them. Left parties in the area have extended support to these families and demanded immediate house allocations. In a recent meeting with officials, Vijayawada mayor Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi enquired about the status of the project. The mayor asked officials to prepare an action plan for the construction of houses for families to be relocated. VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said that the irrigation department will be consulted and a decision will be taken on construction of houses. Irrigation authorities said that project works will gather pace after the withdrawal of curfew and the department will complete works in a phased manner before the floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/retaining-wall-on-krishna-river-bank-soon-vmc-starts-making-plans-for-rehabilitation/articleshow/83096199.cms||Venu Lanka
---||India||These kids trek 6 km daily for e-classes||IDUKKI: Kerala will mark the beginning of another academic year of digital education on Tuesday but learning at home continues to be a dream for many students in Idukki. Preliminary data with Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK), the school education programme of the state government, show that 2,015 students in the district don’t have access to online education. A group of students, including girls, has been walking over six kilometres from Rajamala estate division of Kanan Devan Hills Plantations in Munnar to Eravikulam National Park for the past several months to attend online classes. TOI had reported their plight in January and the situation has not changed yet. Aparna R, a plus-one student of Adimali Govt Higher Secondary School, confirmed this, saying they still walk to the park every day as there is no proper mobile network in Rajamala to attend the classes. She was residing at Pettimudy near Munnar earlier, and her family had shifted to Rajamala after a landslide on August 6 which claimed 70 lives. Job J Neriamparampil, assistant wildlife warden of Eravikulam National Park, said students sitting by the roadside with their mobile phones is a regular scene at the park. “I have been seeing them almost everyday for the past several months. Even inside the park, they get proper mobile network,” he said. The situation is not confined to Rajamala as many areas in the district lack proper net connectivity. SSK district programme officer Bindumol D said they are collecting details of students who cannot access online education. Idukki district collector H Dineshan said network connection would be ensured in Rajamala within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/these-kids-trek-6-km-daily-for-e-classes/articleshow/83102853.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Visakhapatnam||Free power to farmers in Andhra Pradesh for next 30 years||VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government has decided to continue to provide free power for agriculture for the next 30 years. The power utilities of Andhra Pradesh are currently supplying free power to more than 18 lakh agricultural services. The state government is developing necessary power infrastructure to continue the scheme for the next 30 years. As part of this, the government will exclusively set up a 10,000 MW solar power plant for making the free power scheme a permanent one. The state government already spent about Rs 1,700 crore on upgrading agriculture feeders to supply 9-hour free power in two spells during day. The subsidy given by the government to the agricultural sector in the 2018-19 financial year was Rs 6,030 crore against Rs 8,559 crore in 2020-21, representing a Rs 2,529 crore or 40 per cent additional subsidy. State energy minister, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, said that it is a historic decision taken by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to continue the free power scheme for the next 30 years. “No state in the country has taken such a bold decision,” said Reddy. During a review meeting on the 9-hour power scheme through teleconference, the minister said that farming sector undoubtedly is the backbone of the state economy. “The state government is giving highest priority to the agriculture sector. All the farmers in the state are happy with the effective implementation of the power scheme. The state is witnessing a significant change in the agriculture sector for the last two years. This would help boost economy and improve livelihoods of farmers,” said Srinivasa Reddy. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the nearly 6,000 agricultural feeders consume around 15,700 million units of energy per annum, equivalent to the 24% of the total energy demand (66,000 MU per annum) of the state. “The state government sanctioned more than 1.3 lakh new agriculture connections in the last two years. The state government introduced DBT (direct benefit transfer) scheme as a farmer-friendly policy. It would fortify the rights of farmers in getting free power for agriculture purpose and enhance the accountability and responsibility among power utilities,” said Srikant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/free-power-to-farmers-in-ap-for-next-30-years/articleshow/83096230.cms||---

His Delhi trip assumes significance as he is touted to be meeting BJP leaders JP Nadda on Monday morning, sources confirmed, and Union home minister Amit Shah later. He left for Delhi along with senior BJP leader G Vivek and former TRS MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy. Eatala, who had considerable stature within the TRS party, was dropped from the cabinet following his alleged involvement in a land encroachment case for his poultry farm, a charge denied by the family. Eatala was in consultation with Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee and state BJP unit ever since he was dropped from the cabinet and has not denied speculation of his joining the BJP. Despite countering the TRS regime on the allegations, Eatala has not resigned either from the party or relinquished the post of Huzurabad MLA. The Karimnagar Lok Sabha seat, under which the Huzurabad assembly constituency falls, is currently represented by BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and in the past, was held by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Eatala, a strong face from the Telangana statehood movement, has been alleging that Telangana ideologues are being ignored in the TRS.

While the SHO and three policmen were suspended on Saturday, the entire staff was sent to police lines on Sunday. According to police, Bhajan Lal Meena had a confrontation with his cousin’s family on Friday and Saturday in which both the parties used batons and iron rods against each other. Meena’s family alleged that police had been unfair and did not hear their version. On Saturday, police brought Meena to the police station where he suddenly fell down and became unconscious. “It is yet to be learnt how he fell down and became unconscious. He was rushed to a primary health centre from where he was sent to the district hospital. After his health deteriorated, he was rushed to SMS Hospital where he succumbed to injuries. We have suspended three policemen including the SHO and have sent 30 others to police lines for a fair investigation in the case,” said Sawai Madhopur SP Sudhir Chaudhary. After his death, his family initially accused police of atrocities. However, on Sunday evening, the deceased’s brother lodged an FIR of murder against the rival family members. “Under what circumstances he fell down at the police station and did he get any fresh injury at the police station are a few things which would be probed through investigation. Also, it would be seen if his previous injuries led to his death or he was thrashed at the police station as well,” said a senior officer of Sawai Madhopur police on the condition of anonymity. Initially the family members were reluctant of post mortem. However, on Sunday after noticing action against police officers the post mortem was conducted and funeral took place in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-three-cops-suspended-30-sent-to-police-lines-after-man-dies-in-barwada-police-station/articleshow/83102845.cms||---

---||India||Cops: Number of Kumbh pilgrims not downgraded||DEHRADUN: Senior officials of Uttarakhand police have discounted reports which claimed that the pilgrim headcount of shahi snans was revised from 49 lakh to 21 lakh as claimed in some media reports recently, saying that “once an official estimate is released, it cannot be revised,” reports Gaurav Talwar. Denying making any downward revision of the number of people attending Kumbh Mela, Sanjay Gunjyal, Inspector General (IG), Kumbh, said, “The three shahi snan days that fell during the notified period of the one-month Kumbh this year saw over 34 lakh people taking a holy dip in Ganga.” Providing a breakup, he said that 21.2 lakh people bathed in the river on April 12 on Somwati Amavasya, 13.5 lakh on Mesh Sankranti on April 14 and over 25,000 people on Chaitra Purnima on April 27. When asked about the procedure used in counting the number of pilgrims, Gunjyal said that “an artificial intelligence solution equipped with sophisticated cameras, along with a count of the tentative number of vehicles at border check posts and parking lots, was used for undertaking the head count.” The government’s denial came after some media reports claimed that the official attendance figure for the period between April 12 and 14 — when two major snans took place — was significantly less than what was claimed by the mela administration at that time. As per official data, endorsed by Kumbh Police, pilgrim footfall was 21.2 lakh on April 12, 4.5 lakh on April 13 and 13.5 lakh on April 14. The mela administration however had claimed soon after the shahi snans that 31 lakh people (not 21.2 lakh) took a dip on April 12. Commenting on the disparity in figures for the April 12 shahi snan, DGP Ashok Kumar said, “It seems that the figure of 31 lakh released on April 12 was a combined figure of the number of pilgrims gathered in Haridwar on April 10, 11 and 12. However, this would not result in any change in the overall figure of pilgrim headcount released by the government for the Kumbh Mela duration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cops-number-of-kumbh-pilgrims-not-downgraded/articleshow/83102871.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Releasing a booklet ‘Rendellalo Vidhwamsam’ (Destruction In Two Years) at the party office here in Vizag city, Atchannaidu said after coming to power Jagan Mohan Reddy began his rule with a vindictive attitude and tarnished the image of Andhra Pradesh. The CM began by demolishing Praja Vedika and is still continuing the demolition of properties of people who are critical of his government, alleged the TDP leader. The TDP state president said JCB, ACB and PCB have become the CM’s tagline to take on opposition parties in the state. The CM has taken over the Crime Investigation Department (CID) completely and has unleashed terror among opposition leaders, he alleged. He said the YSRC government has driven the state into a debt trap of Rs one lakh crore. Each individual in AP now has Rs one lakh debt, he said. The TDP leader said that the then chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had managed to get Rs 52,000 crore sanctioned for Polavaram project but Jagan succeeded in getting only Rs 26,000 crore. In the name of reverse tendering, the YSRC government allotted works to cronies.

Gadchiroli collector Dipak Singla and his Nagpur counterpart Ravindra Thakare are asking local village ‘doctors’ like hakims or bhoomkals and pujaris or priests to first take the jab themselves and then encourage the villagers to do the same. The district administrations are also approaching the peoples’ representatives to promote the vaccination drive. The district administrations have also started awareness campaigns in local languages, including the tribal ones like Gondi and Madia, spoken in eastern Vidarbha’s Maoist-affected Gadchiroli. Healthcare teams are also visiting remote places to get villagers vaccinated in the Maoist hotbed of Abhujamadh along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. Singla said that a 21-point awareness campaign has been started to first target the hamlets where there is least resistance. The campaign will then move on to villages that are completely refusing vaccination. “We are roping in local doctors, who provide the first line of treatment to the villagers. Once these local doctors are vaccinated, they can motivate the villagers,” said Singla. He said help will also be taken from opinion-makers like tribal activist Devaji Tofa and other well-known personalities to boost vaccination. Gadchiroli’s district health officer Dr Shashikant Shambarkar said his team first vaccinated the pujari at a small hamlet in Chamorshi taluka and another at Dhanora. The villagers followed them. Thakare, who feels the anticipated third wave may hit the villagers more than the urban population, is keen to intensify the vaccination drive in rural parts, especially in the tribal belt of Nagpur district. “We want to capitalize on the trust the local population has in hakims and others who use herbs for treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-ropes-in-hakims-to-beat-tribals-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/83102879.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Rs 450 crore-project is expected to come up in 600 acres land and is intended to stop migration of fishermen from the delta area. The harbour is part of the state government’s proposal to make eight fishing harbours in the state at a cumulative cost of Rs 3,000 crore. While the government has already called tenders for four fishing harbours in the first phase, the Narsapuram fishing harbour is part of the second phase. West Godavari district has a 19km-long coastline and sees nearly Rs 250crore worth of exports in marine products every year. But there are no jetties or adequate places to anchor boats properly in the area. As of now, the fishing boats are anchored at a bund of river Godavari. Narsapuram MLA M Prasada Raju said, “We have planned to develop link roads from the proposed fishing harbour. Land acquisition has already been done for that. This fishing harbour will turn Narsapuram and its surrounding areas into a developed space.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/narsapuram-harbour-tender-call-by-september/articleshow/83096422.cms||Siva G

As per data available on government beds on the BBMP website, the situation is far better among Covid general beds than other categories of beds. Of the total 7,195 general beds, 5,624 (or 78.1%) were available by 3pm on Sunday. In high-dependency units with oxygenated beds, 2,098 (or 42.4%) of 4,945 beds were available. But the situation is not the same with ICU beds and ICU beds with ventilators. As per the website, only 20 (3.3%) of 589 ICU beds and just 10 (or 1.5%) of 637 ICU beds with ventilators are available. While six ICU beds with ventilator were available in Rainbow Children's Hospital and one each was vacant in government hospital, Anekal; KC General Hospital, Oxford Medical College Hospital and Research Centre and Dr BR Ambedkar Medical College Hospital. The government beds are those in government hospitals and those in private hospitals which are reserved for patients to be referred and whose treatment is funded by public authorities. Doctors in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute said all 60 ventilator beds in Victoria Hospital were full, while 27 of the 35 ventilator beds in PMSSY hospital were occupied and the rest blocked. Bed demand down by 30% in pvt hospsDr CR Jayanthi, dean-cum-director, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, told TOI: “Some of the patients are on ventilator for 15-20 days. Slow recovery in severe Covid cases is leading to a prolonged stay.” The demand for Covid beds has reduced by 30% in private hospitals, according to Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA). Its president Dr HM Prasanna said that 20% of high-dependency units with oxygenated beds are vacant and ICU beds are fully occupied. As on May 29, the number of active cases in Bengaluru was 1.6 lakh, of which over 80% are in home isolation. The number of fresh cases were less than 5,000 on Saturday. Bengaluru’s Covid-19 incidence hit a peak on May 6 when 23,706 fresh cases were reported and the city had 3.3 lakh active cases. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that the availability of Covid beds has eased over the past 10-15 days. “From 10,000 enquiries our call centres used to receive, we get 2,000 a day. We faced a tidal surge, but it has gradually declined,” he added. BBMP officers said 28 Covid care centres set up by the government are largely vacant and not all need to be continued. Prasanna said that PHANA will wait till mid-June and then ask for gradual release of 50% beds taken over by the government in private hospitals. “The government has reserved 50% of beds in private hospitals and 75% beds in private medical colleges to patients sent by public authorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-78-beds-in-bengaluru-vacant-icus-ventilators-near-full/articleshow/83102916.cms||Sunitha Rao R
