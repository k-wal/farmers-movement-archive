A stray bullet fired by the robbers in their bid to escape with the booty also hit a passerby, who was rushed to a hospital at Dighwara for treatment. The incident took place around 11.30am when Rahul Kumar, the clerk-cum-cashier of Utkarsh Finance Company, was on way to deposit the cash in the Dighwara branch of Bank of India. Four bike-borne criminals intercepted him and attempted to snatch the bag containing cash. When Rahul (27) resisted, he was shot at and injured in his leg. The criminals fired at least 10 rounds in the air to create panic among local residents and businessmen. However, one of the bullets hit one Ankit Kumar (21), who was crossing the road. Both Rahul and Ankit were rushed to a government facility at Dighwara from where they were later referred to PMCH for better treatment. Their condition was stated to be out of danger. Additional SP (Sonepur) Anjani Kumar said raids were on to nab the criminals involved in the incident under Dighwara police station area in the district. CCTV footage was being obtained to ascertain the identity of the robbers. A team of senior police officials later quizzed the injured cashier, stated to be a resident of Bhootnath Road in Patna. Another injured, Ankit, is a resident of Fardaha village in Saran district. Earlier on May 4, unidentified criminals had looted Rs18 lakh from a private courier company at Ekma in Saran district. “The criminals are committing crime despite a complete lockdown in the state,” rued Dighwara resident RB Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pvt-firm-staff-shot-at-robbed-of-rs9l-in-saran/articleshow/82533155.cms||---

According to numbers sourced from dealer body FADA (Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association), total vehicle retail in April stood at 11.8 lakh units against 16.5 lakh units in March this year. The fall was led by reversals in uptake of two-wheelers (-28%); passenger cars and SUV/UVs (-25%); commercial vehicles (-24%); three-wheelers (-43%); and tractors (-45%). With most auto companies going in for plant shutdown, the dealer inventory is expected to cater to retails in May. Currently the average dealer stock for passenger vehicles is 15-17 days and for two wheelers is 30-35 days. Already the first 9 days of May have seen extremely lean sales due to lockdown by a majority of states, said FADA president Vinkesh Gulati. “Where dealerships are open, walk-ins have dropped to 30% and customers are delaying purchase decisions,” he added. FADA sources its numbers from the government’s Vahan registration data, but this does not have figures for Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Lakshwadeep and Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/auto-retail-sales-hit-8-year-low-registrationsdown-30-in-fy21/articleshow/82533172.cms||---
---||Patna||Four Muzaffarpur lab technicians among 5 held for selling test kits to private hospitals||PATNA: The Muzaffarpur police on Monday busted a racket involved in sale of antigen kits meant for two government hospitals – sadar hospital and Sakra referral hospital – and arrested five people, including four lab technicians of the health department. Around 4,000 antigen and PPE kits were seized from a house at Susta Markan village under the Sakra police station in the district. The antigen test kits were being sold to different private hospitals in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and Samastipur districts. Sources said one Luv Kumar, a lab technician posted at sadar hospital, was arrested on Saturday on charges of selling antigen test kits. During interrogation, Luv disclosed the names of his associates who were involved in the illegal trade. The police later arrested Mukesh Anand, Deepak, Mithilesh Kumar and Awadhesh Kumar Salaskar. While Mukesh and Deepak were serving as lab assistants at the sadar hospital, Mithilesh used to run an ambulance on the same campus. Awadesh, on the other hand, was posted as lab technician at Sakra referral hospital in the district. The accused used to collect antigen test kits from the sadar hospital and Sakra referral hospital by furnishing fake documents and ID proofs and subsequently sell them to private hospitals. Sanjay Thakur, a close relative of Luv, used to contact the private hospitals for supplying the test kits. During preliminary investigation, it came to light that 400 antigen test kits were being sold to the private hospitals per day on an average. The private hospitals used to charge from people anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 for each test. Muzaffarpur (east) DSP Sanjay Pandey said a huge quantity of test kits, sanitizers and gloves was seized from Susta Markan village. The consignment was stocked there for supply to different private hospitals in the district and its adjoining areas. “An FIR has been lodged with the Sakra police station in this connection,” the DSP said, adding more people were involved in the illegal sale of test kits. Meanwhile, the health department has initiated a probe into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-muz-lab-technicians-among-5-held-for-selling-test-kits-to-private-hospitals/articleshow/82533182.cms||Ramashankar

Consequently, the state has a negative wastage record, administering vaccines to more people than intended in the consignments it has received till now. Till Sunday, Bengal had administered about 119.7 lakh doses against 1,22,74,200 doses supplied from the Government of India channel. “Since our wastage factor is negative due to efficient vaccine administration in the field level, we could save about 3.5 lakh doses. We thus have about 6.5 lakh doses vaccine in stock instead of 3 lakh,” said director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. Vaccine wastage has become a major concern at a time when the country is facing an acute supply shortage of shots in the face of the raging second wave. Among all the states and union territories, Lakshadweep has the worst record. According to the latest data with the Union health and family welfare, the archipelago in the Arabian Sea recorded the highest vaccine wastage at 22.7%, followed by Haryana (6.7%), Assam (6.1%), Rajasthan (5.5%), Punjab (5.1%), Bihar (5%), Dadra and Nagar Haveli (4.9%), Meghalaya (4.2%), Tamil Nadu (3.9%) and Manipur (3.6%). “As far as Covishield is concerned, the wastage in Bengal is -4%, meaning for every 1 lakh doses, we could administer an additional 4,000 doses,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. Sources in the health department said that for Covaxin the wastage is just about 1%. This, they pointed out, is due to wastage during the initial days of the vaccine’s introduction. Covaxin was rolled out in the state on February 6. “The wastage is due to the mixed response in the initial days where many questioned the Covaxin’s efficacy data and we would find only a few takers. But now the wastage does not happen any longer,” said a health official. A vial that contains 10 doses once opened has to be utilised within four hours otherwise the remaining doses have to be discarded. Therefore, there has to be sufficient number of people willing to take the jab at a time when a vial is opened for optimum use. “Also from day one, our nurses noticed that they could draw around 11 doses from some Covishield vials. In order for optimal if there were only 4 persons waiting at a time when a vial was to be opened we would request people to wait a few minutes another 6 to 7 persons to turn up. This helped us prevent wastage and also ensure extra dose from many vials,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhaya, vaccination programme supervisor at ID Hospital Beliaghata. The state is currently giving weightage to the second dose due to the short supply. “As far as second dose is concerned we are second in the country with a coverage of 35.5% after Andhra Pradesh (36.4%). However, total vaccination in Bengal much higher than Andhra Pradesh,” said the DHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-negative-wastage-state-saves-3-5l-vax-doses/articleshow/82533199.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Despite trying for days, we did not get a hospital bed for my ‘mama’ (maternal uncle). We had to toil for hours to arrange oxygen cylinders for him. My ‘mama’ was on oxygen for over four days,” rues Piyush Bhatt, a finance consultant in Ahmedabad. Bhatt is left lamenting as the septuagenarian NRI couple’s — Rashmikant Raval (73) and his wife Sushila (72) — died of Covid in span of two days last month. Raval, a retired hotel and catering business owner, passed away in Ahmedabad on April 23, while Sushila succumbed the next day. “After making rounds of crematoriums, it was at the fourth one that I was able to perform the last rites of my uncle. I faced same problems while cremating my aunt,” Bhatt said. The US-based couple came to India in February spend some time with childhood friends and family after over a year of remaining locked in their house in Austin, Texas, due to global pandemic. The two had promised their grandchildren in the US that they will return soon. But they could never make the return journey. The couple arrived in India on February 27 and did not take Covid-19 vaccine in the US. As the condition worsened in India they took the first dose of the vaccine in Ahmedabad on April 3 and 4. Sushila tested positive for Covid-19 on April 16 while Raval developed symptoms on April 19. But Raval tested negative in all three test he underwent. For days Raval searched for a hospital bed for himself, but in vain. “After approaching several hospitals and trying for over 12 hours my mother was finally admitted to one. But my father did not get admission in any hospital since his reports were negative. His CT-Scan showed infection in chest. For three days he was taken to multiple hospitals in an ambulance but they refused to admit him,” said Rakesh, elder son of Raval. Raval, who hailed from Choila village in Sabarkantha, lived with Rakesh, a businessman, in Austin, Texas. The family owns a fuel pump, restaurant and few stores that they have currently rented out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/nri-couple-who-came-for-family-time-die-of-covid/articleshow/82533204.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Last month, the state had announced it was setting up 55 oxygen plants in various government hospitals to meet the demand in the coming weeks. Empty cylinders will be required to store and transport oxygen to various hospitals and satellite facilities where Covid-19 patients might be admitted. In the past few weeks, it has been noticed that on several occasions, the oxygen is available but there are no cylinders to transport them as some people tend to hoard them. “The government has already floated the tender and the process of procurement has already started,” said a health department official. “This is a part of our preparations as government is already setting up oxygen plants in several hospitals. We will need the cylinders to store and transport oxygen,” said the official. In the last week of April, the state government had said there was no oxygen deficit in the state as it produces 475 mt daily while the demand is 223 mt daily. But the situation has been fast evolving and cases have been rising daily with demand of oxygen going up. Several private facility providers are importing cylinders from China, too. “The demand has increased and it might go up in the coming weeks which is why the government wants to be prepared. It has been noticed that most critical patients have low oxygen saturation and require oxygen,” said the official. On Sunday, 15 oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators arrived from Odisha. Last week, 75 oxygen cylinders arrived from Ranchi. All the cylinders have been stored at a government facility in north Kolkata and will be sent to hospitals according to the demand. “We are taking reports from all centres on a daily basis and trying to assess how much the demand is rising. The oxygen cylinders will be dispatched depending on the demand,” said an official of Central Drug Store of the health department. Along with cylinders, the government is also procuring oxygen concentrators from various sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oxygen-breather-govt-to-procure-6k-empty-cylinders/articleshow/82533207.cms||Zeeshan Javed

While 3.5 lakh doses have been procured by the state on its own, about 4 lakh doses have come from the Government of India. On Sunday, the state had purchased one lakh Covaxin doses from the manufacturers. While the vaccines purchased by the state will be used for phase three inoculation drive, the vials from the Centre will be used for second dose. Employees at the state’s Central Family Welfare Store were busy sorting out the vials from different districts right after the shipment arrived at the vaccine warehouse from Kolkata airport in the evening. “The process of sending vials to districts will continue till late into the night. We want to ensure that at least in some districts, the vials reach each place by Tuesday morning and afternoon,” said a source at the store. The supply crisis has forced the state to prioritize on the second dose for now. Since the private hospitals have stopped vaccination since May 1 the government has also asked private centres to redirect those, whose second doses are due, to government units. There is a tremendous pressure on the government vaccination centres. “There is shortage of vaccine and for that we have stressed on the second dose for now. The first dose is restricted to only healthcare and frontline workers now,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director, health services. On Tuesday, 1,289 sessions were held across the state where close to 1.3 lakh doses were administered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/states-3-5l-direct-purchase-among-7-5l-covishield-arrivals/articleshow/82533212.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Many private universities held online convocations and sent the degree certificates to their students’ homes via the department of posts. But the Maharashtra Public Universities Act is binding and all state universities must hold an official convocation ceremony to award the degree certificate . The lack of the degree certificate has hampered many students, especially those planning to study abroad. A parent said, “My son completed his BBA from an affiliated college to SPPU and he applied for higher studies in a university in the UK. While he has got a provisional admission there, till the time we don’t submit his degree certificate, the admission cannot be confirmed. We fear that if we are unable to submit the degree certificate on time, he may lose his place in the university. Due to Covid 19, students are not allowed to visit the SPPU office. There is no reply to emails sent to the university and even phone calls to the university are not picked up. This issue needs to be resolved urgently .”Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation, said while the convocation ceremony for students who graduated in October 2020 was scheduled in April 2021, due to the surge in Covid 19 cases, the event had to be postponed indefinitely. “It is compulsory for the university to conduct the convocation ceremony to award the degrees but due to the strict restrictions put in place by the district administration, a proper ceremony may not be possible and is also not safe at the moment. The university now plans to write to the governor of the state, who is also the chancellor of all public universities, asking if a truncated version of the ceremony can be conducted online so that degree certificates can be finally issued to students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppus-batch-of-2020-waits-for-degree-certificates/articleshow/82533217.cms||Ardhra Nair

Cops are now suggesting walking along with the cycle rather than risk being on the road. The victim — Manohar Lal Shaw — was on his way towards Mominpore when he was hit on the southern slope of the bridge. The cops believe a private car racing on the bridge hit the cyclist. “CCTV footage helped fix up the vehicle involved in the accident,” said a fatal squad officer. The police said that no cycle is allowed on bridges and flyovers. “This is a common rule which cannot be compromised for the safety of citizens,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Those in traffic guards though say that in places where there are no other options — the Bailey Bridge that was being used as an alternative to the Jai Hind Bridge at Majerhat has been shut down — the only way was to walk down with the cycle. “Use the pavements. Else, in places like Jai Hind Bridge, you can walk down the bridge, climb up the bridge right before the rail tracks and then cross over and get off again at the other end of the pedestrian walkway,” explained an officer. The Majerhat Jai Hind bridge has seen a sharp increase in cycle movement after local train services were shut. “We are forced to keep cops at both ends of the bridge from 6am,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-cycle-on-bridge-walk-cops-safety-plan/articleshow/82533218.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The association has stated that like other states, Maharashtra should admit students based on CET scores for first two rounds, while the third round onwards admissions should be opened for students who have not given CET based on Std XII scores. The admissions of all professional courses after Std XII should start and end on the same date and students should also be allowed to switch between courses at the time of admissions smoothly were among the suggestions.A meeting on May 7 online was attended by representatives of over 70 institutes in the state. It discussed the disparity in entrance exam and admissions for professional courses after Std XII.Founder president of the association Ramdas Zol said the CET cell also announced to bring about this uniformity in the test and admissions on March 22, 2019 however there was no implementation after the announcement.“We have taken suggestions from the principals of colleges and education experts on how the system could be made better and friendly for students for the upcoming admission season,” he said.The association has suggested that the various procedures taken up after announcement of class XII results which incor[porated filling application form, seat allotment, reaching to allotted colleges and confirming admission, number of admission rounds and its format as well as counselling round should be conducted in one single phase. Apart from CET, the association members have made recommendations on reducing the number of entrance exams, scholarships and also financial assistance to colleges in wake of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-suggest-open-admissions-after-2nd-round-for-non-cet-pupils/articleshow/82533222.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The FTII Students’ Association (FTIISA) and a section of the newly-inducted students have written to FTII chairman Shekhar Kapur, as well as other top academics at the institute, detailing the issues faced by them in both the film and television wing, because of poor connectivity and lack of sync between the syllabus and online mode of education. The issues pertain to reduction of lectures to two hours, frequent interruptions in online lessons, and lack of practical sessions affecting quality of lessons. The FTIISA also accused the FTII of pressurising students to attend online classes, which, it said, is a violation of the University Grants Commission (UGC) norms. “Students have informed the institute about the issues faced by them, given the fact that no practicals had been held. Besides, multiple students in remote parts of the country were facing issues in accessing their lessons online, and many have been affected by Covid-19. The FTII has said that non-attendance of online lessons will affect their overall attendance records, which is a violation of UGC norms,” said Aadhith Sathvin, president, FTIISA. FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola said, “While we are not under the UGC regulations, we insist on 80% attendance in classes. We address the issues of students individually, like we have done in the case of a student from Ladakh, and we have written to the authorities in Manipur for another student. In case lectures are missed due to connectivity or health reasons, some teachers hold special classes on weekends, and students also have access to some of the recorded lectures,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ftii-students-flag-issues-with-online-sessions/articleshow/82533251.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Experts blame comorbidity cure delay for most deaths||Pune: An analysis of casualties at state-run Sassoon general hospital has reinforced the fact that delaying medical care may trigger severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients with pre-existing medical conditions. A total of 346 of the 1,078 Covid-19 patients succumbing to the contagion in April could not even reach the tertiary care referral hospital in a living condition and were declared “brought dead”, as the disease progression had already reached an advanced stage by the time they set out to seek medical care.Most of these patients had co-morbid conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. A sizeable number of them were from rural parts of Pune and even adjoining districts.Subhash Salunke, adviser to the state government on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services (Maharashtra), told TOI that the comorbidity and rejection from other hospitals played a big role in the increased death rate.“We have also analyzed that around 30% deaths occurred in the first 24 hours. This data is no different than what we observed during the first round of the pandemic last year,” said Salunke, who who had been part of the Sassoon hospital’s death audit committee Unlike private hospitals, Sassoon hospital is a referral unit and does not have a refusal policy. “Hence, patients in a bad shape from all over Pune and the adjoining districts get referred to Sassoon hospital. The late referral accounts for a higher death rate,” he said.Despite being warned time and again, private hospitals, however, keep referring their critical patients undergoing ICU care to Sassoon hospital to maintain a false picture of having less mortality due to Covid at their units, Salunke said. “They (private hospitals) simply do not follow this directive and keep referring patients to Sassoon hospitals when chances of their survival are slim,” Salunke said.Sassoon General Hospital administrative controller S Chockalingam told TOI that there were several factors that everyone needed to be aware of before looking at the death data. “Sassoon General Hospital usually gets the patients whose health is severely deteriorated and the sheer number of ‘brought dead’ patient is high compared to that of any other medical facility,” he said.He added that the staffers at Sassoon hospital were working hard “to save each and every life and they will continue to do so”. He said, “However, many things depend on the severity of the virus.”Health activist Abhijit More said the deaths did not portray the real picture at Sassoon hospital. “It is the only facility that accepts patients in a bad shape. Considering the current situation, the bed unavailability and oxygen shortage across the region have a huge role to play in the increased death rate at Sassoon hospital. Improving other civic facilities that can treat Covid patients can ease the burden on Sassoon hospital.”Earlier last month, Muralidhar Tambe, dean of the BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, had said often they have even seen patients already intubated being transferred to the referral health hub and that should not be done in any case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-blame-comorbidity-cure-delay-for-most-deaths/articleshow/82533262.cms||Piyush Bhusari

These injections were allocated to two private hospitals in Pimpri Chinchwad by the district administration. “I have issued orders to summon the administrative heads of both the hospitals and question them about how the vials were being sold in the black-market,” the commissioner said. Krishna Prakash said he had issued orders to carry out surprise Nakabandi operations to curb the black-marketing of anti-viral drug remdesivir. “Around 2.45am, Wakad police constables Dattaprasad Chaudhari and Jitendra Ugale, along with homeguards Nikhil Sapkal and Rohan Gund, noticed two men on two motorcycles. As their movements were suspicious, our men stopped them and frisked them. They found two vials of remdesivir with on their person,” Krishna Prakash said. He said one them, Krishna Patil (22), is part of the nursing staff at a private hospital, while Nikhil Neharkar (19) is a delivery personnel. “The duo did not have any permission for selling the medicines. During the questioning, they revealed the name of Shashikant Panchal (34), a pharmacist attached to a private hospital. They also told us that Panchal had provided them with the vials for selling them at high prices,” Krishna Prakash said. A Wakad police team, led by senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar, took Panchal into custody and seized 19 more vials of remdesivir from his car. “Panchal and his brother run pharmacies at both the hospitals in question. The vials had been allotted to these two hospitals,” Mugalikar said. Krishna Prakash said, “It was an inhuman act by the pharmacist. These injections were meant for the critical Covid patients who are undergoing treatment in these hospitals. Instead of giving it to them, Panchal was selling it in the black-market. We have arrested the trio under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Essentials Commodities Act.” Mugalikar said all the three suspects have been remanded to the police custody for five days. “We are probing whether they had priorly sold any vials in the black-market,” Mugalikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/21-remdesivir-vials-seized-pharmacist-among-3-held/articleshow/82533320.cms||---

Since 2020, their incomes have declined and now with the second wave, their household income has further crippled as most families are now dependent only on the meagre income of waste-pickers, who are always at a risk of exposure to the virus due to the nature of their work. The closure of scrap shops has caused the biggest dent in their economic condition. Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat, a union of waste-pickers in the city, has appealed to citizens to donate cash and provide vaccination support for their waste-picker members. A crowdfunding initiative has been started by it on GiveIndia fundraisers’ platform. Sonal Dakhale, a waste picker, said,“There is no work for anybody, and my entire family comprising my mother-in-law, husband and two children depend on me. During the last lockdown, many societies helped us with ration and other things. However, this time, we have not received any help from anywhere,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/waste-pickers-affected-by-closure-of-scrap-shops/articleshow/82533370.cms||Ardhra Nair

Prior appointment is mandatory for beneficiaries in this group. The PMC has said it opens slot bookings at 8pm every day. The PCMC has said its slots open at 7.30pm daily. Healthcare activist Abhijit More, however, said that on Sunday, all of PMC’s slots were booked by 7.48pm. He alleged that slots are being given away to "people with influence". More called for transparency in the slot booking process to ensure everyone gets a chance. In Pimpri Chinchwad, many residents said slots were not available by 7.30pm. Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, said he will look into the complaints. “Only we have the access to generate daily vaccination slots. And they are to be generated sharp at 7.30pm every day. But if there are allegations that protocols are not being followed, we will look into it,” he said. In Pune city, mayor Muralidhar Mohol could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. As for Pune rural, Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer, said the access to generate daily slots is with vaccination centres in each tehsil. On Monday, thanks to enough stock of Covid-19 vaccines, the district vaccinated a total of 41,482 beneficiaries. More than 26,000 were second-dose recipients and over 6,000 beneficiaries from the 18-44 age group. But the PCMC said there will be no vaccination drive for the 45-plus group on Tuesday because of a vaccine shortage. The PMC said the drive for the 18-44 beneficiary group will be held at only two hospitals in its limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-say-vaccine-slots-not-opening-on-time-for-18/articleshow/82533403.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Patna||‘It takes time to regain strength after recovery’||PATNA: Most people recovering from Covid-19 generally complain of lack of physical strength for a period varying from a fortnight to more than a month depending upon the severity of the infection. “How shall I overcome my physical weakness and start leading a normal life” is a common question of the patients who have just won the fight against Covid. According to medical experts, post-Covid weakness is equally painful. The virus weakens the body a lot even after full recovery. Hence, people should strictly adhere to the medical guidelines prescribed for the post-recovery period, they say. Noted gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman suggested that patients should take rich and nutritious diet full of proteins, vitamins and minerals to regain physical strength. Fresh vegetables and fruits must be consumed in sufficient amount besides drinking lots of water to keep the body hydrated. They should continue to take B-complex and other vitamin tablets on a regular basis for strengthening their muscular nerves which invariably get weak during the illness, she said. People should also practice some light breathing exercises to keep themselves medically fit. She, however, cautioned that one should not exert too much while doing such exercises as the capacity of lungs is reduced considerably post-Covid. Patna University Yoga Centre’s former director Dr Prabhakar Devraj said besides taking vitamins and electral powder along with nutritious diet, people should practice some exercises like ‘pawan muktasana’, ‘anulom-vilom’ and ‘nadi-shodhan pranayam’ to regain their body strength. Those who have recovered from Covid infection should take rest as much as possible. Any strenuous work which requires exerting the body should not be done during the post-recovery period for at least one month, he added. Dietician and nutritionist Meghna Krishna said Covid infections generally weaken the immune and the nervous system of a person. In fact, all the body organs weaken considerably in the process. Hence, it is essential to take diets full of carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and vitamins to regain physical strength. Milk and milk products, soya products, fresh vegetables, fruits like apple, orange, guava, kiwi, etc should be taken in sufficient amount. One could also consider chicken, fish, eggs and high-fiber food cooked in a healthy way, she said. Government Ayurvedic College principal Dr Dineshwar Prasad Singh also suggests people to consume such food which may boost their energy level in the post-recovery period. They should take a balanced diet consisting of dry fruits like dates, munakka, figs and almonds and seasonal fruits like papaya, bel, orange and apple as well as green and leafy vegetables. They may also take coconut water, sattu in liquid form and petha (sweet) for regaining their vitality. Some Ayurvedic products like ashwagandha, giloy, shatwar and drakshasava would prove much useful in regaining physical strength, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/it-takes-time-to-regain-strength-after-recovery/articleshow/82533497.cms||B K Mishra

Expressing concern over the seriousness of the situation, he said that in over 300 panchayats, the TPR is above 30% and added that there were 57 panchayats with active case load of 500 to 2,000. The chief minister said that the number of people who are testing positive in Kannur, Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam, continues to remain high and thereby serious, while it is slowly showing a reducing trend in other districts. The chief minister said that since oxygen continues to be in high demand, the government has initiated steps to reduce the wastage of oxygen. The government has also initiated steps to appoint more doctors and paramedical staff. The government will appoint retired doctors and those who have come back after leave and studies. He said that the government has taken steps to strengthen the home delivery system in the wake of Ramzan, and a special mobile application developed for the purpose can be emulated in other places too. Of the doses of Covid vaccine that the state has decided to purchase, 3.5 lakh doses have reached the state. These will be administered to those who are facing serious ailments, volunteers of ward-level samithis and media persons. The chief minister said that the local bodies can utilize the plan fund for Covid management. The chief minister said that the public should ensure that the lockdown rules are strictly followed, and the police passes for emergency travel should not be misused. Stating that more than a lakh people applied for passes within 12 hours of opening the pass portal, he said that such a behaviour would defeat the very intention behind locking down the state. He said that while it was a preventive lockdown in the first wave, it is an emergency lockdown in the present phase, which is intended to reduce the death rate. For the same reason, the current lockdown has the value of each one’s life, the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/situation-dire-as-tpr-over-50-in-72-panchayats-cm/articleshow/82533507.cms||---

The agency, which rated him for a loan taken earlier at B+ or stable in January 2020, said Monday’s move was at the back of inadequate information and lack of management cooperation from the company. This non-cooperation has restricted Crisil Ratings’ ability to take a forward looking view on the entity’s credit quality. KH is a proprietorship firm with interests in directing, acting, and producing mainly involved in Tamil film industry. The total worth of bank loan facilities rated of KH stands at Rs 25 crore, according to the report. Haasan had declared assets worth Rs 176.9 crore in his name(in his poll affidavit), which includes movable assets worth Rs 45 crore and immovable assets worth Rs 131.8 crore. The rating agency cautioning investors of KH said all investors, lenders and all other market participants should exercise due caution with reference to the rating assigned with the suffix ‘Issuer Not Cooperating’. As the rating is arrived at without any management interaction and is based on best available or limited or dated information on the company, it added. The ratings report said it failed to receive any information on either the financial performance or strategic intent of KH. “Such non co-operation by a rated entity may be a result of deterioration in its credit risk profile. These ratings with ‘Issuer Not Cooperating’ suffix lack a forward looking component,” it added. Officials at the KH company did not wish to comment on this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/crisil-issues-not-cooperating-tag-to-kamal-haasans-firm/articleshow/82533513.cms||Mamtha Asokan

---||Patna||Patna doctors detect black fungus in 4 post-Covid cases||PATNA: The rare but dangerous mucormycosis, which is a fungal infection known as black fungus and found in some of the post-Covid cases, has been detected in at least four persons undergoing treatment at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P). While three patients are under treatment at the IGIMS, one is at the AIIMS-P. Black fungus usually develops in patients who had been on oxygen support for a couple of days during the Covid-19 treatment and incidentally contract the disease. Diabetic people are more prone to this infection. In many cases, the patient’s immune system becomes weak after recovery from the viral disease and sometimes leads to change in the level of blood sugar too. ENT department head at IGIMS, Dr Rakesh Singh, on Monday said three patients under treatment had contracted the black fungus infection during the course of Covid treatment. “Mainly caused by remaining on humidified oxygen support for some time, the patients detected with mucormycosis had their blood vessels damaged and they were undergoing treatment,” he said. Rakesh said it is a dangerous infection affecting nasal and oral parts of a patient and even could turn fatal. “Patients recovering from the Covid infection should be watchful. In case of any symptom, they should immediately consult the medical experts,” he said. One mucormycosis case was detected at the OPD of AIIMS-P two days ago, said Dr Kranti Bhawana, the head of ENT department there. She said two more patients with suspected black fungus were being examined under different parameters of investigation. “The common symptoms are darkening of some parts of face, black patches in nostrils and problems in teeth and palates,” she said. “The mucormycosis may affect eyes leading to loss of vision and, in worse case, move up to the brain causing death of a patient,” said Dr Bhawna. She said the patient, first in the Covid times, would undergo investigations like biopsy, MRI and other tests as part of the treatment plan, including surgical intervention. However, no case of black fungus is reported from other hospitals like PMCH and NMCH. Instead, the most common complaints reported by people after recovery from the Covid are weakness, headache, cough and loss of appetite. “We frequently get calls from different districts about these problems,” said Dr Anil Kumar, head of the telemedicine department of AIIMS-P. He said these are common post-Covid problems and people should not panic. “As Covid weakens the entire immune system, these residual symptoms gradually go away with time,” he said. “No case of black fungus has been reported from any other place as the team of telemedicine doctors queried all problems in the post-Covid patients for screening the common symptoms,” said Dr Anil. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Sunday issued an advisory on mucormycosis in Covid patients and said it may turn fatal if remained untreated. The major risk factors of this disease are uncontrolled diabetes, use of steroids causing immunosuppression and long stay in intensive care units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-docs-detect-black-fungus-in-4-post-covid-cases/articleshow/82533637.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Thiruvananthapuram||KGMOA writes to CM, seeks more manpower||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) has written to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his urgent intervention in appointing more healthcare professionals, including retired doctors, into service. On an average, 100 healthcare workers are getting positive in a day and hence there is acute shortage of manpower, the association said. KGMOA warned that the state is heading for a severe crisis due to the shortage of manpower in hospitals. With more Covid first- and second-line treatment centres opening up in almost all local bodies, there is huge demand for healthcare workers, said Dr T N Suresh, state secretary of KGMOA. To monitor people on quarantine at the first- and second-line treatment centres, domiciliary care centres and also under home quarantine, retired doctors should be appointed. A 24-hour call centre should be set up in each district for this. The local bodies should be given the charge of appointing doctors here, said Dr G S Vijayakrishnan, state president, KGMOA. KGMOA urged the chief minister that a referral system should be made mandatory for admitting patients in Covid hospitals. In the first phase, besides the Covid brigade, the support of over thousand doctors appointed on a temporary basis was received. Presently, their service is not sought. Hence the government should explore the possibility of getting their support too, said the association in the letter to the chief minister. KGMOA also demanded that priority in the state should be given for vaccination of people of age group 18-45 years. They also demanded the inclusion of first-degree relatives (spouse and children) of healthcare workers in the priority group for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kgmoa-writes-to-cm-seeks-more-manpower/articleshow/82533672.cms||---

On Monday evening, the total number of hospitalized patients in the city and district stood at 9,850. While several questions have been raised regarding the data of positive cases and deaths disclosed by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), transparency has prevailed when it comes to the details of hospitalization. The civic body in its dashboard clearly mentions the total number of Covid-19 beds, occupied beds and vacant beds. This is further divided into categories of ventilator beds, ICU beds without ventilator, oxygen support beds and mild symptom beds. Sources said that on April 24, around 9,900 beds were occupied in the city. This went beyond 10,000 later and never reached four digits again. A major relief was felt when the number went to 9,999 on Sunday night but bounced back to above 10,000 later. On Monday, however, the number remained consistently below 10,000. “Since the last five to six days, it seems that we are on the downward slope but we would like to wait for two to three days more for a significant decline of around 25% from the peak. We would like to see the hospitalization down to around 8,000,” said the officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao. Officials said that those at the helm of Covid-19 management were more concerned about oxygen availability. “Even if the occupancy is lower and oxygen is diverted elsewhere cutting our supplies, we may remain in a tight spot. This has happened even when we had high requirements. Ideally, the city and district would be comfortable if the oxygen requirement is reduced to less than half of what it is today,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hospital-admissions-fall-in-vadodara-after-15-days/articleshow/82533687.cms||Sachin Sharma

According to police, Muhammed Ali Noushad, an IUML member of ward 16 of Vazhakkad panchayat, allegedly dismantled the blockades installed by the police in as many as four roads in the containment zones on Sunday. He also posted social media messages stating that the road blockades have been removed. Noushad along with six others have been booked under Epidemics Act, IPC section 269 and other sections of the Kerala Police Act. The panchayat is ruled by UDF. “The panchayat has been witnessing a rise in Covid cases and the police took up the task of putting up roadblocks as part of containment activities. Actually, the panchayat authorities should have themselves taken the lead in such measures. Instead of supporting it, the member removed the road blockades and opened up the roads,” said Vazhakkad police inspector Sushir K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/panchayat-member-booked-for-opening-up-roads/articleshow/82533697.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals has tied up with the complex for the vaccination, for which total 800 residents have registered. Since the vaccination is finally taking place after a long wait, the excitement among the residents was palpable. Punjabee Bradree, the biggest social organisation in the city of the Punjabi community, has also got a confirmation from the same hospital for mass vaccination on its Mayfair Road premises. Siddha Pines, located in New Town, had set up its facilities after the premises were inspected earlier, but the lack of vaccine supply had held up the drive. On Monday late in the evening when the confirmation came, there was jubilation among its residents who had been living in fear for the past few weeks with a large number of residents being affected by Covid and one having succumbed to it on Saturday. The space in the complex has been divided into three mandatory units with posters giving the required directions. “We have to be extremely careful at every step because many residents are affected. However, all precautions have been taken and we are starting our first jab from Tuesday. Around 200 people will be covered on the first day,” said the president of the complex, Manav Mehera. The drive will continue for four days with a day’s gap in between. “This is the first complex where the 18-plus will be included and the youngsters here are very excited,” said a resident, Amit Bhatt. Arrangements are also being made at the Punjabee Bradree for mass vaccination starting from Friday. The plan is to vaccinate all 5,000 members and their families over a series of sessions. “We are starting out with 200 people on the first day and there will be two days a week. However, we have asked the hospital to step this up to 400 jabs a day and four days a week as we progress. We have a huge space to offer on our premises,” said president Akash Bhatia, adding that though the plan is to cover approximately 20,000 people of the community, the Bradree would be open to the requests from outside as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-help-to-inoculate-18-plus-at-city-complex/articleshow/82533754.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The budget estimates predict an income from finance commission allocation, the state's share of central transfers, funds for centrally-sponsored schemes and market borrowings in the form of bonds and state’s own income in the form of taxes and others. The state's own income stands at Rs 6,746 crore out of Rs 9,340 crore, indicating the state had performed well in its own tax collection and other parameters, officials claimed. “The second wave though very grim, the income generation is better. Last year (2019- 20), the state could only muster five percent of the expected income due to total lockdown,” said a senior finance official. The state earned nearly Rs 1,000 crore in excise and stamps registration generated an income of Rs 700 crore this April. “The state machinery was alert and anticipated slowed down activities, tax collection was efficient,” said another official. Overall monthly income of the state in April is almost close to what was earned in the month of April in 2018-19 when the state earned Rs 9,860 crore with no one having an inkling of the virus back in the days. Apart from its own income, the state had also secured Rs 800 crore as the share from the centre. In April, the state borrowed Rs 1,500 crore as market borrowings. The Union government on Sunday released Rs 8,923 crore as the next installment for various states towards grant for Panchayat Raj institutions, Telangana received Rs 273 crore as it’s share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-2nd-wave-t-earns-rs-9k-cr-in-april/articleshow/82533756.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kochi||Kerala: Cases registered for violating burial protocol||THRISSUR: Preliminary probes into the reported conduct of last rites of a woman Covid patient at a mosque in the district have given hints of rackets fleecing money from relatives of Covid victims for the burial. Police and health authorities on Monday registered separate cases following reports of Covid protocol violation. According to health authorities, the body of Khadeeja (53), from Varavoor, was taken to MIC Juma Masjid near Sakthan Nagar, even though she had died of Covid. As per reports, the body was taken in an ambulance and religious rites like bathing the body were performed there. Acting on a tip-off, health department officials rushed to the spot and alerted collector S Shanavas, and other authorities. However, even before the officials could reach there, the body was repacked, using materials different from the ones used as per Covid protocol, after the ritualistic bathing. The health authorities then seized the body and took it to Kanjirassery mosque near Varavoor for performing the last rites. Terming the incident as ‘disappointing’, the collector said strong action would be taken against those responsible. DMO Dr K J Reena said cases have been registered against the relatives of the deceased patient and against the mosque authorities. The ambulance belonging to a private charitable trust has also been seized . Cases have been registered against the ambulance driver too, said Arun G, CI of Nedupuzha police station. According to the complaint filed by Raju, from the DMO’s office, at Nedupuzha police station, a detailed probe is needed in the incident to zero in on the role of mosque officials and office bearers of Santhwanam City Charitable Trust, who own the ambulance. Raju, the sectoral magistrate for supervising Covid mitigation measures, said that as per masjid secretary Shamzuddin’s testimony, earlier too bodies of other Covid patients were brought there for last rites. Health officials said that they had received information of rackets operating around the mortuary of medical college hospital, undertaking to conduct the last rites of Covid patients as per religious beliefs, fleecing money from relatives. They said that as per reports, the bodies of Covid patients from the Muslim community were earlier buried at a mosque near Mulankunnathukavu, and the bodies of Hindus were taken for cremation at Pambady. The bodies of Christians were being taken to the newly-built crematorium at Mulayam. There were unconfirmed reports that charges for the last rites vary from Rs 30,000 to Rs 60,000 depending on the financial status of the relatives, who would be mostly under quarantine or Covid patients themselves. Money was being demanded under various ‘heads’ like cost of transportation and PPE kits, and expenses for quarantine of ‘volunteers’, they said. Health officials had earlier alerted the police, and there was a let up in such instances after their intervention. However, the latest incident indicates the practice has not altogether stopped, said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cases-registered-for-violating-burial-protocol/articleshow/82533757.cms||T Ramavarman

The state government has decided to set up a Covid facility in Mayo Hospital where people working in Posta and Burrabazar areas can avail of treatment. In a meeting with religious figures and head of market committees in Nabanna, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced that Mayo Hospital on Strand Road will be turned into a Covid-19 treatment facility. While announcing that at least 100 people in the market would be inoculated, the chief minister also requested traders in Posta to support the hospital by providing food. The representatives of the market committees assured all help to the chief minister. “We will set up a Covid facility in Mayo Hospital. The work will be completed in a few days. It will have all the facilities,” said the chief minister. “I will help the traders to come forward and support the government by providing food at the hospital,” said the chief minister. She also told the traders to regulate lorries coming from different states. “Last time we found that Covid had spread in that area due to lorry drivers coming from outside. This time please be careful, or things might take a dangerous turn,” said the chief minister. The committee has decided to deploy people to check temperature of all the drivers coming from the districts and neighbouring states. “A team of ten people will check the temperature. We are already sanitising the area almost every day. Both traders and labourers have been told strictly to wear masks and do not let anybody crowd their shops,” said Biswanath Agarwal, secretary of Posta Bazaar Merchants’ Association. Posta and Burrabazar are the biggest wholesale and retail hub for rice, wheat, flour, potatoes, oil and spices. The chief minister has requested the traders not to shut the market as it might create a crisis. “Last time the traders fed the labourers for several weeks so that they don’t go away to their native place. I will request you to again start providing food to the labourers so that they do not face any difficulty. We want the wholesale markets to function smoothly so that people do not face any problem,” said the chief minister. “ I want to vaccinate everybody in Bengal for free but the Central government is not sending us enough vaccines,” said Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-treatment-aid-for-workers-in-central-biz-dist/articleshow/82533767.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cov test on 136 Tolly technicians, 10 +ve||Kolkata: On Monday morning, 136 free Rapid Antigen Tests were done for technicians engaged in the shooting of serials like ‘Mithai’, ‘Agnishikha’ and ‘E Poth Jodi Na Sesh Hoy’ at the Bharatlaxmi Studio. The results, which came in by evening, showed that 10 technicians have been infected by the Covid-19. Had these tests not been done, the asymptomatic technicians would have continued shooting without anyone raising an eyebrow. The president of Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI), Swarup Biswas, told TOI that all the infected technicians have been isolated. “Arrangements are being made to take care of them in terms of medicines. We are trying to repeat these tests after 15-20 days,” he said. On being asked whether shooting should be discontinued now, that the situation is so critical, he said,“Federation knows how much they suffered during lockdown since no work means no pay for technicians. Work has to go on,” he said. Meanwhile, a new SOP has been signed by West Bengal Motion Picture Artists’ Forum (WBMPAF) and Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP). It has been decided that shooting will not be stalled unless there is any instruction from the state government or Centre in this regard. Some critics have reasoned that this testing will not help to create a bio-bubble. Biswas admitted to having noticed some “rigidity” and apprehension on the part of WBMPAF. “On Monday, some light caretakers and tea boys have also been tested. I have heard some say that if a person gets tests today, it doesn’t mean he or she will be safe the day after. By that logic, we should stop getting tests done across the country. This mentality has to change in order to run the show. I sincerely appeal to artists to be less rigid and leave their ego aside. They can get access to our free tests too.” Actor-turned-BJP member Rupa Bhattacharjee, who is a member of WBMPAF and is currently shooting for the series, ‘Bikram-Betal’, said, “If Federation has taken this initiative for the benefit of the industry, I will rise above my political differences and congratulate the efforts taken. We are freelancers and need shooting to continue without any glitch.” In the coming days, tests will be done on 19 shooting floors. On Tuesday, this drive will take place at Veeline studio where shooting is in progress for ‘Sanjher Bati’, ‘Ogo Nirupoma’, ‘Dhrubotara’ and ‘Rimli’. Producer of these serials Sani Ghosh Ray described the testing drive as a “great initiative”. “It will be of greater help if the tests are done at the end of the day. That will ensure a certificate is available before the shoot commences the next day,” said Ghosh Ray, who is also the secretary of WATP. Biswas, however, said that technically this might not be a workable situation. “We will organize a vaccination drive. We are trying to procure the vaccines privately. If not, we will approach our chief minister for help,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-test-on-136-tolly-technicians-10-ve/articleshow/82533766.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

On April 19, a 50-year-old woman from Vadakkevila was admitted to Meditrina hospital for Covid treatment. Hospital authorities had told her relatives that they would charge Rs 12,000/day and they had paid Rs. 45,000 as advance. But after one week, the ICU bill alone touched Rs 2,50,000. As the patient’s relatives did not pay the bill on May 7, they were given another bill amounting to Rs 5,10, 189. As they could not pay such a hefty sum, the patient was not allowed to get discharged from the hospital. Then, the incident was widely reported by the media and the collector asked the district medical officer to conduct an enquiry and file a report. Following this, hospital authorities decided to settle the bill and asked the patient to pay Rs 1 lakh. After paying this amount, she was allowed to go home on Monday. Hospital authorities claimed that they did not charge exorbitant rates. “As the patient had to be admitted to ICU and placed on the ventilator, naturally the bill amount accumulated over time,” claimed hospital authorities. But, it has been pointed out that hospital authorities settled for a lesser amount in view of the complaint and fearing government action following the high court‘s orders to fix the standard rate for Covid treatment in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pvt-hospital-which-slapped-rs-5l-bill-settles-for-rs-1l/articleshow/82533783.cms||---

In the wake of the first wave of Covid-19 last year, IRDAI had directed all non-life insurance companies to roll out these two standard Covid-19 policies by July 10, 2020. This was mainly targeted at people who did not have any health insurance cover. These policies were earlier permitted to be offered till March 31, 2021, and with second wave hitting the country, the regulator allowed insurers to offer and renew these standard Covid policies up to September 30, 2021. An industry expert pointed out that the rising Covid claim ratios have been pinching insurers. He pointed out that the pricing of standard Covid products, that were fixed last year by insurers, do not seem viable anymore in the face of rising Covid claims. “When we priced it and launched these policies, no one had the visibility of the numbers… but at the same time, no one had predicted that the numbers could go so bad within a year…we took a hit last year, but it is difficult to continue like this. Therefore, many insurance players are no longer pushing this policy,” another industry source said. Besides he added that revising the premium of such policies, where sum insured is not very high, does not make sense even for sellers of the policy as well as buyers. While Corona Kavach is an indemnity-based product, Corona Rakshak is a benefit-based product. While benefit policies pay a fixed amount following a claim, indemnity plans provide either cashless or reimbursement for the money spent on medical treatment. Both are offered for a tenure of three and half months, six and half months or nine and half months. While the sum insured in Corona Kavach ranges between Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh, in Corona Rakshak, it ranges between Rs 50,000- Rs 2.5 lakh. Till January, around 1.28 crore standard Covid policies with a total premium of over Rs 1,000 crore were sold by insurers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mandatory-to-continue-offering-standard-corona-policies-irdai-tells-insurance-cos/articleshow/82533805.cms||Swati Rathor

---||Hyderabad||Telangana may continue with second dose priority||HYDERABAD: With little hope of Covid-19 vaccine supply from the Centre, the state government is likely to continue inoculating only those due for their second dose. The order giving priority to citizens due for second dose will end on Wednesday. Reliable sources, however, told TOI that the government may continue the present policy (priority for second dose) till the vaccine supply improves from the Centre. Though the state government had placed orders with both vaccine companies for limited supply, officials have decided to continue with pre-booking option at private hospitals and spot registration at government centres. In all, 53 lakh citizens had received the vaccine in the state so far. Of them, 44 lakh received the first dose, while around nine lakh people got the second shot till now. Many people complained of non-availability of Covaxin, but it was available in many areas for second dose for the past few days. Over 80,000 people were vaccinated in the state on Monday, the sources said. Meanwhile, with vaccine slots not available at private health facilities, many, who received their first dose at private facilities, were also approaching government centres. “This is causing a lot of friction among people. Those living near primary healthcare centres ( PHC) are questioning us on why outsiders should be given the vaccine,” a health official said. Many urban primary healthcare centres (UPHCs), including those at Koti and Nampally, witnessed heavy rush on Monday too, the official added. Reliable sources told TOI that officials began collating data on taxi drivers, delivery boys, gas delivery boys and other service personnels. According to estimates, there could be nearly 1.5 lakh gig workers in GHMC area alone. The government wants to vaccinate these personnel on a priority to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Greater Hyderabad, the sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-may-continue-with-second-dose-priority/articleshow/82533888.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Surat||Textile traders divided over keeping shops open||Surat: The divide in the textile business community of Surat once again came to the fore on Monday after the district collector gave permission to open the textile markets in the city for four hours on Tuesday. The Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) had sought permission last week for opening the market. However, hours after giving the nod, the collector withdrew it citing ‘administrative’ reasons. Interestingly, many textile traders blamed SGCCI for creating confusion. The district administration in its letter to SGCCI president Dinesh Navadiya on Monday morning allowed keeping the markets open from 10 am to 2 pm on Monday and Tuesday. But since SGCCI received the letter late, the message could not be conveyed to the traders in time, yet some of them opened their shops and were fined by police. Meanwhile, the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA), which had written to chief minister Vijay Rupani for allowing markets to open after May 12, was not in the favour of opening the markets on Monday and Tuesday for a few hours. SGCCI said that it had made a request to the district administration, on getting representations from different associations of traders, yarn manufacturers, dealers, weaving and processors. “The permission was withdrawn for administrative reasons,” said district collector Dr Dhaval Patel. However, he did not elaborate on it. Later, SGCCI in a statement said that there was a question of police permission and when the collector and police commissioner talked to leading traders and trade organizations, they received an opinion that they were fine if the markets will not open for a day.“For last so many years, FOSTTA has been deciding about the operations of all textile markets in the city, some organizations are only trying to gain brownie points by such moves. By keeping the markets open for a few hours was hardly going to make any difference,” said its secretary Champalal Bothra. Last week too, members of FOSTTA and the Textile Task Force constituted by SGCCI had a heated argument outside the office of police commissioner when they went to make different requests for relaxation in the lockdown norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/textile-traders-divided-over-keeping-shops-open/articleshow/82533880.cms||---

However, she did not specify the quantum of doses supplied so far or the total number of orders that the company has received so far. The company has fixed the price of Covaxin for state governments at Rs 400 per dose. Initially, it had announced the pricing for states at Rs 600 per dose but slashed it by Rs 200 a dose after a public outcry as it was supplying it at Rs 150 per dose to the Centre. For private hospitals Covaxin has been priced at Rs 1200 a dose.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad sisters pay smiling homage to granny||AHMEDABAD: The dining table in Pathak household in Paldi area is a creative mess – Dhyani, 12, and Vaishvi, 8, are busy cutting the chart papers neatly, writing inspirational quotes and decorating them with splashes of colours. ‘Get well soon,’ ‘You are braver than you think,’ ‘We’re going home soon,’ read a few of the cards. All these cards are soon going to Covid patients across the city as a homage by the girls to their beloved nani (maternal grandmother) whom they lost to the pandemic. “My mother Jyoti Pandya passed away at the age of 69 years on April 12. The girls were very attached to her and they would frequently make video calls to her when she got hospitalized. On April 12 we got a call from the hospital that she was no more after the brief hospitalization,” recounts Forum Pathak. “It was devastating for us, but the girls refused to believe that she was no more. They insisted that she could not have left without fulfilling her promises to play with them and go shopping.” The family members tried to talk to girls and get them out of the denial to embrace the grief. Eventually Forum, an art teacher by profession, devised a way out. “I motivated them to write the ‘get well soon’ cards as if it’s for the nani. They jumped at the idea and immediately set out to do the task. It not only engrossed them but also helped them express their thoughts and concerns. It proved to be very therapeutic,” said Pathak. In nearly one month, the duo is ready with over 200 beautiful cards which would be distributed to various hospitals. The duo told TOI that their biggest achievement would be putting a smile on the patients and motivating them to get back on their feet. “It would be the best homage we could pay to our nani,” said Dhyani. Dr Jinesh Shah, a city-based child and adolescent psychiatrist, said the creative outlet is a positive way to give children a channel to process their emotions. “Adults often suppress feelings and even details of the demise from the kids, which makes them left out. It thus often takes a lot of time for them to express their feelings,” he said. “Thus, if this emotion can be channelled into something creative like painting, craft or music, it can be very therapeutic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-sisters-pay-smiling-homage-to-granny/articleshow/82533969.cms||Yogesh Chawda

---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: Current surge deadlier for younger patients in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The current wave of Covid-19 in Gujarat has proved to be more fatal for the younger population. An analysis of the mortality during the pandemic reveals that 58.4% of the deaths since April 1 have been reported in the below 60 years age group. To put the figure in perspective, it was 40% from March 2020 to April 2021. In absolute numbers, the mortality for the below 60 years age group went up from 1,803 to 2,263 in these two periods, recording a rise of 25%. On the other hand, the mortality among senior citizens went down by 41%. Experts attribute the phenomenon to two factors – high viral load from the start for the younger population due to mutation, and vaccination of the elderly. The analysis of death statistics revealed that now the age group of 45-59 years have the highest share of 37.7% in mortality – which was earlier 60-75 years with 45.2%. But analysis of pre and post April deaths reveal that the biggest jump is witnessed in the 30-44 years age group - where now 18% of the deaths are reported. The figure has jumped more than double from 7.8% reported before April. Dr Amit Prajapati, a city-based critical care specialist, said that last month witnessed a very high number of young patients getting critically ill from Covid-19 compared to earlier months. “Several of these patients were directly taken to the ICU due to high lung involvement – some had CT scores of 18 to 22 out of 25. Thus, despite all attempts, they failed to revive,” he said. “Often, their condition also deteriorated faster with low oxygen saturation.” The phenomenon of happy hypoxia could be one of the reasons, said Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist. “As the young have better immunity, the distress call is ignored. The oxygen saturation goes down steadily, but the person doesn’t feel it. Thus, when the lungs are severely damaged and the patient is out of breath, he or she is taken to the medical setting,” he said. “But by that time, the lungs are already infected beyond repair. We thus urge all not to ignore any symptoms of Covid.” Vaccination has also played its part in reducing the patients going to the ICUs for the elderly. Civil Hospital officials said that they maintain the records of a Covid patient’s vaccination, and they found that the share of vaccinated persons with higher oxygen requirements was less than 25%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/current-surge-deadlier-for-younger-patients-in-gujarat/articleshow/82533977.cms||Parth Shastri

If the raging wave had continued to rise, these would have been exhausted, leaving those who can ill-afford in a lurch.To tide over a possible situation, the officials held online meetings with doctors of private hospitals in the city and asked them to earmark beds for treatment of patients allocated to them by the administration. The treatment was to be provided for free to these patients. Sources said that initially it was suggested that 20% should be reserved. However, representatives of private hospitals resisted this and it was agreed to reserve 10% if needed.According to those privy to details, the private hospitals had also suggested that some increase should be made in the charges fixed for treatment of Covid-19 patients. They were, however, told that rates were not negotiable and they will have to continued operating at the capped rates.The need for reserving these beds was, however, not felt as the number of hospitalised patients gradually started going down in the city and district. Beds including ventilators, ICU beds and those with oxygen support are available in government facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/private-hospitals-were-told-to-set-aside-10-beds/articleshow/82533978.cms||---

This was the time when acute shortage of the medicine was experienced, and the cases of its black-marketing surfaced. The state government has submitted to the high court that it was managing nearly 20,000 remdesivir vials per day from the market, but after the centralization of its allocation since April 21, its availability reduced to 16,500. The government has stated that total demand in Gujarat was 10,31,358 vials, against which the government could provide 7,76,768 vials or 77% of what was needed. Upon the HC’s instructions, the government has supplied details of how many remdesivir vials it has provided to which district since April 1. Districts like Junagadh, Gandhinagar, Kheda, Ahmedabad and Vadodara top the chart with supply of 80-78% as against the demand. Ahmedabad district had demanded 2,34,957 vials and the government gave 1,83,267 vials. Surat district got 75% vials of its total demand of 1,53,810 vials in 35 days. The tribal district of Mahisagar is at the bottom of the beneficiaries with only 64% of its remdesivir demand met. Against its demand of 9,883 vials, the government could supply 6,345 vials. The case of another tribal district, Tapi, is the same with 65% of its demand met. Aravalli received 68%, the government affidavit said. The government, however, maintained that the supply has been on pro-rata basis looking at the severity of conditions of patients. Meanwhile, the central government’s assistant solicitor general, Devang Vyas, submitted a report and gave details of the Centre’s plan to supply 4,19,000 remdesivir vials to Gujarat between April 21 and May 16.

In its affidavit filed before the HC in response to advocate Amit Panchal’s plea seeking action over the fire, the state government said that following instructions issued on April 26 by the director of fire services, a team of local fire officials of Bharuch town visited Patel Welfare Hospital on April 30 morning for inspection and training. However, the team did not notice the new building, where on the ground floor the Covid-19 ICU had been functioning. Unfortunately, the fire incident took place on the same night of the visit of the fire team. The government has also said that the trust did not inform the authorities that an ICU was being started in the new building when the hospital was re-designated following a surge in Covid-19 cases. The state government has admitted that most of the staff of concerned departments are either in Covid duties or are affected by the disease. It informed the HC about how the fire took place, compensation ordered, and inquiry of Justice (retd) D A Mehta commission has been set up. The government said that there was no need to share Justice Mehta commission’s two reports with the high court in this proceeding on the fire incidents of Ahmedabad’s Shrey Hospital and Rajkot’s Uday Shivanand Hospital.

It, however, maintained that the entire system is under stress due to shortage of oxygen and it has put in efforts to manage emergency oxygen needs of hospitals. It has been requesting the Centre to increase its allocation from 975MT. Five days after the chief secretary projected an oxygen requirement of 1,600MT by May 15 in his letter to the Centre, the government stated that oxygen demand has stabilized with the fall in Covid-19 cases. “Though hospitalization lags new case detection by 4-5 days and bed occupancy in ICUs lags new case detection by 10-12 days, nonetheless, the state is seeing stabilization in oxygen demand and consumption at around 1,250 tons. It will be necessary to watch new case detection for a few more days before arriving at any conclusion with respect to reduction in demand,” the affidavit reads. The state government further said that given the trend of reduction in Covid-19 cases, “it is anticipated that going forward, oxygen demand and consumption in the state will stay around 1,250MT for 4-5 days and thereafter it willl show a decreasing trend at the rate of 100MT per week”. With the stabilization in oxygen consumption, the state government has started diverting oxygen to certain sections of industry for the last three days. Earlier no industrial use of oxygen was permitted. It has restored supply to oxygen cylinder manufacturers, vaccine vial makers and air compressor manufacturers. These industries collectively consume around 22 MT of oxygen per day, the government submitted. Despite the stabilized demand, the state falls short of oxygen due to the static central allocation. It tries to exploit local resources and said it expects 100-120 MT per day from 24 PSA/ASU plants. Seven ASU plants at the Alang ship-breaking yard have been restarted. Efforts are under way to convert 15 nitrogen PSA plants into oxygen PSA plants and this may generate 25-30MT of oxygen. City hospitals are seeing dip in the cases. Ahmedabad district had 54,722 active cases on Monday evening, the lowest for the past fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/o2-demand-to-stabilize-at-1250mt/articleshow/82533989.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat says ‘tremendous stress’ but oxygen demand is stable at 1,250MT||AHMEDABAD: Five days ago, Gujarat government had red flagged that the state's requirement of oxygen is expected to rise to 1,600MT on May 15 and urged the Centre to relax its 975MT quota. On Monday, however, the state relaxed a bit as it submitted to the Gujarat high court that demand and consumption of oxygen is stabilizing at 1,250 MT. The government cited reduction in cases for stability and even anticipated a decrease in oxygen demand in a few days. In its affidavit filed in the Gujarat high court in response to the suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the state government said that “the entire system is under tremendous stress due to shortage of supply of oxygen but the state is making its best efforts to manage and meet all emergency needs of oxygen of patients”. It provided details of demand and supply of oxygen between April 23 and May 7. It stated that average daily demand and supply in Gujarat was 1,232.3 MT in the last two weeks. “The state is seeing a stabilization in oxygen demand and consumption at around 1,250 MT. It would be necessary to watch new case detection for a few more days before arriving at any conclusion with respect to reduction in demand,” the affidavit reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-says-tremendous-stress-but-o2-demand-is-stable-at-1250mt/articleshow/82533994.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Gated communities give support to affected residents||HYDERABAD: From procuring oxygen cylinders to delivering food to the residents, several gated communities have constituted an in-house task force that act like 24-hour helplines for families infected with Covid-19. Even as Covid-19 numbers are on the downtrend across Telangana, gated communities continue to cater to needs of the infected families within their premises. Many have constituted a task force that is not only helping residents with daily groceries and meals, but is also arranging beds, isolation facility, sanitization and vaccination drives, among others. The task force constituted by residents of Rajapushpa Atria has partnered with hospitals, and sanitization agencies among others to help its residents fight the virus. “We have bought two oxygen cylinders that can be utilised by anyone who is in need. We are also helping people with testing, online medical consultations, and webinars by doctors to help people overcome the virus,” said Mithilesh Kumar Singh, vice-president, Rajapushpa Atria, Kokapet. In several housing complexes, doctors who are also the residents have been identified to seek consultations and advice. “Executive members from our society are part of the Covid help group that notifies and helps Covid-19 affected people in the society. Right from delivering food to the infected people, to helping them with medicines and other resources, we extend every kind of aid possible,” said Kishore Nuka, member of the executive council at Vertex Prime, Kukatpally. Some residential societies are constantly advocating Covid-appropriate behaviour among its residents. “We are using MyGate app, which allows us to highlight quarantined flats and keeps everyone informed about cases in the community. Also, the pulse oximeter integration allows the guards to provide a first-level screening of people entering the community,” said Lokesh Yellapu, secretary, Satyanarayana Enclave, Manikonda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gated-communities-give-support-to-affected-residents/articleshow/82534000.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Vadodara||Work stress seems only reason: Police||Vadodara: Immense work-related stress is emerging as the only plausible reason for the suicide of third-year MBBS student who hanged himself in the hostel of GMERS Medical College, Gotri.The 22-year-old student, Siddharth Bhadrecha, was on Covid duty at the hospital till April 30. “His suicide note stated that he was ending his life due to stress. We questioned his friends and room-mates but they said that he never talked about any stress. Neither his family knows anything. We haven’t come across any personal problems he was facing. So, it must be work related stress,” said a police official. Police said they are waiting for his mobile call records to get some clues. Interestingly, the cops handed over Siddharth’s mobile phone to his family instead of sending it for forensic examination to get details of his Whatsapp chats. Sources in the medical fraternity and hospitals told TOI that the MBBS students posted on duty at Gotri GMERS Hospital are under pressure to not give any adverse statement about their working conditions while on Covid duty, lest it shows the authorities in poor light.Many medical students and doctors are under severe pressure to work round-the-clock after the Covid cases spiked a couple of months ago. Siddharth had ended his life late on the night of May 4 by hanging himself in his hostel room. His roommate learnt about Siddharth’s suicide the next morning and informed the authorities. When the cops reached the spot, they found a suicide note written by Siddharth. He said that he was ending his life as he was under stress. In his three-page suicide note, Siddharth had written that he couldn’t be a good son and brother. He thanked his parents and even mentioned his friends as well as lecturers. He also wrote about his dreams of buying a car and a motorbike, and how he wanted to live his life as a good person. Siddharth’s parents live in Mangrol taluka of Junagadh district and they are in the fishing business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/work-stress-seems-only-reason-police/articleshow/82534027.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic fear hits vehicle sales in Apr||Ahmedabad: With people remaining locked up in their homes due to the fear of contracting Covid and imposition of stricter restriction to tame the fierce second wave of coronavirus infection, automobile sales in Gujarat and across India have taken a major beating. The vehicle registrations in the state declined by 25% to 73,586 units in April from 98,121 units in the preceding month of March this year, shows monthly data released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). The figure includes registrations of two-wheelers, cars, three-wheelers, tractors and commercial vehicles. As far as passenger vehicle sales are concerned, the number of cars registered dipped 17.75% at 17,484 units in April as against 21,256 units in March. Similarly, 49,008 two-wheelers were registered in April, down 26.46% from some 66,644 units in March. Auto dealers claim that the demand fell drastically as people were fearful of stepping out of homes. “People were completely unwilling to step out of their homes given the pandemic. This time their apprehensions were about not getting medical treatment and therefore, they were scared in stepping out which impacted demand. In fact, footfalls at dealerships declined by more than 60% due to similar reasons. Customers are clearly delaying their purchase decisions,” said Pranav Shah, chairman – Gujarat region, FADA. According to industry players, sales in Gujarat did not plunge as much as they did in other parts of India because the state administration had imposed restrictions much later. As many customers fell prey to Covid, dealers also witnessed cancellations in booking of vehicles. “At least 5% of bookings have either been kept on hold or have been cancelled. This is primarily because customers have fallen prey to Covid,” said an Ahmedabad-based two-wheeler dealer. According to FADA, the first nine days of May has seen extremely lean sales due to lockdown or restrictions imposed by several states. Lockdown also means dealership outlets to remain closed thus meaning zero sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-fear-hits-vehicle-sales-in-apr/articleshow/82534047.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Goa||Goa to start prophylactic treatment to reduce severity of Covid, says health minister Vishwajit Rane||PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Monday announced that the state government would provide ivermectin tablets as a prophylactic treatment protocol for all Goans above 18 years of age to reduce the severity of the impact of Covid-19. The decision, Rane said, was taken based on studies conducted in the UK and US. Stating that Goa will become the first state in the country to take steps towards starting preventive treatment, Rane said, “If we have to decrease the mortality rate then we have to take various steps.” The medication will be made available at the state’s health centres, rural dispensaries, besides the sub-district and district hospitals, from Tuesday, he told reporters. “We — the state’s doctors and experts — have taken the decision based on studies conducted in the US, UK, Japan and Germany, among other countries,” he said. "Once they administered this treatment protocol to their entire population in advance, their mortality rate decreased. The impact of Covid on the persons who took this prophylaxis was also less severe,” Rane said. This treatment is much more effective “in clearing the Covid virus” and people have to take it for five days in a row, the health minister said. He added that the medication is harmless and even those with comorbid conditions can safely take it. He said that they have received suggestions that even children above the age of 10 can be given the preventive treatment, “but we have decided to start it for those above 18”. “We are doing this in the interest of the state. Even if someone has taken the vaccine, they must also take the tablets.” The health minister reiterated that the treatment line does not prevent one from getting Covid-19, but only reduces the severity of the infection. “We should not develop a false sense of security and complacency and should strictly take all precautionary measures and follow the SOPs,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-start-prophylactic-treatment-to-reduce-severity-of-covid-rane/articleshow/82534049.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CID’s Sitalkuchi SIT summons six CISF officers to Kol today||Kolkata: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Bengal CID has summoned six CISF officers on Tuesday in connection with the April 10 firing in Sitalkuchi, Cooch Behar, that left four persons dead. The CID team on Monday also recorded the statement of three police officers — the IC of Mathabhanga thana and two ASIs, one of whom was in charge of the quick reaction team (QRT) that responded to the distress call and the other the sector officer of Jorapatki village booth where the incident took place. “We will record statements of six officers who have been summoned to Bhawani Bhavan. The CISF IG (Southeast sector) has been communicated about the summons,” DIG (special) Kalyan Mukherjee said, adding that the six names had been finalised based on “evidence and documents”. Sources said there was an attempt to arrive at a consensus on recording the statements via video-conference amid the pandemic. “But, we have no legal provisions for the same under the CrPC and have thus asked them (CISF officers) to be present in person,” said a senior CID officer. The DIG (Operations) and CPRO of CISF said they were being given very little time to bring the summoned officers to Kolkata. “The CID could have given us a couple of more days to sort out the logistics... Our men have already returned to their bases across the country. However, we are trying to arrange their presence. In case our men fail to appear, we may seek an alternative day (for questioning),” the CISF DIG added. CID officers said Mathabhanga IC Biswasroy Sarkar was on Monday asked about the steps he took after he heard about the commotion. He was also asked if the QRT team — comprising CISF personnel — had contacted him after the incident. QRT officer ASI Subrata Mondal was asked if he had debriefed the district police or had led the team on his own, an allegation raised by local residents. Sector officer ASI Rafa Burman was quizzed on his exact role that day. The SIT had questioned the investigating officer (of Mathabhanga police station) Moloy Bose last Thursday. He was summoned to Bhawani Bhavan and his statement recorded. CID sources said the future of the probe would depend on the “cooperation” they received from the CISF. Last week, speaking to reporters in Nabanna, CM Mamata Banerjee had said: “I will wait for the (CID) report first.” She had added that “strong action” would be taken against “mischiefmakers”. The initial post-mortem report had indicated that all the four victims had gunshot wounds on their torso and above. The report had prompted the CM to refer to the Sitalkuchi incident as “genocide” and “cold blooded murder”. The CISF — and district police — had claimed firing in self-defence when a “mob tried to snatch firearms”. Calcutta High Court has sought a CID report as several petitions, demanding judicial inquiry, are being heard. One PIL has even urged for an inquiry by a sitting HC judge. The court is likely to take up the matter again after summer recess. “The CID wants to ensure that the probe advances so that we are ready to reply to any queries posed by the court,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cids-sitalkuchi-sit-summons-six-cisf-officers-to-kol-today/articleshow/82534057.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||India Inc battles Covid absenteeism||Mumbai: As Covid numbers rise across the country, organisations are dealing with unusual absenteeism at work. This is because a section of employees is either down with the disease themselves, or are on ‘care giver’ leave for a family member who may have contracted the virus. Business continuity plans are being put to good use with a backup for every role and work being prioritised. Companies like Kellogg India gave out a call to action — ‘There to Kare - Step up, Step In’ — where every employee goes a step beyond their responsibilities to be there for their peers and colleagues and help deal with the challenges of additional workloads. Dabur India, on the other hand, is covering up for absenteeism through job enlargement and managing workload through cross-functional teams. Many firms are also using temp workers to fill in for staff who may be on leave due to Covid. Kellogg South Asia director (HR) Nimisha Das said, “To fully gauge the impact on the organisation, we have been tracking not just Covid-positive cases but presumptive cases as well, where employees’ family members are affected. In either case, this requires time away from work and downtime for people to recuperate. Last month, at the peak of the second wave, at a given point in time a part of our workforce, including extended workforce, was impacted and away from work. Since then, this number has come down to 5%.” Given this scenario, Kellogg crafted a two-level business continuity plan designed by the leadership team to look at how the organisation can operate in a ‘worst case’ scenario. This plan factored in contingencies to the second level if one person were indisposed. “Our actions were focused on two aspects. The first one was to bolster organisational capacity by ensuring that we have a backfill identified for every critical role. In certain cases, we even explored opportunities where external consultants could be brought in to supplement the organisational capacity. The second focus was what we call ‘60-Day Prioritisation’. It was a bottoms-up exercise done to ensure that we focus on only core work and reduce work and meetings by 30% starting at the leadership level down to the frontline workers. This created space and energy for our people to manage core work with full safety, while letting them take care of themselves and their families,” said Das. As the severity of the Covid situation increases, Dabur India has put in place a series of measures so that business remains fully functional. Dabur India executive director (HR) Biplab Baksi said, “At Dabur, we have a sympathetic and collaborative work culture with support coming from all layers in the hierarchy. We are trying to cover for absenteeism through job enlargement of other team members for a specific period. Besides, the workload is being managed with cross-functional support and pooling of resources across functions. In some cases, we have enhanced working hours and added fixed-period temporary resources to manage deliverables.” Max Life Insurance follows an agile business continuity programme that is tailored according to varied functional needs. “To ensure that business processes remain unaffected due to the current situation, we have introduced focused business continuity programmes that enable employees to put their health first with a minimal effect on day-to-day organisational activities,” said Max Life Insurance’s chief people officer Shailesh Singh. A number of companies today offer Covid or vaccination leaves. Some even offer unlimited leaves to employees to manage their work-life balance in a stressful environment. Given the stress, it also means employees are taking more ‘mental breaks’ than before, adding to the absenteeism due to Covid. According to a recent survey by HappyPlus Consulting, a tech-enabled happiness solutions provider, amid concerns of rising number of corona cases and the soaring number of deaths on one hand and the inability to manage work-life balance on the other, employees across organisations are working under immense stress. The study, which covered 2,500 respondents, said nearly 54% are often in the stress zone, while around 39% need immediate attention to manage their anxiety and stress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-battles-covid-absenteeism/articleshow/82534066.cms||Namrata Singh

As a bail condition, additional sessions judge J A Thakar directed Dr Naresh Malhotra of Aditya Multi-speciality Hospital to render his medical service without delay to Covid-19 patients admitted to Civil Hospital and hospitals run by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) till further order. He will have to file an affidavit in this regard. This was among other bail conditions including furnishing Rs 10,000 as bail bond. In February, Dr Malhotra was arrested for allegedly demanding 10% commission to get CIMS Hospital’s bills of approximately Rs 1.5 crore passed by the civic body. Earlier, the doctor was denied bail on the ground that investigation was pending, and the police were yet to file a charge sheet. However, after the charge sheet was filed, Dr Malhotra sought bail once again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doc-accused-of-graft-to-do-covid-duty/articleshow/82534036.cms||---

When HC pressured the government to increase Covid-19 testing facilities, particularly RT-PCR testing, the state government said it would make 26 universities start these testing facilities. However, after nearly a month and instructions to administrative heads of the region to use the Epidemic Diseases Act to force these universities to act, facilities at only nine universities could be made operational, an addition of only four varsities since last week. These four are National Forensic Science University, Gandhinagar; Sardar Patel University, Anand; Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat and IIPH Gandhinagar. For Anand Agriculture University, Uka Tarsadia University in Bardoli, Ahmedbad University, Kamdhenu University in Gandhinagar and Central University of Gujarat, the government said they “do not have appropriate RT-PCR machines for testing and thus, RT-PCR testing would not be possible in the five varsities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/just-9-varsities-started-rt-pcr-testing-govt/articleshow/82534080.cms||---
---||Goa||Public representatives must get 10 persons per day to get jab, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday that the state government wants to fully vaccinate all those above 45 by June 10, and that public representatives should motivate 10 persons a day to go for the jab. He also said that in the next 20 days, the government would have mobile vaccination vans to jab persons with disability and those bedridden. Sawant said that there are around 2,000 public representatives in the state, and if each one of them does so, 20,000 people would be vaccinated every day. He also said that these representatives would be declared frontline workers. Sawant held a meeting with government officials, panchayat members, councillors and ZP members on Covid management. “If we target getting 2 lakh persons vaccinated in the next 10 days, by May 20, all those above 45 would have received the first dose,” he said. The next 10 days, he said, would target those who have received the first dose, so they can receive the second. Sawant said that the state government has set up 37 vaccination centres which function from 9am to 5pm. He said that if the 45+ age group is vaccinated, it would be easy for the state to complete vaccination of the 18-45 group. Sawant told representatives that the government’s target is to save lives, and that he is ready to face criticism. He also recalled the “sad” incident at Bastora on Saturday, where panchayat members stopped the cremation of a person due to the curfew. “We should allow Covid victims to get a decent burial,” he said. Meanwhile, speaking on the curfew, Sawant said that public representatives should stop bars where illegal liquor is being sold. Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho said that 90% of the people of the state should be vaccinated. Godinho said that the state must have more centres for vaccination, and that he is facing problems regarding availability of vaccines and nurses to administer the jabs. “I request the chief minister to maintain hygiene and cleanliness at hospitals,” he said. “We have to keep the morale of healthcare workers who keep hospitals clean high.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-public-reps-must-get-10-persons-per-day-to-get-jab/articleshow/82534089.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Diaspora Goans make frantic calls as solitary parents struggle amid Covid||PANAJI: The elderly in Goa find themselves increasingly isolated and slipping through the cracks of the state’s health care system till it is too late. Living alone, with most of their relatives in other states or abroad, senior citizens are struggling not just to step out to get vaccinated, but to also get medical treatment on time for Covid-19 symptoms. Distraught kin living overseas find themselves making frantic calls from across the world, appealing to volunteer networks and on social media for help. One such instance came to the fore a few days ago, after Christina Fernandes, who lives in Dubai, sought help for her sister, who was admitted to Goa Medical College (GMC) with Covid-19 and severe pneumonia. Fernandes’ appeal was amplified by netizens and local volunteer groups. “She needs to be in ICU due to her severity, but they have kept her in a general ward. No one is really attending to the ward she is in. There is a nurse that just comes and gives some medicines, we don’t even know what they’re giving,” said Fernandes in a social media post. Not only are older people more at risk of severe effects of Covid-19, they also face added challenges in terms of isolation and mental health. The World Health Organisation has warned that older people across the world continue to be “challenged” by requirements to stay at home, lack of physical contact with friends and family, and anxiety over illness and death. Volunteers say that expats are feeling increasingly helpless and worried about their aging parents and relatives who are in Goa. One such volunteer who has stepped in to help the elderly is Runa Aggarwal, a resident of Panaji. “We get WhatsApp calls every day from the Gulf region, UK, Germany and other parts of Europe, and all the calls are for help for Covid positive patients who are alone here in Goa,” said Aggarwal. In many cases, the elderly start developing symptoms, but with no family members to help them access Covid-19 testing, treatment gets delayed. By the time the information finds its way to volunteer groups and NGOs, the elderly are already in respiratory distress and need to be hospitalised. Goa has recorded 1,729 deaths, with 50 people losing their lives to Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. A significant number of the victims are senior citizens who are unvaccinated or have got just the first jab. “I have seen a lot of elderly people in the hospital who have nobody to take care of them. Sometimes all the family members are infected, and there is no one to take care of them,” said activist Rama Kankonkar. Kankonkar has been using mini-ambulances and other vehicles to ferry patients, including senior citizens, to GMC. While ambulances are in short supply, even those ambulances that arrive refuse to take elderly citizens who do not have any kin to accompany them. The 108 ambulances also can’t drop patients back home, so the elderly often have to rely on other people’s kindness to return home. “Systemically, these people are slipping through the cracks, as our healthcare system does not know where the elderly are and what their situation is,” said Kankonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/diaspora-goans-make-frantic-calls-as-solitary-parents-struggle-amid-covid/articleshow/82534102.cms||Newton Sequeira

Recently, relatives of a Bastora resident, who had died of Covid complications, were forced to carry out the cremation at Mapusa after they were not allowed to perform the last rites in the village crematorium. “It is unfortunate what happened in Bastora. The government must take immediate steps to ensure that such incidents are not repeated elsewhere in the state. People should ignore rumours and render all possible help in performing the last rites of Covid deceased,” Panjikar said. He said that it is a false notion that the virus spreads from corpses, and emphasised that everyone must use masks, maintain hygiene and ensure social distancing. People should think beyond religion, caste, creed and help others in these tough times, he said.

---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: Gujarat readies for possible third wave||AHMEDABAD: Amid the predictions by the national and international experts on a possible third wave of Covid-19 cases across India, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Monday convened a meeting with senior bureaucrats, medical experts and scientists to chalk out action plan. Senior officials said that the key issues discussed during the meet included strengthening existing health infrastructure, arranging for the human resources, ensuring oxygen supply and enforcing a uniform treatment protocol. “The points were discussed in light of the state’s experience of the past one year. Vaccination was also stressed as an effective tool for Covid control by the CM and experts,” said a senior state government official. Rupani told participants that the focus in the third wave will be to minimize both deaths as well as coronavirus infections. He credited the recent decline in cases to the collective efforts of healthcare workers and citizens. Gujarat has opted for partial lockdown and night curfew to curb cases, rather than adopting the strategy of limited period full lockdown followed by many states. The experts pointed at mucormycosis – a fungal infection now frequently seen in Covid-recovered patients – as an area of concern and asked the administration to brace for a higher number of cases. In a press conference after the meeting, Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare), said that rural areas are under focus to contain the pandemic. “Isolation centres and Covid care centres with oxygen are being increased across the state. The focus is on breaking the chain, quick identification of the positive cases and isolating them. We also want to reduce the delay in hospitalization,” she said. She defended the dip in Covid testing, claiming that the state’s existing testing is over 2,000 per million population, which is higher than the national average. “The testing is based on factors such as calls to 104 helpline, severe cases in triage areas and OPDs at private clinics. We are not reducing the tests,” she said. Medical experts said that the government is advised on increasing oxygen beds based on the experience of the existing wave.

---||Goa||Goa: 50 more die of Covid, positivity rate 46%||PANAJI: Goa recorded 2,804 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, which took the state’s active tally past the 32,000-mark. Also, the day saw 50 persons succumb to the virus, with the death toll hitting 1,730. Sundays and Mondays usually see a slight dip in numbers, and the state’s recovery rate, too is now 46% after breaching the 50%-barrier last week, by far the highest in the country. “We will have to wait and watch to see how things pan our over the next two weeks,” said a health official. “It is too early to rejoice with the drop in cases.” Over the past couple of days, the number of tests done has been substantially less than the preceding days, and he was quick to point this out too. None of the 50 who died on Monday were fully vaccinated, and only three had received the first dose. The youngest were a 34-year-old man with chronic kidney disease and a 39-year-old with diabetes. 28 of the day’s mortalities were reported at Goa Medical College (GMC), 15 at South Goa district hospital, and three persons were brought dead to hospital. Nine died within 24 hours of admission. Twelve of the 50 didn’t have any comorbidities, and 16 were under 60 years of age. “People continue to report late and with severe complications,” said Dr Anil Mehndiratta, a chest specialist who has been offering his services at Chicalim hospital as an expert. “With the setting up of a small unit such as the facility in Chicalim hospital and at other places, it will help reduce mortalities to some extent, but the impact will be seen eight to ten days later.” The Chicalim hospital is the latest additon as a step-up facility for admission of Covid patients. “Heath officers and doctors have done a fantastic job at Chicalim hospital. I only streamlined the management. Such efforts will make a difference to the pandemic situation in the state,” said Mehndiratta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/50-more-die-of-covid-positivity-rate-46/articleshow/82534139.cms||---

These past few months, this woman had on several occasions prevented my younger sister from taking the lift, saying my sister would spread the infection. But on Monday, matters came to a head, when both of us tried to enter the lift,” said oncologist Rituprana Biswas, who is attached with a private hospital. Her younger sister, Dipanwita Biswas, is a post-graduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, which currently has 290 Covid beds, all occupied. They live in a housing complex near the Kolkata airport. According to the police complaint lodged at the Dum Dum police station, the two sisters, who live on the top floor of the building, called the lift around 8am on Monday as they had to leave for their hospitals. When the elevator arrived, the accused woman was inside. “She had come up to the top floor as she was headed for the terrace to perform puja. But she simply refused to leave the lift so that we could not board it. When I asked her to let us enter, she shouted at me, saying people would get Covid because of us,” said the oncologist. The sisters alleged that the woman abused them verbally and then, threw water at Rituparna’s face. When Dipanwita started recording the incident on her mobile, the woman allegedly snatched away the phone and threw it down. “We are traumatized. Is this the price we have to pay for being in the medical profession?” said Rituparna. Criticizing the incident, ENT surgeon Abhik Ghosh said, “This kind of stigmatization cannot be accepted. This will pull down the morale of the fraternity.” Ghosh is the secretary of Protect the Warriors (PTW), a body working for the welfare of doctors. Similar incidents of ostracization and abuse had become frequent at the beginning of the pandemic last year. But, doctors claimed, though the bias against healthcare workers amid the pandemic had reduced, they still faced the stigma. PTW has shot off a letter to the state health department, appealing to look into the matter so that no doctor, especially those on Covid duty, were threatened or harassed. “Such treatment towards committed doctors should be condemned. We expect the authorities concerned ensure them justice and see that no other healthcare worker faces such traumatizing harassment,” said plastic surgeon Adhish Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neighbours-shame-doc-sisters-face-abuse/articleshow/82534143.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

When the Delhi government was putting the blame on the Modi government for the shortage it was facing allegedly because of inadequate allocation and supply by the Centre, Hibu and the Good Samaritans from the Sikh community swung into action. Hibu, known for his charitable work among his colleagues, felt that his team-work would encourage people from other parts of the country to serve the people. One just needs to send a WhatsApp message at 9810083486 with the patient’s name, Aadhaar card number and doctor’s prescription to get the medical oxygen at the oxygen ATM set up at Subhash Nagar in West Delhi. “We are providing oxygen for 4-5 days or oxygen kits for SOS use. Preference is being given to Covid patients from NE, who work in private companies on meagre salaries and students from the region,” Hibu told TOI over phone from Delhi on Monday. Nine days after the inauguration of the facility, the response has been overwhelming. “But call us only as a last resort,” he said, adding that initiative is meant for the most needy people from the region. Olympian boxer MC Marry Kom donated Rs 3 lakh to support the Oxygen ATM facility that is being constantly manned by Helping Hands Sikh youth team. The oxygen kits are mainly for those who don’t have cylinders to refill. Some amount donated by Mary may be utilized for burial and cremation also of people from the NE. The documents that are needed are digital quarantine papers, Covid report, identity cards from companies and student ID cards. After this, Helping Hands will issue digital token numbers through WhatsApp and SMS to NE patients. The token number and other details will also be sent to the person in charge of the Oxygen ATM. Amandeep Singh (John), in-charge of the ATM, said they faced a dilemma when phone calls came from locals, who are not from the northeast. “In such tragic times, we did break a few rules. About 600-700 patients have got oxygen from us and a few are from other states. Humanity comes first, though we started the initiative for a specific group,” Singh said. For Hibu and his team it was a moment of joy when Rajya Sabha member Mary Kom called him up to say she would provide all support from the MPLAD fund. “No words are enough to thank Helping Hands for their selfless social work in this crisis,” said Mary Kom. “She is the first leader to support Helping Hands reach out to the distressed and needy NE folks. I have conveyed my deep gratitude to her on behalf of the people from the region,” Hibu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/northeasts-good-samaritan-saves-lives-with-oxygen-atm-in-delhi/articleshow/82533745.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Private banks have shifted focus to small business loans that are secured by a government guarantee. This was done under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) announced by the government in the wake of Covid. Another segment where banks have been aggressive is home loans, which saw unexpected demand in the fourth quarter despite the pandemic. Kotak Mahindra Bank said during its earnings call that it has reduced its unsecured portfolio to 5.8% of the loan book in FY21 from 7.5% earlier. Given that the bank had hardly grown its loan book during the year, it meant that the lender had shrunk its unsecured book. ICICI Bank too has been cautious in this segment of individual loans. While the bank grew its home loans by 21% year on year, its loan book grew in single digits. The bank also brought down its loan against shares and other securities by 8%. Incidentally, lenders consider two-wheeler loans to be part of their unsecured portfolio as both recovery costs and depreciation are high. ICICI Bank shrunk its two-wheeler loans by 4%. Axis Bank had been bringing down its share of unsecured loans to small businesses even before the pandemic. As against 19% of small & medium enterprise (SME) loans that were unsecured in FY19, the share came down to 15% in FY20 and 11% in FY21. During its results announcement, Axis Bank said that it shifted focus to secured lending and growing the deposit base. It also said that it has made 100% provisions for unsecured loans that were restructured. Another private lender IndusInd Bank said that it will remain cautious on unsecured lending and will contain this segment within 5% of the bank’s portfolio. It would also go slow on three-wheeler loans. According to analysts with rating agencies, the growth in home and government-guaranteed loans has helped lenders expand the balance sheet even as they shied away from unsecured loans. By making 100% provisions for unsecured loans, private banks have ensured that they do not have to take a major hit in the first quarter despite the second wave of the pandemic buffeting the economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cut-in-fy21-unsecured-loans-may-ease-banks-covid-pain/articleshow/82534155.cms||---

The NGO, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), has also said that medical facilities in Gujarat’s rural parts need to be augmented. JSA has been working to establish healthcare as a basic human right. “The pandemic has posed fresh challenges for healthcare in rural areas of Gujarat,” said Neeta Hardikar, a steering committee member of JSA. “The PHCs and other sub-centres are both underequipped and understaffed, and the number of tests being conducted for Covid-19 in rural areas is too low.” A number of JSA workers who have been working in villages of 12 districts of the state shared their experiences about how the pandemic is being controlled. “Testing kits are not available anywhere in the rural areas of Dahod,” said Vipul Pandya, a volunteer. “As a result, many patients are dying because they are reaching hospitals very late.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rural-anti-corona-push-faces-test-infra-challenge/articleshow/82534171.cms||---

The Mahila Congress blamed the BJP-led government for putting an additional burden on people who have already lost jobs because of the pandemic. “ The party’s women wing president Beena Naik said that since 2014 prices of essentials have increased. “The prevailing price of petrol is Rs 101 per litre in some parts of the country, when the prices of crude oil are much lesser per barrel in the international market. Consumable items are beyond the reach of a person who lives hand to mouth. Transport , medicines are unaffordable because of GST and high tariffs on electricity and water,” said Naik. She added that the pandemic and the failure to curb inflation proves that the BJP government, both at the Centre and in Goa, have lost control over the economy and the healthcare sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rising-prices-further-strain-on-people/articleshow/82534194.cms||---
---||Kolkata||8 women, faces from backward classes & dists in Didi’s new cabinet||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has struck a fine balance between experience and fresh faces, packing her council of 43 ministers with eight women and seven members from the minority community. While handpicking her team, Banerjee has had an eye on district representation. She has also undertaken some major changes in portfolio distribution, possibly based on public feedback. Like earlier, the CM has kept for herself a few key departments such as home, Hill affairs, health and family welfare, land and land reforms, refugee relief and rehabilitation, information and culture, and north Bengal development. She has passed on minority development and madrasa education to Ghulam Rabbani, three-time MLA from Goalpokhor in North Dinajpur. Under the new arrangement, higher education goes to Bratya Basu, like it was before Partha Chatterjee had taken over, and school education to former Left Front minister-turned-Trinamool MLA Paresh Adhikary. Retired IPS-turned-Trinamool MLA Humayun Kabir is the new technical education minister. Both Adhikary and Kabir are ministers of state. Chandrima Bhattacharya has got independent charge of urban development and municipal affairs, along with her responsibilities as MoS health, land reforms. Amit Mitra will look after finance. He has been relieved of the commerce industry portfolio that has been assigned to Partha Chatterjee, other than parliamentary affairs. Former urban development minister and Kolkata ex-mayor Firhad Hakim is the new transport and housing minister. Aroop Biswas will handle power, sports and youth affairs while former power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay will manage the agriculture department. Moloy Ghatak is the new public works department minister and will also handle law and judicial portfolios. Ratna De Nag is the new environment minister. Madhyamgram MLA Rathin Ghosh is the food minister while Jyotipriya Mullick has been given forest portfolio. Two inductions from East Midnapore include Soumen Mahapatra and Akhil Giri. Mahapatra is a Cabinet-rank minister in charge of irrigation and Giri is MoS in charge of fisheries. Another major inclusion in the Cabinet is Manas Bhuniya, Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member. He had served as Cabinet minister in the first Mamata Banerjee regime in 2011 till Congress (Bhuniya was then with Congress) pulled out of the government. Bhuniya is in charge of water resources and investigation department. The other cabinet portfolios remain more or less the same. Trinamool veteran Subrata Mukherjee has panchayat and rural development and also public enterprises while public health engineering goes to Uluberia Dakshin MLA Pulak Roy, a new entrant. Former cricketer Manoj Tiwari is minister of state for youth affairs. The new council has representation from backward classes, including Adivasis, that had been a major plank of the BJP. Bulu Chik Baraik, Sandhya Tudu, Srikanta Mahato, Birbaha Hansda and Jyotsna Mandi are among the prominent inductees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eight-women-faces-from-backward-classes-dists-in-didis-new-cabinet/articleshow/82534203.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP leaders call for ‘coordination’ with Centre||Kolkata: Bengal BJP leaders on Monday urged the Mamata Banerjee government to shun its “confrontationist” attitude and take a “coordinative” approach towards the Centre amid the pandemic in addition to “containing post-poll violence” in the state. Responding to Banerjee’s remarks blaming the Union government for the vaccine crunch, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “The CM has been making new claims for vaccine every day. Today, she asked for 3 crore doses. The government needs to concentrate on proper distribution of vaccines that it has. People have no clue where they can get vaccines. The Centre has already sent 1.9 lakh doses to Bengal. We have seen how vaccine vials remained unused in the state at one point of time.” Ghosh also pointed out that the Centre had sent Rs 652 crore for rural Bengal. “We need vaccines and other states need them too. Like the CM, we can’t say that medical oxygen produced in Bengal should be used in the state first before it is sent to other states,” he said. Suvendu Adhikari harped on the restoration of “a violence-free democracy” in Bengal soon after he was named the leader of the BJP legislative party. “Look what is happening at Sabang, Amdanga in North 24 Parganas, and Canning, Gosaba, Basanti and Kultali in South 24 Parganas,” Adhikari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-leaders-call-for-coordination-with-centre/articleshow/82534208.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Lilly is also in discussions with other manufacturers for potential grant of additional voluntary licences, a company statement said. The domestic companies will manufacture and distribute the drug in India. Details about the pricing were not disclosed. Recently, Eli Lilly received restricted emergency use for Baricitinib to be used in combination with Remdesivir for the treatment of Covid in hospitalised adults requiring supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation. Significantly, Natco Pharma filed a compulsory licence to manufacture Baricitinib on grounds of an unmet medical need due to lack of supply as well as affordability. The application says Eli Lilly’s Olumiant is not manufactured in India, and that less than 9,000 tablets were imported in 2019 and 2020. The average price per tablet is huge, approximately Rs 3,230. Baricitinib was discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly. It is approved in India and other countries including the US as a treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eli-lilly-signs-licences-with-generic-cos-for-covid-drug/articleshow/82534236.cms||---

Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar said that all the industrial units have adopted stringent protocols to break the chain and reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus. Speaking to TOI, Kochkar said that the industry body will be issuing fresh SOPs so that all steps are taken to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. “We already have SOPs in place, but we want to add a few more things like isolation for positive cases, especially in larger industries. Verna Industries Association (VIA) will be circulating SOP’s to self-impose and strictly follow all safety protocols required to run the industry,” Kochkar said. Most of the firms have asked employees involved in accounts, sales, purchasing and human resources to work from home. Only engineering staff and machine operators involved with production and maintenance have been asked to report for duty. Many firms have asked their employees to work from home for the duration of the state-wide curfew. Units have also restarted thermal screening, staggered lunch timings and prohibition of outsiders in factory premises. VIA plans to setup a step up a hospital at Verna for workers so that those who test positive can be treated. “The step-up hospital can take care of the patient till he goes for the requirement of oxygen, though the facility will have oxygen concentrators as a back-up. A company has offered us a site for the step-up hospital and by the weekend it should be up and running,” Kochkar said. The Covid care centre that VIA set up for the first wave has been converted into a vaccination centre. VIA has purchased 52 concentrators and additional RT-PCR machines for the step-up hospital. The industry body has also donated RT-PCR kits to the South Goa district hospital and to the Cansaulim step-up hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/industry-works-with-45-staff-many-from-home/articleshow/82534247.cms||---

I am sure we will all get a clean chit. BJP had been unnecessarily trying to malign my image and career,” Hakim said. “I will say what I have to in court, and justice will be served.” Hakim and Mukherjee are among 43 Trinamool leaders sworn in as ministers in the new Mamata Banerjee government on Monday. The governor said: “I have accorded sanction as CBI sought the same. I gave sanction after considering everything. I used my discretion. The CBI sought sanction, but I decided not to look into it till the poll process was over. As a governor, I gave sanction against the ministers as the governor is the appointing authority for ministers as per Article 164 of the Constitution.” Trinamool sources indicated the Narada sting ops also implicated BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who was then transport minister. The CBI plea came and the governor’s nod was granted after Adhikari resigned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/have-full-faith-in-judiciary-hakim-says-after-guv-cbi-sanction/articleshow/82534260.cms||---

When people buying essentials at the market questioned the police as to why they were being stopped from shopping, they were told that the municipal market is not permitted to open during curfew, sources said. When TOI asked Canacona PI Tulshidas Naik whether buying vegetables and fruits at the market was not permissible, he said that though vegetables and fruits come under essentials, as per directives, the municipal and panchayat markets are not to be opened due to a possible rush. However, he said that people can purchase their requirements from small vegetable and fruit outlets that are open outside the main market. On Monday, Canacona residents were mostly seen shopping in the commercial town of Chaudi. However, there was no rush like that witnessed over the weekend. Meanwhile, active cases in Canacona dropped to 43 on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-police-shut-municipal-mkt/articleshow/82534281.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to visit violence-hit areas of Bengal||KOLKATA: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has decided to visit violence-hit areas of West Bengal. The last time a governor undertook such a tour was after the Nandigram violence in 2007 by then incumbent Gopalkrishna Gandhi. “If your vote becomes a cause of your death or your property is subjected to loot, it is the end of democracy. Constitution cannot flourish when people are to suffer for choosing to vote. This is very serious,” Dhankhar said soon after administering the oath of office and secrecy to 43 ministers in the third Mamata Banerjee government on Monday. Violence spread after assembly election results were declared on May 2, when Trinamool Congress achieved a resounding victory with 213 seats while BJP managed 77. The governor has already asked the state government to make arrangements for his visit, within days of the Union home ministry sending a four-member team to Bengal to assess ground situation following complaints of post-poll violence. “I have decided to visit the affected parts of the state as part of my constitutional duty. I asked the state government to make arrangements,” Dhankhar said. The governor implored the Trinamool government to do some soul searching after CM Banerjee claimed there was no such violence in the state. “All is well, there’s no violence (is being projected). But the ground situation is otherwise. I expect the state government to engage in soul searching, address grim ground reality and book the culprits who have chosen to tarnish our democratic fabric,” Dhankhar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-dhankhar-to-visit-violence-hit-areas-of-bengal/articleshow/82534303.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fuel price jumps twice in one week, adds to Covid pressure||KOLKATA: Petrol and diesel prices again went up on Monday after two days of break, evoking another round of demand for fare revision by public transport operators. On May 10, the diesel price rose by 33 paise to retail at Rs 84.95 and petrol price by 24 paise to sell at Rs 91.71 a litre. At a time when the nation is reeling under Covid-induced crisis, the rising fuel cost is having an adverse impact on residents’ budget as well as livelihood. Apart from the public transport sector being affected, the cost of ferrying goods has also increased substantially, pushing up prices of essentials sharply. Consumers have been struggling with their budget as prices of essential goods, from edible oil to pulses, have been burning a hole in their pockets. Till May 2, the day election results in five states were declared, prices of petrol and diesel had remained static for around a fortnight. In Kolkata, the diesel price stayed at Rs 83.59 a litre and petrol at Rs 90.6. But since May 4, the fuel prices have been on the upward swing, and within days, diesel got costlier by Rs 1.46 per litre and petrol Rs 1.11 per litre. “Every upward revision is forcing at least 5% buses off the roads. Bus operators have run out of their resources. They had hoped for a fare revision commensurate with the ever-increasing fuel costs. But the government did not revise the fares, leaving us gasping for breath. It will not be easy to bring those buses back on the road, even if the Covid situation improves,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. The successive increase in fuel prices crippled the public transport sector, which had already become unviable to run, he claimed. “We demand a substantial rise in fare to keep the trade afloat. A lot of bus operators and workers have lost their livelihood. The private bus operation system in the city bears a grim picture,” said Bandyopadhyay. Owners of vehicles, both four- and two-wheelers, complained their monthly budget on fuel had gone up so much that they had been compelled to cut corners so that they could continue to travel by their own vehicles to steer clear of the virus. The high rate of fuel prices also impacted the automotive sector — a large source of employment in the country — as vehicle sales saw a sharp drop, said Amrik Sondhi, a automobile dealer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fuel-price-jumps-twice-in-one-week-adds-to-covid-pressure/articleshow/82534308.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

When the earlier four-day lockdown was announced, some who were planning to leave the state much later, boarded the first available trains and any other means of transport. Migrants from Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Karnataka, Nepal returned to their respective states fearing a return of last year's lockdown as the number of cases started shooting up. Vaibhav Shenvi who rents out rooms to a number of migrants said that migrant workers who usually rush home before the end of summer to be in time for the harvest season left a little earlier this time as they were worried with the rising Covid cases in Goa. Some of the workers who had returned to Goa after restrictions has eased had hoped for some earnings before they returned to their home states but seeing cases increasing in Goa they had little choice but to return. Some regret coming back to Goa in the hopes of earning since they couldn't earn as they normally would during previous years. With workers heading back the real estate industry in Goa has got hampered, said a contractor who didn’t want to be mentioned. Labourers were brought to Goa every year by many contractors but with the current pandemic they couldn’t stay longer this time, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-canacona-migrants-head-home-as-wages-dwindle/articleshow/82534347.cms||---

On the other hand, 15,326 patients recovered in last 24 hours and fatalities were under 200 for the first time after April 16.

He said a vaccination centre was to be opened at MPT, as per the directorate of shipping circular issued last month. However, till date there is no sign of the same. He also accused the NRI cell of not taking up the issue and further, demanding for a seafarer Covin corridor. “Seafarers are waiting to get the two doses to join work onboard ships, but unfortunately there is no support from the government”, he said Viegas also offered the government support to start the Covin seafarer corridor. “Actually, there should have been more centres for vaccination,” he said. Meanwhile, AAP has launched a plasma donation drive as part of its #GoansAgainstCorona campaign. AAP state convenor Rahul Mhambre said this decision was taken after the party received a number of requests from citizens for plasma, as there was a shortage at the Plasma Bank at GMC due to lack of donors. “With 20 donors already confirmed, the goal is to create a database of at least 50 donors,” Mhambre said adding that donors were located through the AAP’s own volunteer base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-govt-ignoring-seafarers-vax-demand/articleshow/82534370.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Growth may ease to 8.2% if pandemic peaks end June, vax needs Rs 60k cr spend: Crisil||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Crisil, which had forecast an 11% growth as a base case for FY22, has said that the second wave of the pandemic could bring India’s GDP expansion for the current fiscal to 9.8% if it peaks in May-end. The projected growth rate would be even lower at 8.2% if the second wave peaks by end-June. “The intensity of the second wave of Covid infections in India has come as a surprise and is haemorrhaging the country’s healthcare infrastructure. That has made lockdowns and restrictions inevitable,” Crisil said in a presentation on the impact of the second wave. According to Crisil, the base case of 11% GDP growth assumes case surge and lockdowns peak by mid-May. In this scenario, the economy returns to the pre-pandemic level by September 2021 quarter. Pointing out that India ranks lowest in terms of a fully vaccinated population, Crisil said that Rs 55,000-60,000 crore will need to be spent on vaccine procurement. However, the budget is manageable as it is 15-20% of healthcare expenditure for key infected states. On the positive side, the manufacturing sector has shown some resilience because of external demand and the fact that manufacturing activity is permitted during the lockdown. Prompted by this resilience, Crisil has maintained its 15% revenue growth estimate for companies during the current fiscal. However, the contact-intensive services sector — such as hotels, air transport and other services, which account for 10% of GDP — would be hit. Incidentally, these sectors also account for 10% of employment. Because of the second wave, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to continue with its accommodative stance despite upward pressure on commodity prices. This will result in interest rates being softer than they were in the same period last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/growth-may-ease-to-8-2-if-pandemic-peaks-end-june-vax-needs-rs-60k-cr-spend-crisil/articleshow/82534376.cms||Mayur Shetty

Ohio Hospital now has around 50 patients admitted to its Covid-care ward. Had it not been for the unpredictable supply of oxygen, the hospital could have catered to 30 more patients, a good number given the dearth of hospital beds now in the city. Like many other smaller hospitals, the healthcare facility in New Town also depends on bulk oxygen cylinders as it does not have a liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tank for storage. Currently its daily consumption is between 100 and 150 oxygen cylinders. “Most patients coming to the hospital are requiring oxygen support. The demand in the past few weeks has gone up by around five times. Our old vendor has their limitation. We have frantically been trying to contact new vendors who can provide us with more cylinders. But we are not getting any positive response,” said a source at the hospital. Hospital officials have reached out to the state health department, asking for for help so that it can ensure continuous oxygen supply to the currently admitted 50-odd patients, including around four on ventilation. “The supply has become so unpredictable against the rising demand. Unless we get help, it would be difficult for us to take in new patients,” said a source. Amid complaints of oxygen shortage in many states, hospitals in Bengal that have LMO tanks are getting regular supply, despite the rising demand. But many smaller healthcare facilities are on the brink of facing an oxygen crisis. “Initially, we ran only 60 Covid beds and we had enough oxygen supply. But now, we have 100 beds occupied by Covid patients, 80% of whom require oxygen support. Every day is a struggle to refill the cylinders,” said an official of another nursing home off VIP Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/o2-shortage-hits-new-town-hosp-admission/articleshow/82534393.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The food kits contain rice, atta, oil, sugar, milk powder, pulses and biscuits. The covid protection kits contain hand sanitiser, soap, mask, steam inhaler and immune booster tablets. Whenever required, they are also providing the vulnerable with oximeters and thermometers. “Last year, we were only giving ration kits, but with the second wave, we took the initiative to look at precaution and protection from the infection till people are able to take the vaccine. This is especially for construction workers and residents of slums at Zuarinagar, Chimbel and Baina,” Fr Lawrence Monteiro, executive director of the Don Bosco’s Konkan Development Society, said. They have ordered 2,000 strips of the multivitamins besides 5,000 masks and hundreds of soaps and sanitisers. They are currently distributing oximeters on demand only. The Covid kits are being assembled by the Society before being distributed among the poor. “Some of these things may take time to arrive, but we will continue to provide kits until people are able to get vaccinated,” Fr Monteiro said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/don-bosco-society-gives-food-covid-kits-to-the-needy/articleshow/82534402.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||BJP names Suvendu Adhikari as leader of opposition||Kolkata: BJP’s Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari was elected leader of the party’s legislative wing in a meeting of 52 newly elected legislators on Monday. MLA Manoj Tigga was named for the party chief whip’s post. BJP national vice-president and first time MLA from Kirshnanagar Uttar Mukul Roy proposed Adhikari’s name. BJP MLAs will now propose Adhikari’s name to Bengal Assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee for the post of leader of the opposition. Union law minister and BJP central observer Ravi Shankar Prasad announced Adhikari’s name after the meeting at the party’s Hastings office. “Our party’s national vice-president and new MLA Mukul Roy proposed Adhikari’s name. The proposal was seconded by 22 MLAs. I asked if there was an alternative name. No other name came up,” he said. After the meeting, Adhikari said: “Some MLAs couldn’t attend due to Covid and the extraordinary situation in the state after the declaration of poll results. Our party consulted MLAs representing a cross-section of communities before taking the decision.” While Adhikari’s selection signalled that there would be no let-up in BJP’s “struggle for democracy” in Bengal, state minder Kailash Vijayvargiya made it loud and clear. “People have assigned our party with the role of the opposition. We will support the state government’s good work but won’t hesitate from taking to the streets if the government takes the old track of corruption and nepotism,” he said. With the “giant killer” label after his Nandigram victory, and now taking up as the leader of BJP MLAs, assembly seniors cutting across party lines saw little chances of all-party resolutions. They kept their fingers crossed over what was in store, keeping in mind the bipolar representation in the assembly with 213 members from Trinamool, 77 from BJP and one each from Abbas Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binay Tamang). Adhikari’s selection may also help the party brass tone down the slanging match between the old guard and the ‘dal badlu’ BJPs that has come to the fore following the polls. A section close to Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh had floated two-time BJP MLA Tigga’s name on the ground that he was a “tested member” of the Sangh. Some leaders like former Bengal BJP president Tathagata Roy also feared there would be an exodus of ‘dal badlu’ leaders after BJP’s defeat and were in two minds about giving the mantle to Adhikari. This section had a similar opinion on Roy, which could explain why he announced that he was with BJP and would continue with the “struggle for democracy” in Bengal. Roy pulled out of the race after being told that he might have to play a greater role as BJP national vice-president. Adhikari was ahead in the race on two grounds. He could defeat Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram though TMC won a decisive victory, relegating the BJP to 77 seats. Secondly, Adhikari has enough administrative experience that none of his contenders have. He handled two major departments — transport and environment — as minister (2016-2020) before quitting TMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-names-suvendu-as-leader-of-oppn/articleshow/82534406.cms||---

Banerjee said: “Not even 24 hours had passed since the government took oath when they sent a central team. And they are going to only those areas where BJP has been attacked? Have they gone to places where Trinamool Congress has been attacked? When there was post-poll violence in Tripura, did they spend a dime? We will protect peace in Bengal.” There is peace in Bengal, she said, adding: “Those who cannot digest defeat are spreading fake videos that there is genocide in Bengal.” “Those who are coming to Bengal from outside need mandatory RT-PCR tests. And if these tests are positive, they will be quarantined,” the CM said. Promising immediate free vaccination in Bengal once the doses arrive, the CM said: “We have been asking for three-crore doses of vaccine, we are being provided only a few lakhs. The state cannot provide for vaccine, the Centre can. They had exported 65% of our vaccine stocks outside India, now it is their job to arrange for it.” “We must buy vaccines at a much higher price (than the Centre). The Centre is not helping us in any way. To scale up health infrastructure, we need funds. I would appeal to all corporate houses and citizens to help in this effort,” Banerjee added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/why-only-visit-areas-where-bjp-has-been-attacked-asks-cm/articleshow/82534409.cms||---
---||Jaipur||UDH decides not to impose lease money & conversion charges on new oxygen plants||JAIPUR: The Urban Development and Housing (UDH) department has decided to provide more incentives to oxygen manufacturers who will establish plants in the state. In an order issued on Monday, the department has stated not to impose lease money and conversion charges on plots where oxygen plants will be established. A top official in town planning department said, “The state government has provided immense benefits to the manufacturers. For instance, If businessmen are establishing a plant on 1,000 square meter land, they will get benefit of not paying atleast Rs 35 lakh, which otherwise would have been spent for various government fees.” An official further said, on a 1,000sqm plot, the manufactures in normal situation would have to pay approximately Rs 250 per sqm, which includes conversion and development charges. Similarly, government imposes 2.5 % amount on the reserve price per annum as lease money. This is imposed for 99 years. “The government is converting the land of the manufacturers without any cost. This is the best incentive which could be provided to any industry,” said a source. After UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal announced plans to establish 59 oxygen plants in the state, many MLAs have approached the minister requesting to set up plants in their constituencies. The MLAs have offered money from their LAD funds to establish the plants. So far, the DLB has received requests of 10 MLAs. A senior UDH official said, “We are examining the request of MLAs following the direction of the UDH minister. The expense of the oxygen plant is proposed to be borne by local bodies. However, there are a few local bodies which are cash-strapped and cannot support the cause. Considering the fact, the MLAs have come forward and offered money from their LAD fund.” In district hospitals, the state government plans to establish oxygen plants having a capacity of 50 cylinders. The estimated cost to set up the plant is Rs 55 lakh. The MLAs of different areas are approaching the UDH department to establish plants in community centres or in other facility areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-decides-not-to-impose-lease-money-conversion-charges-on-new-oxygen-plants/articleshow/82534438.cms||---

Alarmed by the crowded swab collection centre, he suggested ways to decongest the campus.“There is crowding at the testing centre because there is not enough space for people to wait and distance themselves. The lack of space is because of too many ambulances driving in and piling up at the same drop-off point,” an official said.Since ambulances can’t be avoided, Pandian suggested moving visitors’ vehicles, both four and two-wheelers, to the Government Arts College Road located diagonally opposite the hospital’s mortuary gate. He also moved the swab collection centre to St Francis School. After noticing complaints of crematoriums being fully booked due to being used exclusively for Covid-19 victims, the commissioner also inspected electric crematoriums at Aathupalam, Podanur Chettipalayam Road and the corporation’s west zone crematorium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/swab-collection-centre-at-cmch-shifted-to-nearby-school/articleshow/82534443.cms||---

The racketeers were sourcing medical items from private hospitals and other states like Haryana. The arrested accused — Dinesh Khateek, Rakesh Prajapath and Sonu Meena were selling one 100 mg injection at Rs 30,000 through their connections in different private hospitals. Digant Anand, DCP, Jaipur Police Commissionerate said that the initial investigation proved that all the accused and their racket have connections with hospitals. “The accused have confessed to having links with hospitals and agents who can provide cylinders and concentrators at exorbitant prices to those in needy,” said Anand. The racket in the city usually gets information through their network in hospitals or source information about those in need from social media platforms. They call up the given numbers and assure them of fulfilling their request by charging a hefty sum. The accused were providing oxygen cylinder between Rs 10,000 and Rs 30,000 while oxygen concentrator at Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000. “Remdesivir injections and oxygen cylinders are also being stolen from these hospitals. It is the duty of the hospitals to monitor the inventory of the medical items they have been receiving from the government,” said Anand. Police laid a trap for the arrested accused by approaching them in the guise of Covid-19 patient’s relatives outside a private hospital on Monday. Two private hospitals in the city have been dropped from the list of Covid-dedicated hospitals for overcharging and not keeping the record of the inventory of Remdesivir injections and oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-track-links-of-remdesivir-black-marketing-to-city-hospitals/articleshow/82534459.cms||---

Codissia would support the state government initiatives like the present round of lockdown for Covid prevention, Babu said. “There are a lot of export-oriented industries in Coimbatore, which are allowed to function even during the lockdown. At the same time, there are several units that need to remain closed. These units face a lot of problems.

The chief minister was interacting with MLAs and panchayati raj and local bodies’ representatives through VC. The chief minister said the government will also make ambulance service free for Covid patients to mitigate the hardship of the people. He said the situation now is such that we do not know who is Covid positive as many asymptomatic people are bringing virus home and spreading it to their family members and acquaintances. This is the reason that the government has decided to enforce a lockdown. He said the only way to defeat the virus is by following Covid appropriate behaviour of wearing masks and following social distancing. Besides, people should seek medical help whenever they see any symptoms and early treatment is the best way to avoid complications and faster recovery. He said the government is ready to use all its resources for Covid management, but that will not make any difference if the cases increase at current pace. He said the virus had spread to rural areas, affecting all age groups unlike last time. Besides, the number of patients requiring oxygen support and ventilators is very high in contrast to last time. Health minister Raghu Sharma said this pandemic could be avoided by speeding up vaccination. “It is our endeavour to carry out the vaccination programme in the state at full speed,” he said. He urged the central government to provide adequate doses for vaccination to people of all age groups. Secretary, medical and health, Siddharth Mahajan said the number of active patients in the state has crossed 2 lakhs. If the rate of infection remains the same, then in 26 days this number will be doubled. He said that a campaign is being carried out on a war-footing to identify corona positive cases and distribute free medicine kits through door-to-door survey across the state. So far, over 7 lakh people have been identified who were suffering from cough, fever, cold, and medicines are being distributed to them. In rural areas, arrangements have been made for treatment of non-Covid diseases along with Covid through mobile medical units and mobile vans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-cooperation-of-all-to-break-the-chain/articleshow/82534472.cms||---

---||Jaipur||High Court issues notice on defunct ventilators and poor condition of 108 ambulance service||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Monday issued a notice to the government on two PILs. One is related to defunct ventilators distributed from the PM Cares fund in Karouli and other districts and the other is related to the shortage of staff and oxygen at the government-run 108 ambulance services. The division bench of chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Satish Sharma issued the notice to the chief secretary and secretary medical and health. The notice comes in the wake of a PIL by lawyer Vijay Pathak seeking a reply on not using the ventilators provided by the PM Cares Fund for Covid patients last year. The petitioner said the condition of Covid patients in the state including Karauli district remained a matter of concern, but due to the negligence of the state government and the medical department, it was unable to fully utilise the available resources to fight the virus effectively. The ventilators were made available to the hospitals in view of the serious Covid condition last year. Neither the ventilators were installed nor the administration of the hospitals and the medical department trained the medical staff for the smooth operation of these machines. As a result, around 51 patients died at Karauli district headquarters and 47 at Hindaun subdivision headquarters within a month. In all, 25 ventilators at Karauli district headquarters and nine at Hindaun were lying idle since last year. Many of these lives could have been saved if the ventilators had been working. In Pali district too, about 40 ventilators are also not being used due to lack of trained staff, it was said. The petitioner said newspapers had reported that 10 ventilators in Bharatpur division headquarters had been rented out to private hospitals. The petition has also demanded installation of CCTV cameras in the ICUs of state government and private hospitals so that the patients’ relatives keep track of their condition. The petition on the poor condition of 108 services said GVK EMRI company, which is operating the ambulance services, is getting Rs 16.10 crore from the government but the ambulances are in poor condition due to lack of maintenance and staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-issues-notice-on-defunct-ventilators-and-poor-condition-of-108-ambulance-service/articleshow/82534476.cms||Joychen Joseph

In a letter to the chief secretary, the network requested the government to notify the ‘Sponsorship Scheme’ under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, which can provide supplementary support to families to meet medical, nutritional, educational and other needs of their children and improve their life. The network has asked for immediate identification and enrolment of beneficiaries for priority households under the National Food Security Act, 2013. It stated that out of a population of 15 lakh, around 5.5 lakh have been covered under PHH (priority house holder) cards, but benefits have reached very few as per a RTI. “The claim that the state is leading in the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and that 97.3% people covered in the scheme availed of its benefits does not match with the information provided by the department,” the network stated. It has also asked for extension of the midday meal package for May during the pandemic and distribution of immunity building foods with vitamin C, D, Zinc and Magnesium to children at their doorstep or have this picked up by parents, along with an audit of midday meals distributed through schools in Goa. The network comprising members of civil society organisations and child rights advocates working for protection of children in the state have also demanded that Goa activate the State Children’s Fund (under the Goa Children’s Act) and Juvenile Justice Fund (under Juvenile Justice Act) so that emergency needs of children due to Covid-19 vulnerabilities may be prioritised and addressed through these funds. “The immense health and socioeconomic crisis brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately hit underprivileged children. What started as a public health emergency has turned into a multidimensional crisis that has led to a pandemic of malnutrition, poverty, violence and mental health issues of children in the state,” the convenor stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/welfare-org-seeks-medical-nutritional-support-for-underprivileged-children/articleshow/82534479.cms||---

But that has not checked the outflow. Industry representatives said during the curfew, about 50% of workers, mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, had left and after the lockdown was announced another 15% have gone. Many workers living in villages nearby the industrial areas have stopped reporting to work. “Most of the Muslims workers have left because of Eid. The fear of the fast-spreading pandemic has also been a reason for many workers living nearby areas of the industrial areas not reporting to duty. Every value chain of production requires specially-skilled workers. If we miss workers engaged for one component, the whole process gets disturbed,” said Dileep Baid, former president of CII-Rajasthan. On its part, the government has tried to facilitate the movement of workers and check the misuse of the waiver by setting up a portal for self-generation of e-passes. Last time around, the system of pass issuance was chaotic as the district collector’s office was flooded with e-mails for permission and there was hardly any strategy to respond them. Principal secretary, department of IT & Communication, Alok Gupta said, “Out of the three-step process, we have gone live with the first one. Already 258 companies have registered. By tomorrow, all the steps will be live to facilitate companies for generating the e-passes. We are trying to make the process hassle-free, quick and effective.” The industry is also wary of running the operations after it lost a few of its members to Covid. “There is a bigger risk now. The demand is not so high to make a big business case for running the operations. But then, it’s our profession and there are so many workers who depend on us. We cannot simply shut the gates and tell everybody to go,” said Saurabh Gupta, an apparel manufacturer in Sitapura. Hero Ravjani, secretary, Apparel Park Manufacturers Association, an exporter himself, said their business continuity is a necessity as overseas clients need delivery of orders in time. “So far, we have not seen any disruption. The government’s decision to keep running the industry is a huge relief. With limited staff, we can manage 15 days but if it goes beyond that and we don’t have enough labour, it will start to have an impact,” added Ravjani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hassle-free-e-passes-for-industry-but-more-workers-leave-as-lockdown-kicks-in/articleshow/82534495.cms||---

While their work in the fight against Covid-19 continued, various groups of Asha workers held protests by displaying banners or wearing black ribbons. The Asha Gat-Pravastak Karmachari Union said this protest was to bring to the government’s attention their dire financial condition. Rajendra Sathe, president of the union, said the government can easily resolve the issue. “All Asha workers must be paid according to the state government’s pays scale, whatever is the minimum one, let’s start at that. Also, they must be paid Rs 300per day for Corona-related work. This was something which was promised last year but never implemented,” said Sathe. Priti Meshram, general secretary of the union, said, “From time to time, we have been raising this issue but it seems the government is not interested. We are at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19 with thousands of my colleagues risking their health and working 10 hours minimum each day. And our monthly compensation is less than Rs10,000 while nurses and doctors earn many times that.” She added that Asha workers have been involved with vaccination drive and monitoring health of home-quarantined patients. “We are going to their houses and checking up on health parameters. It’s such a risky thing because we are coming in close proximity of positive patients,” she said. The union has demanded a life insurance for every Asha worker. Sathe said, “Minimum cover of Rs10 lakh must be provided to each worker. Also, a pension scheme of Rs5,000 per month must be implemented with retrospective effect, plus a lump sum of Rs5 lakh to everyone after retirement.” He warned that their agitation will go the ‘next level’ if government does not fulfil their demands. “We have conducted an online meeting with many of the union members and soon a strong agitation will be launched,” said Sathe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/asha-workers-protest-for-better-wages/articleshow/82534503.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Panic in villages after 7 bodies found in Yamuna||KANPUR: There was panic among locals of Hamirpur district on Sunday when they spotted seven dead bodies floating in the river Yamuna amid news of several casualties taking place due to Covid-19. The incident came to light after a video of multiple bodies floating in the Yamuna in Hamirpur went viral on social media. Though ASP, Hamirpur, Anoop Kumar, did not rule out any foul play, he said many families in villages still believe in ‘jal samadhi’ (immersion of body in river) and prefer it over cremation in some cases as per their beliefs. A probe is under way still, he added. “We are looking into the matter and have contacted police of Kanpur Outer and Kanpur Dehat as two dead bodies were brought from Kanpur side in tractors and immersed in the river. Besides, one body in a partially charred state was also found floating towards Kanpur side. We have apprised the two districts and have intensified vigil in the area,” the ASP said. Locals were, however, fearful that people have died in large numbers in villages in the second wave and their family members are dumping their bodies in the river out of fear of contracting deadly coronavirus.“In some cases, people kept death of family members due to Covid confidential fearing social boycott. Both reasons may have made people to immerse bodies in the river instead of cremating them. This is why there has been a sudden rise in sighting of bodies in the river,” said a local. A police official, preferring anonymity, said, “On an average, one or two bodies are easily spotted floating in Yamuna on the Kanpur-Hamirpur border daily. But, there has been a surge in the number of bodies found floating in the river recently, which indicates an increase in number of deaths.” The incident, however, saw environmentalists raise concerns over the unchecked practice of body disposal in rivers by villagers, who consider the ‘panchak’ period spread over five days as inauspicious and prefer to immerse bodies in river than cremating them. “Most villagers consider the ‘panchak’ period, which started on Wednesday and ended on Sunday, to be inauspicious and therefore prefer immersing the body in river,” said Jal Prahari Rajendra Veer Singh Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/locals-in-hamirpur-panic-on-spotting-seven-bodies-in-yamuna-amid-covid-second-wave/articleshow/82534510.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Along with sms, the local staff at centres distribute tokens to those who have come as early as 8 am and are standing in queue. Actual time for vaccination as per the sms is 10am to 5pm.  Earlier, unruly scenes were witnessed outside Soni Faliya vaccination centre and Dumas as well. Following allegations of irregularities in maintaining sequence in queue, locals even attacked a staff member at a centre in Vesu.  “We are sending around 250 smses per centre and we have a capacity to vaccinate these many people. All reach in the morning due to which the chaos is created. We have enough stock of vaccines,” said an SMC officer.  Meanwhile, for the below 45 years, not getting appointment is also a major issue. “I have been trying for an appointment for the past five days,” said Jitendra Pawar, a resident of Udhna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/chaotic-scenes-at-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82534516.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Life has become meaningless for those who have lost dear and dear ones||JHANSI: From the four-page obituary published in a local daily on Monday shows how much trauma families are passing through who have lost their near and dear ones in large numbers. There are families who have lost both their parents leaving young children orphans and helpless. The devastating effect of the second Covid wave has left a life-long scratch in the lives of many pushing them to the darkness of uncertainty. For 21-year old Radha Srivastavs and her 16-year old brother Vivek (names changed), life has come to a dead end after both of their parents succumbed to Covid a few days ago. Sitting alone in their old ancestral house in Bara Bazar, they have no tears left in their eyes as they have to think of their future which is quite dark. Radha is doing B.Ed and Vivek is in grade XI. “The past fortnight has changed our entire life. While my younger brother and my brother- in- law were trying to find a place to cremate my father who died of Covid, me and my elder sister who got married a few months ago, were trying to rush my mother to a hospital as she had too developed serious related problems while in home isolation, while I myself was positive too. My mother too died of Covid within days after fighting a tough battle. The irony is that she left the world on the day of her marriage anniversary. I have never seen such a traumatic time and now fear for our future”, said Radha with an expressionless face. Life has also come to a standstill for Manoj Agarwal (name changed) a businessman, who lost his father and 47-year-old wife within a gap of a few days. With two young children, Manoj has no idea how his life became miserable within a few days.  Same is the case of a doctor couple who along with his sister died of Covid recently while their younger son was in the hospital getting Covid treatment and the elder son is abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/life-has-become-meaningless-for-those-who-have-lost-dear-and-dear-ones/articleshow/82534529.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||People waiting to buy remdesivir stage protest||Coimbatore: Hundreds of people who had been waiting to buy remdesivir at the Coimbatore Medical College took out a protest on Monday when the sale counter was closed within half an hour of its opening.According to the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC), the counter was closed as all the allotted 500 doses were sold in 30 minutes.But the protesters, mainly relatives of patients, suspect that there were unfair practices in the sale of the drug and claimed that they had to take many pains to come here and wait during a lockdown to get the medicine.People from at least five other districts began camping outside the medical college gates on Avinashi Road in Peelamedu from 6am on Monday.When the gates opened by 9am, people queued up before the counter to buy the drug.“We gave preference to 63 people who had tokens that were issued to them on Sunday when the counter was closed,” a GH official said.“With each patient requiring six doses and being allowed to sell only 500 doses, we can give it to only 83 people a day,” he explained.“Thus, among new people in the queue we could only give it to 20 people,” he said.However, many people who had been waiting in queue for more than three-and-half hours got impatient and began protesting.“This sale of rremdesivir is an eye-wash. They are holding stocks and selling it to people they favour or come with a recommendation or selling it for a higher price,” accused an irate 46-year-old man, Sugumaran, from Tirupur who had come to buy the medicine for his hospitalized wife.To try averting a repeat of this situation, GH authorities have decided to give tokens only to 40 people a day.“The remaining 43 beneficiaries will be patients who need it on an emergency basis,” an official said.Though rremdesivir is being sold in Salem GH also, many people waiting in the queue were people from Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Erode.Meanwhile, rremdesivir shortage continued to haunt all Covid-19 treating hospitals. CMCH on Monday received 600 doses, which they say will last for only two days.“We can give 300 patients one dose each for two days, and we hope to get fresh stocks to give them the following four doses,” CMCH’s Covid-19 nodal officer in charge Dr Keerthivasan said.In PSG Hospitals, the availability of the anti-viral drug has marginally improved but not even close to meeting their required quantities.“While we could administer it to only 20% of the patients requiring it earlier, we can now administer it to a few more patients due to increased availability. However, it is not sufficient at all,” Covid-19 nodal officer of the hospital Dr A Murali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/people-waiting-to-buy-remdesivir-stage-protest/articleshow/82534535.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Sheer khurma, kurta-pyjama, sharara missing ahead of Eid||Nagpur: With just four days left for the holy month of Ramzan to conclude, festive mood, Eid shopping, and preparation for the traditional sheer khurma are conspicuous by their absence to a large extent in the community. Like any other home, many Muslim families have lost more than one member to Covid in the second wave which has led to a melancholic mood ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, which is likely to fall on May 14. Though last year the community had celebrated the annual festival in a symbolic manner at home, the traditional savories and shopping for kurta-pyjama and sharara etc were still on the menu. Many have already missed most of the rozas while taking care of a sick relative and only those unaffected by Covid and lockdown are in celebratory mood. Mohammad Ejaz Khan, senior accounts officer in a private firm, said this would be his family’s first Eid without both his parents. “We shall forever love and miss our ammi and abbu from the core of our hearts. We wish them Happy Eid in heaven. May Allah rest their souls in eternal peace. Aameen,” he said. Khan’s mother passed away during Ramzan while his father died early this year. Javed Alam Khan, who teaches Quran, said he would prod community members to seek forgiveness of Allah. “May our Lord protect all countrymen from Covid-19. Lot of families have lost some or other members in the second wave and there is widespread fear,” he said. Engineering professor Ahmed Sajjad Khan said as the pandemic has badly hit the world, strict stay-at-home orders, many near and dear ones suffering and a few passing away, there is no denying the festivities will be dull and gloomy this year. “Charity is one of the important pillars of Islam. This year, it will be good to help many in need. Charity and gratitude can surely bring out the true spirit of the festival,” said the HoD at Anjuman College of Engineering and Technology. Aejaz Shami, AGM, marketing and communication, Kingsway Hospitals, too said the preparation for Eid is not the same as seen until last year. “Many are in grief, many more are still in hospitals or recovering in home isolation. Though there are still many families thankfully unaffected by the pandemic, but the general mood is of fear and repentance. More than indulging in festivities, community members are working towards charitable causes, especially those hit by Covid and lockdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sheer-khurma-kurta-pyjama-sharara-missing-ahead-of-eid/articleshow/82534550.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

All the centres achieved the target of 55 shots at each centre. In addition, the regular vaccination of 45+ people also took place at the sites. The district administration had appointed sector magistrates with adequate police force at every centre in order to avoid mismanagement.  District magistrate Jhansi Andra Vamsi said that to make the vaccination drive successful the health professionals had been asked to report on duty on time and warned of strict action against if they deliberately remained absent from duties. He said 1,800 people of 18+ age took the shots in the district on Monday while 1,400 persons of 45+ were also vaccinated. The youth seemed quite determined to get themselves vaccinated to fight the menace. Aryan Srivastav (18), a first year engineering student told TOI that he was quite perturbed seeing massive spread of the virus. “I am really scared of the things going on these days and was waiting eagerly to get myself vaccinated”. “In the present circumstances vaccination is the only alternative to remain safe while observing Covid safety protocol at the same time”, said Navneet Sharma (22), a student of MSc (Agriculture) who had come for the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/1800-people-of-18-plus-1400-of-45-plus-take-vaccine-jab-on-the-opening-day-in-jhansi/articleshow/82534565.cms||---
---||Surat||Mango farmers in south Gujarat work from home this season||SURAT: Every year during April and May, Laxmi Patel, an organic farmer in Aat village of Navsari, would reach Surat with truckload of mangoes from her three orchards. However, this year the second wave of pandemic has not only made mobility difficult, but she is also afraid of risking getting infected in the city. After cases started to escalate in the first week of April, Patel was in serious dilemma — whether to risk it all and go in person to APMC market to sell the produce or sell in the local market. However, thanks to digitalization, the worries for Patel and hundreds of organic mango farmers from south Gujarat like her are over. Today, sitting at her own home, Patel has been able to sell 200 quintals of mangoes in just 15 days! Thanks to the Krushi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) of Navsari Agricultural University, farmers’ work-from-home dreams have been made possible. Every year KVK opens its facility for organic mango farmers to sell their produce, but owing to second wave of pandemic, the centre dropped the idea this year. But to help farmers avert losses, KVK helped them connect with thousands of buyers from their database. “Around 400 mango farmers are connected with us and thousands of people used to come to our centre every year to purchase the mangoes. So, this year too they called us. But now we are just passing on phone numbers of farmers to the buyers,” said Dr C K Timbadiya, senior scientist and head of KVK. Buyers then either go to the orchard directly after contacting the farmer or the farmer sends a truck full of mangoes. “If the order is small, then the buyer can go to the orchard and purchase, but if there is an order from an entire society or a big group, the farmer sends it in a truck,” Timbadiya told TOI. “This is helping immensely because I do not have to go anywhere and if people come at my farm too, I take all precautions. Even the cash that they give is kept outside open for a couple of days before bringing it inside the house,” said Patel, who is expecting to sell 250 more quintals of Alphonso, Kesar and Daseri mangoes. “If we go to sell in the APMC market, there are chances of contracting the virus besides paying commission to the market. The closing of the market has come as a blessing this time because I can sell my products without any fear or favour,” said Suresh Patel, a farmer from Vasan village of Gandevi taluka. According to Timbadiya, farmers are selling 100 to 125kg mangoes through this new initiative to buyers from Surat, Vadodara, Ahmedabad and even from Mumbai. “When the buyer too goes to the orchard, they will know more about the other crops that farmers grow which will help farmers to get market for other produces too,” he said. Buyers can contact KVK’s two scientists Dr Rashmikant Gurjar (9574545436) or Dr Sumit Salunkhe (9921398237) to get in touch with mango farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mango-farmers-in-s-guj-wfh-this-season/articleshow/82534586.cms||Jay Pachchigar

District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “In the initial phase, the 250-bed ICU wing of this 750-bed Covid facility set up by DRO has become functional from today. Patients admitted at SPG divisional hospital, DDU district hospital, LBS government hospital, ESIC, BLW hospital and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital, who needed ICU facilities, were referred to the facility. A list of such patients was finalized and then their shifting was started.” No patients will be directly admitted. All admissions will be done through the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) Varanasi under the district administration, said Sharma. The modalities for admitting patients in the two wings with 500 oxygenated beds likely to become operational in three-four days, will also be finalized by Army doctors on the basis of experience of running the ICU wing. The DM praised the Ministry of Defence, DRDO and Army Medical Corps for setting up the temporary facility to tackle shortage of beds and health care. The Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) specialists, doctors, nursing and other medical staff from across the country started treating the patients. The medical staff has been trained in Covid protocols and all equipment checked, said officials. All the beds in the hospital have oxygen support and we have 40 KL oxygen stored in three tanks, they added. The state government has ensured supply of all essentials, including oxygen, dedicated power and water supply besides bio-medical and other waste management. Medicines and food will be provided free of charge to all patients and phones have been arranged to ensure interaction of patients with their attendants, the DM said. The facility for stay of patients’ attendants is already available in BHU besides food free of cost. After the second wave of Covid-19 started wreaking havoc, the Ministry of Defence came forward and is setting up temporary hospitals across the country and is manning their operations. After Delhi, Ahmedabad and Lucknow, the DRDO’s Covid facility has become functional in Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/icu-wing-of-drdos-covid-hospital-becomes-functional/articleshow/82534614.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Covid cases have come downby 85,000 in last 10 days: CM||GORAKHPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday in Gorakhpur aggressive trace, test and treatment strategy has brought active Covid cases down by 85000 in the state in the last 10 days. “There were 3.1 lakh active cases in the state on April 30, but they have reduced to 2.25 lakh today which shows a decrease of 85,000 cases. We successfully tackled the first wave in Uttar Pradesh and will do it again in the second wave. Vaccination is the biggest weapon and our government is providing free vaccine without any discrimination,” the CM said. “During first wave, medical oxygen was sufficient, but the demand increased manifold in the second wave. Under the guidance of PM Modi, for the first time ever in the country, oxygen was supplied by Oxygen Express trains and Air Force planes,” Yogi added. The CM inspected vaccination centres and Gorakhpur AIIMS and took feedback on the construction of 200-bed Covid hospital with the help of Boeing company. He also held a Covid control review meeting with officials of Gorakhpur Basti division at BRD medical college and gave instructions to increase RRTs and ensure oxygen audit. “It is necessary to audit oxygen use in hospitals and ensure there is no wastage of oxygen. There should be no black marketing of oxygen and stern action should be taken against black marketeers,” he told officials. The government is providing medicine kits to be distributed by RRTs in all the districts and distribution should be verified. About 75% of 108 ambulance service vehicles should be earmarked for Covid patients. No carelessness in Covid-19 management will be tolerated. People with symptoms should come for a test and there is no need to hide the disease as treatment is necessary, he added. “Life is priceless and needs to be saved at all costs. If we work with team spirit, we will definitely get success,” said Yogi. The rates of private hospitals, ambulances should be fixed and strict action should be taken against overcharging and profiteering,” he said. The CM asked officials to ensure CCTV cameras at all Covid hospitals besides reviewing active cases and recovery in the district every day. He directed them to give a list of home isolation patients and their phone numbers to MPs and MLAs so that they can communicate with them. Appoint at least one nodal officer for supervision of food grain distribution, sanitization and fogging, the CM told officials. He stressed on increasing the number of beds and asked officials to constitute district level committees for supervising availability of oxygen, remdesivir injection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/covid-cases-have-come-downby-85000-in-last-10-days-cm/articleshow/82534661.cms||---

The accused used to supply raw milk to the sweet shop.According to case details, on April 23, Lala Amra asked Mafatlal to lend him some money. But Mafatlal refused saying that he did not have money due to Covid-19 induced crisis. A few days later on May 3, Lala Amra called up Mafatlal and again demanded money. He threatened to kidnap Mafatlal’s family member if he did not pay him Rs 10 lakh as protection money or pay down payment for his new car.However, Mafatlal did not take the threat seriously. On The same afternoon, Lala Amra and his two sons came to Dave Mithaiwala’s Vijayraj Nagar branch and abused the employees there. They abducted Jitubhai in a car mistaking him to be a family member of the Mafatlal family. When the accused realised they had goofed up, they thrashed Jitubhai in the car and left him near Shastri Nagar. Jitubhai later told about the incident to Mafatlal. He was so scared that he was reluctant to lodged a complaint. But after much persuasion, he filed an FIR on Sunday night with Bhavnagar's Nilambaug police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/46-yr-old-abducted-beaten-abandoned/articleshow/82534694.cms||---

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) started fetching water from the dam some 40km away in January. Various technical checks were underway since then for four months which included the pipeline network, velocity and pressure of water and the quality of water. These checks are now over and water supply has reached Vadgaonsheri. “We started with 50 MLD water supply which has now been increased up to 165 MLD in a phased manner since our teams were also checking the functioning of the network. It has been tedious to clean the water pipelines to ensure good quality water at adequate pressure,” Sudesh Kadu, executive engineer at PMC’s water supply department, said. The civic administration suspended supply from Bhama Askhed pipeline project in March after citizens from Nagar Road areas complained of muddy water coming through the taps. Officials from the administration said the issue has now been resolved and they have again started distribution of water. “All the water from the Bhama Askhed dam is being treated at the purification plant and citizens need not worry about the quality of now. The water was turbid for a few days because the pipelines were laid more than a couple of years ago in some areas which needed to be cleaned. We are now almost done with the work and water has been flushed out during the course of cleaning of the pipelines and water tanks,” the official added. The 200 MLD project will meet the water supply needs of some part of the population of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad till 2041. The project was started in 2013 but took long to complete over several protests over the pipeline. Farmers had stood in water as a mark of protest seeking adequate compensation. The project was inaugurated early this year after several rounds of trials .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhama-askhed-work-over-citizens-to-get-clean-water/articleshow/82534696.cms||Sarang Dastane

It will be replaced in the second phase with cement slabs. The stage-II work is expected to be completed by month-end. The girder has been installed so that we get working space for final work,” said engineering department officials.According to officials, the earlier girder was damaged when a trailer hit the overhead railway bridge in December last. The traffic on this stretch is closed for over six months and is being diverted from Mangalwari flyover towards Sadar.However, officials said, “Even if railway work is completed, the road will remain closed for traffic for an indefinite period as MahaMetro has also started work on a double-decker multi-layer transport system between SFS Cathedral and Automotive Square. The Central Railway has already granted permission to start work in their area.”They added that 80 tonne pre-cast slab is to be laid at Gaddigodam for replacing the girders of the railway bridge. The work is running behind schedule owing to lack of workforce due to Covid-19 restrictions, they said.Once completed, the RUB will provide much-needed relief to passers-by who were a tormented lot whenever trains stopped over the bridge. Passers-by complained about toilet water dripping down the gaps in the RUB whenever the trains stopped. The RUB was constructed during the British era and the railway continued its use with minor repairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crly-installs-steel-girder-to-start-restructure-of-kamptee-road-rub/articleshow/82534697.cms||---

A 25-year-old woman Nidhi Thakar turned out to be the person who had been harassing the Vadodara-based female complainant online since February this year. According to the police, Thakar, a law student made fake social media profiles of the complainant and passed indecent comments on the latter. “The accused made several accounts of the complainant and also posted her family photos. She used to post indecent comments on the complainant,” said Hardik Makadia, ACP (cybercrime). “We tracked the IP address of the social media accounts and found that they were made from the mobile phone of the accused. When our team reached her home, we learnt that she was under quarantine due to Covid. Thakar was arrested after she recovered,” Makadia told TOI. When asked about the reason behind Thakar’s acts, Makadia said, “It must be a case of personal rivalry. Thakar’s sister and the complainant’s sister are both married in the same family. The complainant was to be engaged to the third brother and Thakar didn’t want it to happen. So, she tried to spoil the complainant’s image,” Makadia added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/female-law-student-held-for-doxing/articleshow/82534706.cms||---
---||Pune||Companies make employee health first priority||Pune: From asking employees to update their health status, to collecting donations to create a fund for those in need of financial assistance to pay medical bills due to Covid, various companies are trying to ensure that the health of employees remains their first priority. “My manager is mandated to make sure that everyone on his team above the age of 45 is vaccinated. Those above 18 years will have to register from May 1 as well. The company has announced a reimbursement, if an employee gets the vaccine from a private hospital,” said Sunil Joshi, who works for an investment bank. Employers are also taking an interest in the status of their employees’ mental health by arranging sessions hosted by professionals and motivational speakers to help them get through this difficult time. “We have two mental health professionals on board to help our employees if needed. When everyone is coming to work, they talk about their personal lives and share their problems with colleagues. Since we are working from home, it is difficult for them to share their distress with anyone else. It is an even more difficult time with the uncertainty about job security, health, education for those who are already suffering from depression and anxiety,” said Joshua O’Brien, HR executive at a multi-national company. At some firms, higher level management believes in making face-to-face contact, even if it is through video calls, with their employees to check on their health. “I manage a team of 20 freshers, who become part of different teams every few months. One guy, who was a good worker with no complaints in my team six months ago, was missing work, logging in late and troubling his new team leader. When I checked in with him, I found that he has been physically ill and could not get help to go to the doctor as he lives alone in the city. A few other colleagues got together and helped him get the medical attention he needed. Since then, we have made it a point to get on video calls with our employees to see if they are okay,” said Satyabrata Das, project manager at a business consulting and outsourcing services company. Other companies have foregone the personal touch and asked their employees to update their health status online on a daily basis. “All employees must get vaccinated. To keep a check on this, everyone is required to update our company’s internal portal whether they have taken the vaccine, registered for it, and if they have any Covid-like symptoms every day. If an employee requires hospitalisation, we have a team that reaches out to their family and helps in whatever way they can,” said Nitesh Agarwal, HR executive at an IT company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/companies-make-employee-health-first-priority/articleshow/82534709.cms||---

Autorickshaw drivers said they were still awaiting the link to apply for the government grant of Rs 1,500. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakane told TOI that MahaIT Corp had been assigned the task to create the link. “There is no need to know computers as the state government is involving the autorickshaw unions and the citizen facilitation centres for this purpose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-drivers-to-face-stern-action-for-overcharging/articleshow/82534716.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Portion of mother’s liver saves infant’s life||Pune: An eight-month-old baby boy, weighing 6kg, successfully underwent a living donor liver transplant at a city hospital on April 2, making him the second-youngest patient in the city to undergo the procedure. The child was suffering from a rare genetic disorder ‘Alagille syndrome’ which turned worse with time, progressing to end-stage liver disease. Alagille syndrome is an inherited condition in which bile builds up in the liver as there are few bile ducts to drain the bile. This results in liver damage. A seven-month-old baby boy, weighing 5.8kg, had undergone the same procedure at Jupiter hospital in Pune in May last year. “When the infant’s parents first brought him to the hospital a few months ago, the baby had jaundice. His health continued to deteriorate with progressively increasing jaundice and end-stage liver disease,” Sahyadri hospital’s liver transplant surgeon Bipin Vibhute said. With infection in his blood, the bilirubin had increased to 63mg/dl, and the baby had started to lose weight. Alagille Syndrome was confirmed on the basis of the liver biopsy and genetic test reports. Vibhute said. “We had to go in for an urgent transplant. Luckily his mother was identified as an ideal donor,” Vibhute said. Performing the transplant surgery on such a small baby was not an easy task. “The transplant was challenging as the child was fragile and weak,” the hospital’s paediatric hepatologist Snehavardhan Pandey said. The surgery took 10 hours. “The infant showed continued improvement after the transplant, after going through minor complications. We discharged the child after 20 days of surgery. He is doing well now,” Pandey said. “Alagille syndrome is a multi-organ disorder. This child had a life-threatening liver disease, which has been cured by the transplant. But, the involvement of other organs such as heart, kidneys would require further treatment,” Vibhute said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/portion-of-mothers-liver-saves-infants-life/articleshow/82534757.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Ahmedabad||Mevani’s fundraiser faces account freeze||Ahmedabad: After Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani issued a public appeal to fund Covid-19 facilities in his constituency, the charity commissioner has ordered the freezing of the bank account of the NGO under whose name Mevani is collecting funds. The charity commissioner has issued a show-cause notice to ‘We The People Charitable Trust’. The charity commissioner has asked it to explain why action may not be taken because it got itself registered under this name, when a trust had already existed under the name of ‘We The People Charitable Society’. The authority said that similar names cause confusion among people and this issue has been dealt with in the Emblems & Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950. In a statement, charity commissioner Y M Shukla said that as soon as the Vadgam MLA made a public appeal, the charity commissioner’s office began receiving applications. The MLA had sought funds for an oxygen plant and oxygen concentrators in the name of the trust by giving the details of the organization. Upon inquiry, it was found that Mevani is not a trustee of this organization. On May 3, an inquiry was sent to the trust about the resolution passed or the collector’s permission authorizing Mevani to make a public appeal for fund collection, but no reply has been received. The charity commissioner further stated that taking the issue seriously, it was ordered that the bank account be frozen. All documents, receipt books, and resolutions passed have been sought from the trust and an inspector has been ordered to inquire into them and report. The charity commissioner also said that there have been many instances of people illegally dealing in essentials like remdesivir injections and oxygen cylinders. These incidents have hurt public sentiments in this Covid-19 situation, the charity commissioner said. The commissioner also appealed to the people at large to report immediately if anybody is found making such mischief. Mevani said that the administration is acting because the fund collection campaign is getting unprecedented public response. He further said, “The trustees have not yet received any notice and without granting an opportunity of hearing, the bank account was sought to be frozen.” He added: “There is something fundamentally wrong with the intentions of the authority. The trustees are being targeted because they are helping me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mevanis-fundraiser-faces-account-freeze/articleshow/82534760.cms||---

Even TOI received many messages from aggrieved students who highlighted their plight, especially those who reside outside the city. NU vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari and Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable have already instructed colleges to not call students to the campus for any purpose. TOI forwarded the complaints to the VC, who in turn, referred them to the officials of the exam section. “I told our officials to call all the principals and remind them about our directives. Principals should understand that there’s a risk to the lives of students if they come to the college campus. It’s high time they switched over to technology to remain safe during the pandemic,” Chaudhari told TOI, adding, “We would soon reissue a detailed notification.” Social activist Shashank Gattewar, who also received a slew of complaints from distressed students, slammed the NU authorities and colleges for risking their lives. “This is unbelievable. Just for the sake of fees, colleges are calling students to the campus in such precarious conditions where the virus is spreading like wildfire. This shows the institutions in poor light. For them, money is more important than the lives of students. NU must act against such erring colleges,” said Gattewar. During a recent meeting with the Principals’ Forum members, the VC and BOEE director had reiterated the use of technology for filling up exam forms and also for receiving fees online. They were told to use online platforms like Bhim App for receiving fees. They were even asked to recover the fees later, if students, especially those from rural areas, weren’t able to pay online. Students pointed out that they are unable to commute due to strict Covid restrictions. They even said that their parents were apprehensive to send them to college. Many students hail from different states and cities and it would be very difficult for them to travel from their respective places. “Many NU employees too have been infected by the deadly virus,” they said. PROBLEMS GALORE * Colleges asking students to fill up exam forms by visiting counters * Outstation students can’t come due to transportation problems * Even local students find it hard to visit colleges due to restrictions * Many college employees have contracted Covid-19 * While many students are positive, some are hospitalised * Parents apprehensive of sending their wards to colleges||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-nu-colleges-are-still-calling-students-to-campus-despite-covid/articleshow/82534762.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In their letter, the senior citizens said it has been 34 months since Lavasa approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), but there is no final decision or resolution on who can take over the project. “Why is the state government not taking interest in this project?” asked Suresh Goswami, who approached the CM on behalf of the Lavasa residents. He had earlier approached the Prime Minister and even Housing affairs ministry. After a complaint was filed under the central public grievance portal, the Centre had directed the state government to look into the issue. However, no action has been taken since then, Goswami said. In the letter, the residents said the project value has been reduced many fold, yet there is no investor and no intervention from the state government. “Lavasa residents are struggling with incomplete buildings and overall upkeep of the area,” Goswami said. The residents have also approached the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority as well as Economic Offences Wing regarding the project. “There is no single defined authority where a senior citizen in trouble can approach or communicate,” Goswami rued. In the letter to MahaRERA, the residents stated that Lavasa Corporation registered all the incomplete projects in Dasve, but did not register almost 800 incomplete properties in Mugaon. “These projects are over 10-11 years old, exceed Rs 500 crore in investment and do not include any interest and compensation as per the RERA Act,” stated the residents’ letter to MahaRERA. “We have been requesting the Lavasa Corporation Limited and the Resolution Professional to get the mandatory permissions, registration and licences as a majority of the buildings are 80-90% complete in Dasve. He said that they collectively within the Lavasa citizens desired to complete the buildings on their own but these requests have not been considered at all. The president of Apex Association of Lavasa Residents and other committee members have also tried to address the issue of Non-Possession holders but so far there is no hope at al”he said. The copy of the complaint filed to EOW has been forwarded to the Chief Minister too, he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-citizens-of-lavasa-hill-station-reach-out-to-cm-to-revive-the-project/articleshow/82534766.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Citizens rue separate bills for oxygen by health hubs||Pune: Citizens have raised complaints of being charged separately for oxygen in their final bills despite the fixed hospital bed rates, which includes amounts for use of the life saving gas. The district administration has pledged action would be taken against hospitals charging for oxygen separately in violation of the state government’s direction. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI that he would ensure that necessary checks and action against any violation of the state government’s orderIn May 2020, the state government had issued an order to cap charges on beds reserved for Covid-19 beds in private hospitals. The order was subsequently extended.Many citizens have, however, complained to the administration about hospitals preparing separate billing for oxygen use. A citizen, who was admitted to a private hospital recently, said he was charged separately for oxygen beds and oxygen. “I was charged Rs 32,000 for eight days as Rs 4,000 for a day. I had to sell two of my bikes to pay the bill,” he told TOIActivist Abhijit More said there were several such instances. “Not just for oxygen, but most of the bill components are in total violation of the government notification,” he said. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Pune chapter, said while it was agreeable that no hospital should violate the government notification, there was also the other side whereby the existing rates of oxygen levied on hospitals “is way too high”.He said, “All hospitals should strictly follow the state government’s notification. We as an association have repeatedly approached the government to make the changes in the charges. The rates were issued last year. A jumbo cylinder would cost us Rs180 in 2020. Now it costs Rs1500-Rs2,000. Unless the government puts a cap on oxygen prices, the rates mentioned in the are not viable for smaller hospitals.” Dr Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, said, “All hospitals should follow the state’s notification and refrain from charging separately for oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-rue-separate-bills-for-oxygen-by-health-hubs/articleshow/82534791.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||No interim relief in O2 concentrator case, lookout notice against Kalra||New Delhi: A court on Monday refused to grant any interim stay on coercive action against businessman Navneet Kalra in connection with an FIR over the seizure of over 500 oxygen concentrators from his restaurants. Kalra has filed an anticipatory bail application through advocates Vineet Malhotra and Harsh Sethi. The hearing took place before special judge Sumit Dass, who posted the matter on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Delhi Police is learnt to have issued a lookout notice against the absconding restaureatur. During the hearing, public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, who appeared on behalf of Delhi Police, informed the court that the investigation had been taken over by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch. He indicated that the case might be heard by some other court dealing with matters concerning the Crime Branch in the light of jurisdiction. Public prosecutor Wasi Ur Rahman said, “Strongly oppose (bail plea) for any relief.” Malhotra, Kalra’s lawyer, questioned invoking of the provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 during the brief hearing that lasted for about 15 minutes. “They’re hounding me. Let them file a reply. Have it tomorrow,” he submitted. According to the lawyer, oxygen concentrators have not been notified as essential commodities; hence, Essential Commodities Act could not have been invoked. His plea further stated, “All imports have been made through legal banking channels and there is not even a single oxygen concentrator, which has been clandestinely or illegally imported. All imports are legally documented and all sales were taking place legally after payment of GST and other applicable taxes.” It claimed, “There has been no black marketing of any article. The government or any other authority has not fixed any price and, therefore, there is no question of black marketing.” Kalra has been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (order duly promulgated by a public servant), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 7 that relate to supply and distribution under Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The matter was adjourned after the court directed police to file a reply on the Kalra’s anticipatory bail plea. “Simple adjournment… No stay,” the court said. Kalra owns Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants in Khan Market and Lodhi Colony. Apart from seizing the life-saving machines from these places, the cops had also recovered many concentrators from a farmhouse in south Delhi. Soon after police raided his premises last week, Kalra went underground with his family. A senior police officer said there were apprehension that Kalra might try to flee the country after which the lookout notice was issued. The raids are still on to arrest him, he added. Through an LOC, the cops alert all immigration and sea ports to detain an individual if he tries to leave the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-interim-relief-in-o2-concentrator-case-lookout-notice-against-kalra/articleshow/82534770.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Cure facilities in villages still grapple with availability||Pune: Small and medium-sized hospitals continue to face oxygen shortage in the district’s rural areas though the crunch has almost smoothened in city areas after almost a month of crisis. A sizeable number of private Covid hospitals, which are dependent on the daily supply of oxygen cylinders, have still not started admitting new patients needing high oxygen support owing to uncertainty over the supply of cylinders. This, in turn, is adding to the burden on Covid hospitals in the city areas. The sistrict administration has said oxygen tankers were being sourced from cities such as Jamnagar in Gujarat and other places. Physician Bhaskar Atram of 50-bed Chintamani hospital in Saswad said, “We need 50 jumbo cylinders daily, but we are getting 30 cylinders now. As a precautionary measure, we are still not admitting new patients needing high oxygen support.” The hospital has seven ICU beds and 31 oxygen-supported beds. “Quite a few oxygen beds at the hospital are vacant for want of an uninterrupted supply of the gas.” Physician Siddharth Kulkarni of Yogeshwari hospital in Daund, “We are still not admitting new patients requiring high oxygen support in the ICU. We need 50 jumbo cylinders, but are getting 40 a day.” Hospitals in Lonand, which geographically is in Satara district but shares a border and caters to patients from Baramati, Purandar and Bhor talukas, have expressed some relief in terms of oxygen supply “The public representative and district collector made an old oxygen generation plant functional in Lonand. The plant has the capacity of refilling 1,500 jumbo cylinders daily,” said physician Nitin Sawant, who runs the 50-bed Siddhivinay Hospital — a 55-bed Covid facility in Lonand. Moreover, the district administration has for the first time conducted an oxygen audit on a large scale. “This exercise has also helped us reduce oxygen wastage and improve the situation,” he said. Collector Rajesh Deshmukh said oxygen tankers were coming from cities such as Jamnagar in Gujarat and other places. “We will need some more days to get an uninterrupted supply of oxygen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cure-facilities-in-villages-still-grapple-with-availability/articleshow/82534803.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Experts suspect that the same tiger might have been involved in killing both the women as the incidents have taken place just 3km apart in two hours. In the first incident, Kalpana Chaudhari (37) from Mahadwadi village was killed in the forest while she was out to collect tendu leaves along with other villagers in the morning. A tiger moving in the area suddenly attacked and killed her in compartment no. 566. The tiger fled hearing cries of other women. In the other incident, Sindhubai Mungahate (57) from village Kuradi, just 3km from Mahadwadi, was killed in a tiger attack in compartment no. 54 of the same forest range. Mungahate too was out in the jungle to pluck tendu leaves. Honourary wildlife warden of Gadchiroli Milind Umre said the incidents were accidental in both the cases as the tiger did not take away the kills. RFO of Porla range Changle claimed that there is a tigress with grown-up cubs in the area. It is likely that the cubs made the kills. He claimed that the attacking tigers were scared away by fellow tendu collectors. He added that ex-gratia aid of Rs10,000 each was given to kin of the victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-women-killed-in-separate-tiger-attacks/articleshow/82534804.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Goa||Indian football loses one of its finest in midfield||Panaji: Nobody could tell the story of Indian football’s greatest triumph better than Fortunato Franco. The former midfielder was a member of the squad that attained immortality in Indian football, winning the 1962 Asian Games gold in Jakarta. He told the triumphant story with amazing clarity and authority, remembering every detail, including the daring long walk from the stadium to the Games Village with a gold medal around his neck. Jakarta was cold to India. The 1,10,000 capacity crowd at the stadium cheered South Korea vociferously, but Franco didn’t care while walking through them after the 2-1 victory. “It was Indian football’s most glorious moment. How could I ever forget what happened? We were, after all, the Kings of Asian football,” the 1960 Rome Olympian once told TOI. Franco will no longer tell such stories from Indian football’s glorious past, notably the sixties. The former midfield marshal died of Covid-19 complications early on Monday at a hospital in south Goa. He was 84 and is survived by his wife, son and daughter. “Franco died this morning,” his wife Myrtle told TOI in an early-morning call. “He had Covid-19 but was out of the ICU and had also tested negative. Things went bad (again) two days ago. He had a heart attack.” Born in Colvale in north Goa, Franco and his family soon migrated to Bombay (now Mumbai) where he realised his childhood dream of donning colours for the all-powerful Tata Sports Club, after a brief stint with Western Railway. Franco grew up to become one of the finest midfielders India has seen. At the 1960 Olympics in Rome, a year after he made his international debut against Pakistan, he never got a chance to take the field, falling behind the likes of Kempaiah and Ram Bahadur, two of coach SA Rahim’s undroppables. But he couldn’t be left out for long. Franco worked hard and soon won Rahim’s confidence. Whether it was Ram Bahadur or Prasanta Sinha besides him at the Asiad in 1962, the midfielder hardly put a foot wrong, even creating the goal for Jarnail Singh to score in the historic final. Between 1960 and 1966, Franco was an automatic choice for the national team, winning gold at the Asiad and silver at the Asian Cup. He also won the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy with Maharashtra in 1963-64. Franco believed he was a prime candidate to captain India at the 1966 Asiad but a knee injury in a domestic league game the same year forced him into early retirement. He later took to coaching but didn’t have the same success. “Sir Franco was my coach when I played for Tata SC in 1984. We always took great pride that we had an Olympian amongst us and that too, a Goan,” said former India midfielder Lector Mascarenhas. Once Franco retired from his job as senior manager (public relations) with Tatas, he returned to Goa and settled for a quiet plot in Colva. Franco was among the few footballers from the golden era who never received any honour from the central government. For the past three years, he applied for the Dhyan Chand lifetime achievement award, without success. “The decision left me with a broken heart,” he told TOI after the first snub. “I’ve given my life for football and anyone who saw me play will testify to what I did on the field. If merit is the sole criteria to choose the winner, what have I not achieved?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indian-football-loses-one-of-its-finest-in-midfield/articleshow/82534869.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said on Monday, “DRDO’s temporary facility, Pandit Rajan Mishra Covid Hospital has been set up three months and can be extended for six months.” Sharma said, “The German hangar tent and auxiliary items used for installing the structure of the temporary hospital have been taken on rent while equipment, beds and all necessary medical items have been purchased by the state government. So, we will be fully prepared to tackle the predicted third wave if it does hit. We will be vigilant and depending on the trends, analysis and guidance from the Central and state governments will estimate whether paying rent for long or purchasing it would be viable.” The officials of district administration and health department are thinking of a long term plan to be prepared in case the third wave hits. Sharma said, “Even after beginning of the DRDO’s facility, we are augmenting the capacity of super specialty hospital and Trauma Centre at BHU, which is Level-3 facility since the beginning of the pandemic and have been treating critical patients of Varanasi and surrounding districts of east UP region.” He said the possibility of continuing the temporary hospital set up on the amphitheater ground of BHU will be mulled after holding discussions with university authorities and government. BHU will also provide its specialist doctors at DRDO’s Covid hospital to handle patients requiring treatment for other complications and ailments of heart, kidney and others. Once the critical patients are treated at DRDO’s Covid hospital and are cured of Covid, they will be shifted to wards of the department concerned of BHU hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/drdos-temp-hosp-set-up-for3-months-to-continue-if-needed/articleshow/82534875.cms||---
---||Delhi||Firm seeks release of ‘legally procured’ O2 machines||New Delhi: Matrix Cellular Services on Monday sought directives from Delhi High Court for immediate release of oxygen concentrators seized by Delhi Police from its collection centre in Lodhi Colony and its office premises in Mehrauli. The company submitted before Justice Yogesh Khanna that there was no basis for the “arbitrary, irresponsible and highly capricious” conduct on part of police in seizing essential commodities such as oxygen concentrators when people in Delhi were in dire need of the same. Appearing for the firm, senior advocate Mohit Mathur argued that the company had imported the machines legitimately and had all the documentation in place. He pointed out that till May 5, there was no order to regulate pricing of the concentrators, adding that the seizure was “baseless in law” and was “entirely without merit” since the FIR failed to disclose any offence. The company said it was engaged in the business of providing telecommunication services for persons travelling abroad. However, on account of the pandemic, it started procurement and distribution of novel coronavirus-related products. It said that on account of the catastrophic impact of pandemic on India’s health infrastructure and the acute shortage of oxygen in the country and, more specifically, in Delhi, the petitioner started importing and acquiring oxygen concentrators and allied equipment from suppliers and selling them to customers through an online portal. The plea said that due to the increase in the number of Covid patients, several customers started arriving at the offices of the firm to buy oxygen concentrators. “This resulted in significant overcrowding at the petitioner’s offices and not only did this created significant problems in the functioning and operations of the petitioner but also posed a serious health risk for the petitioner’s employees and also the gathered crowd.” Customers often arrived even in ambulances to collect oxygen concentrators, the plea added. “Covid-positive patients were also arriving on the office premises to procure oxygen concentrators,” it claimed. On its part, police said no one could sell the machines above the MRP and said its Crime Branch would now investigate the case. The high court deferred the matter to Thursday after hearing the submissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/firm-seeks-release-of-legally-procured-o2-machines/articleshow/82534882.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune private hospitals start placing requests for doses with vaccine manufacturers||PUNE: A few private hospitals in the city have now started the process to directly procure Covid vaccine doses from manufacturers. Ruby Hall Clinic said it has sent a request to Serum Institute for 2 lakh Covishield doses. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said it has sent requests to SII and Bharat Biotech for 10,000 doses of Covishield and Covaxin. Dr Purvez Grant, managing trustee and chief cardiologist at Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We have been told by SII that part of the requested batch could land by the third week of May. To start with, SII may give us 50,000 doses.” Dr Manjusha Kulkarni, manager (legal) at Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “There will be a formal agreement between us and SII for sale of doses.” But Dr Kulkarni, also the secretary of the Association of Hospitals (Pune), said much of the logistics involved in purchase and distribution of vaccines by private hospitals “is still unclear”. “No private hospital in Pune city has been able to restart its Covid vaccination drive due to the absence of clear guidelines and shortage of doses,” she said. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said the unit has requested 10,000 doses each from SII and Bharat Biotech.“Estimates from the firms indicate the doses could come to private hospitals after the third week of May,” he said. Abrarali Dalal, the COO of Sahyadri Hospitals said, “We have placed requests for Covishield and Covaxin. We’re awaiting word from the manufacturers on quantity and timeline.” In Mumbai, some private hospitals have already started their vaccination drives. In Pune, facilities said they are awaiting guidelines on procurement and pricing. “We are also considering how many doses we are to buy early on. Since the per dose cost is now higher than the earlier Rs 250, our request for stock depends on how much demand there will be for the shots with the new prices,” said Dr Madhur Rao, deputy medical administrator at KEM Hospital. State immunization officer Dr DN Patil said, “Guidelines are clear. Private hospitals have to procure doses directly from SII and Bharat Biotech. Once they procure the doses, they’ll have to inform the relevant civic authority so that a hospital can be integrated with the CoWIN system. The hospitals will then be issued usernames and passwords.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-hospitals-start-placing-requests-for-doses-with-vax-manufacturers/articleshow/82534880.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||Goa loses its treasure as 1960 Olympian Franco dies||PANAJI: Goa has produced several top-notch footballers, but Fortunato Franco will forever hold a pride of place. He remains the only Goan at the Olympics, the biggest sporting spectacle on earth. Franco was a member of the Indian football team that took part in the 1960 Olympics in Rome. He didn’t get a game, as coach SA Rahim preferred to start with established midfielders like Kempaiah and Ram Bahadur. But two years later when the Asian Games kicked off in Jakarta, Franco had turned himself into India’s best midfielder. Whether it was partnering Ram Bahadur or Prasanta Sinha, he hardly put a foot wrong and created the goal for Jarnail Singh to score in the historic final triumph against South Korea. Goa lost this treasure early on Monday. “Franco died this morning,” his wife Myrtle told TOI in an early-morning call. “He had Covid-19 but was out of the ICU and had also tested negative. Things went bad (again) two days ago. He had a heart attack.” Franco was rushed to a hospital in Margao on April 29 after he, and his family, tested positive for Covid-19. While his wife and son were recovering at home in Colva, the former India star was fighting for his life. He won the battle, temporarily, as he was moved out of the ICU. But Covid complications meant he soon breathed his last. He was 84 and is survived by his wife, son and daughter. Born in Colvale in north Goa, Franco migrated to Bombay, now Mumbai, along with his family as a six-year-old. He was always passionate about football and worked his way up the ladder, winning a gold at the Asiad and silver at the Asian Cup. Making his senior debut with Western Railway, Franco was soon offered a contract by the powerful Tata Sports Club, something he gladly accepted. It was a “dream come true” and he remained with the club till the end of his career. Franco never represented Goa at the national championships. In fact, when Goa made its debut at the Santosh Trophy in 1963-64, Franco was donning colours for champions Maharashtra. The only time Franco played in Goa was for Salgaocar Sports Club, immediately after the 1960 Rome Olympics. “The trip, my first to Goa, happened entirely by chance,” Franco was quoted as saying in the club’s publication. “My good friend, John Charles from Caltex, asked me to accompany him to Goa. John was invited by Salgaocar for a local tournament and since I had just returned from the Olympics, they wanted him to drag me along too.” Franco helped Salgaocar win Taca de Ouro (Gold Cup) with a 2-0 win over Academica. The Olympian was among the goal scorers in the final. Salgaocar then made an offer — a position as laboratory assistant — to hold him back. But Franco’s loyalty to his employers (Tatas) was cast in stone. Franco’s football career was cut short by a knee injury in 1966. He continued to be employed by Tatas and retired only in 1999 as senior manager (public relations). Once he retired, Franco decided to pack his bags for home. He found a “nice little plot” in Colva where he built his house and lived happily with his wife and son. Surprisingly, Franco never won any award either from the central government or Maharashtra, where he spent 60 years of his life. When he moved to Goa, he was felicitated by the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG) with a cash purse of Rs 5 lakh, a recognition from his home state that he cherished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-loses-its-treasure-as-1960-olympian-franco-dies/articleshow/82534221.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Inoculation was badly affected on Monday and situation will not improve on Tuesday for want of doses.As against average coverage of 13,000 per day, 2,669 took the jab in the city on Monday. Only 27 of total 98 centres were open due to shortage of doses.Vaccination of 45-plus was severely affected. Of the 89 centres assigned for this age group, only 21 could continue inoculation on Monday. All three centres of Covaxin for 45-plus were closed.NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said there would be no vaccination of 45-plus in the city on Tuesday.Inoculation of 18-44 years age group continued at six out of nine centres. Three centres were shut due to non-availability of doses.The state government allocated fresh stock of Covishield and Covaxin on Monday. It is likely to reach the city on Tuesday afternoon. Vaccination will resume on Wednesday.Due to shortage of vaccine, the centre had directed the civic bodies to give preference to second dose. The decision was taken as many 60-plus and 45-plus persons with comorbidities, who are the most vulnerable to novel coronavirus, were due for second dose. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar had issued a circular to all centres in this regard on May 8.On May 9, 6,464 persons from 45-plus took second dose and 3,797 took the first dose. On Monday too, when limited doses were available, 437 took the first dose and 947 had second dose.NMC officials told TOI, “Centres are not following our directive about second dose thoroughly due to huge rush whenever doses are available. Also, corporators demanding same preference be given to first and second dose, they said.According to ruling party leader, Avinash Thakre, people are turning up at the centres in large numbers. “So it is going to be difficult to segregate first and second dose beneficiaries. We are planning separate counters at all centres. There will be one counter for second dose, one for first dose with online appointment and another for walk-ins of first dose. To ensure no crowding and physical distancing, centres are also distributing tokens to walk-ins,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-vax-shortage-no-priority-given-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/82534890.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Representatives of Timber Merchants Association sought permission for the movement of raw material and packaging material. Plastic Industries’ Association said that factories should not be shut down forcefully as reports of such occurrences had surfaced in the Bapunagar area of the city. Naroda Industries Association had also wanted permission for 24x7 movement in the industrial area, especially for transport vehicles. Similar demands were made by Kathwada Industries’ Association. It also sought the validity of driving licences that have expired or whose expiry is due to be extended for six more months.Panchjuva Cloth Merchants Association, Edible Oil Merchants’ Association, and Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA) have sought permission to open shops for a couple of hours for administrative work.

A representation regarding this was made by the Gujarat unit of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) before chief minister Vijay Rupani. The state government had imposed restrictions in 29 cities closing all commercial complexes and shops in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19 from April 28. Traders say that the curent lockdown-like situation means they are unable to meet operating costs such as rentals, electricity bills, staff salaries and others without any revenue.“A number of small traders are suppliers to industries and construction sites but with their shops getting shut, manufacturing and construction is being hampered,” states the representation..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/trade-body-reps-seek-exemptions-amid-curbs-meet-police-chief/articleshow/82534912.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Eatala keen on new party, interacts with BCs leaders||Hyderabad: Ousted minister Eatala Rajender is believed to be keen on floating a new party instead of joining other parties. Eatala, who belongs to one of the strong castes (Mudiraj) in Backward Classes, strongly believes that there is a room for a new party of BCs as all existing major parties have failed to protect the interests of BC communities in the state, which constitute 52 per cent of total population. Sources close to the Huzurabad MLA said he wants to highlight ‘atma gouravam’ (self-respect) of BCs in the state. Gearing up to launch a new party, the former minister has been meeting BC leaders, his followers and even leaders who left the TRS and those who are unhappy with the party leadership. He also reportedly spoke to some BC leaders over phone and sought their support in his fight against the TRS leadership. “I started interacting with my followers and well-wishers to finalise my future course of action. People and leaders are giving their suggestions on various issues. I will announce my decision soon,” Eatala told TOI on Monday. Among those met him include former Karimnagar ZP chairperson Tula Uma, who is unhappy with the TRS leadership. She is not happy with the party for the past two years after the party turned down on her request for Vemulawada assembly ticket in 2018 elections. She was also denied ticket as a ZPTC member to become ZP chairperson of Karimnagar. Former MLC Ramulu Naik, who was disqualified after he defected to Congress, before 2018 elections and 20 village sarpanches of erstwhile Karimnagar district also met the ex-minister in the past few days. “There has been a deliberate attempt to prevent sarpanches from meeting me by offering money by some leaders,” Eatala said. While some BC leaders have decided to extend support to Eatala, some leaders alleged Eatala has not done anything for the BCs when he was in power. “There is a scope for a new party for BCs, who have been fighting for power for the last several decades. But, people won’t believe Eatala as he tried to split BC and Dalit unions when he was in power,” National BC Welfare Association president and former MLA R Krishnaiah told TOI. He said discussions among BC and Dalit leaders like Manda Krishna Madiga, Gaddar, Malanadu Chennaiah and Devi Raju have begun over supporting Eatala if he chooses to float a new party. Interestingly, Krishnaiah had also announced a few years ago to launch a political party, but it did not materialise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-keen-on-new-party-interacts-with-bcs-leaders/articleshow/82534928.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Pune: Guidelines to assist rural vaccine sites manage rush||PUNE: District collector Rajesh Deshmukh has released a set of guidelines seeking a coordinated effort on the part of the rural police and the pr/imary health centre (PHC) authorities to tackle crowding at the facilities for vaccination. The problem has been accentuated by an acute shortage of vaccines, which has forced people from urban areas driving in large numbers to the PHCs in the hope of getting the all-important dose. Coupled with the local population that reaches the PHCs, the people from the urban areas end up adding to the crowd and many times it becomes difficult for the authorities to manage them, especially when there is very less allotment of vaccine. Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said almost all vaccination centres were reporting chaotic situation across the district for the past few days. This issue was discussed at a meeting chaired by district collector Rajesh Deshmukh last week. “We have deployed 100 constables and 150 home guards to maintain the situation,” said Deshmukh. “Disputes between local population and people, who come from the Pune and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits for vaccination in rural areas, are taking place at multiple centres nowadays. This has disturbed the entire process of the vaccination at sites. Hence we have deployed our force,” Deshmukh added. Dr Indira Parkhe, in-charge of Shelpimpalgaon PHC, said, “The crowd here comes in the early hours for vaccination, despite giving clear instructions about doses and eligible beneficiaries. They sometimes behaved inappropriately with our staffers. The situation improved on Sunday after deployment of two police constables at the centre. On an average, we get 200 doses for different age groups. Most of the doses are for people aged abover 45 years. But still people aged between 18 years to 44 years come to centre and create a chaos.” Jayshree Mahajan, in-charge of PHC Karanjvihare, said, “Maximum beneficieries here come from the PCMC limits. Because of this, we have witnessed dispute between locals and these people. It creates tension among our staffers. Police deployment was needed to resolve the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/guidelines-to-assist-rural-vaccine-sites-manage-rush/articleshow/82534929.cms||Sandip Dighe

With the help of industries and the community leaders, the Kutch industries association has ordered 275 oxygen concentrators. Of this, the association has already received 65 oxygen concentrators in the first phase. “These concentrators have been provided to the social organizations in Anjar, Bhuj, Bhachau, Gandhidhan, Nakhatrana, Mandvi, Mundra and Rapar talukas of the Kutch district,” the industries’ body said on Monday. “The objective is to provide concentrators to Covid-19 patients at negligible or free of cost,” it further added. As part of the second phase, the association has planned to donate oxygen concentrators to Lakhpat and Abdasa taluka as per their requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kutch-industries-assn-orders-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82534969.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC orders govt to ensure price fixed for oxygen cylinders is adhered to||New Delhi: Delhi High Court delved into a host of issues on Monday on the pandemic preparedness — from seeking to know if oxygen concentrators can be declared essential commodities to taking stock of equitable distribution of hospital beds to fixing rates for oxygen cylinders and ambulances/hearse vans. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also questioned the AAP government over its lack of communication with citizens on dealing with Covid-19. “When election time is there we find full-page advertisements of your leaders. But in a pandemic, there is no information, no advertisements. In leading national dailies, we didn’t see a single insert. This way the system will collapse,” the bench told senior advocate Rahul Mehra, who represented Delhi government. Mehra tried to assure the bench that the government is alive to the situation and named a Hindi daily where it has published advertisements. But the bench was unimpressed, wondering why more publications are not being reached out to inform citizens on bed availability, doctors’ prescriptions and other related information. Later, Mehra informed the bench that the government had placed advertisements in several English and vernacular dailies that should be out the next day. The court also directed the government to file an affidavit on the status and patient intake of Indira Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Dwarka. On Monday, the bench heard a bunch of petitions and applications on various Covid-related matters. It asked the Centre and Delhi government to act swiftly to prevent black marketing and hoarding of medicines and medical equipment, including oxygen concentrators, while hearing a plea seeking to bring the items meant for Covid treatment under Essential Commodities Act. The petition by Delhi resident Manisha Chauhan has also sought setting up of dedicated fast-track courts to deal with such cases. The court issued a slew of other directions to Delhi government on fixing rates for oxygen, cylinders and planning for any future shortage of medicines after studying a note filed by amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao. It directed Delhi government to ensure that the price fixed for oxygen and its cylinders by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority was adhered to, pointing out that the government could look at fixing the price by also taking into account the transportation costs, but “the bottomline is supplies should not be hit”. On availability of ambulance and hearse services to ferry bodies of Covid patients, Rao placed before the court a list of verified service providers along with their rates. The bench then asked Delhi government to upload the list on its Covid website for the benefit of the public. The court also directed the government to start planning for any possible shortage of basic medications and other requirements, including blood, and directed it to plan ahead. The court asked for a note explaining how the government intends to deal with the situation. Taking up another PIL on allocation of beds, an issue also flagged by the amicus, the bench issued notice to both central and AAP governments. The plea sought creation of a “centralised agency along with helpdesks in every Covid-19 hospital in Delhi to ensure that patients are able to locate a bed in another hospital” if a bed is not available in one hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-orders-govt-to-ensure-price-fixed-for-oxygen-cylinders-is-adhered-to/articleshow/82535002.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation’s active Covid cases plunge 45% in 3 weeks||PUNE: The number of active Covid cases has dropped by over 45% in areas coming under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the last three weeks, which health officials attributed to the ongoing restrictions and rigorous contact tracing. The PMC areas had the highest active caseload of 56,636 on April 18. Since then, cases have been on a constant decline. On Monday, the active case count reached 30,836 — a decline of 45% or 25,800 cases in 22 days. The data of the last one week shows that the PMC areas have been adding less than 3,000 cases daily since the last few days. The daily caseload was above 3,000 only on three days since May 1. On Monday, the city added just 1,165 fresh cases, which is the lowest since March 15 when the PMC limits had added 1,082 new infections. Civic officials said the figures indicate that the drop in cases, which started in the third week of April, has continued in May. The daily positivity rate has also dropped in the last few days to below 20%. On Sunday, the positivity rate was 15.4%, while on the two previous days, it was around 16.5% and 14.65%. “Various restrictions imposed in the PMC areas and rigorous contact tracing have helped identify positive cases early on, thus restricting the spread,” a civic official said. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant medical chief at PMC, said the city has not reported any significant jump in daily cases since the last three weeks. “In the beginning of April, the PMC areas were adding over 5,000 positive cases daily. On a few days, the tally had even jumped past 6,000,” he said. The health data has revealed that the constant rise in recoveries and drop in daily cases have pushed the overall recoveries above 90% in the PMC limits. The city has so far recorded 4.46 lakh cases, while its recoveries stand at above 4.05 lakh. A senior civic official said the cases have dropped in most of the civic ward limits. Some civic wards like Bhavani Peth, Wanowrie-Ramtekdi, Kasba-Vishrambaug, Dhole Patil Road, Shivajinagar-Ghole Road have added fewer than 1,000 cases in the last one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmcs-active-covid-cases-plunge-45-in-3-weeks/articleshow/82535008.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Allahabad||Students, teachers complain of eye-related ailments due to prolonged virtual classes||PRAYAGRAJ: The ferocious second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has only prolonged the online mode of learning and teaching. While the online medium has its benefits, the digital mode of learning is posing a risk to the vision of both teachers and the students. The use of gadgets and long hours spent before the computer, laptop or mobile screens is affecting the eyesight of students and teachers. Moreover, the uncertainty posed by the pandemic’s unabated run has only given rise to the fear of ‘digital fatigue’ in the education sector. The long hours spent via the virtual classes and online private coaching sessions are harming the eyesight of children in the city, complained many parents. Ophthalmologists claim that both students, as well as teachers, are complaining about convergence inefficiency, computer vision syndrome, reflective errors and other eyesight ailments. Although virtual classes are a much-needed step to ensure studies are not affected, cases of eye strains and fatigue are also soaring amid the pandemic, with redness in the eyes and headache being the most common ones. And if not addressed instantly, these can lead to serious issues in the long run,” claimed the ophthalmologists. Noted eye surgeon, Dr Atul Kumar Dubey told TOI that “About 40 -45 per cent of patients, approaching ophthalmologists for eye-related ailments are children and young adults aged 6-22 years. Among adults with similar complaints, the majority are from teaching professionals. Even before the lockdown, doctors have been counselling parents to limit their children’s screen time. And, considering that kid’s organs are still in the developing stage, especially their eyes and the retina, it is relevant to limit their screen time to avoid damage, particularly during these growing times,” he added. Dr Dubey also claimed that people in the teaching profession are also suffering from eye ailments as they too spent long hours on computer screens while taking online classes or coaching sessions and preparing the material for online learning. Doctors claimed that most of the children and their teachers are diagnosed with Convergence insufficiency as their eyes are unable to work together when looking at nearby objects. This condition causes one eye to turn outward instead of inward with the other eye, creating double or blurred vision. Children working long hours on computers and smartphones often complain about itching or burning in eyes, watering, dementia of vision, headache and eye-ache,” added doctors. Moreover, an eye blinks 15 times every minute. But in the current scenario, this has come down by half, because of increased screen time and having to focus on the screen for long hours. Blinking is essential and children and parents taking online classes should ensure that their eyes must blink more often. Dr Dubey added that convergence insufficiency is being diagnosed among school-age children, who are attending online classes for longer durations. Many teachers were also diagnosed with computer vision syndrome, following an increase in the number of hours spent before computer screens. There is a correlation between ocular symptoms such as pain, redness, dryness, blurring of vision, double vision and other head and neck sprains. Besides, cases of reflective errors in terms of myopia and hypermetropia have also surfaced among children. Dr Anil Kumar, meanwhile, advised three main exercises including reducing screen times, the 20-20-20 rule ( every 20 minutes spent using a screen, users should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds) and eye-related exercise like pencil push-up exercise, cat card exercise and convergence eye exercises. A K Tripathi, a teacher, said “While taking online classes, we also experience irritation and redness in the eyes after using the screen for long hours."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/students-teachers-complain-of-eye-related-ailments-due-to-prolonged-virtual-classes/articleshow/82535023.cms||---

A conventional surgery would have made the boy’s arm dysfunctional which the hospital wanted to avoid as the patient was very young, consultant surgical oncology, Manipal Hospital, Dr Eugene Rent stated. “We decided to surgically remove the shoulder blade and then treat the removed bone with radiation. The sterile bone was then put back and all the muscles were stitched back in place,” he stated. “The final result was the shoulder is saved and he will have normal movement with no tumour,” he added. Manipal Hospital has stated that the team treated him with chemotherapy by a procedure which has been done only a few times before in the country for the shoulder blade called Extracorporeal radiation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rare-surgery-on-boy-with-shoulder-tumour/articleshow/82535032.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The chapel, in a corner of the former capital, is an important monument and the site an integral part of tourists’ itinerary. The three-dimensional panoramic view the site offers, Old Goa churches and monuments, Tiswadi islands and Carambolim khazan, makes for a memorable experience. “The conservation project’s first phase envisages repair of the roof. The part covering the vault above the main altar will be taken up on priority,” an official said. Over the years, the monument, under the charge of DoA, has been battered by natural elements and the roof has been damaged. The outbreak of Covid-19 and administrative delays added to the conservation woes, as the neglect worsened the decay of the roof. “We began pursuing the matter with the department over two years back. During the rains, water gushes through the roof and impacts the vault, which may collapse if neglected,” Fr Alfred Vaz, president of Se Cathedral chapter said. The chapel, though conserved by the department, is under the charge of the chapter. The department plans to take up the remaining conservation work in the second phase. As it rains randomly, the committee members are concerned about timely completion of the roof repairs. “The work needs to be expedited as delays may cause more damage,” the chapel committee’s secretary Glean Cabral said. From a historic point, Portuguese conqueror, Afonso de Albuquerque ordered the chapel to be built after defeating Adil Shah’s forces in 1510. The Sultan had positioned his artillery at the chapel site to retake it from the Portuguese.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/old-goas-monte-chapel-to-get-facelift/articleshow/82535038.cms||Paul Fernandes

But in Rome, I met an athlete who would change the way the world looked at sportspersons. We were hanging around at the Games Village entertainment zone where music was played and many athletes were dancing. We were not allowed to dance by our coach SA Rahim. After a while, a black athlete walked towards the Indian team and asked us to join in the fun and dance. We told him that we were not allowed. Before the athlete walked back to rejoin the dancing group, we decided to introduce ourselves. I shook hands with him and said ‘I am Fortunato Franco and I am a football player from India’. The black athlete took my hand and then said, ‘I am Cassius Clay, I am a boxer from USA’. Little did we know that the young man, all of 20, would go on to become one of the most influential athlete of the twentieth century.

While this might also lead to an artificial shortage with people spending as much as Rs 1 lakh and above to stock these gadgets, suppliers claim they are insisting the buyer first get a doctor’s opinion. In most cases, people having patients with co-morbidities are stocking these, but there are also others who are over cautious and hoarding concentrators, fearing finding no oxygen in hospitals when they need it most. “In many cases, these are being purchased as a back-up, especially by people who have co-morbidities. Also, there are calls from people who are just worried and can spend that kind of money, wanting to buy. We are discouraging panic buyers, but at least 35 to 40 of every 100 concentrators we get are being supplied to individual buyers,” a dealer said. With huge demand, dealers have run out of stock of concentrators. “I had been trying to get a concentrator for my home for the last two weeks. Initially, the contacts I got seemed to be fraud ones and later when I got a genuine dealer, I was told there is a waiting period of 4-5 days. I received one earlier this week and now I feel confident that I will be able to keep my mother safe. She has diabetes and is 78 years old,” a businessman from Manikonda said. Pleas for references, meanwhile, were unending on social media and people were trying every possible resource to get hold of a supplier. “The fear of finding no oxygen at hospitals or anywhere in the city is resulting in lot of people looking for concentrators. We are getting, on an average, 30 calls per day asking for contacts of suppliers. Despite increase in prices, non availability and almost no knowledge on how to use these, people want to purchase concentrators. We have been educating people on the purpose of concentrator and also advising them to speak to their doctors first before suggesting any places to them,” Arun Daniel Yellamaty, founder Youngistaan Foundation, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-sees-spike-in-demand-for-o2-concentrators/articleshow/82535053.cms||Amrita Didyala

Against a target of procuring over 80 lakh metric tonnes of paddy this season, only 25 lakh MTs have been purchased from the farmers so far. The procurement has slowed down as several staff and procurement centres were infected with Covid-19. Even the rice mills are not accepting paddy from the procurement centres as a large number of workers for loading and unloading of paddy have not returned from Bihar and other states in view of the surge. With unseasonal rains lashing most parts of the state, the farmers are a worried lot. At several places, large quantities of paddy have been damaged due to unseasonal rains. At a few places, even tarpaulins covered on paddy got washed away resulting in the paddy getting soaked in rain water. K Ravi of Rythu Swarajya Vedika said the farmers do not have better options than to wait for the government to procure their paddy. While the government is offering Rs 1,888 MSP per quintal for grade-A and Rs 1,868 MSP per quintal for common grade variety of paddy, the merchants and traders in private market are offering only Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,300 per quintal for the two varieties. Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy on Monday conducted a review meeting and directed them to ensure that there was no delay in transportation of paddy from procurement centres to the rice mills. “Create space in procurement centres so that the paddy brought by farmers from their villages is purchased immediately,” he said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the government would purchase the entire paddy produced by farmers this year also keeping in view of the pandemic. The government has also given a counter-guarantee to the Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation for taking a loan of Rs 20,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-hits-paddy-procurement-hard-in-t/articleshow/82535061.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||‘Furnish documents on how AAP MLA accessed O2 cylinders’||New Delhi: Insisting on a “full disclosure”, Delhi High Court on Monday asked AAP MLA Imran Hussain to furnish documents showing how he accessed oxygen cylinders that he supplied to patients in his constituency. “Please make a full disclosure. If you are doing a good voluntary service please do it in your constituency. But we need to know from where you got the oxygen. From your own sources you can do a service to society, but it can’t be from the quota allocated to Delhi. If that’s the case you are doing it for publicity for a political party,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli remarked, while asking the MLA to show documents that he procured the oxygen from Faridabad, Haryana, as claimed by him in an affidavit. To further verify, the bench also asked Delhi government to inform it if Hussain was supplied any oxygen through refillers in the national capital meant for hospitals and ambulances. The court’s enhanced scrutiny came after Hussain, represented by senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, told the court that he procured the gas from outside Delhi, while the cylinders were rented from the national capital and he has the receipts to prove it. “There is not a shred of paper filed to support your claim. We would like the government’s response also on this. Is the state giving cylinders to other people ?” the bench demanded to know, pointing out none of the receipts were on record. The court then asked the MLA to show the documents in support of his claims and listed the matter for hearing on May 13. However, Pahwa persisted in claiming that an affidavit on oath has been filed by Hussain. “This is not the way, there has to be documentation,” the bench shot back. It also underlined that the help being done by Hussain is being appreciated if it doesn’t cut in Delhi’s allocated resources. “We have not asked you to stop, please continue to do it (help constituents) but don’t take it from the allocated quota. We need to know from where you are sourcing it,” the court further clarified. The court was hearing a plea by Vedansh Sharma alleging that Hussain was hoarding oxygen cylinders at a time when the entire city was in the midst of crisis due to short supply of the life-saving gas. The plea filed through advocate Amit Tiwari said such distribution of oxygen was illegal and unlawful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/furnish-documents-on-how-aap-mla-accessed-o2-cylinders/articleshow/82535069.cms||Abhinav Garg

However, it may not rain everyday and it is unlikely to be widely distributed. Over the past week, parts of the state have been witnessing rainfall and thunderstorms. The IMD had earlier said that this phenomenon is due to the occurrence of a trough across interior Karnataka. The trough persists, but it is away from Goa to have any significant system impact. The clouds developed over interior Karnataka may get transported in the night/early morning hours and can cause light to moderate rainfall, the IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/light-showers-likely-till-may-14-15-imd/articleshow/82535077.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With a total of 18,000 titles the KA library staff and management are making the best of the Covid induced ‘curfew’ to prepare for the shift. “People have not been visiting the library due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. With the renovation going on work is in progress, it is the right time for us to start the process of moving,” sources from the library said. Besides scripts and plays performed at KA its library also has biographies, gramophone records, photographs and other material dating back to the 1970s. It also has rare literature written by playwrights from Goa, some of which are handwritten manuscripts copies of which cannot be found elsewhere. The library management is however unsure about when the actual shifting would happen. The challenge for now is not just moving base from KA along with the entire storehouse of knowledge but also on how to operate from another premises in the face of the second wave of the pandemic. Ashok Parab, the deputy director of the directorate of art and culture, who currently holds charge as the curator of the Goa State Central Library said that it is up to KA if they want to operate from their premises. “The Kala Academy library is a separate body and does not come under the Goa state central library. But with the current Covid situation, how will they operate? It is up to them. We don’t know their decision on whether or not they wish to operate,” he said. The Goa state central library is operational but visitors are not allowed to enter the building to browse books. They can rent or return books by prior request.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ka-to-move-its-books-to-central-library/articleshow/82535097.cms||Nida Sayed

Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders said that farmers from Punjab and Haryana are committed to the success of this movement. They claimed that the BJP government was trying to spread the lie that movement was weakening but farmers were constantly coming to the protest sites and fighting with full strength. The SKM asserted that farmers would end the protest only after their demands of repeal of farm laws and a constitution of a law on MSP were met. The SKM said farm laws would promote privatisation of the agricultural sector, which would ruin farmers’ life and cause immense loss to the poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/large-convoys-of-farmers-from-punjab-leaves-for-delhi-borders/articleshow/82535117.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Men more vulnerable to Covid in second wave too||NAGPUR: Similar to the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic, more men continued to be affected by the virus than women during the second wave. Though, the district has seen slight rise (2.4%) in infection cases among women during the second wave. In the first wave between March 11, 2020 and February 28, 2021, 1,49,720 persons had contracted novel coronavirus infection in the district. The district has started to witness second wave from the third week of February, but cases started spiralling up from the beginning of March and surged in April. Total cases detected were at 2,58,107 in the last two months of the second wave. Of the total 1,49,720 cases in first wave, 90,295 (60.3%) were men and 59,425 (39.7%) were women. Medical experts, however, have observed rise in the number of women patients in the second wave. Though, when it comes to numbers, there is not much difference. Of the total 2,58,107 cases, 1,49,325 (57.9%) were men and 1,08,782 (42.1%) women in second wave. With the slight increase in the number of women patients, the ratio of males in total cases came down by 2.4% compared to females. Doctors, experts and officials had time and again stated men are more exposed to the disease. Also, they had to say that women take more precautions compared to men. Doctors had also claimed that immunity level in women remains higher than men. Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar told TOI, “We are observing rise in the number of female patients in the second wave than we saw in the first. Also, more women are getting admitted for desaturation in the second wave. But female patients are doing well with oxygen support and recovering. Only around 10% of women patients need ventilation support.” Dr Swarnakar, who is also national secretary of Indian Chest Society, added, “The number of women patients in ICU has increased during the second wave mostly due to late testing and delayed hospitalization. Such percentage is high in rural areas.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Undoubtedly, more females are being infected in the second wave compared to the first one. The virus has become highly contagious in the second wave. Also, secondary attack rate is higher this time. Therefore, all or most in a family contracted the disease. It is clear that the virus is jumping gender gaps due to increased transmissibility. Even women landed up in hospitals with high infection this time as the disease was more virulent during the second wave.” There is also slight difference in ratio in male and female age-group wise. In the first wave, 62.9% men in 31-50 age group were infected, which has declined to 59.9% in the second. Similarly, 61.1% of total patients were males in 51-plus age group during the first wave and the percentage has come down to 56.6 in the second. Similar scenario is being seen in other age groups, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/men-more-vulnerable-to-covid-in-2nd-wave-too/articleshow/82535119.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: NGOs offer free oxygen to patients awaiting admission||HYDERABAD: A group of volunteers has set up a free oxygen facility at three government hospitals, including Gandhi Hospital, for Covid-19 patients awaiting admission. Since there is a waiting timing for Covid-19 patients in view of heavy demand for beds, the golden hour, which is critical for saving lives, is often lost as attendants search desperately for oxygen supplies. Taking this into view, the volunteers have set up oxygen beds outside the government hospitals to help patients breathe easily from the time they get down the ambulance till they get admission in the hospital. Volunteers of Social Data Initiative Forum , an NGO, are now operating free oxygen facility at Gandhi, King Koti and Chest hospitals. Pending a formal admission, volunteers provide free oxygen. Two other NGOs — Access Foundation and Safa Baitul Maal — are also involved. “We have witnessed several cases wherein patients have died due to lack of oxygen despite reaching the entrance of the hospital. In view of heavy inflow of patients and lack of beds, the admission process in hospitals, especially government hospitals, has become lengthy. Therefore, we have kept several filled medical oxygen cylinders at the entrance of hospitals, with trained staff, at free of cost,” SDIF volunteer Khalid Saifullah told TOI. According to SDIF advisor Syed Amjad, the oxygen facility has reduced the casualties. He said SDIF will provide free oxygen at more hospitals. “Our only intention is to save as many lives as we can. We are identifying the specific needs of Covid-19 patients and trying to extend the required help to them and their families. This is pandemic and we must focus only on saving lives and helping each other,” he said. SDIF founder Mohammad Azam Khan told TOI that they are also providing free oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators for home quarantined patients. “Many Covid-19 patients belonging to the poor and middle class families cannot procure an oxygen cylinder or a concentrator either due to lack of money or awareness. Since any drop in the oxygen saturation levels could prove fatal, such patients or their relatives could approach SDIF if they need an oxygen cylinder or a concentrator,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngos-offer-free-oxygen-to-patients-awaiting-admission/articleshow/82535122.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Government hospital in Dwarka ready for partial opening||NEW DELHI: Residents of Dwarka are likely to get dedicated Covid health care facilities by this weekend. Delhi government’s Indira Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, construction of which started in 2014, is going to open partially as a 250-bed Covid hospital. While construction work on the super speciality hospital at Dwarka is still underway and will take some time to complete, Delhi government has decided to start the hospital as a Covid care centre initially with 250-bed capacity keeping in view the current situation in the capital. The government plans to increase the capacity gradually in the coming days. While Delhi government’s health and family welfare department had given an order on Saturday (May 8) to start operations at the hospital complex as a dedicated Covid facility from Saturday itself, sources said that the facility is expected to start by this weekend as arranging manpower to manage the place is proving to be a challenge. To expedite partial opening of the facility, the government had constituted a five-member committee on April 28 to ensure the hospital is made functional in the shortest possible time. The committee, which has senior Delhi government officials, was entrusted with the responsibility of working out the modalities, including obtaining necessary approvals. The hospital complex was earlier planned over an area of 15 acres, but the premises will now be spread over 24 acres.  “Most of the construction work is completed but full-fledged operations will take some time to start,” an official said. While the physical infrastructure is nearly ready, finding adequate healthcare professionals and other manpower to manage a super speciality hospital has posed some challenge. In a circular issued late last year, the health department has stated that it intends to post willing staff in three new Delhi government hospitals at Burari, Ambedkar Nagar and Dwarka and requests are invited from doctors, nurses and paramedics for posting at these new hospitals. The residents of Dwarka have been running an online campaign to make the hospital project operational. The hospital will not only cater to residents of the sub-city, which doesn’t have any government hospital, but also many areas of southwest Delhi. The hospital has been in the pipeline for more than two decades as the land for its construction was allotted in 1997 and Rs 350 crore was allocated for the project in 2007. The construction work, however, started only in 2014. While the super speciality hospital was planned as a 750-bedded hospital initially, the Aam Aadmi Party government decided to increase its capacity to a 1,225-bedded one, which also resulted in more time being taken to open the hospital for public. The hospital complex has three sections – emergency, out-patient department and hospital wards, including intensive care unit and operation theatres. There are also plans to open a medical college in this complex and space and provisions have been kept aside for that, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-hospital-in-dwarka-ready-for-partial-opening/articleshow/82535124.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||India||Govt identifies 2,400 drivers to tide over fatigue of oxygen tanker pilots||NEW DELHI: In its bid to ensure no shortage of drivers to keep the fleets of road oxygen tankers running amid concerns of driver fatigue, who have been behind the wheels, the government has identified 2,400 more drivers for this purpose. The government is also roping in ex-servicemen, who have long experience in driving heavy vehicles carrying fuel through tough terrains and also for some imported vehicles which have steering wheels on the left. Union road transport secretary Giridhar Aramane, who heads the empowered group-2, told TOI that some of these identified drivers have the licence to drive vehicles carrying hazardous materials (HAZMAT) such as fuel, gas and acid. He added that those who don’t have the necessary licence will be trained in the next three week. For example, in UP, a road oxygen tanker is followed by one or two cars with additional drivers to ensure non-stop travel from origin to destination. Currently, there are little over 1,750 oxygen tankers in the country including the recently imported ones. Aramane said due to the effort of all stakeholders the medical oxygen production has been ramped up significantly in the past month. For example, the medical oxygen production was around 3,000 tonnes a day in September 2020 and it reduced to only 1,300 tonnes in January. In the past three weeks, it has increased from 4,500 tonnes to nearly 9,000 tonnes. “We are transporting the entire quantity,” the secretary said. This is corroborated from the data obtained from UP where the daily lifting of medical oxygen has increased from barely 250 tonnes a day to nearly 1,100 tonnes per day in the past three weeks. Meanwhile, officials said the Indian Railways has done a commendable job by operating the Oxygen Express trains by delivering more than 4,700 tonnes of the medical oxygen till Monday to Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Telangana and Rajasthan. Railway Board chairman, Suneet Sharma said they are running these trains at maximum permissible speed for fastest delivery of the medical oxygen. “Besides the speed, what is more important in case of railways is predictability as there is no chance of the trains getting delayed and more so when the railways is creating green corridors for them,” said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-identifies-2400-drivers-to-tide-over-fatigue-of-oxygen-tanker-pilots/articleshow/82535127.cms||Dipak K Dash

Policemen guarding a checkpost at Chaura Rasta said, “It is quiet at present with very few people coming out of their homes for medicines and vaccinations. No one is roaming without any reason. If there are any problem anywhere, people inform us.” Policemen check the vaccination message on mobile phones of people as proof before letting them go. There were people outside vaccination centres, but not crowded. Roads leading to Chaura Raasta, Badi Chaupar to Choti Cahupar were deserted. A handful of fruit vendors were seen on the streets with very few customers. Vendors selling coconut water were found standing in front of SMS Hospital where mostly patients and relatives were seen purchasing. At Chandpol gate, an autorickshaw was seen taking two women to hospital. Police immediately stopped it. When the women claimed they were on their way to a hospital, cops let them go. Pradeep Singh, traffic in-charge of Walled City said, “Checkposts were put up at several places. In the last three days, crowds on the roads have decreased.

---||Delhi||AAP, BJP continue to spar over Covid management in city||New Delhi: Aam Admi Party and BJP continued to trade charges on handling issues related to Covid management. Aam Aadmi Party MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak on Monday said that BJP-run corporations were endangering lives of Delhiites during the pandemic by not properly disposing of Covid-related biomedical waste. “Yesterday I had informed how Covid patients went missing from North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital. Instead of giving an adequate statement on this, BJP functionaries are trying to mislead the citizens,” he alleged. “You all know that there are several patients who are under home isolation. The biomedical waste generated from these people should be treated in a scientific manner, which is the responsibility of the civic bodies.” He alleged that biomedical waste has been dumped in open plots. He said that AAP wants stringent action to be taken against the people who are responsible. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, however, denied the charges while stating that the health care system is failing and people are dying in Delhi without adequate medical care while AAP is busy “doing politics”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-continue-to-spar-over-covid-management-in-city/articleshow/82535182.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Med officer, ambulance must at private vax centres in housing societies||MUMBAI: The BMC has issued detailed guidelines for vaccination drives to be organised at workplaces and housing societies by private covid vaccination centres (PCVC) having sufficient number of willing beneficiaries. Employees, family members, society residents, maids, drivers, etc., above 18 years shall be eligible for vaccination. One PCVC can be linked with one or more workplaces or housing societies but information about the same will need to be given to the local ward office. Vaccination will be done on a payment basis, and the price per vaccine will need to be mutually decided by the PCVC and the respective workplace/housing society. The civic body, in a circular signed by its chief I S Chahal, has said that it is necessary to expand the number of vaccination centres in Mumbai and also ensure swift vaccination before the third wave of Covid hits the city. Workplaces or housing societies will be required to designate one of their senior staff to work as a nodal officer to coordinate with PCVCs. The nodal officer will oversee and facilitate all aspects of vaccination at the workplace/housing society, such as registration of beneficiaries and availability of physical and IT infrastructure. It will be mandatory for the beneficiaries to be registered on CoWin app prior to vaccination. In case of workplace, on the spot registration will also be available to employees but family members of the employees will still need to be registered via CoWin portal. The BMC said some of the workplaces have health infrastructure in the form of hospitals and health clinics which can be utilised for setting up a vaccination site. However, the PCVC will allow any one brand of vaccine at such drives. It will also appoint a medical officer at all workplaces/housing societies equipped with anaphylaxis kit to deal with any adverse event. These PCVC will be linked to the nearest health facility and a basic life support ambulance will be utilised for shifting beneficiaries, if required. “This policy therefore liberalises the current practices/permissions without comprising on the safety aspect. The onus and responsibilities of the PCVC will be increased, and at the same time, they will get faster and easy permissions to take up vaccination work,” states the civic circular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-med-officer-ambulance-must-at-pvt-vax-centres-in-hsg-societies/articleshow/82535192.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Intervene, save lives: Congress to Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: Congress has urged the high court to intervene and save lives of people by directing the TRS government to constitute an empowered task force committee at state and district level and take several other measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. In a letter to chief justice Hima Kohli on Monday, All India Congress Committee spokesperson Dasoju Sravan stated: “The high court’s intervention is needed to save lives of people in Telangana as several letters written by Congress to the state government highlighting the ground level situation and steps needed to save lives, has had no response and that people are continuing to die of Covid-19.” A copy of the letter was released to the media by Sravan. Sravan suggested the task force must comprise experts from healthcare, public health, technology, logistics and supply chain management, armed forces and resident welfare associations. It should have decision making powers to formulate, monitor, review, streamline and implement global and national best practices to tackle Covid-19. Other suggestions made by him include declaring health emergency, setting up 24x7 Covid war room at state and district level similar to ones in Kerala and Maharashtra, setting up adequate testing kiosks, free testing centres and thousands of vaccination centres, and ensuring free testing and vaccination irrespective of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/intervene-save-lives-cong-to-hc/articleshow/82535199.cms||---
---||Chennai||EPS is TN oppn leader, OPS rejects deputy leader’s post||Chennai: The AIADMK on Monday chose former chief minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami as leader of the opposition in the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly. The decision came after much wrangling and muscle flexing. Party coordinator O Panneerselvam initially resisted the move and proposed former speaker P Dhanapal’s name, sources said. But there were few takers for the suggestion. The power struggle was in full display as Panneerselvam and Palaniswami squabbled over who was more eligible to be the leader of the opposition. But with little support from the newly elected MLAs, 63 of them discounting the two leaders, Panneerselvam gave in. He rejected the offer of deputy leader for himself, proposing Dhanapal for the post instead, and left the party headquarters in a huff, sources said. AIADMK deputy coordinator and erstwhile supporter of Panneerselvam, K P Munusamy, submitted a letter to assembly secretary K Srinivasan about the ‘unanimous’ choice of the legislature party, on the eve of the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected MLAs. Later in the evening, Palaniswami called on Panneerselvam at the latter’s residence and greeted him with a shawl and a bouquet. Panneerselvam returned the compliment, draping the same shawl on Palaniswami. Former ministers and senior functionaries accompanied Palaniswami. Allies PMK leader S Ramadoss and G K Vasan of TMC congratulated him. The legislature party unanimously elected Palaniswami as leader of the opposition with a majority of the MLAs, including former ministers, backing him. “Except Alangulam MLA P H Manoj Pandian, no one present at the meeting backed OPS. They were all urging him to sacrifice one more time, like he did when he agreed to project EPS as chief ministerial candidate for the assembly election,” a senior leader told TOI. The decision was made after a three-hour long discussion by MLAs at the party headquarters in Chennai, and Panneerselvam left after signing the necessary papers, “appearing unhappy”.The leader of the opposition must be chosen by Tuesday night since the Speaker-elect would have to be taken to the chair on Wednesday by the chief minister and leader of the opposition. On Friday too, AIADMK MLAs discussed for nearly three hours, but failed to arrive at a consensus. Panneerselvam did not get support even from his own community members and senior leaders in the southern belt.Close Palaniswami associates P Thangamani and S P Velumani and senior leader K A Sengottaiyan threw their weight behind him. The meeting began with Palaniswami stating he would accept whatever decision the MLAs took. The AIADMK won 32 out of 54 seats in the western belt, and only 16 out of 60 seats in the southern belt. Panneerselvam was the lone party MLA from his home turf, Theni district. Palaniswami won from Edappadi constituency in Salem district in western TN. Of the 11 constituencies in the district, AIADMK and ally PMK won 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-is-tn-oppn-leader-ops-rejects-deputy-leaders-post/articleshow/82535202.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Most hopefuls who land at vax centres not locals, says corporators||MUMBAI: With an eye on the upcoming civic elections, several corporators had pushed for Covid-19 vaccination centres in health posts or civic hospitals in their own localities to cater to their voter base. Now, many of them say they have been finding a large number of people from other localities and even from outside Mumbai at these centres, as local residents struggle to find slots. Ever since the “no walk-in rule” was introduced, the situation has worsened, said the corporators, as earlier they would give tokens to residents of their own localities and accommodate them for jabs. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said almost 75% of the people landing up at the Motilal Nagar health post in his ward are from other localities. “Forget my ward, they are not even from Goregaon. I do not blame them as they too are choosing any vaccination centre where they can find a slot. But we feel our own voters are being deprived despite a vaccination centre so close to their homes,” he said, adding prior to the no walk-in rule, almost 100% of the people who got vaccinated at the centre were locals from the area. Srikala Pillai, the corporator from his neighbouring ward, said her locality has large slum pockets and she is worried how their residents will get vaccinated if the no walk-in rule continues for a while. “Besides, several senior citizens who are not tech-savy come to us saying they feel helpless that they cannot enter a centre so close their homes,” said Pillai. In Mulund, MLA Mihir Kotecha said there are three vaccination centres in the locality which get up to 30% people from outside Mumbai. “These centres have people come from Vashi, Ambernath and even Juhu to take their vaccines while the elderly citizens of the locality are deprived of jabs. They come to us with complaints like how they are due for their vaccine or are more vulnerable and hence should be administered their jabs on priority. But then, there is little we can do as slots get booked in no time,” said Kotecha. In south Mumbai, BJP corporator Atul Shah, in whose ward a vaccination centre has started in Bhendi Bazaar, said local residents are not able to get any appointment. “The slots get filled in half an hour. With hardly any vaccines available, the no walk-in rule is not serving the purpose of benefiting the local public of every area where a centre has been opened,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-most-hopefuls-who-land-at-vax-centres-not-locals-says-corporators/articleshow/82530618.cms||Richa Pinto

A Virar activist said just 100 of 500 doses are given to those who have registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-anger-rising-in-vasai-virar-as-many-register-for-jabs-yet-turned-away/articleshow/82530688.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Hyderabad||WHO: Avoid large gatherings, pray at home||HYDERABAD: Ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, which marks the conclusion of Muslim month of Ramzan, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has come out with an advisory for healthy festival celebrations and to derive the maximum spiritual fervour and social benefit even while maintaining a safe distance in view of Covid-19 second wave. “As we celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr this year, let’s also celebrate good health. Play your part in saving lives. Cancel large gatherings. Use outdoor venues or ensure good ventilation indoors with physical distancing. Remember that virtual gatherings are safe,” the WHO said in its Eid-ul-Fitr 2021 advisory. Eid-ul-Fitr or ‘festival of alms giving’ falls on May 13 or 14 in India depending on the sighting of the crescent. This is the second year in a row that the month of Ramzan and the Eid-ul-Fitr are falling under the shadow of Covid-19. Though there had been a few instances when the Muslim month of fasting coincided with pandemics and epidemics in the last 180 years, this is the first time that the pandemic has extended into two consecutive Eid-ul-Fitr. The WHO advisory suggested that Muslims should help in protecting themselves and others during prayers. “Use your own prayer rug and maintain physical distancing. Wear your mask. Choose to pray at home with close family members only. Remember the sick in your prayers this year,” it added. Stating that one can be sick but not showing symptoms and putting others at risk, WHO suggested avoiding large gatherings. “Avoid attending Eid-ul-Fitr prayers and gatherings if you feel unwell. Encourage friends and family, who are over 60 years or have other health conditions, to stay at home. We all deserve to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr safely this year. Limit social gatherings. Maintain physical distance. Wash your hands and get vaccinated,” the advisory said. Meanwhile, Muslim religious leaders have appealed to the community members to stay indoors and offer prayers at home in view of the critical Covid-19 phase in the country. They also appealed to Muslims to donate in charity for vaccination programmes and help in building health infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/who-avoid-large-gatherings-pray-at-home/articleshow/82535233.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Cantonment has over 30,000 fewer voters this year||Secunderabad: There has been a significant dip in the number of electoral voters in the process of the final electoral draft in Secunderabad Cantonment. In all, 30,722 voters have been deleted from the electoral rolls. According to the latest final draft of electoral rolls, 1,29,696 voters were identified in all eight civilian wards in the Cantonment. Anticipating that the SCB elections are likely to be held as per schedule, officials prepared electoral rolls in 2019, when there were 1,60,416 voters in the Cantonment. After the schedule was deferred and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) extended the elected Board’s tenure twice. In February this year, MoD announced that the Board’s tenure was completed. The pandemic had forced the MoD to postpone preparing a final draft of electoral rolls and finally, the final draft was asked to be published by April 2021. A marathon exercise was taken up, in which duplicate voters and double entry in the electoral rolls were deleted and new voters were enrolled. “We have found that the total number of deleted voters is 30,722,” an in-charge of SCB election wing told TOI. In the 2015 Cantonment Board elections, a total of 1,68,063 voters were on the electoral rolls. This year, the number has fallen to 1,29,696. “We have implemented Supreme Court’s 2016 judgment which ruled that encroachers of defence land have no right to vote in the Cantonment Board elections, which has caused a dip in the number of voters,” an SCB official said. Voters can verify their names and file their objections on the final draft either at SCB main office or any of SCB’s five circle offices, an official said. The final voters list will be published in the next week, he added. Meanwhile, senior BJP leader in Secunderabad Cantonment, Dhananjaya Chary, said that physical verification by voters was risky during the pandemic situation, especially since a few SCB staff tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantonment-has-over-30000-fewer-voters-this-year/articleshow/82535238.cms||---

According to the suspension orders, it was mentioned that Rajkumar Meena made a Facebook account in the name of Hansraj Meena with his picture on it. “Today at 9 pm people can listen to the ‘Mann ki Baat’ of a ‘Feku’ ALM (read backwards). People can also speak out their ‘Mann ki Baat’ on the dilapidated medical infrastructure during the pandemic,” the comment read. He also commented on MP Sukhbir Singh Jaunpuria, who had earlier said mud bath and blowing of conch prevent coronavirus. Rajkumar allegedly said on the post, “Last time the Member of Parliament suggested to have a bath in cow dung to prevent coronavirus. I think we have selected these parliamentarians to eat cow dung and bathe in it.” According to sources, the teacher’s comment of Facebook was against the Rajasthan Code of Conduct Rules for government servants which mentions that no working official can make such comment against public representatives. District education officer of Sawai Madhopur Radhey Shayam Meena said, “We found that Rajkumar Meena made some derogatory remarks against the public representatives. Hence, we have suspended the official and he has been given a 15 days’ notice to explain his conduct. After this, action will be taken as per the Rajasthan Code of Conduct Rules.” Reacting to the action taken against the government teacher, Narayan Singh Sisodia, president of Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh said, “Teacher’s intention was not to hurt the public representative but to comment on the superstitious act. We would request the state government to forgive the teacher and reinstate him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/teacher-suspended-for-fb-remarks-against-mla-mp/articleshow/82535257.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 paramedics among those held in Covid crackdown||New Delhi: Delhi Police continued its crackdown on those involved in black marketing of Covid-related equipment and arrested several people, including paramedics and nursing assistants, for illegally selling oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir injections. In the first case, two paramedics were arrested in south Delhi for indulging in black marketing of oxygen cylinders using the CATS ambulance service. DCP (south) Atul Thakur said that the police were alerted by a woman who informed them that a person had posted a message on social media regarding supply of oxygen cylinders. When she contacted the number, the man demanded Rs 90,000 for a 50-litre cylinder. The woman then lodged a complaint. A team led by ACP Lakshay Pandey mounted surveillance and arrested one Pawan. Later his associate, Vipan Nagar, was also arrested. During interrogation, Pawan revealed that for the past two years he was working as a paramedic with the CATS ambulance service. He was charging Rs 40,000 for a 15-litre cylinder and Rs 90,000 for a 50-litre cylinder. The oxygen cylinders were being issued to ambulances for transporting critically ill patients. The accused managed to circulate his number on social media for oxygen cylinder supply and soon started getting many requests. He then started misappropriating oxygen cylinders that were being issued for ambulances. In another operation, three people, including nursing assistants of two hospitals, have been arrested for allegedly indulging in black marketing of Remdesivir injections used to treat Covid-19 patients, deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said. On May 8, Anshul Aggarwal (22), a resident of Shahdara, was nabbed while he was trying to sell the injection to a person posing as a customer sent by the police, officials said. The police also arrested two of his associates, Sunil Kumar and Rahul Paul, both residents of Nehru Nagar. While Kumar was working as a nursing assistant at a hospital in Gulabi Bagh, Rahul was a nursing assistant at a hospital in Ghaziabad, police said. The duo managed to get these injections from hospitals where the patient had either succumbed to Covid or did not care to report their theft, police officials said. They found six Remdesevir injections with them, each was being sold for Rs 32,000. In north district, a man was arrested for duping people who needed Remdesivir.

The decision was made at a meeting conducted by chief minister M K Stalin with higher education minister K Ponmudi, secretary Apoorva and officials from Anna University on Monday. As many as 4.25 lakh students appeared for the proctored online tests conducted by Anna University in February. The university declared the results on April 9. “Of the 4.25 lakh students who appeared for online tests, the university declared the results for 2.3 lakh students. Of 2.3 lakh students, only 1.1 lakh students have cleared the exam and 1.2 lakh have not cleared it. The university withheld the results of the remaining students due to suspected cases of malpractice,” Ponmudi told reporters. Ponmudi said, “Students have complained that the proctored online tests were not conducted properly.”“The CM took a decision to conduct re-exam for all four lakh students. All four lakh students can appear for the re-test which will be conducted for three hours as in other universities,” Ponmudi added. “Students who have passed the February test can appear for re-test if they wish. The online exam will be conducted for three hours like in other universities. Exams for the next semester also will be held in the same pattern,” a release from the state government said. Students need not pay the exam fee for appearing for the re-exam. Other universities are conducting partial online exam in which students will download the question papers and write the exam without any supervision. However, Anna University conducted a proctored test in which the exam was monitored by artificial intelligence tools along with invigilators. Every move of the students was recorded. “The university has evidence of suspected malpractice activities. Students tried to cheat the exams in different ways, including forming WhatsApp and Telegram groups, taking help from siblings and friends and some even tried to copy from books. Some students innocently also looked away from the screen many times. The results cannot be released without verifying the videos,” sources in the university said. A source said the university was ready to release the results of a further 1.2 lakh students. The government also announced that exams for college students, which were stopped due to the lockdown, would be held from May 25. “The announcements will be released by the respective universities and students are requested to prepare for the exams,” the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hold-re-exam-for-4l-engg-students-tn-to-anna-univ/articleshow/82535286.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Spurt in psychotic episodes, panic attacks among patients||HYDERABAD: Home isolation, prolonged hospitalisation, deaths of near and dear in the family and fear of getting infected is leading to acute psychotic episodes in Covid-19 patients and their family members. Panic attacks, anxiety disorders and depression are increasingly diagnosed among patients. Dr M Umashankar, superintendent of the Institute of Mental Health at Erragadda, said: “The fear of getting Covid-19 infection, hearing about deaths in the family and among relatives is resulting in acute psychotic episodes and panic attacks. Keeping away from such negative thoughts, regular exercises, entertainment and other relaxation measures will help them to stay mentally healthy.” Dr G Jagannath, psychiatrist at Asha Hospitals and Rehabilitation Centre, said diagnosis of acute psychosis among home quarantined persons should be done carefully. “If it is a psychotic behaviour of a confused state associated with hypoxia to the brain is key to the treatment. Behavioural problems should also be checked. In case of an abnormal behaviour, hallucinations and hypoxia, the patients should be shifted to a hospital for treatment,” he said. Dr Jagannath said panic attacks are increasingly reported. “Basically, people suffer from anxiety. In isolation, if there are two positive patients, usually there is less stress on them. But, in case of only one patient getting isolated, it leads to anxiety and panic attacks,” he said. Dr Jagannath said that counselling the patient, relaxation exercises and use of low doses of medicines can help in controlling the panic attacks and anxiety. “In case of depression, apart from counselling, low doses of anti-depressants can be given,” he said. Rachakonda commissioner of police Mahesh Muralidhar Bhagwat said mental health is not taken seriously by people. There were two recent instances wherein a person died by suicide by jumping from the hospital building due to fear of having Covid-19 and a youngster who suffered schizophrenia due to isolation for 14 days, he said. Having come across numerous instances where people are suffering from stress, depression, loneliness, fear, grief and anxiety because of the pandemic, the CP said Rachakonda police in association with Rachakonda security council is launching psychosocial counselling services for all citizens of Telangana. This service was made available during the lockdown period in 2020 and counsellors had addressed more than 200 calls, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spurt-in-psychotic-episodes-panic-attacks-among-patients/articleshow/82535288.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Jaipur||Woman, 3 daughters jump in front of train, die in Dausa||JAIPUR: In a gruesome incident, a woman and her three daughters jumped in front of a train under Mandawar police station in Dausa on Monday. Though she ran towards the train with her five daughters, miraculously two escaped unhurt by jumping off the tracks at the last moment. The deceased were identified as Vinita (34), her daughters—Komal (10), Amni (8) and Payal (2) while Pari and Koyal survived the suicide bid. Vinita was married to Khemraj Meena, who is a gateman at a railway crossing at Mandawar village, and lives in a rented house in the same village. “Initial investigation says Vinita was unhappy with Meena’s abusive behaviour. Meena is a habitual drinker and used to beat his wife and daughters almost every day. On Monday night, Vinita left for her mother’s place in Bawarikheda village with her five daughters after a tiff with her husband,” said police. While on the way to her mother’s village, Vinita was passing through the railway tracks and saw a goods train coming from the other end. “Eyewitness said after she saw a train coming, she took her five children on the tracks and started walking towards it. She was holding all her daughters tightly so that all came in contact with the train,” said police. At the last moment, Pari and Koyal jumped off the tracks and survived the suicide attempt. Eyewitness and others who heard the cries of the daughters rushed to help only to see four bodies lying on either side of the tracks. Police were called at the spot which took the bodies to a hospital for post mortem in Dausa. “Police called Meena at the hospital but he didn’t respond and switched off his phone. He has not joined duty at the railway crossing either,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/woman-3-daughters-jump-in-front-of-train-die-in-dausa/articleshow/82535303.cms||---

The deceased Sayar Kanwar died due to prolonged illness at a private hospital in Sikar. The hospital ambulance dropped the body outside her residence and left. Kanwar lived with her husband and grandchildren. “Her husband ran from pillar to post requesting the villagers to help him cremate the body but none helped fearing the spread of Covid. However, the deceased died due to non-Covid health complications,” said a villager. The matter reached the sarpanch who contacted tehsildar Yadav for help. Yadav came there within an hour and offered help to the family. She brought four PPE kits as a precautionary measure. Yadav called the ambulance to take the body to the cremation ground but faced refusal. “With the help of the sarpanch, a pick-up van was arranged which took the body to the cremation ground. There, Yadav made the preparations for the body to be consigned to flames. Thereafter, she called the deceased’s husband to light the pyre,” said the villager, who witnessed the entire episode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tehsildar-arranges-womans-cremation/articleshow/82535318.cms||---

The installation of the plant was facilitated with the joint efforts of the Delhi government’s Dialogue and Development Commission and Bansuri Charitable Society. The PSA plant has been installed by MVS Engineering to help address the oxygen crisis, a company statement said on Monday. The plant has been manufactured and installed at an cost of Rs 91.8 lakh and has a capacity of 35 NM3 per hour (equivalent to 5 jumbo cylinders/hr), it said. It will contribute to uninterrupted oxygen supply to DDU Hospital, which is one of Delhi's crucial Covid care centres, the statement said. “We started building the machine two weeks back and had to work very closely with our supply chain partners to expedite the process,” said Siddharth Rastogi, Executive Director, MVS Engineering Pvt Ltd. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddu-hospital-gets-psa-oxygen-plant/articleshow/82535319.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Ailing Asaram seeks bail for ayurvedic cure in Haridwar||JODHPUR: Battling with Covid at AIIMS-Jodhpur, Asaram, who is a convict of sexual abuse of a teenage girl of his gurukul, has sought bail for ayurveda treatment in Haridwar. Asaram is currently under medical care at AIIMS-Jodhpur for Covid and his condition is stated to be stable there. Allowing the petition, however, the division bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Devendra Kachhawaha has summoned the medical report of the petitioner from AIIMS-Jodhpur and has listed the matter for next hearing on May 13. His counsel, Pradeep Choudhary said that a suspension of sentence application had been moved in the high court some time back, which came up for hearing on Monday. Arguing on the petition, Choudhary said to the court that Asaram has already been suffering from many diseases and has recently contacted Covid, for the treatment of which, he has been admitted to AIIMS-Jodhpur. “He has been suffering from many ailments and has interest in taking ayurveda treatment in Haridwar. We have sought bail so that he could go there and avail the treatment,” said Choudhary. It may be noted that Asaram had earlier expressed a wish to be admitted in AIIMS, when he was taken to MG Hospital from jail on Wednesday night after he tested positive and complained of shortness of breath. Granting his wish later, he was shifted to AIIMS on Friday night, while police had attributed this shifting to threat from his devotees, who had assembled at MG Hospital in large numbers and tried to sneak in to catch his glimpse. It is worth mentioning, that since his conviction by the trial court (special court for Pocso cases) on April 25, 2018, Asaram has moved 3 applications praying suspension of sentence including the present one. Interestingly, the former two had been withdrawn later by his counsel as ‘not press’. The two co-accused Shilpi and Sharad, who had been sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, have their sentences suspended and both are out on bail, while Asaram is still serving the jail term as life sentence till death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/ailing-asaram-seeks-bail-for-ayurvedic-cure-in-haridwar/articleshow/82535343.cms||---

As per the hospital’s records, 264 patients with psychological illnesses are currently lodged at the institute at present. Of them 74 patients were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus, a number which has now dipped to 62 patients. “There are no severe cases or deaths. We are treating patients with Covid-19 by isolating them and if they need oxygen support, we are shifting them to other hospitals. Of the 62 patients (currently said to be positive for Covid-19), some of them have completed 14 days (of isolation) so the number will reduce further. We are managing well and are informing the courts from time to time about the patients,” IMH superintendent, Dr M Uma Shankar, told TOI. “Usually, families come and back and take these patients only when they they are completely cured,” the IMH superintendent added. Meanwhile in the private sector, only a few mental health hosptials and rehabilitation centres in the city have inpatient facilities. Shifting psychiatric patients infected with Covid-19 is often a herculean task as most ambulance services refuse to take such patients due to a fear of violent behaviour. “In case of patients already suffering from mental illnesses, we continue with same medication for psychosis but the dosage of sedatives has to be reduced as these drugs may act on the respiratory centre in the brain. Butantipsychoticss should not be stopped. Mood stabilisers that metabolise in the liver should be used carefully because anti-viral drugs are also metabolised by the liver. Lithium carbonate, which is excreted by the kidney should either be used carefully or better, stopped for a few days as dehydration may occur. Loss of appetite and low water intake while being infected with Covid-19 can cause lithium toxicity,” said Dr G Jagannath, psychiatrist at Asha Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/62-patients-at-imh-erragadda-being-treated-for-covid/articleshow/82535349.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||Buy vax for 59 lakh aged 18-44 for Rs 350 crore, says BJP to BMC||MUMBAI: City BJP MLAs have demanded that the BMC dips into its reserves and purchase vaccines required for those between 18-44 years for Rs 350 crore. They said the BMC has fixed deposits of Rs 70,000 crore so there will be no financial difficulty in providing free vaccination to this population. The Rs 70,000-crore fixed deposits include provident and pension funds of civic employees, surplus funds, sinking fund and bank guarantees from contractors. In a letter to BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, the BJP MLAs, including Mumbai unit president Mangal Prabhat Lodha, said that as per the 2011 census, there are 59 lakh persons in the 18-44 age group and at Rs 600 for two doses, the total vaccine cost for this population works out to Rs 350 crore, an amount the BMC can easily afford. The letter added that the Centre has allowed state governments and private hospitals to procure 50% of the required vaccines directly from the manufacturers. Therefore, the BMC should, through the state government, procure the required dosages, it stated. “The BMC administration must get this amount immediately approved, place orders with vaccine manufacturers and inform the state government,” the letter said. The BJP legislators further asked the BMC to follow up with the state government to increase the stock of vaccines for those aged above 45 so that their second doses could be provided at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-buy-vax-for-59l-aged-18-44-for-rs-350-crore-says-bjp-to-bmc/articleshow/82535351.cms||---

Petrol rates have already crossed Rs 100 in Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh. In Jaipur, petrol prices rose to Rs 97.92 after an increase of 27 paise, while diesel prices increased by 36 paisa to Rs 90.61 per litre. In Bansawara, Jalore, Churu, and Dungarpur, petrol is sold at above Rs 99 per litre. The rates in the six districts are higher compared to Jaipur because they are served from depots which are located faraway places. In February, the state government reduced VAT on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 each but the centre which collects even a bigger amount has not cut its taxes on the fuels. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fuel-prices-rise-further/articleshow/82535383.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Small, mid-sized hospitals seeking huge cash payments upfront for Covid-19 treatment||HYDERABAD: While cashless treatment facilities for Covid-19 patients are now available in most big hospitals, many small and mid-sized hospitals continue to demand cash payments at the time of admission. “My sister suddenly developed low oxygen saturation and we rushed her to a private hospital. After being denied a bed at three different hospitals, we got a bed in a small hospital in Banjara Hills. However, they demanded that we deposit Rs 70,000 in cash at the time of admission and refused to begin treatment till we paid,” said Srikanth, the brother of a patient. The family has not lodged a complaint fearing backlash from the hospital as the patient is under their care, he said. Like Srikanth, many others find their insurance cards and plastic money futile when it comes to admissions. “I had to plead with the hospitals to accept part-card payments and out of three hospitals who has an oxygen only one accepted, that too 30 per cent payment through cards. Insurance was outright rejected,” said Moinuddin Shah, a patient’s relative, who had to pay Rs 60,000 payment in cash at the time of admission. Apart from daily payments upfront or payments once every two days, some hospitals are also said to be seeking upfront payments in cash for every oxygen cylinder refill. “Small and medium-sized hospitals which have turned into Covid-19 hospitals are also charging huge sums, right from advance payments in cash up to around Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Even patients on oxygen support are being charged separately depending on how much oxygen the patient is consuming — if he or she is consuming less than 5 litres then there is one rate but if more is consumed, the rate increases. There is no check on and everyone is trying to make a quick buck at the cost of patients,” said Helping Hand Foundation trustee, Mujtaba Hasan Askari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/small-mid-sized-hosps-seeking-huge-cash-payments-upfront-for-covid-19-treatment/articleshow/82535385.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Delhi||Offer Eid prayers at home: Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid||New Delhi: In the wake of the current Covid wave across the country, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid, Mufti Mohd Mukarram Ahmed, has issued an appeal to the Muslims to offer Eid-ul-Fitr prayers at home. With doctors and experts predicting further rise in cases, everyone should avoid stepping out without any important reason and take all prescribed precautions, he said. In his video message, Mufti Mukarram said the sharia permitted praying at home in such unusual situations and people needed to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour like avoiding crowding or heading to markets. He added that with the uncontrolled spread of the virus, people should avoid heading to mosques for prayer, like they did throughout Ramzan. He also elaborated the procedure to offer the Eid namaz at home in place of a congregational prayer. With the surge in cases and rising economic hardships, Mufti Mukarram insisted that the Muslims should offer sadqa fitr (charity for poor) to those battling Covid or those who had lost their dear ones. He said the sharia allowed using donation money to help those fighting Covid-19. He also urged people to pray for novel coronavirus to ebb and insisted that no risk of gathering should be taken at this hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/offer-eid-prayers-at-home-shahi-imam-of-fatehpuri-masjid/articleshow/82535425.cms||Amin Ali

He later surrendered before police on Monday. Police arrested the accused Bisnaram Bheel and seized the sword from him. Preliminary investigation revealed that Bheel suspected his wife’s character and had taken his wife from her parents’ house on Sunday night itself. The couple was daily wagers working as masons. According to ADCP (West) Harphool Singh, the victim Neelam, 35, was staying with her parents in Soorsagar area of Jodhpur for the past few days and was the second wife of Bisnaram Bheel. “He had taken Neelam from her parents’ house on Sunday night to his house in Piparli in Luni area of Jodhpur,” said the official. He said both the husband and wife were alone at home at night and they might have had some arguments as Bisnaram suspected his wife’s character. “While both slept at night, Bisnaram hacked Neelam to death in sleep and slit her throat. She died of profuse bleeding later,” said the official. Bheel kept roaming around the entire night and surrendered at the Luni police station on Monday morning admitting to the police that he killed his wife.

---||Chennai||Raw deal: Tamil Nadu got only 50% of doses despite more cases||Chennai: Tamil Nadu received half the number of Covid-19 vaccine doses that three other states with similar populations did, data released by the Union health ministry show. With a population of 7.6 crore, Tamil Nadu received 72 lakh doses of the vaccine until May 7, according to a central government press release. Rajasthan with 7.8 crore population got 1.4 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat with 6.9 crore population received 1.3 crore doses and Karnataka with 6.6 crore population received more than 1 crore doses. While Tamil Nadu had used up 65.9 lakh (91%) of the vaccines allotted, the consumption was between 95 and 99 among the other three states. “It is a very raw deal,” said a senior health department official. “We have been fighting with the Centre for everything from oxygen to drugs,” he said. After presenting its case before the Madras high court for enhancement of oxygen supply, the state is now lobbying with the Centre for increase in allocation of anti-viral remdesivir. On Monday, chief minister M K Stalin urged Union minister Piyush Goyal to increase the allocation of remdesivir for Tamil Nadu to 20,000 vials a day. Across the country, of the 17.35 crore vaccine doses that the Centre had provided to states/UTs, the total consumption on May 7 (including wastage) was 16.7 crore doses. Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported fewer Covid-19 cases compared to Tamil Nadu. Rajasthan has a case tally of 7.7 lakh and Gujarat has reported 6.7 lakh cases, compared to more than 19 lakh in Karnataka and more than 15 lakh in Tamil Nadu. Public health experts and hospitals said that in January when the vaccination drive was launched cases were low and there wasn’t adequate information about the vaccine. So many people, including healthcare providers, did not get vaccinated. As the effectiveness of the vaccine became clear from scientific studies, cases were spiralling. “So, people went in for vaccination. Unfortunately, by then the supply dwindled too,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. On Monday morning, the state announced that at least 73% of its health care providers and 88% of its frontline workers have taken the first dose of the vaccine. Nevertheless, nearly two out of five healthcare providers and three out of five frontline workers who took the first jab did not return for the second. While more than 16 lakh senior citizens are partially vaccinated only 5.7 lakh have taken the second dose. Similarly, only 5.2 lakh people of the 13.9 lakh people above 45 years (with comorbidities) have taken the vaccine. Joint secretary immunisation Dr K Vinay said the state revised strategies by reducing vaccination centres as the supply came down. “We limited Covaxin only to those who had taken the first shot. Centres that had poor attendance were shut even if it meant that people had to travel longer for the vaccine,” he said. Over time, the wastage of vaccine came to near 4% from more than 12% two week ago. “This is because more people went to vaccine centres now. We are trying to make judicious use of the vaccine. The state programme of free vaccine for everyone above 18 years has been postponed,” he said.

While this facility kicked off in Uttar Pradesh three days ago, the service by retired Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) personnel has been extended to Rajasthan based on good response. E-Sanjeevani OPD is a central flagship telemedicine platform developed by the Centre for Development of Advance Computing (C-DAC), Mohali, under the aegis of the ministery of health and family welfare. It provides free consultations to any Indian citizen. However, with Covid cases surging, the demand for doctors has gone up while the supply has reduced due to doctors being pulled out for Covid ward duties. This is where the defence veterans are stepping in to help, said officials. The medical branch of HQ Integrated Defence Staff is providing telemedicine service for the serving and retired defence personnel and has coordinated with MoHFW and NIC to roll out this ex-defence OPD for civilian patients. “There has been a good response from retired defence doctors and more are expected to join soon. Subsequently, a separate Nationwide Ex-Defence Doctors OPD is envisaged. Their vast experience and expertise will help the larger clientele to obtain consultation from their homes and tide over the crisis,” said an official. Apart from this, the Indian Air Force (IAF) airlifted two empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Jodhpur to Jamnagar on Sunday. While empty tankers are being flown in the C-17 aircraft, the filled ones are being brought via road as liquid oxygen cannot be flown. The IAF has ordered 24x7 readiness of the entire heavy lift fleet and substantial numbers of the medium lift fleets to operate in a hub and spoke model. Presently eight C-17, four IL-76, eight C130, 20 AN-32, 10 DO-228 Dornier aircraft and 20 helicopters have been tasked for Covid duty. Aircrew for all fleets have been augmented to ensure round-the-clock operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/retired-defence-docs-to-provide-online-consultation/articleshow/82535456.cms||---

Targeting the Centre, the editorial said that the second wave of Covid-19 has spread across the country. But BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis hit back terming the allegations “a blatant lie, again and again” and said the Centre itself, through the solicitor general, had suggested constituting the national task force. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-shiv-sena-taunts-centre-on-sc-move-to-set-up-o2-task-force-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/82535474.cms||---

On Sunday, the state had seen 17,921 new cases. However, the number of deaths stood at 160 and active cases reached 2,03,017 in the state. Some 13,499 people were discharged from various hospitals and ICU availability remained a problem. Following complaints, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas has been visiting private hospitals to ensure that they do not deny admission to any patient and charge them only as per government guidelines. Nearly after a fortnight, Jaipur saw its daily infections below 3,000 after it had even crossed the 4,000 mark a few times. As per data released by the health department, the city reported 2,918 cases.

Empty tankers from Bellary in Karnataka, expected to bring liquid oxygen from Tata Steel plant in Kalinganagar, Odisha, may reach the plant only late Monday night or Tuesday morning. The daily oxygen need in the state has jumped to 635MT per day. On an average, the government is supplying 350-370MT of liquid oxygen daily to districts. “Three LNG tankers reached here from Jaipur on Monday. Each one of them has a capacity to carry 18MT of liquid oxygen. We will fill and send them by Monday night. This will be the first batch of tankers going to Rajasthan from West Bengal. I am hopeful that the tankers will reach Rajasthan in 48 hours,” said Sushmit Biswas (IPS), who is in-charge of managing supply of liquid oxygen from Burnpur. “In order to ensure smooth passage of tankers, the state government has provided police escort, including two assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) and constables. We will also monitor the location of tankers through GPS,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tankers-bringing-54mt-liquidoxy-from-bengal-leave-for-state/articleshow/82535490.cms||---

The Mumbai police recently received a notification from National Institute of Public Health Training and Research (NIPHTR) for around 300 policemen who will undergo special training to deal with medical emergencies.  The NIPHTR is a central government organisation which comes under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and provides educational courses. These 300 cops who will be called `super savers’ will be deployed all over Mumbai to help tackle medical emergencies, particularly relating to the Covid-19 situation in the city. The Mumbai Police commissioner’s office has asked all senior inspectors to send names of at least two cops, including one of police inspector rank. “We have asked for the list of cops... NIPHTR will provide training online on how to manage Covidemergencies,” said deputy commissioner of police (PRO) S Chaitanya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-med-training-for-police-to-help-in-covid-emergencies/articleshow/82535492.cms||S Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||As pandemic hits desilting, corpns say they will speed up activity soon||New Delhi: The pandemic crisis has delayed the desilting exercise that is supposed to be over by May-end or mid-June before the onset of monsoon. This year, due to the delay in issuing tenders, non-availability of labourers and increasing cases of Covid-19, the municipal corporations have been going at a slow pace. The ongoing lockdown has also delayed interdepartmental meetings at the state and municipal levels to check the status of desilting work, identifying and resolving problems at waterlogging points, and ensuring coordination among the departments, admitted several councillors. The work with big machines will pick up pace and transportation of silt will be done simultaneously as soon as the situation normalises to avoid waterlogging and breeding of mosquitoes, officials claimed. A recent report of North Delhi Municipal Corporation suggested that 29% of the desilting work had been completed by May 6. The corporation has 192 big drains and it has targeted to remove 10,000 tonne silt. So far, 3,400 tonne has been removed and 2,800 tonne sent to the sanitary landfill site. “Finding labourers has become difficult for contractors. Due to the lockdown, many migrant labourers have left for their hometown and the rest fear for their lives. Our staff members have also been engaged for multiple works,” said mayor Jai Prakash. In east Delhi, 13% of the work is over. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said that out of the 46,000 tonne silt to be taken out from drains more than 4 feet deep, 6,000 tonne had been removed. “But the remaining work has got delayed due to the Covid crisis. We will issue work orders by May 14 and expect to complete our target by June.” The super sucker machines are already working at big drains and all 21 pumping stations and sump wells have been repaired or checked, Jain added. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has also shifted the date for completing the work from May 31 to June 15. There are 269 big drains in its jurisdiction. “We have completed 35% desilting and there is a target to lift 25,900 tonnes of silt. We expect to speed up the process soon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-pandemic-hits-desilting-corpns-say-they-will-speed-up-activity-soon/articleshow/82535501.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: RTI activist, sons held, accused of cheating banks over property loan||GURUGRAM: Harinder Dhingra, a man often in the news for his right to information pleas on corruption in public offices, was arrested along with his two sons on Monday in a cheating case. Dhingra and his family members are accused of defrauding two banks of several crores through loan against property. Dhingra’s wife, daughter-in-law and grandson were issued notices by police to join the investigation. Police said they received a complaint on April 16, and after investigating it, filed an FIR against Dhingra, his wife Poonam, their sons Prashant and Tarun, daughter-in-law Tani and grandson at DLF-1 police station on Monday. The FIR has charges under sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468 and 471 (forgery), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. Police have formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the allegations. The complainant is Tarun Bateja, a Malibu Town resident. Bateja’s connection with the case remained unclear. The case centres around the Dhingras’ house, built on a 500 square yard plot, in DLF-1. Police said Dhingra bought the property in 2001 and in 2003, Poonam and Prashant – through their company Elegance Fabrics Pvt Ltd – took a loan from Indian Overseas Bank against the property. In 2004, the loan of around Rs 3 crore was declared an NPA by the bank, which filed a case before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Delhi and filed for attachment of property. “To save the property from attachment, Prashant filed a case before court to seek claim over the property. In November 2006, they reached a compromise at Lok Adalat and transferred the property in the name of Prashant. Now, the bank could not attach the property as ownership was changed,” said ACP (DLF) Karan Goel. In 2007, Prashant mortgaged the property with OBC Bank for a loan of Rs 8 crore for his firm Tarun Exports. This loan also became an NPA in 2008. OBC Bank issued notice for recovery of Rs 10 crore (loan and interest) and filed a case at DRT Chandigarh and also filed for attachment of the property, police said. This time, Tarun filed a case before Gurgaon court, challenging the Lok Adalat decision of 2006 and staking claim over the property. The court stayed the 2006 order of the Lok Adalat. The case reached the Punjab and Haryana high court in February 2016. Police claimed Dhingra, in the meantime, forged documents to transfer the property to his Tarun and Prashant’s son in December 2016. “All of them live in the same house and keep on transferring property in each other’s name after taking loan from banks,” said the ACP. Before his arrest, Dhingra told TOI, “The case is baseless and matters related to loans are pending before court. I had raised issues against the police chief and a case was filed against me as vendetta,” said Dhingra. In a statement, police said Dhingra claimed to be an RTI activist, but he and some others misused the RTI Act to extort money from government officials and builders. The police statement also alleged Dhingra and an associate had encroached over prime land in DLF, which the cops had removed.  It urged people to share information and documents about Dhingra and his associates with the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rti-activist-sons-held-accused-of-cheating-banks-over-property-loan/articleshow/82535513.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Muslims skip Eid shopping to help needy||MUMBAI: With the city plunged in gloom and despair, many Muslims are foregoing Eid shopping and directing the funds to charity. Though Eid, one of the most important Muslim festivals, is just a few days away (May 13 or 14), there is no buzz around festivities as community leaders and volunteers are engaged in reaching out to people with oxygen cylinders, medicines, hospital beds and Eid ration. “Eid doesn’t mean flaunting clothes and fine cuisine. It is a festival to share joy but since we are reeling under the assault of a pandemic, this Eid should be an occasion to help the needy,” said Iqbal Memon Officer, president, All India Memon Jamaat Federation, an umbrella organisation of 500 Memon jamaats. “Don’t spend much on buying clothes. Pay school fees of poor children, buy oxygen cylinders and pay hospital bills of poor patients battling Covid,” said Officer in an audio message which has gone viral. Haji Mudassar Patel, vice-chairman, City Congress (minority department), was busy for a substantial part of Ramzan in distributing ration and Ramzan packets to those in need. “We are passing through one of the toughest times in our country’s history. Lockdown has already made the poor more vulnerable. Eid should bring a smile to the faces of those who have lost businesses or jobs,” said Patel who, along with former ministers Baba Siddiqui and Arif Naseem Khan, reached out to hundreds of the impoverished with ration and food kits. “Don’t shop for Eid, help the needy,” he urged too. Haj and Umrah Tour operator Imran Alvi said that his family has not shopped for Eid, both last year and this year, because “there is no meaning in celebrations when there are deaths in the family or extended family.” “How can we celebrate when people around us are dying? We have to do everything that we can to help people fight the dreaded Coronavirus,” he said. Since congregational prayers are banned, not many will visit mosques to offer the Eid namaz in the city. And most homes will skip hosting lavish Eid parties. “The sky will not fall if we just eat sheer khurma and a few other dishes, instead of preparing a dozen dishes,” said Officer, who also supported the idea of giving more fitra (a charity done before the Eid namaz) than mandated (a few kg grains or the equivalent in money per person).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-muslims-skip-eid-shopping-to-help-needy/articleshow/82535515.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Additional commissioner of state tax, Sarita Gadgil has been appointed as the nodal authority to oversee exemptions in IGST and customs for Covid-19 relief that is meant for the Goa government or any entity, relief agency or statutory body authorised to undertake relief. The Union ministry of finance has exempted oxygen concentrators, ventilators, non-invasive oxygen masks, Covid-19 medicines, testing kits and other goods from paying integrated tax when imported into India as humanitarian relief. “In order to ensure smooth implementation of the exemption, Sarita Gadgil, additional commissioner of state tax-I is hereby appointed as the nodal authority for Goa, to ensure compliance of conditions,” said commissioner of state tax Hemant Kumar. The nodal officer would issue the authorisation certificate for import of Covid relief items after verification of certificate of registration of the organisation, invoice or purchase bill, cargo details and declaration of the donor. The Centre’s order says that “before clearance of the goods, the importer produces to the deputy or assistant commissioner of customs, as the case may be, a certificate from a nodal authority, appointed by a state government, that the imported goods are meant for free distribution for Covid relief. Several companies and volunteer groups are assisting the state government with Covid-19 relief material with one organisation even starting an international crowdfunding initiative to purchase oxygen concentrators.

---||Delhi||...Students, auto unions run three-wheeler ambulances||New Delhi: Raju, who owns and drives an autorickshaw, has been on a mission for the past two days. Wanting to ensure that people faced no difficulties in reaching the hospital, the 34-year-old turned his three-wheeler into an ambulance. For now, with the limited fund for the initiative of left student organisations and trade unions, Raju’s is only one of the two auto ambulances in operation, each equipped with an oxygen cylinder. Since Saturday, the three-wheeler ambulances — one each in South and North districts — are being run jointly by All India Students Association (AISA), AICCTU, Revolutionary Youth Association and CPI(ML). Said N Sai Balaji, national president, AISA: “Our left trade unions are collaborating with the auto drivers. To protect the auto drivers, we are providing them minimum wages along with a PPE kit, hand sanitiser and basic first aid kit. Depending on the funds, we will launch more ambulances in all the districts.” Raju, in North district, said, “Even otherwise, I was helping people affected by Covid and was available to them 24x7. When I learnt of the left organisations creating autorickshaw ambulances, I volunteered. In times like these, one should not refuse to help even an enemy.” Raju has made five trips to the hospitals so far. Surya Prakash mans the helpline to book the auto ambulance service in the North district. “We have been getting many calls, but most have been about taking bodies to the cremation grounds,” said Prakash. “There are also people who urgently need to convey non-Covid patients to emergency hospital care and are finding it difficult to get an ambulance or are deterred by the exorbitant rates being quoted. We have also received enquiries about dropping patients to faraway places like Jhajjar and Sonipat. But we have not been able to provide long-distance services.” Balaji claimed that many people are calling to ask if the auto ambulance service was working because they wanted to volunteer their services for the initiative. “Yes, the service is in operation,” said Balaji. “We wish mainly to cater to the working class because so many in that class are infected or have lost their livelihoods. Doctors who are doing their PhDs at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s community health medicine school are assisting us and providing patients with consultations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-students-auto-unions-run-three-wheeler-ambulances/articleshow/82535539.cms||Shradha Chettri

The meeting, which lasted for an hour, was described as a courtesy call. Patel is the second NCP leader to pay a courtesy visit to Raj Bhavan. Last week, Supriya Sule had personally called on the governor and that visit, too was described as a courtesy visit. In corridors of power, it is well known that Pawar is at loggerheads with the governor, particularly over the prolonged delay in clearing nominations of 12 persons on the legislative council as nominees of the governor. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government had submitted the list to Raj Bhavan on November 6, 2020. The CM was expecting that it will be cleared within a week or fortnight.

---||Business||During pandemic, visitors from India topped overseas arrivals in the US||NEW DELHI: Visitors from India have been the largest overseas arrivals in the US during the pandemic. Data from the US department of commerce’s National Travel and Trade Office (NTTO) for the period February 2020-February 2021 shows visitors from India topped the list on both its overseas “arrival monitors” — one based on country of citizenship and the other on country of residence. US had 17.5 lakh international visitors from February 2020 to February 2021 — 9.9 lakh from Mexico; 6.1 lakh from overseas and 1.4 lakh from Canada. This is down 84% from almost 1.1 crore in same period of the pre-pandemic pervious year, shows NTTO data. Canada and Mexico share land border with the US. India topped the list in the overseas source market categories. India was among the top 10-12 source markets for US in the few years before Covid with numbers growing rapidly from here. Based on the country of residence of visitors, Indians topped the list at 65,077 in February 2020-2021, followed by Colombia (56,367); Dominican Republic (32,001); Argentina (30,610) and Chile (27,634), according to data released by the US department of commerce’s National Travel and Trade Office (NTTO). Even this February, the “I-94 visitor arrivals monitor, based on country of residence (COR)”, shows India at the top with 24,332 visitors from here. NTTO’s other arrival monitor is based on “country of citizenship.” Data for this shows India at the top in February 2020-2021 period 67,426 visitors, followed by Colombia (55,856); Dominican Republic (31,057); Argentina (28,183) and Chile (26,253). While from May 4, 2021, America has restricted travellers from India, with some exceptions like US citizens and residents, due to the rapid spreading Coronavirus mutant here, the pandemic has seen strong travel between the two countries — first with Vande Bharat Mission and later under India-US air bubble. This is thanks largely to the size of the Indian diaspora in the US estimated to be over 27 lakh. So large is the India-US travel market that the US last year told India, Air India flights would be allowed on a case-to-case basis unless American airlines were also allowed to carry passengers between the two countries under the air bubble. India allowed that and after that both AI and United have been increasing their flights. Air India and United have a number of nonstops while one-stop connections are available to some categories of travellers like US citizens and green card holders via Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Doha. Vistara is planning to start US nonstops later this year. “Once the travel restriction is lifted by US when — and hopefully soon the Covid situation in India improves — India-US will be among the most vibrant travel markets for airlines. In fact AI’s huge presence in the US, thanks to its popular nonstops, is seen as a big strength in the divestment bid,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/during-pandemic-visitors-from-india-topped-overseas-arrivals-in-the-us/articleshow/82535530.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Mumbai||BMC plans global tender to buy 1.5 crore vax doses||MUMBAI: The BMC plans to float a global tender for procurement of 50 lakh vaccines in a bid to speed up its vaccination drive. The erratic supply of doses has slowed down immunisation in Mumbai, affecting potential beneficiaries of first as well as second shots. BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told TOI he has received a go-ahead from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to procure stocks for the country’s financial capital. Chahal said the authorities are open to a deal with any approved vaccine manufacturer that comes forward. Apart from Covaxin and Covishield, the civic body will consider Sputnik V, which was developed in Russia and accorded emergency use authorisation in India. It will also consider vaccines developed by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. “We want to initially only test the waters and see and hence will be floating a tender for 50 lakh vaccines by the end of the week. The process should take 3-4 weeks,” said Chahal, adding that there is a need to procure vaccines considering that supply from the Centre has thinned. BMC’s decision to float a tender to purchase vaccines may seem at odds with the state’s own plans, but Chahal said Mumbai's needs being less, chances of getting a quicker response from manufacturers were higher. While the state may seek supplies of up to four crore doses, the BMC chief said Mumbai could do with 1.5 crore doses to ensure vaccination for all. More than 25 lakh doses have so far been given in the metropolis so far to various sections including healthcare workers, senior citizens and others in the 45-60 age group. Cabinet Minister Aaditya Thackeray took to Twitter on Monday to make the same point. “Looking at the need for adequate vaccines to ensure that vaccination is swift and efficient, after discussing the issue with CM Uddhav Thackeray ji, as guardian minister of Mumbai, we have asked @mybmc to explore possibilities of global procurement of vaccines,” tweeted Thackeray. Shiv Sena leader in BMC Vishakha Raut said it was a welcome move. “BMC has the required funds and should not hesitate from procuring vaccines if they can at their level. Many are still awaiting the second dose of Covaxin. Something needs to be urgently done for them," she said. Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi MLA and corporator, said it was time the BMC found ways to ensure every Mumbaikar is vaccinated as soon as possible. "With BMC being the richest civic body, why should funds not be spent in a way that Mumbaikars would benefit out of it. Even the poor should be vaccinated at the earliest," he said. Ravi Raja, Congress leader in the BMC, said the vaccines need to be administered free. “The commissioner in a discussion with group leaders on Monday has ensured that vaccines would be free at civic centres while those going to private centres would need to pay,” said Raja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-plans-global-tender-to-buy-1-5-cr-vax-doses/articleshow/82535567.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||How this close-knit Delhi village is keeping deaths at bay||NEW DELHI: With Delhi’s health care facilities overwhelmed by the resurgent Covid-19 coronavirus, the small village of Nangal Thakran located in northwest Delhi’s Bawana is showing the way forward. The young volunteers led by a doctor are not only helping patients to receive the right medical counselling and medication, but also developing common resources such as oxygen cylinders and free ambulance service for the use of the village. Myths and ignorance are also being busted through awareness drives. Farmer Ravindra Thakran, a core committee member of the project and a former sports teacher, said that while the group was engaged in social causes for two years, it decided to bolster the anti-Covid arrangements in the village seeing how the official system appeared unable to manage the new wave of infections. “In April, we created this WhatsApp group with volunteers from each lane and people from nearby villages,” said Ravindra. “Dr Vikas Thakran, a cardiologist and originally a resident of the village, guides us.” From creating awareness about the disease to reporting individuals exhibiting Covid symptoms, the platform is a crucial cog in coordinating the project. “In the beginning, being infected meant remaining secretive. But now, aware that treatment is possible and help is accessible, people come forward on their own to report symptoms,” disclosed Ravindra. A pool of 8-9 oxygen cylinders — many of them donated by the villagers — and 100 oximeters are now available alongside a free ambulance to take critical patients to hospital. Dr Vikas Thakran said that he started the initiative when he found a patient who had approached had alarmingly low oxygen levels. “We started by creating the WhatsApp group. It is essentially a triage at the village level. We monitor the markers, medical treatment based on symptoms and determine early enough whether a patient requires hospitalisation,” explained the cardiologist. There are 50 active cases in the village with a population of 6,000. A tricycle mounted with a loudspeaker system goes around spreading awareness. Pamphlets in simple language instruct the residents on the steps to follow each day after the onset of symptoms. “These are instructions from AIIMS that have been simplified,” said Vikas. Villagers and people who have migrated out to other countries have also been donating to keep the collective effort going. Besides his duties in two hospitals, Vikas spends a large part of his day on consultations with village patients and studying their medical reports. “We don’t want to leave the infection unattended to the point the patient requires oxygen support,” said the doctor. “The emphasis is on early treatment based on markers and symptoms.”  His efforts are helped by the fact that the close-knit village community is like a family where everyone is prepared to help the other. The volunteers have specific talents. A plumber and an AC repair mechanic have the skill to help with oxygen cylinders.  Two male nurses, Akash Verma and Sandeep Thakran, both village residents, help the people isolated at home after they get over their 10-12-hour shifts in hospital. Members like Ravindra and Hoshiar Singh help with logistics. Singh, a municipal corporation sanitary inspector, said, “We help procure medicines, provide daily essentials and get the oxygen cylinders refilled. Three volunteers contracted the infection, but others kept working and the situation has improved. There have been just two deaths in the village.” And then, as Ravi Jain pointed out, there is also some innovation. “Some of the donated empty cylinders were meant for industrial use and we did not have flow meters,” narrated Jain. “So, we took a glucose sipper from a local akhada and modified it into a gas-flow control device.” Paras Tyagi, who runs an NGO on rural issues, said Nangal Thakran is a model for others. “Both the central and state governments are engaged in a blame game, but Nangal Thakran village has shown what the villages forming the core of India are capable of under the guidance of professionals,” Tyagi pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yes-we-can-how-this-close-knit-village-is-keeping-deaths-at-bay/articleshow/82535574.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra lockdown likely to extend till May-end||MUMBAI: The lockdown-like restrictions, currently imposed in the state till May 15, are likely to be extended till month end. Officials say that even though Covid-19 cases in many districts, including Mumbai and Pune city are showing a decline, daily cases in the state have plateaued, but are not decreasing. A senior cabinet minister said that with Covid-19 cases declining in many parts of the state, there is a demand from several quarters for relaxations, but the state government is not likely to extend relief anytime sooon. The minister said that it is most likely that the state government will extend the ongoing restrictions till the end of the month. “Nearly 12 districts are showing a decline in cases, but that is just one-third of the state; the remaining two-thirds is either stable or is reporting an increase. Opening up would lead to a surge again,” said the minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Last week, state health minister Rajesh Tope had said that Maharashtra’s positivity rate for Covid-19, an important indicator in gauging the spread of viral infection, has not come down significantly, despite the number of tests being scaled up. A senior official said that relaxation in restrictions will only be given when the cases are under control. However, the issue will be discussed at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday and a final decision will be taken then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-lockdown-likely-to-extend-till-may-end/articleshow/82535580.cms||---

Covid positive cases are rising in the state and just like other health centres, frontline workers of Siolim PHC are trying their best to fight the pandemic. The medical staff and equipment at the current health centre are insufficient to cater to the patients. Around 100 to 150 patients are being tested for Covid-19 at a special testing centre on a daily basis, and in addition, many infected people as well as those in home isolation come for treatment at the health centre regularly, and this has put an additional burden on the existing infrastructure of the health centre. On Monday, Paliencar, along with the health officer of Siolim PHC, Sadhana Shetye, reviewed the Covid scenario in his constituency and directed health authorities to immediately provide home isolation kits to Covid positive patients. They also inspected the Covid testing centre and assured the authorities that the necessary supply of medicines and kits would be provided for the convenience of the patients. The local MLA also appealed to locals over age of 45 years to get vaccinated without any apprehension.

---||Chandigarh||Sexual exploitation case moral defeat for farm leaders: BJP Punjab chief Ashwani Sharma||Chandigarh: BJP Punjab president Ashwani Sharma on Monday said the demise of a woman who was allegedly sexually exploited at the farmers protest on Tikri border by fellow activists from Bengal, was a moral defeat for the leaders of farmers’ agitation. Sharma said it was surprising that though the girl fell ill on April 24, she was taken to hospital on April 26, when her condition deteriorated. “Why was she not taken for help on time and what moral ethics these leaders have to lead the people? They are exploiting the innocent,” he said. He added it was only when the woman was taken to hospital that it was determined she had been sexually exploited and she succumbed on April 30. Sharma said government agencies had been stressing that in the garb of farmers’ agitation, a segment of anti-social elements were working to destroy the fabric of society. He said Bahadurgarh police have registered an FIR on a statement by the woman’s father. Leaders booked in the FIR are Anup Singh, Anil Malik, Ankush Sagwan and Jagdish Singh Brar besides two women, said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sexual-exploitation-case-moral-defeat-for-farm-leaders-bjp-punjab-chief/articleshow/82535600.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Less than 1% of Maharashtra’s 18-44 age group have received shots so far||MUMBAI: Around 5lakh in the age bracket of 18-44 years have got vaccinated in the 10 days since the drive began in the state on May 1. Constraints in securing online appointments and limited supplies have combined to ensure that less than 1% (0.87%) of the estimated 5.71 crore population in this category could be covered so far. In Mumbai, less than 30,000 have managed to get the vaccine out of the estimated population of 55lakh, a little over 0.54%. Experts are questioning the strategy of vaccinating a meagre 50,000 people from this age group daily as this may have little impact on disease severity or mortality. The state is keen to push for sequential vaccination—giving priority to the 35-44 years group or those with comorbidities—but this plan cannot be implemented till changes are incorporated in the Co-Win app used for booking vaccine appointments, officials said. Maharashtra has so far purchased over 10 lakh vaccines for the 18-44 group and have been assured of another 10 lakh later this month. The latest consignment of 3.5lakh Covishield doses procured by the state arrived on Sunday. A civic official said, “We were not keen on starting the drive for 18-44 on May 1 since vaccinating just 1,000 in a day would be resource intensive and cover very little”. But the official added that from five centres they have now doubled the reach for this group, including two private hospitals (HN Reliance and Nanavati). On Monday, 4,837 in the 18-44 group took the vaccine, the highest daily turnout so far. “Even though numbers are rising daily, it’s a drop in the ocean,” the official said, adding that the drive is a logistical nightmare for staffers who have to balance stocks from state and Centre and simultaneously manage online and offline appointments. A vaccination centre in-charge said this leg of the immunisation drive should have been started only when enough doses were available rather than spreading it thin. Amravati civic surgeon Dr Shyamsunder Nikam said the district vaccinates only around 200 from 18-44 but slots get booked in 2-3 minutes. “Locals from areas like Melghat are struggling to book appointments due to poor internet coverage,” he said, adding that in the rural centres 50%-60% of the vaccines doses have been taken by people from nearby cities. Vaccination expert Dr Naveen Thacker said in Gujarat, vaccination for 18-44 has only been started in six corporations and three districts that have high case burden rather than spreading the doses thin across the state. The drive for the 45-plus group too is faltering due to shortage of vaccines meant to be supplied by the Centre. At least 5lakh people are waiting for the second dose of Covaxin and multiple times of that number are waiting for Covishield. An officer from Kolhapur , which has vaccinated 57% of its 45-plus population said the appointment-only method has slowed down pace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/less-than-1-of-maharashtras-18-44-age-group-have-received-shots-so-far/articleshow/82535610.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||For those under 45, BMC mulls an ‘emergency’ walk-in quota||MUMBAI: No Covaxin doses were administered in the city on Sunday and Monday. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said even for Tuesday, there were very limited doses. The BMC, which announces the opening of online slots for 45-plus on Twitter, didn’t notify anything till midnight. For 18-44, the slots opened after 9 pm and were filled up in less than 2 hours. Meanwhile, the BMC is having discussions to write to the Centre to allow walk-ins for a small percentage of recipients for the age bracket of 18-44. An official said that they were toying with the idea of asking for 5%-10% walk-ins that can be used by those in an emergency. “Say some student wants to go abroad for studies and needs a dose urgently, such a provision could be helpful,” the official said. AMC Suresh Kakani said they were holding internal discussions, and a decision would be taken in a few days. After a dip to 19,631 on Saturday, the city’s vaccination turnout increased to 31,043 on Monday. Vaccination had dropped to 1,10,448 in the state on Saturday from an average of 2.5-3 lakh vaccinations in the past week. A state official said with the 7 lakh doses received on Sunday, the state’s drive could continue for three days. In Mumbai though, many centres said footfall has dropped partly due to shortage of doses but also because of the issues around online appointment bookings. Kamothe resident Sumeet Vaishnav (42) had an appointment at BKC centre on Saturday. But on reaching there and standing in queue, he was told vaccines were over. “We were given a chit and asked to come on Monday. We again travelled but were refused entry with a fresh appointment,” he said. Dr Gomare said centres have been directed to fix a quota so all doses are not exhausted for healthcare workers and frontline workers walking in. A centre in-charge, however, said that may create chaos again as people may have to be turned away. At the centre started at Gokuldham maternity home in Goregaon, BJP corporator Priti Satam alleged fewer than 200 people are getting shots. “Till last week, BMC was vaccinating 400 people daily, now numbers have dropped as people are unable to book a slot online,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-those-under-45-bmc-mulls-an-emergency-walk-in-quota/articleshow/82535694.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The move, aimed at reducing the Covid-19 mortality rate, will help in detecting severity of cases based on information provided by patients. For Pernem, the centres has been set up at the Government College of Arts and Commerce; for Tiswadi, at the office of the directorate of art and culture, Panaji; for Sattari, at the Industrial Training Institute; and for Bicholim, at the Santadurga Higher Secondary School. A senior government official said that each call center has 30 personnel trained by doctors of the district health services (DHS) and deputed to source updates from patients under home isolation. The representative will call each patient and record information on basic parameters, SPO2 level and symptoms the patient may be having. The format for the same has already been provided by DHS. Later, data obtained from patients who are in home isolation will be uploaded on a portal developed by DHS. This data analysis will be carried out in order to ascertain the severity of the symptoms and classify patients into the category of red zone. Based on inputs received from DHS, patients will either be told to get themselves admitted into a Covid hospital or act as per the advice of DHS doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-sets-up-call-centres-to-keep-track-of-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82535719.cms||---

At the Hindon air base in Ghaziabad, NDRF personnel are also helping ferry equipment to different parts of the country. Three oxygen generating plants from Israel reached the air base on Saturday. Naresh Chauhan, NDRF inspector, said his team has been tasked with unloading heavy machines from aircraft and ferrying them safely to locations where an oxygen generating plant is being set up. “We are also giving full support to technicians to install oxygen plants at different hospitals. A team of 50 personnel are involved in this work,” he said. In fact, NDRF’s Ghaziabad team has recently set up four oxygen plants in Delhi-NCR. “Two plants from Italy and Ireland have successfully been set up at a hospital in Greater Noida run by ITBP and at ESIC hospital in Faridabad, respectively. The third one from Germany has been set up at DRDO hospital in Delhi,” he said. On May 5, India received an oxygen plant from the US as medical aid, which was to be set up at ESIC Hospital Okhla in Delhi first. “But later authorities decided to set it up at ESIC Hospital Jhilmil in Delhi. On May 9, tour personnel helped set up the plant. The plant has a capacity to produce 200 litres of oxygen per minute, which is sufficient for a 40-bed hospital,” Chauhan said. Similarly, on Sunday, the NDRF team transported two oxygen plants from Delhi’s IGI Airport to Ajmer and Jhalawar of Rajasthan, respectively. “Oxygen generating plants are also being sent to Karnataka, Mysore, Rajasthan, Varanasi and other parts of the country. These machines are being delivered by road or air and the NDRF is ensuring fast and safe delivery of these machines,” a senior officer of NDRF 8th battalion said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ndrf-pitches-in-to-set-up-o2-plants-that-come-from-abroad/articleshow/82535725.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

Isolation wards will be set up in villages through these funds and other necessary items associated with Covid treatment, such as oximeters, steam machines, thermometers and blood pressure monitoring machines will be arranged. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala shared this information on Monday after presiding over a meeting with officers of the panchayat department. Expressing concern over Covid spread in villages, Chautala said 8,000 teams are being formed by the state government to increase Covid testing in rural areas. According to him, it is mandatory to set up Covid treatment facilities in villages to curb Covid infection in rural areas, for which the state government would provide funds to panchayats immediately. Dushyant said the government would allocate funds of Rs 30,000 to all villages having population of less than 10,000 and Rs 50,000 for those with more than 10,000 population. He said Covid isolation centres would be built in chaupals, government schools and Anganwadi centres of villages. The deputy CM said a team would be formed to operate these centres. The teams would include health staff (ANM), anganwadi workers and gram panchayat representatives. The teams would be monitored by in-charge of CHC and PHC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-govt-to-release-funds-to-counter-covid-spread-in-villages-dy-cm/articleshow/82535730.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC to conduct oxygen audit of its own hospitals to cut wastage||MUMBAI: The BMC has decided to conduct an oxygen audit of all its hospitals in the city to ensure there is no wastage of the life-saving gas. Civic officials said the audit will help know exactly how much oxygen is required per patient at each hospital to prevent emergencies due to shortage. “We are going through previous oxygen audit reports of a few bigger institutions. We will soon finalise the methodology and do an oxygen audit of all civic hospitals,” additional municipal commissioner (Projects) P Velrasu said. “We have a meeting with Dr Prashanth Narnaware, in-charge of oxygen audit in the state, on Tuesday,” he added. BMC officials said out of the 240 metric tonnes of oxygen that Mumbai requires each day, 170-180 metric tonnes is used from oxygen tanks installed at major hospitals. The remaining 60 metric tonnes is supplied through jumbo and dura cylinders that are refilled at the two plants located in Navi Mumbai. “Around 15,000-17,000 patients need oxygen support every day. ICU patients need around 25 litres per minute, while those on oxygenated beds need about 10 litres per minute. So, understanding the requirements for the whole of Mumbai, a detailed micro-planning is essential for successful oxygen management,” said Velrasu, who had played a key role in setting up ‘oxygen teams’ to tackle the shortage in the city in May 2020. Civic officials said that due to the shortage in hospitals, the state government had fixed the oxygen quota for each district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-conduct-oxygen-audit-of-its-own-hospitals-to-cut-wastage/articleshow/82535769.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||After HC nudge, Maharashtra sets up grievance panels to settle MPJAY claims||AURANGABAD: After a rap from the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, the state government has formed grievance committees under the respective district collectors for securing and processing claims by eligible beneficiaries under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY) for Covid treatment. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan told TOI on Monday, “No eligible MPJAY beneficiary would be deprived of reimbursement towards Covid treatment. The beneficiaries are requested to submit their claims in a format prescribed by the district administration. We will scrutinise all such applications and ensure proper follow-up with the hospitals to get things done.” The next hearing of a PIL filed by Om Prakash Shete, the former head of CM’s Relief Fund, claiming that several needy Covid patients from BPL families were being denied the MPJAY benefits has been posted for June 22 by the HC. Shete had also attached affidavits by some of these beneficiaries along with his petition. “We hope and trust that the state of Maharashtra will take due care for implementation of the MPJAY scheme in its true letter and spirit and that not a single Covid patient below the poverty line and possessing all the necessary document is denied treatment or bed only on the grounds that he does not have the necessary financial capability,” the HC bench of Justices S V Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni said while hearing the PIL on May 7. “The state shall also further state the outcome of the show cause notice issued to the hospital upon grievance of the persons not receiving treatment under the said scheme,” the bench said. The government had filed an affidavit in the court stating that 26,48,827 patients were provided treatment free of cost in Covid care centres across the state so far. It further said that apart from patients on ventilators, 20 packages have been identified wherein Covid-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms can avail treatment under MPJAY. However, the HC took note of around 20 to 25 affidavits suggesting that Covid-19 patients from BPL families were denied MPJAY benefits despite having all the necessary documents and were being charged huge amounts as bills by hospitals. It also took note of a submission that admissions were not given to these patients in the Covid dedicated hospitals recognised by the state government. The HC said that eligible beneficiaries denied benefits of the MPJAY can approach the grievance panels to seek redressal of their complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-after-hc-nudge-state-sets-up-grievance-panels-to-settle-mpjay-claims/articleshow/82535772.cms||Prasad Joshi

The University has also declared vacation for students and teaching staff of the varsity and affiliated institutes. “In view of the curfew, the university has decided to suspend the conduct of online classes for programmes offered at the campus and at also at its affiliated colleges from May 11 to 24, 2021,” registrar Radhika Nayak, has said in a circular issued on Monday.  This two week period will be considered as vacation for teachers and students, the circular states. “Non-vacation staff shall continue to work from home as per the directives of their respective directorates/institutions. Affiliated colleges offering professional programmes governed by statutory councils/bodies shall, however, continue to follow the guidelines/advisories of their respective councils if issued in this regards,” states the circular. Meanwhile, many college teachers have been summoned by the district collectors to carry out various kinds of Covid related work. The directives came even as online teaching sessions for college students were still on, as instructional days for the second semester are still in progress for general stream colleges up to June 5. College heads and teachers felt little regard was shown for academic schedule before the directives were issued. “Directives have been issued to state government department staff, which allows them to work at 50% capacity and on alternate days. These government staffers could have been used for Covid duty, instead it was chosen to summon teachers, whose teaching is in progress. Teachers from aided and government colleges have both been requisitioned, but a disproportionate number of teachers from government colleges are being utilized for the work,” said a college head.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/varsity-suspends-online-classes-during-curfew/articleshow/82535866.cms||---

---||Noida||Crowds and chaos mark first day of Covid vaccination for 18-44 age group in NCR||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The first day of vaccination of those between 18-44 years saw chaos, with most centres seeing large crowds, flouting of all Covid protocols and unpreparedness on the part of the administration. Both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar had assigned 16 centres for the drive. However, the crowds in most places were unmanageable for the health department, which had to call in police. Unlike the previous phases, spot registration is not allowed for this age bracket. But hundreds turned up at the centres, expecting walk-ins. Adding to the chaos was the lack of barricades and markers for people to follow social distancing norms. In Gautam Budh Nagar, reports of chaos started surfacing from the District Hospital in Sector 30 from 9.30am. Soon after the gates were opened, many descended inside the main hall. At other government centres in Noida and Greater Noida, the situation was no different. Kasna, Dadri, Hoshiyarpur, Barola, GIMS, Jewar, Bhangel and Bisrakh, were some other places where a large number of people were seen waiting. In Ghaziabad, crowds had gathered at many centres, including District Combined Hospital (DCH) and District Women Hospital (DWH) since morning. Many did not have prior registration and many others reached the centre before their allotted time slot, creating confusion. Officials said there were many people who had booked the time slot of 11 am but had arrived as early as 9am. At DWH, many were asked to go back, despite having registration. Later, the staff collected Aadhaar cards of people and asked them to wait. As people were not called according to the time slots, many had to wait for three-four hours to get the jabs. In Shastri Nagar, the crows was unmanageable and security personnel and health workers had a tough time pacifying people. At DCH, a major vaccination centre in the urban area where 413 people were vaccinated, including 219 in the 18-44 years category on Monday, the queue had stretched to the main gate from the vaccination centre. At the end of the day, against a target of 3,100, Ghaziabad was able to inoculate 2,338 people, registering a coverage of about 75.5%. Along with this, 1,179 people above 45 years and 909 above 60 years were inoculated at 23 centres. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the target was 2,800 and 2,603 people were vaccinated. Health department officials in G B Nagar said people who were not given slots were the ones who were turned away. “Many are vying to get vaccine without an appointment. Such people will be turned away,” said chief medical officer of the district, Deepak Kumar Ohri. DCH chief medical superintendent Sanjay Teotia said the management has decided to put up barricades from Tuesday and mark circles on the floor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/crowds-chaos-mark-18-44-vax-start-in-ncr/articleshow/82535907.cms||Shalabh
---||Lucknow||Covid leaves family in tatters: Teacherloses son & husband within a fortnight||Lucknow: Madhulika, a teacher at Topkhana branch of Kendriya Vidyalaya, had never thought in her wildest dreams that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will unleash its wrath on her family and leave her life in tatters. In a span of less than a fortnight, she lost her husband and her 18-year-old son to Covid-19. Shell-shocked by the tragedy, Madhulika, who was also in hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19, is being taken care of her college friend. It all began on April 13 when her husband, Ranjan, tested positive for Covid-19. He had been experiencing mild symptoms of the disease for a couple of days. He gave his sample for the test and by the time he got his report which came out to be positive, Madhulika and her son also started showing symptoms. By April 14, the entire family of three had Covid-19. While everything seemed manageable in the beginning, things took a drastic turn on April 16 when her husband’s oxygen started dipping with every passing minute. When the oxygen dipped to 80%, he was admitted to a private medical college on IIM Road. All this while, Madhulika struggled to arrange for her husband’s admission, manage her son at home and maintain her own vitals. The situation turned bad when her son’s oxygen level dipped to 90% and he had to be admitted to another private medical college in Sarfarazganj on April 19, his birthday. “As she too was unwell and wanted to be with her son, Madhulika also got admitted to the same medical college. On April 20, my wife got a one line text message from Madhulika which read that her husband Ranjan had passed away,” said Prof RB Singh, a faculty at Lucknow University’s physics department, whose wife Jyotsana Singh and Madhulika are close friends since 1989. Jyotsana is also a faculty at LU’s physics department. While friends tried to console and help Madhulika, her son’s condition started deteriorating by April 20 evening. He was transfused plasma, put on ventilator by April 26 but at 2am that night, an SOS call from the medical college to friends and family, broke down all who could help. “The hospital said the boy was in ICU and his condition was fragile. We did not know what to do. By 3am, news of her son’s death arrived. The mothe’s heart already knew something was wrong,” said Jyotsana, who is now tending to her lonely friend in her own house. Since the rest of Madhulika’s family was also Covid-19 positive and her aged mother was not told what had fallen on her daughter, Jyotsana and Prof RB Singh decided to bring Madhulika to their house. “We sent our nephew and children to village so that they could be safe. We brought her to our house. Leaving her alone was not an option for us,” said Prof Singh, who suffers from hypertension and diabetes. Ever since she was discharged, Madhulika hasn’t even bathed or had proper meals. “Even now, it is not like we have locked her up in a room. Jyotsana and my sister Jaya both sit for a couple of hours, talk to her and lend emotional support. She can’t be left alone with her thoughts. They take precautions inside the room but basic human interaction has to be done,” said Prof Singh. Madhulika’s condition is better and she tested negative this Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-leaves-family-in-tatters-teacherloses-son-husband-within-a-fortnight/articleshow/82535910.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Mumbai||State task force to care for kids orphaned by pandemic||MUMBAI: Two days after the Supreme Court Juvenile Justice committee made suggestive measures related to protection of children who lost their parents to the second wave of Covid, the state government decided to form district-level task forces under the respective collectors to take care of children orphaned following death of their parents due to Covid-19. Women and child development officers of every district will work as committee secretaries to compile data of children who lost parents to Covid and coordinate with other stakeholders. It will be the responsibility of the chairperson of the district child welfare committee to decide if the child is to be handed over to his or her relatives, if the need arises, to follow the adoption procedure as per provision of the Central Adoption Resource Authority, provide counselling if required or hand over to a children’s home. The state has asked medical officers to take written undertaking from parents, having minor children, and admitted to hospital for Covid treatment, about whom their kids be handed over to during treatment.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Retired babu hired despite chief secretary flagging proposed probe||MUMBAI: The appointment of retired IAS officer V K Gautam as officer on special duty (irrigation) despite a notice for an inquiry proposed against him during his stint on the Commonwealth Games organizing committee has violated the state government’s rules on the hiring of retired officials on contract, TOI has found. The government went ahead with the appointment although this issue was red-flagged by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and the general administration department (GAD), sources said. The state had issued a government resolution on January 8, 2016 for the hiring of retired employees on contract for specified work. It said that the retired official “should not have a departmental inquiry ongoing or proposed against him.” Gautam retired as additional chief secretary of the irrigation department on April 30. He was served a notice from the Centre’s Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) the same day, saying that an inquiry was proposed against him for alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts during his tenure as chief operating officer on the CWG’s organizing committee. His appointment as the OSD of the irrigation department, which has budgets running into thousands of crores, came a week later, on May 7. Gautam had served in the irrigation department for only four months before retirement. The government resolution on his appointment says, “In a very short time, Gautam showed able leadership of a large department and resolved many issues. The department will benefit from his experience and ability in implementing major projects.” It said 278 projects were under implementation with a budget of Rs 1 lakh crore. Sources said the state government had initially proposed to appoint Gautam on contract in the irrigation secretary’s post for a 3-year term. But the GAD department and Kunte said this was against the rules since the post of irrigation secretary was a “cadre” post and could only be occupied by a serving officer from the IAS cadre. They also said government rules did not allow for a retired officer facing a proposed inquiry to be hired on contract, sources said. Kunte and GAD secretary Sujata Saunik declined comment. In response, the state government dropped the idea of appointing Gautam in the irrigation secretary’s slot for 3 years. But it went ahead with hiring him as an OSD for a one-year term on contract. TOI contacted irrigation minister Jayant Patil from NCP and Gautam, but neither responded to calls and messages. Earlier, when TOI had on May 9 reported on Gautam’s appointment despite a proposed inquiry against him, Patil had said, “Gautam has superannuated on April 30. To my knowledge, no charges for departmental inquiry had been served on him till then.” He added, “No case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been made against him in connection to the CWG contracts or any other case.” Gautam had earlier told TOI that he had not received the DoPT notice till 6.30 pm on April 30 or even later. Sources close to him said a notice received after retirement was “infructuous.” Senior officers say they are deeply concerned about the recent trend of the state hiring retired officers on contract. After retiring as chief secretary, Ajoy Mehta was hired for a stint as principal advisor to the CMO. Radheshyam Mopalwar heads the MSRDC, which oversees major road projects in the state despite retiring in 2018. R A Rajeev continues to head MMRDA despite retiring in February. He was hired on a 3-month contract. However, the MMRDA chief’s post is a cadre post. According to the IAS Cadre Rules 1954, a non-cadre officer can only be appointed to such posts if there is “no suitable cadre officer suitable for filling the vacancy.” Also, extending such a tenure beyond three months requires approval of the Centre. “This is a wrong trend. Retired officers have no accountability and this undermines authority of the IAS officer posted in the department,” said ex- finance secretary Subodh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retd-babu-hired-despite-chief-secy-flagging-proposed-probe/articleshow/82535946.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Noida||Covid vaccination in Noida: Many in 45+ age group with booked slots turned away||NOIDA: They had appointments and had turned up at the designated hour but many of those in the 45+ bracket queuing up for their second or first vaccine shots were sent back by inoculation centres on Monday. At some centres, the scenes were chaotic with crowds gathering because vaccinations for the 18-44 group also began on Monday. At many centres, those over the age of 44 were asked to leave the queue. And while the office of the chief medical officer in Gautam Budh Nagar claimed that only those without a registered slot were asked to go back, it was a different story on the ground. Take Ramakant Mishra (77) and his wife Shyamla (66), for instance. An Amrapali Princely Estate resident, Ramakant had taken the first dose with his wife in the last week of March at Kailash hospital in Sector 27. The couple finally managed to book a slot for Monday after trying for a week on the Co-WIN portal. “We got confirmation on Co-WIN for Monday morning. We reached the primary health centre in Prahlad colony, Barola, before 9am for our 9am-11am slot. But police chased us away around 9.45am. We were told only people in the 18-44 bracket will be given vaccines and doses are not available for others,” said Mishra. The elderly had taken a risk of exposure. “We are not getting any slot for this week. We are clueless,” said Mishra. Similarly, Abhishek Malviya, a resident of Sector 34, said, “My uncle stays in the same colony and is 64+. Worried about the rush, I took him and two of his friends, all over 60, to Child PGI on Monday. We were told no registration was required for second doses. But all senior citizens and those over 45 were turned away.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/many-in-45-age-group-with-booked-slots-turned-away/articleshow/82535953.cms||Shalabh
---||Goa||Goa: Across party lines, 7 panchayats in Bardez unite to serve Covid families||PANAJI: Over the past two weeks, villages across Bardez have seen a steady rise in Covid-19 cases. The distress this has caused for affected families is not lost on panchayat members, who have for some time now been hearing of entire families testing positive. This has led members of seven panchayats to unite across party lines with the common help of bringing relief to affected villagers. Sarpanch and panch members of Saligao, Sangolda, Pilerne, Guirim, Reis Magos, Verem and Nerul panchayats converged for a meeting on Sunday, where it was decided that free meals should be centrally-cooked and delivered by panchayat members to self-isolating families of Covid patients. “We decided on Sunday that two free meals a day should be provided, and by Monday itself, we had received requirements from 120 families. As days go by, the requirement is likely to go up manifold, but we are prepared to meet the demand,” said Sangolda panch member Premanand Kochrekar. The initial funds required came from the pockets of the sarpanch and panch members themselves. “Every Thursday, the Sai Baba Mandir at Sangolda served mahaprasad to 2,000 to 3,000 persons,” said Pilerne panchayat member Karan Govenkar. “They had a ready setup of a kitchen, and temple officials were kind enough to agree to our proposal almost instantly. To be able to maintain the best hygiene, no one besides the temple catering team is allowed in the kitchen. We only monitor distribution of the food packets, which are picked up by each panchayat member from us as per their requirement.” The team is overwhelmed with donations in groceries they have already begun receiving on the first day of their service itself, on Monday. “We have refused cash in the interest of transparency,” said Govenkar. “Our aim through the initiative is that others should start similar services in religious institutions in their panchayats. If each panchayat takes such a step, then so many in need can receive relief. We clarified it on day 1 itself that persons across party lines should come forward, and they have.” While packets for lunch are available from 1pm onwards, dinner food packages are ready for pickup by 7pm. “We provide rice, curry, bhaji in the afternoons and soup, bhaji and chapati in the evenings, keeping in mind the nutrition of Covid patients. Only, we have to be informed one day in advance so we can prepare meals accordingly,” said Kochrekar. Ajay Govekar, Rupesh Naik, Sandeep Bandodkar and Fondu Naik are the other panchayat members actively involved in the initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/across-party-lines-7-panchayats-in-bardez-unite-to-serve-covid-families/articleshow/82535506.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Lucknow||2 Covid hospitals excluded from service in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Acting on complaints that over a dozen hospitals were neither admitting patients nor updating bed availability status on the online dashboard, district officer in charge of Covid-19, Roshan Jacob, ordered exclusion of two facilities from Covid services and issued notices to others, on Monday. She directed officials concerned to prepare a list of those hospitals which are not admitting patients despite availability of beds and not updating status on the dashboard so that accountability could be fixed and appropriate action could be taken against such facilities. TOI has been persistently raising the issue of Covid-19 hospitals not updating details on dashboard and not admitting patients. Jacob crosschecked the complaints with ICCC and found that two hospitals were not expediting the process to admission of patients despite having beds vacant. Both the hospitals were served notice. It was also found that due to a damaged oxygen pipeline, a hospital put out on the dashboard that no beds are available and that the information will be updated in next two days. Scrutiny of another complaint against a hospital revealed that the management was not admitting patients even after availability of beds. She also found that two reputed private Covid-19 hospitals were not updating the dashboard for availability of beds even after several reminders. Two hospitals, which had updated information for the last time on May 4 and May 6, were also issued notices. “In case of non-compliance, ensure legal action against the hospitals under the Epidemic Act,” she told officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-covid-hosps-excluded-from-service/articleshow/82535966.cms||---

Dr Dube was admitted to Medanta Hospital around three days ago but could not be saved. Dr Dube, who had started practising privately in Rajajipuram after his retirement, reportedly got infected from one of his patients during OPD services he was extending. “Dr Dube died of Covid-19 and its complications. He was a renowned cardiologist and worked at Balrampur hospital until his retirement. His nephew, who lives in Mumbai, confirmed the news of his death in Lucknow,” president of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Lucknow chapter, Dr Rama Srivastava, said. He was the father of gynecologist Dr Amita Shukla and father-in-law of Dr Abhishek Shukla. “He got infected with coronavirus while attending OPD patients in early April,” Dr Abhishek Shukla said. Previously, former chief medical superintendent and orthopaedic surgeon at Balrampur hospital, Dr Rishi Saxena, had also died of Covid-19. Till now, as many as 10 doctors have lost their lives in the city due to novel coronavirus infection.

The assurance was given after petitions filed by Sangram Singh and several others challenging the demolition notice issued more than 10 days after a full bench order of the HC in a suo motu PIL, directing all demolition orders to be kept in abeyance till May 7 and with the order being further extended till June 30. “The illegal structures are impeding completion of a project of public importance, the Hancock Flyover on Shivdas Chapsi Marg,” said the BMC lawyer before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. The petitioners contended that the BMC is “in contempt and appropriate order should be passed protecting the petitioners’ interest”.

---||Lucknow||Under Covid cloud, Eid to be a simple & subdued affair this year||LUCKNOW: As coronavirus pandemic continues to grip the city, Eid celebrations will remain subdued and simple this year too in view of people’s safety. With mosques closed and large congregations prohibited, families will celebrate the festival with simplicity, offering ‘namaz’ at home and giving away zakat (charity) to the needy. Eid is expected to be celebrated on May 13, however, the confirmation will be done only after the sighting of the moon. Like last year, Mohd Yusuf will celebrate the day with his family and giving away zakat on chaand raat. "We have an orphanage near our house where we used to visit every Eid. However, as it’s not safe for the kids to venture out, only my elder brother and I will visit the children and give books and clothes to them," said the Lalbagh resident. Both Shia and Sunni clerics have appealed to the people to avoid shopping for Eid and help the poor and the needy who have been affected by the pandemic.Giving charity in the form of zakat is the essence of Eid. One of the five pillars of Islam, it is given to help the needy achieve their goals and also help them celebrate the festival. "It gives us joy and satisfaction to help bring a smile on someone’s face, especially when the times have been gloomy for so long. Since we are also avoiding celebrations with our relatives, my wife and I will prepare food and ‘sewaiyan’ for the ones in need. We will pack them in disposable boxes and distribute them among people," said Amir Husain of Hazratganj. "My plans are simple. Stay at home, offer namaz, and pray for the well-being of our loved ones. Children are more excited about the festival and they will miss the huge family affair. A video call with cousins will make up for the change," said Nida Rashid. Tahira Abbas, who recently came home from Delhi, will celebrate the festival from a distance. “Since I am still in home isolation, I’ll be cooking my meal alone. It feels different because I wanted to sit and celebrate the day with my family the way we always do, but safety is the priority now," she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/under-covid-cloud-eid-to-be-a-simple-subdued-affair-this-year/articleshow/82536057.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anna Hazare, others move plea for transfer of MSCB scam case||MUMBAI: Following a petition by former MLA Manik Bhimrao Jadhav, other protest petitioners in the Rs 25,000-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam case, including activist Anna Hazare, have moved a plea before the principal judge of the sessions court to transfer the proceedings related to the state EOW’s closure report to another judge. Hazare’s plea sought a stay on the proceedings before the current judge, stating that he was convinced he may not get justice from the court currently incharge of the hearing. “The applicant is convinced that the learned judge has either developed bias or prejudice, and is trying to favour prosecutions for the reasons best known to him. The applicant, for the reasons stated, has not only a real apprehension but a genuine fear that free, fair and impartial hearing would not be available to him,” the plea said. The 84-year-old’s plea submitted through advocate Satish B Talekar also pointed out that after Jadhav submitted the transfer plea before the principal judge of the sessions court, the original complainant in the scam case, Surinder Mohan Arora, objected to it. The plea alleged that this was done in the interest of the accused as well as the prosecution. Jadhav’s plea came days after the incharge court refused to grant four weeks to them to go through 75,000 pages of the closure report. “... Arora as well as the prosecution do not want protest petitioners and their advocates to get enough time to take printout of the documents and study them and point out to the judge the offences that are made out...” Hazare’s plea said. The plea said the role of the prosecution was quite dubious from the beginning and the investigating officer registered the offence only after he was compelled to do so under the directions of the Bombay HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-anna-hazare-others-move-plea-for-transfer-of-mscb-scam-case/articleshow/82536079.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Talking to TOI, Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey said, “We have conducted the raid in the presence of health department officials.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra O2 Team backbone of uninterrupted supply in state||MUMBAI: Shortly after the midnight of Wednesday last week, Maharashtra grappled with an alarming reality: 50 metric tonne of oxygen it had been receiving from a plant in Bellary was no longer going to be available. Yet, in a few hours, a crisis was averted. By dawn, supplies were arranged from Gujarat’s Jamnagar and Dolvi and Murbad in the state. As a result, western Maharashtra, which is seeing a spike in cases, was spared an oxygen shortage. In a state which has consistently reported the highest cases in the country, uninterrupted oxygen supply both to cities and remote districts has drawn acclaim. Especially, since the bulk of oxygen in the state is manufactured by private companies with plants in just a few locations. While 1,250 metric tonne is produced locally, 500 metric tonne has to be sourced from outside the state, including Jamnagar in Gujarat, Bhilai in Chhattisgarh and Angul in Odisha. Working behind the scenes is a task force of officials firefighting through the day to ensure the state plugs its oxygen crunch and supplies are transported all over. The state’s Oxygen Team includes FDA commissioner Parimal Singh, medical education secretary Saurabh Vijay and transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne. They look after the overall allocation to districts, assess demand and organise inter-state transport. The next rung in the Oxygen Team includes nodal officers, each in charge of two revenue divisions. Ashwin Mudgal, joint managing director of Cidco is in charge of Vidarbha’s Nagpur and Amravati division. Animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh oversees Marathwada and Western Maharashtra while Amit Saini, CEO of Maharashtra Maritime Board is in charge of Konkan, MMR and Nashik. Each official also coordinates the supply from another state. The team reports to chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in a nightly review meeting at 10pm. “This is a crucial meeting in which the demand, supply and emergencies are assessed,” said a senior officer. The nodal officers are in touch with divisional commissioners, district collectors and civic chiefs who alert them to shortage and requirements. “Once we receive an alert, we are able to divert supplies. For instance, we had a shortage in a hospital in Ambejogai and were able to divert an oxygen tanker from Latur, Since district collectors and municipal chiefs can coordinate with us, it saves time,” said Sachindra Pratap Singh. “In the case of urgent requirements, even the puncture of a tyre in a tanker carrying liquid oxygen becomes an emergency. If a tanker from Hyderabad gets delayed, we may end up diverting another tanker from Marathwada,” he adds. The logistics of inter-state transport is a major challenge. “We have carried tankers by rail and air by coordinating with the Indian Railways and the Air Force. The first oxygen train in the country went from Vizag to Kalamboli in Maharashtra,” says Dhakne. Entire tankers have been air lifted to areas as distant as Jamnagar, Angul and Nagpur. “At least 20 air sorties have taken place in the past two weeks carrying tankers from Maharashtra,” says Dhakne. They usually return by rail or road. Around 300 tankers, mostly privately owned are used to transport liquid oxygen. Most are fitted with GPS. Most on the Oxygen Team are media shy. “The fact that none of the big cities or remote districts have had an oxygen crisis so far is our reward,” says a senior member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-o2-team-backbone-of-uninterrupted-supply-in-state/articleshow/82531426.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The move came after the civic body received several complaints from residents regarding cremation grounds charging exorbitant amounts for the procedures. As per the order, the total fee has been fixed at Rs 5,500. This includes the cost of wood, the priest’s fee and sanitation charges. Officials said that the public brought to the MCG commissioner’s notice that various crematoriums have been charging different amounts. “The order also requires the in-charges of the cremation grounds to submit a daily report to the office of the MCG regarding all pieces of information, including the amount charged as the fee for each cremation and the records being maintained at the cremation ground,” reads the order issued by MCG commissioner. The MCG has dedicated four crematoriums in the city for Covid deaths in Sector 32, Madanpuri, Atul Kataria Chowk and Carterpuri. The MCG officials said that action will be taken against those violating the order. “We have not received any such complaint from the public. Everybody is already paying Rs 5,500 and we have put it on our signboard as well. We have received the order and have been told not to charge beyond Rs 5,500 for every cremation. We are following it,” said Pramjit Singh Oberoi, president, Rambagh Shamshan Bhoomi Sudhar Samiti, Gurgaon. Meanwhile, many family members of Covid victims said that they have to wait for long hours at the crematoriums to conduct the last rites. Following this, the state government asked all the municipal corporations to identify crematoriums for Covid deaths and designate nodal officers for proper management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcg-caps-cremation-charge-in-gurgaon-at-rs-5500/articleshow/82536162.cms||---

If a fresh consignment of doses doesn’t arrive by Tuesday, the 37 government session sites that are carrying out vaccinations for this age group will have to stop the drive. At present, only two private hospitals — Max and Fortis — are giving Covid jabs. All other inoculations are happening at government centres. So far, only 28,236 people in this age group have been inoculated in the city, translating into a daily average that is below 3,000. The city has a target of vaccinating 10 lakh peopke with two doses in this population group . According to a senior official from the Haryana health department, the state is likely to get a fresh consignment of Covaxin for the 18-plus category by Wednesday. “Gurgaon will get vaccine doses by Wednesday evening or Thursday morning. We are also expecting to get three lakh doses of Covishield for Haryana for this age group by the weekend,” the official said. Meanwhile, on Monday, 4,836 people in the 18-plus age group were vaccinated in Gurgaon. The Gurgaon health department said they might have to close down vaccinations for this category on Wednesday and Thursday. “We are likely to exhaust all our stock of vaccines for this category on Tuesday. We might not plan session sites for the next two days if we don’t receive a fresh consignment. We have already informed the state government,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. He also said private hospitals will conduct session sites on their own. “We aren’t providing them vaccine doses. If they have stocks, they can carry out vaccinations,” he added. A total of 7,732 people in the 45-plus age group also got vaccinated on Monday at 41 session sites in Gurgaon. As many as 124 healthcare workers and 169 frontline workers also got the jab. While private hospitals are allowed to hold vaccination camps at workplaces and residential societies, they aren’t carrying out large-scale inoculations because of an unavailability of vaccines. “We are unable to carry mass vaccinations as the supply is low at present. We will carry out workplace camps once we get adequate doses,” said an official from a leading private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/vax-stock-almost-over-jabs-for-18-44-may-stop-for-two-days/articleshow/82536185.cms||Ipsita Pati

Within no time, he got a list of verified plasma donors, thanks to a group of strangers who have helped more than 300 people desperately looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma and medicines. “Saving lives is the need of the hour. Apart from sharing initial leads, we also ask patients to remain in touch with us till they get help,” said 33-year-old Shobhit Tandon, a financial consultant from Kanpur. The team, constituted by a management faculty in Lucknow, gets requisitions on Whatsapp groups following which the team uses social media to seek information. The group comprising students and professionals keeps helping callers on testing, treatment, hospitalization and oxygen support facilities, besides providing counselling to them. “We provide verified leads to attendants. Our inboxes are flooded with messages offering leads. There are people who offer assistance immediately. Such is the power of humanity in times of crisis,” said Reena Agarwal, 49, the woman behind the initiative. Agarwal, who heads the social responsibility committee in a management institute, contacted her students and alumni of last 10 years, now working in different sectors across the country. “We have three WhatsApp groups where over 600 volunteers are connected. It’s heartwarming to see people responding in record time. The USP of our team is that we are working in shifts round-the-clock,” Agarwal told TOI. In a recent case, the team used social media to help a patient from Tirupati get a bed. “We got the message that a person needs a bed in Tirupati. When we searched, we found that no bed was vacant. Within an hour, we arranged for a bed in a hospital in an adjoining district roughly two hours away from Tirupati. We even arranged an ambulance for him, and everything was done online,” Shobhit said. “The entire movement is by the people and for the people. The second wave of pandemic has left us so helpless that we decided to do our bit. Every time we save a life, we feel happy and motivated,” said 30-year-old Aditi Rana, a first year management student. For Ankur Bhatia (31), a bank employee in Kanpur, the movement has instilled hope in people. “When we came together, we found that lack of information was the biggest hurdle in fight against Covid. We work on providing leads and help people,” Ankur said. In the last two weeks, the team has helped over 100 patients with hospital beds in Lucknow, Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Jaipur, Patna, Dehradun, Varanasi and Prayagraj. The group has helped more than 125 patients in various cities of the country with medicines and injections. They have arranged plasma for at least 40 patients and provided oxygen cylinders, cans and concentrators to 120 people. The group is also arranging RT-PCR tests and ambulance for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mgmt-students-professionals-turn-saviours-use-tech-to-mobilise-help-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82536188.cms||Isha Jain

These nine locations are SGT medical hospital (500 beds), Tau Devi Lal Stadium (100 beds), Nilkanth hospital (50 beds), Government Girls PG College (100 beds), Girls college in Sector 14 (100 beds), M3M Urbana in Sector 67 (100 beds), DLF community centre phase-1 and phase-3 (150 beds), Honda warehouse in Manesar (25 beds), Hotel New Destination near Pushpanjali Hospital (35 beds) and Apollo guest house in Sector-46 (150 beds). “Most projects are being set up now. Soon, the district will have more than 1,000 additional beds for Covid patients,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. He also said, “Adequate steps are being taken to ensure that the makeshift hospitals work effectively. I have already sent a request to the headquarters seeking additional staff for the 100-bed makeshift hospital which is coming up at Tau Devi Lal Stadium.” A team formed by the health department and the district administration had faced opposition from residents in Sector 27, while the makeshift facility was being planned in that area. Initially, the makeshift facility was planned on a one-acre government school land that is lying adjacent to the old hospital building in Civil Lines. Since it was a small patch of land, the health department had decided to set up the facility at Sector 27, but again it had to change the plan and shift the facility to Tau Devi Lal Stadium after facing protests. Gurugram’s medical infrastructure is under immense strain with more than 3,500 fresh cases being added daily on an average in the past few days. Several residents, meanwhile, are still scrambling to get hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in their families. The district has more than 34,000 Covid patients under home isolation, while around 2,400 patients are in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-seeks-staff-to-run-100-bed-covid-facility/articleshow/82536242.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Lucknow||Govt refuting witnesses’ accounts of deaths: SP||Lucknow: Accusing the ruling BJP of fudging statistics, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said the government has now started refuting eye-witness accounts of increasing number of deaths due to Covid-19. Till now the government was citing ‘aankare’ (statistics), but now it is denying even eye-witness accounts, Akhilesh said on Monday. The fact that even BJP MPs and MLAs are writing to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the state government, expressing their anguish over the mismanagement at hospitals goes on to explain the extent to which the situation has deteriorated. But it seems the government is not taking lessons and instead busy in showcasing one meeting after another that is being held in the name of Covid management. Akhilesh said the CM’s whistle stop tours of districts will not help improve the situation on the ground. “Instead, the government should focus on setting up a fool-proof system of checking black marketing and hoarding of drugs and equipment as black marketing of life-saving drugs, oxygen cylinders and related equipment is still rampant and such activities cannot flourish without involvement of government officials,” the former UP CM said. “The manner in which the Covid-19 is spreading across the state and now particularly in rural areas and claiming human lives is simply heart wrenching. But the attempt of the government to under report the challenge is only adding to the people’s miseries. What all the more is disturbing that such an approach will make things worse for people in case the third wave hits Uttar Pradesh,” Akhilesh said. The SP chief said trends suggest that the infection is spreading fast in rural areas. “When gross mismanagement in terms of beds in hospitals, availability of ventilators and oxygen cylinders and supply of life saving drugs is prevailing in Lucknow, one can easily imagine what the condition will be in rural areas,” the SP national president added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-refuting-witnesses-accounts-of-deaths-sp/articleshow/82536249.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: High blood sugar wider effect of steroid misuse||MUMBAI: While the spotlight has been on the recent emergence of a rare fungal infection, mucormycosis, among recovered Covid-19 patients who were treated with steroids, doctors said that increased sugar levels is the wider epidemic caused by overuse/misuse of steroids. “There have been a few cases of patients with diabetes who needed steroids during Covid treatment, developing diabetic acidiosis and needing emergency admission,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s Covid task force. However, there are many recovered patients whose sugar rose after steroid treatment. On Monday, a doctor from Delhi who tweets anonymously, posted, “Uncontrolled sugars post steroid use is leading to acute thrombotic events such as strokes, peripheral clots and heart attacks. Pandemic in a pandemic.” Rising sugar also makes a post-Covid diabetic more susceptible to mucormycosis. Dr Santosh Shetty of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, Andheri, said, “We are seeing a large number of patients coming with deranged sugars, including diabetics whose sugars have suddenly increased significantly.” He said this could be a “combination” of the infection plus the steroids use to treat Covid. Hiranandani Hospital CEO Dr Sujit Chatterjee, too, said that his Powai hospital saw a “fair number of people with deranged sugar levels” but pointed out that Covid itself is responsible for impairing blood sugar levels. Endocrinologist Dr Dheeraj Kapoor said many patients in the post-Covid OPD come with high sugars. “Some who used to take tablets now need insulin while some need increased dosages,” he said. Since the pandemic, doctors have said steroids are the only medicine with evidence to save lives. But, in the second wave, there has been a trend in smaller cities and towns to prescribe steroids in the first week of infection. As the virus is still in a multiplication stage in the first week, use of steroids, which tends to lower immunity, ends up increasing viral load. “There are instances of patients getting oral steroids at home for two weeks after discharge. This is not recommended,” said a civic hospital doctor. The government has now called for rational use of steroids. “Time table for Covid is 14 to 21 days, but for patients who needed steroids to recover, it goes to three months. They must take care of the nose, mouth and throat for the entire period,” said Dr Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-high-blood-sugar-wider-effect-of-steroid-misuse/articleshow/82536253.cms||---

Making the announcement, the administration informed that the government has started an online portal — oxygenhry.in — in collaboration with over 30 civil society agencies and 300 volunteers to meet the demand for medical oxygen. “The government has been taking decisive steps to address the challenges in availing medical oxygen. We have collaborated with 32 NGOs and 300 volunteers to ensure that we are able to handle requests for oxygen cylinders and deliver them within 24 hours,” said Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata. To avail this service, people will have to register on the online portal and raise requests for refilling of medical oxygen. Thereafter, the request will be taken up by the volunteers, who will mobilise the resources and ensure that oxygen refilling is done within 24 hours. While the administration boasts about its initiative, people have complained about the dearth of information at the ground level. and absolute neglect from the government officials to generate awareness. “ It’s been months that not a single official has taken stock of the ground situation ,” argued Hamara Adhikaar Morcha convener Mohammad Younis Alvi. Officials, however, contested that they will be carrying out a public awareness soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/refilled-oxygen-cylinders-to-be-delivered-to-nuh-patients-in-24-hours/articleshow/82536286.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||MLALAD gets blocked over ‘vacant’ Tundla seat order||Lucknow: In yet another instance of discrepancy in the release of MLA Local Area Development (MLALAD) fund for legislators, the state government deprived Tundla assembly seat, represented by BJP MLA Prempal Singh Dhangar, of the crucial funds. The rural development department has now rectified its mistake and issued a fresh order for release of funds for Tundla assembly seat. Dhangar got elected from Tundla, a reserved constituency, in the 2020 byelections when senior BJP leader SP Singh Baghel vacated the seat following his victory from Agra Lok Sabha in 2019 parliamentary elections. Dhangar’s election from the seat, surprisingly, got overlooked when the state government decided to release MLALAD funds on April 12, almost a year after keeping it suspended to mop up funds to meet the financial requirements in its battle against coronavirus pandemic. According to sources, the discrepancy came to light after the chief development officer of Firozabad dashed off a letter to the rural development department, the nodal department for distribution of MLALAD funds, putting up the case of Tundla being deprived of the funds. Rural development commissioner, K Ravindra Naik, admitted that the department in its April 12 order, issued by additional chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, showed Tundla seat as vacant.  “The department has now released the first instalment of Rs 1.5 crore under MLALAD fund for Tundla,” Naik said in the order. Earlier, the department had left out Sikandra seat in Kanpur, which was represented by state minister for IT & electronics Ajit Pal Singh. Surprisingly, the department released funds for Swar seat in Rampur, which had fallen vacant after the Allahabad high court, in December 2019, declared the elections of Abdullah Azam, son of senior SP leader and party MP Azam Khan, invalid following discrepancy in affidavit regarding his age. Later, the department corrected the anomaly. The state government had decided to raise MLALAD corpus from Rs 2.4 crore to Rs 3 crore per annum while making a provision of Rs 2,400 crore in the state budget for 2021-22. The funds were meant to be released for MLAs as well as MLCs. Officials in the rural development department said the funds allocated to legislators would be utilised as per rules and government order issued from time to time. The finance department has also been issuing directions for utilization of funds as per the budget manual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mlalad-gets-blocked-over-vacant-tundla-seat-order/articleshow/82536289.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Kin of rural poll staff who died of Covid to get Rs 30 lakh||LUCKNOW: UP government will give ex gratia of Rs 30 lakh to the families of teachers, government officials, security forces and any other person deputed for panchayat election duty who may have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the course of work. Amid allegations that more than 700 personnel on election duty have died of Covid-19, the state panchayati raj department has written to all district magistrates, asking them to submit a list of such personnel and their RT-PCR rest reports and other documents by Wednesday.

As chief minister is himself handling the finance portfolio, the purchase committee under him should procure more ventilators without any further delay,” Capt Yadav said.  “The government should impose a strict lockdown to break the chain of the virus transmission and also announce a financial package and distribute dry ration to the poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/procure-more-ventilators-for-covid-hospitals-says-capt-ajay-yadav/articleshow/82536328.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Lucknow||Home isolation patients in UP to get calls from MPs & MLAs||LUCKNOW: Covid-19 patients in home isolation may soon be getting calls from their MPs and MLAs to check on their health. On Monday, CM Yogi Adityanath directed the Gorakhpur and Basti administrations to provide the MPs and MLAs a list of patients in home isolation for Covid-19 and their contact numbers so that the public representatives could establish direct contact with them. In Gorakhpur, the CM inspected a CHC where vaccination for 18-plus age group was taking place and BRD medical college where people in 60-plus group were getting jabs. He also visited AIIMS where Boeing is in the process of setting up a temporary Covid hospital. The CM later chaired a high level meeting to review the Covid-19 work in Gorakhpur and Basti divisions.“Because of the work being done by the government for effective control over Covid-19, the state had seen active cases reduce by 85,000 between April 30 and May 10. To control the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas, monitoring committees and rapid response teams should be strengthened and their numbers should be increased,” he said. In rural areas, the CM said, all those showing symptoms of Covid-19 should be given medical kits. If the persons test positive, then suitable arrangements should be made for their treatment. He also asked officials to ensure that an oxygen audit was carried out in both divisions so that no oxygen was wasted. The CM said that CCTV cameras should be installed in all hospitals while 75% of the 108 ambulance service should be used for Covid patients. “Fees for private ambulance services should also be fixed and strict action should be taken in case of overcharging,” he said. Gorakhpur divisional commissioner Jayant Narlekar informed the CM that 63,042 antigen tests and 54,633 RTPCR tests had been conducted in the division. The administration had appointed 4,856 monitoring committees of which 4,368 were functional in rural areas. The division had 126 ambulances at its disposal which are currently being used. He added that 7,19,118 persons had received their first shot of the vaccine while 1,75,442 persons had received their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/home-isolation-patients-in-up-to-get-calls-from-mps-mlas/articleshow/82536359.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Hindu-dominated village in Ayodhya elects lone Muslim candidate as pradhan||AYODHYA: In an unprecedented show of brotherhood that reaffirms the syncretic soul of Ayodhya, rural voters in Hindu-dominated Rajapur village have elected Hafiz Azeemuddin – a cleric and member of the lone Muslim family in the village – as the gram pradhan by a thumping margin. He edged past six other candidates in the fray, all of them from the majority community, by bagging 200 out of the total 600 votes. Hafiz Azeemuddin, who considers the panchayat poll victory as his Eid gift, attributed his success to his Hindu brethren, who reposed faith in him. The election, however small it may be, once again demolished the concept of Hindu-Muslim votebank politics in Ayodhya, the epicenter of Hindutva. Rajanpur village falls in Rudauli assembly constituency of Ayodhya. Azeemuddin, a farmer by profession, holds the degree of Hafiz and Aalim from Islamic madrassa. He also taught in a madrassa for 10 years and then joined his family’s traditional business of farming. He grows cereals, vegetables and fruits in his 50 bigha land. “This is an example of communal harmony in our society which cannot be breached,” Girish Rawat, a local resident, said. “We have not voted on the basis of religion. We only kept in mind what is good for us. We are diehard Hindus but elected a Muslim cleric as our head to show as to what extent we follow secularism,” said Shekhar Sahu, another villager. “It is a manifestation of our pluralism. It shows that the idea of cultural harmony in India survives despite all the odds. Let us strengthen the bond of harmony and fraternity,” said Athar Hussain, secretary of Ayodhya Mosque Trust. “I am sure that in 200 votes that I secured, only 27 could be of Muslims as there are as many Muslims in the village. The rest of the votes have been polled by Hindus who supported me,” said Azeemuddin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hindu-dominated-village-in-ayodhya-elects-lone-muslim-candidate-as-pradhan/articleshow/82536396.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The area is part of the 66-acre CTS no. 1 owned by the state dairy development department. The SRA has also decided to declare similar areas in Dindoshi and Malad (E). Satish Lokhande, SRA CEO, said: “We have issued the notice inviting objections and suggestions.” Activist Zoru Bhathena said construction in Aarey would require HC permission. Pointing out that the area is part of the eco-sensitive zone of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), advocate Godfrey Pimenta said: “The process itself violates the HC order. The SRA may claim it is not construction, but it is a process that would eventually allow construction.” He added that in the new Development Plan 2034, the BMC has earmarked 43 hectares (107.5 acres) for rehabilitation of slumdwellers and tribals from Aarey and SGNP. Advocate Zaman Ali said the HC had disallowed all SRA schemes in a 2003 PIL by NGO Citispace. “In 2014, in a modified order in the same matter, the HC said the project proponent would need to obtain objections from the NGO and make an application before the court for the scheme to be implemented. In another PIL in 2016, the HC said there can be no SRA scheme in Aarey,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-plans-sra-area-in-aarey-despite-hc-stay-on-construction/articleshow/82536485.cms||Clara Lewis

In both cases, the minors had deposed. Special public prosecutor Veena Shelar cited this and other evidence to seek the conviction of the two accused. In the first instance, 30-year-old Karuna Naik, a labourer, was found guilty of grabbing the arm of a 10-year-old girl in 2018. The child was 11 years old when she deposed in 2019. In her deposition, the child submitted after returning from school and having lunch, she would headed for her tuitions at 4pm. She said on September 7, 2018, when she was returning home around 6:30pm along with two of her friends, a man caught hold of her bag which was on her shoulder. She said he removed the bag and then pulled her hand. The child said she screamed and a man rescued her. She then ran home. The child further said she confided in her mother. Her mother then brought her to the same spot, where they saw that a crowd had gathered and they were beating the man. The child said the police then arrived and they went to the police station. She said after the police made inquires with her, the following day she was sent to a doctor and later before a court where her statement was recorded. The child’s mother too deposed and iterated the details of the incident. In the second instance, the accused, Dilshan Shaikh (33), was accused of sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl who was sleeping alongside her mother on a footpath. It was submitted on May 9, 2017, at about 4am, the child woke her mother in tears, pointed to the accused and described the assault. The mother had identified him but he ran away. The mother then told the child’s father and they went to the cops. Subsequently, Shaikh was arrested. In both cases, the judgements were pronounced via video-conferencing. While Naik was fined Rs 500, the court fined Shaikh Rs 1,000. Both accused were found guilty under the Pocso Act section relating to aggravated sexual assault.

These horses, in normal times, would be used for recreational rides. Maharashtra Government Railway Police (GRP) commissioner Ravindra Sengaonkar, from Mumbai, started an informal initiative to collect funds to help the horse owners in Matheran. “When I read about how the horses in Matheran were starving, I verified the facts and appealed to my friends, family and acquaintances to help. I requested them to forward this message in their circle too and contribute whatever they could. Funds from all contributors were sent directly to a trusted horse owner’s bank account, who bought horse feed and distributed it among 150 horse owners. The initiative is still on and we are encouraging people to donate towards this cause,” he said. Co-trustees of Jeevraksha Animal Welfare Trust, Manoj Oswal and Sunil Kadam from Pune, have also contributed towards horse-feed for Matheran horses and are now extending their operations to help remedy a similar situation in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani. “About two weeks ago, I received a call from someone who told me about how bad the situation is for horses in Matheran and how their ribs were showing because of starvation. I immediately got in touch with a local horse-feed vendor and had him distribute sacks of food to the horse owners there. We have also started horse-feed distribution work in other nearby hill stations where horse owners are going through equally distressing circumstances. People who want to donate can reach out to the trust,” said Oswal, who has been working for animal welfare in Maharashtra for over a decade. Rakesh Kokale, third-generation horse owner from Matheran, said, “The main source of income here in Matheran is from tourism. There is no agriculture- or manufacturing-based industry. There are over 200 horse owners here, each with 2-3 animals, who have had no income since all tourism-related activity came to a halt for over six months during the lockdown last year. This year, we have again been suffering for the last two months. But after the news of how we could not afford to feed our horses reached Pune and Mumbai, I received calls from people who wanted to help by donating horse feed, rations and funds. In the last 15-20 days, I have received over Rs1.60 lakh in donations and I am grateful for.” Another horse owner, Karan Jankar, said, “When the donated horse-feed is distributed, it is not enough for all horse owners. Throughout last year, I had to cut down on important household expenses and make many sacrifices just so I could feed my three horses. Our horses are very important to us as our livelihood depends on them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/people-from-pune-mumbai-raise-funds-to-feed-horses-in-matheran/articleshow/82534727.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Calcutta HC ‘appreciates’ state’s efforts to stem post-poll violence||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court five-judge bench on Monday “appreciated” the Bengal government’s efforts to stem post-poll violence and said, after being informed that no violence had been reported since Sunday, that it should “keep up” its work. Fault-finding could be done later, acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal observed, adding that both the state and the central governments should work together to maintain peace now that a new state government was in place. The court, comprising Acting CJ Bindal and justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, also sought the Centre’s response to the state government affidavit and will hear the case again on May 18. The state home secretary’s report to the HC on post-poll violence said there were 15 “violent incidents”, leading to 16 deaths, till May 3, an official said. There were six political clashes but no death on May 5, the day the new government was sworn in. There was no death on May 6 and May 7 and, on May 8, there was one death in Birbhum’s Khairasol. There was no incident since Sunday, according to the state government. Cops had arrested 400 people, including 72 for crimes like murder and arson, and 34 FIRs had been drawn up against fake news (five of them in Kolkata). State advocate-general Kishore Dutta assured the court that all possible steps would be taken to pre-empt violence. Additional solicitor-general YJ Dastoor, however, told the court that it was not just one party highlighting “post-poll violence”; all parties that fought the poll had made similar allegations, which was borne out by the state affidavit. Complaints were not registered by police stations in several cases, Dastoor said, but Dutta disputed this as false. The National Human Rights Commission, the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Women and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, too, had received numerous complaints, Dastoor said, demanding that a special investigation team led by a retired director-general of police be set up. All such complaints could be forwarded to the state DGP “to enable him to transfer the cases to police stations for appropriate action”, the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cal-hc-appreciates-state-efforts-to-check-violence/articleshow/82536594.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Police suspect Dinesh Bhati, brother of local SP leader Mahesh Bhati, may have been killed over personal enmity . At least 18 criminal cases were registered against Dinesh, a resident of Luharli village, at various police stations in Gautam Budh Nagar. The alleged crime happened around 7pm when Dinesh was returning home. “Suddenly, the three assailants came on a bike and fired at him and fled towards the village. Locals told cops and immediately a team reached the spot. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival,” said Vishal Pandey, additional DCP of Zone-3 in Greater Noida.  “We have sent the body for an autopsy and the report is awaited. On the basis of a complaint, an FIR has been lodged against unknown person under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC at Dadri police station,” Pandey said. Police said Mahesh Bhati’s son was also murdered in 2018. “This could be a case of personal enmity but we are investigating all angles. The family has named a few suspects and their involvement is being looked into. Four teams have been formed to track down the culprits. We are also checking the footage of CCTV cameras installed in nearby areas,” said Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sp-netas-brother-shot-dead-over-personal-enmity/articleshow/82536613.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Kolkata||No government step yet, self-imposed lockdown need of hour: CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Only “a self-imposed lockdown-like situation” could save Bengal as it stared at a spike in Covid cases over the next fortnight, CM Mamata Banerjee said on Monday. She, however, added that the government was not thinking of imposing any lockdown as yet. People would have to create a lockdown-like satiation by remaining indoors to save themselves, Banerjee said at a meeting with religious leaders, socio-cultural organisations, trade bodies and Durga Puja committees. “We have to take care for the next 15 days. The threat may reduce after that,” she added, appealing to religious organisations to celebrate festivals following Covid protocols. The CM urged state DGP Virendra and Kolkata CP Soumen Mitra to work out the modalities with imams ahead of Eid later this week while lauding Muslim clerics Qari Fazlur Rahman and Nakhoda Masjid deputy imam Safique Quasmi for calling off the mass Eid prayers on Red Road and in Park Circus like last year. She also asked imams to appeal to people to offer namaz at home. Buddhist leaders, too, said there would be no mass gathering on Buddha Purnima (May 26) and the day would be spent providing relief to Covid victims. “We have banned political gatherings and have put a cap of 50 people for social and religious gatherings. This will be allowed subject to prior permissions and adherence to Covid protocols,” Banerjee said, adding that secularism and harmony would take Bengal ahead. “Religion is personal but festivals are meant to be shared with everyone,” she said. Several religious and educational organisations shared their plans to complement the government’s Covid fight. Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan representatives informed her that they had set aside 120 Covid beds at their Hazra hospital, which would also have its own oxygen plant, and were setting up a 50-bed safe house at the polytechnic institute near their Belur Math headquarters. RKM could increase the bed strength at their Sishu Mangal facility immediately if they wanted to, the CM said. Bharat Sevasram Sangha, too, had given up its Joka health facility for Covid care, state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay told the meeting and Sikh representatives informed Banerjee that the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in Alipore would have Covid facilities. St Xavier’s University vice-chancellor Father Felix Raj told Banerjee that the institute was coordinating with the North and South 24-Parganas district administrations so that its campuses could be used for safe homes. “We have already opened one on Sunday,” he said, referring to the Raghabpur campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-govt-step-yet-self-imposed-lockdown-need-of-hour-cm/articleshow/82536645.cms||---

These horses, in normal times, would be used for recreational rides. Maharashtra Government Railway Police (GRP) commissioner Ravindra Sengaonkar, from Mumbai, started an informal initiative to collect funds to help the horse owners in Matheran. “When I read about how the horses in Matheran were starving, I verified the facts and appealed to my friends, family and acquaintances to help. I requested them to forward this message in their circle too and contribute whatever they could. Funds from all contributors were sent directly to a trusted horse owner’s bank account, who bought horse feed and distributed it among 150 horse owners. The initiative is still on and we are encouraging people to donate towards this cause,” he said. Co-trustees of Jeevraksha Animal Welfare Trust, Manoj Oswal and Sunil Kadam from Pune, have also contributed towards horse-feed for Matheran horses and are now extending their operations to help remedy a similar situation in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani. “About two weeks ago, I received a call from someone who told me about how bad the situation is for horses in Matheran because of starvation. I immediately got in touch with a local horse-feed vendor and had him distribute sacks of food to the horse owners there. We have also started horse-feed distribution work in nearby hill stations where horse owners are going through equally distressing circumstances. People who want to donate can reach out to the trust,” said Oswal, who has been working for animal welfare in in the state for over a decade. Rakesh Kokale, third-generation horse owner from Matheran, said, “The main source of income hereis tourism. There is no agriculture or manufacturing industry. There are over 200 horse owners here, each with 2-3 animals, who have had no income since all tourism activity came to a halt for over six months since last year. This year, we have been suffering for two months. But after the news of how we could not afford to feed our horses reached Pune and Mumbai, I received calls from people who wanted to donate horse feed, rations and funds. In the last 15-20 days, I have received over Rs 1.6 lakh in donations that I am grateful for.” Another horse owner, Karan Jankar, said, “Throughout last year, I had to cut down on household expenses just so I could feed my three horses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/people-from-pune-mumbai-raise-funds-to-feed-horses-in-matheran/articleshow/82536648.cms||---
---||Kolkata||English-medium schools to be set up in every block: CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: The government will set up an English-medium school in every block of the state, CM Mamata Banerjee announced after her first cabinet meeting on Monday. “This will help rural students avail the opportunity of English education,” the CM said, addressing a rural demand that has led to mushrooming of English-medium private schools in the districts. This will now be a priority for Paresh Adhikary, the minister given charge of school education. Banerjee’s decision comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government’s New Education Policy advocates education in mother tongue. PM Modi during his election campaign had repeatedly stressed that his government would help the poor and marginalised pursue even professional courses like medicine and engineering in mother tongue. Political observers see Banerjee’s move as yet another challenge to Modi, this time on the education front. Bengal has witnessed fierce debates over the medium of instruction at the primary level since the Left Front banished English till class V in the Eighties. The move was aimed at bringing down the rate of school dropouts in rural areas, which experts in the party had ascribed to a fright of the language. The decision, however, proved counter-productive in the course of time as lack of English knowledge led to a generation of students losing edge in higher education and national-level competitive examinations. English was finally brought back to classrooms after 24 years in 2004 when then CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reintroduced it in class I as the Left Front’s language policy began to have an impact on its vote share. Aware of the past, CM Banerjee started pushing the English-medium agenda from her second term. The state government took a two-medium approach in select government schools, where students could opt for English-medium instruction. The CM now wants to take the initiative down to the grassroots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eng-medium-schools-to-be-set-up-in-every-block-mamata/articleshow/82536696.cms||---

There is a threat to me and my family and hence it is the responsibility of the government to provide police protection,” Ghadge said. Meanwhile, advocate Abha Singh, representing bookie Sonu Jalan, on Monday held a press conference and said while the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) manual may have a stipulated time period, the law of the land laid out by the Supreme Court in the Lalita Kumari judgment states an inquiry should just take a week before a decision on registering an FIR is taken. The ACB is conducting three separate inquiries against Param Bir Singh on the allegations of corruption filed by two bookies and two police inspectors. “However, if no inference is arrived at within the prescribed period, then it would be open for my client to approach the ACB special court or the high court in the matter,” said Abha Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/police-inspector-seeks-protection-bookie-threatens-to-move-court-in-mumbai/articleshow/82536764.cms||---

---||World||Biden admin reopens doors to foreign entrepreneurs via ‘startup’ visas||MUMBAI: Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the US is reopening its doors to foreign entrepreneurs. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced that it is withdrawing a ‘proposed’ rule introduced by the Trump administration that would have rescinded the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER), better known as the start-up visa program. IER enables ‘qualified’ international entrepreneurs (based on prescribed criteria including funds raised, which are a minimum of $ 250,000 from qualified US investors or $ 100,000 from government grants) to obtain immigration ‘parole’ – that is to temporarily enter and stay in the US and nurture their startup, despite not having a work visa or a green card. Commonly, IER is known as the startup visa, but it is actually a permit for eligible foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the US for two and a half years with the possibility of another extension of a similar tenure. Withdrawing the proposed rule that would end the IER is consistent with the Biden administration’s goal of better ensuring that all avenues available under the law remain viable options for those seeking to come to the US, including qualified entrepreneurs who would substantially benefit the US by growing new businesses and creating jobs for the US workers, states DHS. “I’m beyond thrilled that the Biden Administration has decided to fully implement the IER. The current US immigration system does not have a specific option for immigrant founders of startups and this puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage. The IER will help fill that gap until Congress can pass a startup visa. We need to do all we can to attract and retain innovative immigrant entrepreneurs,” Fiona McEntee, a Chicago based immigration attorney told TOI. To illustrate, countries such as Canada, Israel and the UK have a separate category of visas for foreign entrepreneurs. Originally created at the end of the Obama Administration, IER was targeted for removal by the Trump Administration before it was launched. Due to a successful lawsuit filed by the National Venture Capital Association, it remained in force, but was not seen as a viable option as the Trump administration repeatedly tried to end the program. "The IER is a long overdue immigration pathway for startup founders," said Doug Rand, co-founder of Boundless Immigration - a technology company in the immigraiton space. He had helped create this program while an advisor to former US President Obama. "This regulation was finalised three days before Donald Trump's inauguration. It survived several near-death experiences over the next four years, and is now poised to become part of President Biden's efforts to grow the economy and build back better. I'm so glad that, four years ago, we burned the midnight oil to finish this midnight regulation, whose time has finally come," added Rand. Read AlsoUS federal court opens doors to ‘startup visas’A US district court judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration cannot delay an Obama-era immigration rule, which enables eligible foreign entrepreneurs to temporarily stay in the US to nurture and grow their startups.“Immigrant entrepreneurs have made incredible contributions to the US economy, including creating some of America’s most prominent companies, such as Moderna and Pfizer that have developed COVID-19 vaccines,” said Bobby Franklin, President and CEO of the National Venture Capital Association. “By implementing the IER, the Biden Administration is unlocking an incredible job creation tool that will help the US remain the global leader in innovation,” he added. TOI had covered this lawsuit – budding entrepreneurs, including those from India, who were also a party to the lawsuit, had pointed out that besides the cutting-edge technology that is available, US based investors have a comfort level if founders are also based in America. Access to funding and future growth for startups especially those in the technology sector is easier, with a US base. It is a win-win, as according to a representation made earlier by the National Venture Capital Association and other associations to the DHS, it is estimated that the IER could create more than 4.29 ;alj jobs in the first ten years, account for more than $25 billion of direct additional wages over ten years, and inject more than $18 billion of indirect value into the US economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-admin-reopens-doors-to-foreign-entrepreneurs-via-startup-visas/articleshow/82535913.cms||Lubna Kably

Pakistan’s interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed told reporters in Islamabad that Saudi Arabia was even ready for the return of Pakistanis imprisoned for serious crimes as many of the prisoners have already served a large part of their sentence. The minister said that with an aid of Rs 1 billion, hundreds of more prisoners who have to pay small fines can be released from Saudi jails. “The cases of the ones convicted for serious crimes, will be dealt with separately,” he said, adding that the whole process of return of prisoners has been completed. At least 30 Pakistanis imprisoned for murder and drug offences will not be released as they have been sentenced to death, the minister said. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had signed an agreement on the transfer of convicted prisoners during PM Khan’s three-day visit to Saudi Arabia. The two countries had also inked a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of the Saudi-Pakistan Supreme Coordination Council (SPSCC), that would address the treatment of criminals and crime. The two countries have also agreed on combating drug trafficking; as well as financing energy, infrastructure, transportation, water, and communications projects. Last year, the Saudi government had released 2,080 Pakistani prisoners as part of an agreement with the Imran Khan government. These prisoners were involved in crimes like forgery, theft, bribery and illegal bordering crossing. During Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Pakistan in 2019, he had announced the release of 2,100 Pakistani prisoners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/saudi-arabia-to-release-1100-pakistani-prisoners/articleshow/82536887.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Since May 1, the two zones that have reported the maximum number of cases are Tigra (5,521 cases) and Chandralok (4,832). These two areas have reported 30% of the fresh Covid cases in Gurgaon, which added 33,565 cases in just nine days of May. Tigra includes sectors 47, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 56 and 57, Sushant Lok-3 and Suncity. Chandralok includes DLF-1, 2 and 4, Ardee City and sectors 24, 25, 26, 42, 43 and 52. The current positivity rate of Gurgaon is 24%. While Tigra has a positivity rate of 33%, Chandralok’s stands at 26%. The health department said that they are conducting focused testing in these areas. “Most of the new patients are in the age group of 18 years to 35 years, and are living in highrises,” said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurgaon chief medical officer. He also said it has been noticed that a large number of people in these areas had recently travelled to different parts of the country before the lockdown, leading to a spike in active cases.  “The new patients had gone to Delhi and other states. We are monitoring them closely and are already creating a database. Focused testing of those showing symptoms is being carried out in these hotspots,” the CMO added. Apart from these two zones, other areas which have reported more than 1,000 new cases in the nine days include Wazirabad (2,970), Patel Nagar (1,731), Bhangrola (1,552), Laxman Vihar (1,527), Badshapur (1,392), Rajiv Nagar (1,194), Mullahera (1,100) and Firoz Gandhi Colony (1,018). The health department said entire families are getting infected as patients are hardly following home isolation norms.  Response teams are monitoring the condition of each patient daily, officials said, adding that this will be followed till the situation improves. Gurugram has been witnessing a surge in cases from March 25, which is expected to continue till May 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/30-of-covid-cases-in-may-from-2-zones-with-most-condominiums/articleshow/82536901.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Mumbai||BMC seeks walk-in vax quota for frontline/health workers||MUMBAI: The vaccination drive in the city for those aged 45 and above is likely to be limited to a few centres on Tuesday as the civic body didn’t receive any doses from the state. The BMC has also asked individual vaccination centres to fix a quota to be given to walk-in frontline and healthcare workers, as many with online appointments have complained that doses were running out before their turn. Civic officials confirmed that after receiving 38,000 doses on Saturday, they have not received any on Sunday or Monday. A total of 50,674 people was vaccinated in these two days. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said that only those centres with leftover doses after Monday’s vaccination will provide the jabs on Tuesday. In addition, a dozen new municipal vaccination centres that are opening on Tuesday will be administering vaccines as doses were set aside for them. “If we don’t get any doses on Tuesday, it may be difficult to hold a drive on Wednesday,” she added.No Covaxin doses were administered in the city on Sunday and Monday, while Gomare said even for Tuesday, there were very limited doses. The BMC, which announces the opening of online slots for 45-plus on Twitter, didn’t notify anything till midnight. For 18-44, the slots opened after 9 pm and were filled up in less than 2 hours. Meanwhile, the BMC is having discussions to write to the Centre to allow walk-ins for a small percentage of recipients for the age bracket of 18-44. An official said that they were toying with the idea of asking for 5%-10% walk-ins that can be used by those in an emergency. “Say some student wants to go abroad for studies and needs a dose urgently, such a provision could be helpful,” the official said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that they were holding internal discussions, and a decision would be taken in a few days on whether to ask for exceptions. After a dip to 19,631 on Saturday, the city’s vaccination turnout increased to 31,043 on Monday. Vaccination had dropped to 1,10,448 in the state on Saturday from an average of 2.5-3 lakh vaccinations in the past week. A state official said that with the 7 lakh doses received on Sunday, the state’s drive could continue for three days. In Mumbai though, many centres said that the footfall has dropped partly due to shortage of doses but also because of the issues around online appointment bookings. Kamothe resident Sumeet Vaishnav (42) had an appointment at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) vaccination centre on Saturday. However, on reaching there and standing in the queue, he was informed that vaccines were over. “We were given a chit and asked to come on Monday. We again travelled all the way but were refused entry with a fresh appointment,” he said. Dr Gomare said centres have been directed to fix a quota so that all doses are not exhausted for healthcare workers and frontline workers walking in. A centre in-charge, however, said that may create chaos again as people may have to be turned away. At the vaccination centre started at Gokuldham maternity home in Goregaon, BJP corporator Priti Satam alleged fewer than 200 people are getting vaccinated. “Till last week, BMC was vaccinating 400 people daily, now numbers have dropped as people are unable to book a slot online,” she said, pointing to empty chairs kept outside the vaccination centre. Officials from P South ward, however, blamed it on vaccine shortage and not the online system. “Every day there is a session created for the number of persons that can be vaccinated, and on Monday, 169 persons could be vaccinated based on the online session that was created,” said an official. Slots are opened depending on vaccine doses available with the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-seeks-walk-in-vax-quota-for-frontline/health-workers/articleshow/82536903.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In another raid three people, including an owner of a medicine shop were arrested from Sector 16 and police recovered 4 vials of Remdesivir injections. The accused has a pharmacy near Sarvoday Hospital. A case was registered at Sector 17 police station under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal investigation) of the IPC and relevant sections of Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940, Essential Commodities Act, 1955, and Disaster Management Act, 2005, in Faridabad. “We got information about black marketing of Remdesvir. After getting their contact details, a cop acting as a customer contacted them. After discussion they agreed to give him one vial for Rs 30,000. We set up our team and as soon as they arrived we arrested them,” said the officer, adding that the seven were taken on police remand for further investigation. On May 7, the crime branch of Faridabad police arrested a former Congress worker, who had earlier contested assembly election as an independent, for allegedly selling oxygen cylinders in black market. A police team seized around 50 oxygen cylinders from his home at Indra Complex in Faridabad. Inspector Pradeep Mor, in-charge of the crime unit of sector 17 of Faridabad, said they received information on oxygen cylinders being sold by the accused at an exorbitant rate. Acting on the tip-off, they raided the house of Mawi in Indra Complex and found 50 oxygen cylinders loaded in a mini truck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/four-nursing-staff-3-others-held-for-black-marketing-remdesivir/articleshow/82536964.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra curbs averted 19,000 deaths, 3.8m cases: IISc||MUMBAI: Even as Maharashtra recorded its lowest single-day Covid-19 tally—37,236—in 41 days on Monday, the state’s handling of the second wave came in for praise from one of the country’s premier scientific institutes, the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Dr Sashikumaar Ganesan, who handles the institute’s Covid dashboard, told TOI that the state’s exceptional measures saved around 19,000 lives in the second wave. The model shows that the state escaped an additional burden of 3.8 million cases too. In April, the Maharashtra government imposed 24x7 prohibitory orders, banned dining-in at restaurants, and closed temples and malls when the second wave’s ferocity became apparent; over half a lakh cases have been detected on most days since April 9. On April 4, 11,206 cases were detected in Mumbai, three times the highest single-day tally during the first wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Mumbai registered only 1,782 cases, the lowest daily tally in 76 days. Deaths in both Maharashtra and Mumbai continued to be high at 549 and 74, respectively. Ganesan’s team released its latest data on Monday, comparing the actual data from states with a national trend that their mathematical model devised. The impact of 15 days of lockdown in Maharashtra has not only saved 19,000 lives, but also averted 3.8 million cases, according to the IISc model. As per the model, while the national trend curve had predicted a death toll of 95,300 deaths in Maharashtra on May 9, the actual toll stood at 75,850. While the national trend anticipated Maharashtra’s caseload to climb to 8.9 million on May 9, the actual caseload is 5.1 million. “While Maharashtra has done better than the national projections, other states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala have done worse than the projections,” said Ganesan. The IISc team has recommended lockdown-like restrictions in these states to save thousands of lives by May-end. A BMC hospital doctor attributed the sharp drop in caseload in both Maharashtra and Mumbai on Monday to the weekend effect with fewer tests. In Mumbai, only 23,061 tests were carried out on Sunday as against the average of 35,000 over the weekdays. In Maharashtra, too, only 1.9 lakh tests were carried out against 2.5 lakh on an average daily. The state reported a drop in fatalities too, fewer than 600 deaths for the second consecutive day. With the addition of 549 deaths, the total toll of the state rose to 76,398 with 51.3 lakh cases. With the dip in daily detections, the daily case fatality rate rose to 1.4%. A senior state official said with the surge in cities slowing, cases are rapidly going up in the smaller districts. There are nearly seven districts in the state that have imposed local lockdowns in their area to break the spread. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Monday announced 10-day stricter curbs in Nashik city from May 12. And Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation has decided to extend the week-long curbs imposed from May 3 for five more days. At the state level, Latur circle recorded the highest deaths--133 and only 2765 cases were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-curbs-averted-19k-deaths-3-8m-cases-iisc/articleshow/82536986.cms||Malathy Iyer

There are around 25 such hospitals in the city. In an order issued recently, hospitals have been told that the OAP should be a doctor, who will get reported upon by an oxygen audit team (OAT) comprising senior nurses, biomedical and paramedical staff. The team will work to promote judicious use of oxygen and prevent oxygen wastage. The OAP and OAT will monitor leakage in the centralised oxygen distribution system and supply to unused areas such as operation theatres. The teams will work to prevent oxygen wastage by stopping high flow in cases where the patient is not in bed. Trainable patients will also be taught how to stop oxygen flow in such cases. “The hospitals will conduct training of the OAT, in which they will be sensitised about the current oxygen demand-supply gap; basics of pulse oximetry and its limitations; how oxygen levels fluctuate depending on various scenarios; modes of oxygen delivery and their utility for Covid-19 treatment,” said Municipal Corporation of Manesar commissioner Munish Sharma, who is also the nodal officer for Gurgaon’s Covid bed management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/set-up-team-to-audit-o2-use-hospitals-told/articleshow/82536994.cms||Vishakha Chaman

There was a five-minute lag in reloading the oxygen cylinder that caused the pressure to drop, resulting in the deaths, he said. "The oxygen supply was restored within five minutes and everything is now normal.Because of this we could prevent more casualties," Hari Narayanan added. About 30 doctors were immediately rushed into the ICU to attend to the patients. The Collector said there was no scarcity of oxygen in the hospital and adequate supply was in place. In all, about 700 Covid-19 patients were undergoing treatment in the ICU and oxygen beds in Ruia while another 300 were in normal wards. Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed grief over the incident. He spoke to the district collector and directed that a detailed investigation be conducted into the incident.

The CM, who was inspecting the upcoming Covid care centre at Ramlila Ground near GTB Hospital with health minister Satyendar Jain, said by Tuesday, 500 ICU beds would be ready at the centre, apart from 500 ICU beds at a similar facility near LNJP at the main Ramlila Ground in a few days. 500 ICU beds have been constructed in 2 weeks at Ramlila Maidan opp. GTB hospital.

However, the scale at which we are preparing our infrastructure and executing the same, even if 30,000 cases come up in the next wave, we are ready to deal with it,” he said. The CM said there had been a great need for ICU beds during the second wave so the new ICU beds had been set up. “Only monitors are left to be set up, which, too, will be made available by tonight,” he added. “A similar 500-bed ICU centre will be set up at the Ramlila Maidan in front of LNJP Hospital within two-three days. It is hoped that these 1,000 operational ICU beds will meet the needs of Delhi,” Kejriwal said. The CM claimed that by Monday evening, the city was likely to receive 1,000 oxygen cylinders, and in the next three-four days, additional oxygen cylinders would arrive. “We are creating new oxygen beds across the city, and hope that Delhi will no longer see any shortage of beds,” the CM said. “Oxygen tanks have been installed outside and are to expend 22 metric tonnes oxygen, which is expected to reduce the scarcity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ready-for-the-next-wave-putting-infra-in-place-cm/articleshow/82537236.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Any overzealous, though well-meaning, judicial intervention may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences, in absence of any expert advice or administrative experience, leaving doctors, scientists, experts and the executive very little room to find innovative solutions on the go,” the Centre said. The first signs of a push back against the SC's expanding superintendence of oxygen distribution emerged as the Centre in its affidavit said it was withholding details sought by the apex court and leaving a decision on this issue to the national task force set up by an SC bench headed. The task force comprises experts drawn from various cities. “In view of the constitution of an NTF and its terms and references, the central government respectfully defers its response on the issues mentioned in the SC order pertaining to generation, availability, procurement, allocation, supply, logistical plans for transportation of oxygen to states, its delivery by states to its hospitals and the manner of its administration to Covid-19 patients,” the Centre said, the reverential phraseology barely camouflaging its angst over the SC’s suo motu proceedings. Read Also13 core Covid-19 vaccine doses will be produced per month by July: Govt to SCThe Union government has informed the Supreme Court that vaccine production in India will be ramped up to more than 13 crore doses per month by the end of July while negating the court’s suggestions for door-to-door vaccination. The govt said that support for one private industry and three publicThe bench in its April 30 and May 6 orders asked the Centre many questions — from nationalisation of vaccination to supply of essential medicines. The government viewed this as an interference by judiciary in policy decisions worked out in consultation between the central and state governments and domain experts. Seeking executive discretion and policy framework to deal with the situation, the Centre said, “In times of such unprecedented crisis, the executive functioning of the government needs discretion to formulate policy in the larger interest. In view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which the vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the wisdom of the executive should be trusted.” The Centre did explain its vaccination policy and said, “As per medical advice and global policy, it is settled across the world that the age group above 45 years is especially vulnerable to Covid-19. In light of the same, it has been decided that the vaccination of this group (above 45 years) is absolutely imperative. Since vaccination of the entire country is not possible in one stretch due to the very suddenness of the pandemic, limited availability of vaccine doses and vulnerability as the prime consideration, the policy is framed as above which is just, equitable, non-discriminatory and based upon an intelligible differentiating factor between the two age groups." “This policy conforms to the mandate of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution and is made after several rounds of consultation and discussion with experts, state governments and vaccine manufacturers requiring no interference by SC as while dealing with a pandemic of this magnitude, the executive does have room for free play in the joints, in larger public interest.” Though the Centre went through the motion of acknowledging the SC’s role in scrutinising the executive’s work, it was of the firm opinion that the judiciary lacked the necessary expertise or wherewithal to address, even on a strategy level, the challenges posed by the pandemic, which is propelled by mutated versions of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-pushes-back-at-sc-warns-of-overzealous-judicial-intervention/articleshow/82537296.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||Delhi: Nod to vaccination for 18+ at 33 corporation schools||New Delhi: After repeated requests, the three municipal corporations have finally got permission from Delhi government to start the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-44 years age group at 33 primary schools from Monday. NEW DELHI: This includes 15 centres under North Delhi Municipal Corporation, 11 under the south corporation and seven under the east corporation. In the New Delhi Municipal Council area, such facilities are available at two schools, Atal Adarsh Vidyalaya in Moti Bagh and Navyug School at SP Marg. The services could not start at many centres due to lack of arrangements and the corporations said these would definitely be ready by Tuesday. In the east corporation, the drive started at four centres, including Pocket A-3 at Mayur Vihar Phase III, Shri Ram Colony, Karawal Nagar West and Trilokpuri, Block-27. “Rest of the three centres at South Gandhi Nagar, East Old Seelampur and New Bholanath Nagar primary schools will start from May 11,” said mayor Nirmal Jain. The sites were approved by Delhi Disaster Management Authority. The corporation is providing school premises and staff, including nurses and doctors, said Jain. “We preferred polyclinics and maternity centres where all services would have been easily accessible but still we are glad that Delhi government paid heed to our demand and started vaccination at primary schools in neighbourhoods areas,” he added. Since vaccines are in short supply, on average 150 people are being inoculated at each centre, said Jain. “People will need to book the slot on Co-Win app. As soon as the supply increases, it is assumed that the number of stations would increase at each of the centres,” he added. In north Delhi, four sites where vaccination started were Rani Bagh, Wazirpur, Ashok Vihar and Jharoda. “We received the order on Monday morning but still managed to provide all facilities. As soon as vaccines are supplied, the drive will start at the rest,” said mayor Jai Prakash. In south Delhi, the vaccination drive started at 11 schools, including three in Central zone, 2 in South, four in Najafgarh and 2 in West zone. “If adequate supply of vaccine is made by Delhi government, each of the 11 centres can administer 750 doses every day and overall more than 8,250 people can be vaccinated,” said mayor Anamika Mithlesh after visiting the centres. On the first day, 130 people took their first dose at the centre located at SDMC School Jaitpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nod-to-vax-for-18-at-33-corpn-schools/articleshow/82537388.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||BJP rejects Delhi government’s claim on vaccine orders||NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday asked the AAP government in Delhi to explain as to how many vaccines it has actually ordered with party spokesperson Sambit Patra releasing copies of letters which said that the state plans to procure vaccines from Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech rather than concrete requests for supply. Patra shared two letters of the Delhi government dated April 26, and claimed that they are about intent to procure the two vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — 67 lakh doses each but not placing orders. “Read both these letters released by AAP Govt, carefully, you would find that these are not ‘letters of placing the ORDER’ of 1.34 crore vaccines as said by CM Kejriwal. At best these letters are “Letters of INTENT” ( ...we are planning to procure) Can’t pass these as orders!!” Patra said. Patra noted that Kejriwal had claimed on April 26 that his government will order 1.34 crore vaccines, which is worth nearly Rs 1,400 crore. "Today, he's saying he has nothing. Only 8.93% people over 45 years have got their second dose in Delhi. Only 48.03% people over 60 years have received their first dose. Only 17% people over 60 years have received a second dose," he said. Patra alleged that the Delhi government didn't give a timely push to the vaccination process and was now doing politics over the availability of oxygen. Citing an interview of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal in which he rejected suggestions that the Centre is to blame for oxygen crisis and said states are primarily responsible for making arrangement for the life-saving gas, the BJP spokesperson said Kejriwal made little efforts to augment its availability in the national capital. Despite funding from the PM-Cares Fund for setting up oxygen plants, the Delhi government failed to start any because it could not provide any site, he alleged. Patra also hit out at the AAP government over an alleged rape at Tikri border, where farmers'' protest has been continuing, alleging that the name of one of its workers has cropped up, and he has been missing. Despite repeated attempts from TOI, there was no response available from the AAP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-rejects-delhi-govts-claim-on-vaccine-orders/articleshow/82537443.cms||---

The cumulative data from the three civic bodies showed that, between April 1 and 30, the nine Covid-designated funeral centres under South Delhi Municipal Corporation oversaw 3,931 cremations and burials, while 14 centres under North Delhi Municipal Corporation witnessed 3,978 Covid funerals. During the same period, the east body recorded 1,523 Covid funerals, leading to a cumulative Covid funeral count to 9,432. Nigambodh Ghat under the north civic body and Punjabi Bagh Shamshan under SDMC had been the two busiest sites. In April, the official Covid fatality count in the health department’s Delhi state health bulletin increased from 11,036 on April 1 to 16,147 on April 30 — an increase 5,111 bodies. A senior official said the Covid protocol cremations were carried out with a series of precautions mandated by the health ministry to minimise the risk of spread of the infection.  “In cases where the test results are still awaited or tests could not be carried out but patient shows symptoms, the hospitals send the bodies with Covid suspect tag. The suspect bodies are also laid to rest with the same procedure,” the official added. For instance, EDMC saw 1,523 Covid funerals, of which 1,219 were Covid confirmed, while 304 were under suspected category. Another public health official said the real count of the Covid fatalities was likely to be much higher. “With hospital beds full and lack of access to ICUs, many people are now dying at home and cremating the bodies under the normal non-Covid categories. There has been a significant increase in the non-Covid funerals, too, at many sites,” the official added. After having peaked at 717 Covid protocol funerals on April 29, the number has consistently fallen in the past 11 days. On Sunday, 431 Covid protocol funerals were carried out till 7pm.

Though the exact number of casualties was yet to be officially announced, sources confirmed to TOI that 11 patients had died in the brief disruption in oxygen. Government claimed that the supply was affected for just a few minutes during which time the tragedy took place. Relatives of some of the patients, however, claimed that supply was disrupted for at least 25 minutes. There are about 135 ICU beds and 400-plus oxygen beds at the hospital where some 1,100 Covid-19 patients have been admitted at present. Sources told TOI that the 10,000 litres capacity oxygen tank at the hospital was nearly empty and was being refilled after a tanker arrived from Tamil Nadu. The refilling process led to interruption in oxygen supply and during this time the condition of several critical patients deteriorated. Their attendants desperately tried in vain to keep them alive by using hand fans and other desperate means. Videos coming out of the hospital showed a number of patients lying lifeless on beds even as people run around trying to help them with hand pumps and other equipment. District collector M Hari Narayana rushed to the hospital after learning of the tragedy. He has asked the police to probe if there was any attempt to sabotage the oxygen supply. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed shock at the death of the 11 patients and asked for a report from officials. He also ordered all collectors to keep an eye on oxygen supply in all hospitals in their districts and ensure that such tragedies don’t take place. The chief minister sought a detailed report on the incident by Tuesday morning. Earlier, officials of the CMO briefed Jagan on the incident. Health minister Alla Kalikrishna Srinivas spoke with the officials of Chittoor district and the staff of the Ruia Hospital and asked to take required steps to restore oxygen supply to the inpatients.

Especially during my pregnancy,” she is heard saying in the video. “I did not want this to happen and took all precautions, but here I am. I want to run, walk, be active and here my body is giving up due to Covid. Everyone please think about your family members, old people, pregnant women, who are more susceptible to the virus, and wear a mask whenever you interact with them.” The 2-minutes-32-seconds-long video was made by Dipika to warn others of the ruthlessness of the Covid virus.  Chawla told TOI, “We live in Surya Niketan in east Delhi with my parents. On April 11, Dipika had a mild fever. We initially thought it was viral, but being a doctor herself she was suspicious and we immediately got ourselves tested. My three-and-half-year-old son and she proved positive, while I was negative. Since my parents are old and my father is a heart patient, we decided to move to her parents’ house in Faridabad, where we isolated ourselves on the first floor. When her oxygen dipped, we rushed her to the hospital.” The gynaecologist checked Dipika on April 24. She started bleeding soon after that. “She had labour pains the next day but the ultrasound showed the baby had died in the womb,” said Chawla. “The pulmonologist told us that we needed to take the baby out via Caesarean section and that Dipika needed to be told about the baby to prepare her from slipping into shock. She kept asking about the baby. At one point, I lied that she had delivered a boy. Her oxygen level improved, but I don’t know what went wrong after that. She passed away on April 26.” Chawla claimed he wanted to upload the video on Twitter for the world to know that the Covid virus had to be taken seriously and to tell his son that his mother was a hero. “My son asks about her every day,” Chawla said. “His questions haunt me. I can’t even cry in front of him. I don't have an answer and I think I never will have one.” Another video has NCR-based make-up artist Srishti Bhardwaj talking about her Covid journey. In the 14-minutes video on Instagram, Bhardwaj speaks about the different days and different symptoms she suffered. “I had gone to my brother’s house in Badaun and thought I had caught a cold. I used Vicks on my nose and realised I couldn’t smell it. When I asked my niece, who stays with me, to smell it, she couldn’t either. I realised something was wrong,” Bhardwaj told TOI. In the video recorded during her isolation days, Bhardwaj says, “I had tea which felt like water, food felt like salty water, no taste and no smell. I felt weak and couldn’t even take a shower. Even a little work made me feel tired. We had to make a chart of our medications. Please don’t take Covid lightly.

The decision was taken in the wake of severe supply crunch of vaccines locally and government insisting the local production be supplied to protect Indians first. States have been prompted to approach the Pune-based company to negotiate contracts to procure these doses to meet local demand. The doses are likely to be used to vaccinate those between 18-44 age. “These 50 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine are now available for inoculating people between 18-44 years age. States have been asked to procure it. Private hospitals can also get them,” an official source said. The ministry has asked the states to contact the company and initiate procurement activity at the earliest. However, sources said, the labels of these doses may have to be changed. Since the vaccines were packed for supply to the UK, a different label was affixed on the vials but now since they have to be supplied in the local market, they need a label for the same.

The cabinet meeting, to be chaired by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, is likely to discuss Ramzan festival which falls on May 14 and likely impact on Eid-ul-Fitr if the lockdown is imposed. There is speculation that if the government were to impose lockdown, it would come into force after Ramzan. Sources told TOI that despite pressure from different quarters, KCR is still hesitant about a complete lockdown. But a clear picture will emerge only after Tuesday's meeting. The chief minister’s office (CMO) on Monday said: “There are reports which suggest that despite certain states imposing the lockdown there is no decrease in the positive cases. Against this backdrop, different opinions are emerging on the lockdown. Some sections are arguing in favour of imposition of lockdown. Under these circumstances, the state cabinet will discuss the pros and cons of the lockdown and also the adverse impact it may have on the ongoing procurement of paddy and take a decision.” All the southern states, except Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, have already imposed a total lockdown for a few days. While Telangana has been implementing the night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am for the past two weeks, AP had announced a partial lockdown from 12 noon to 6 am. Just last week, KCR had ruled out imposition of lockdown in Telangana, saying it would affect the livelihoods of people and also impact revenues of the state. The CM also pointed out that despite clamping lockdown there was no improvement in the situation in several states as positive cases have not come down. KCR said 25 lakh to 30 lakh workers’ lives will be at stake. “We have seen how their lives were adversely impacted by the lockdown in the first wave. If they are dislocated, they will not come back. Moreover, the state is having a bumper yield of paddy and 6,144 procurement centres are purchasing the grain. The entire paddy purchasing process will come to a standstill if lockdown is imposed,” he had said then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-cabinet-meet-today-kcr-may-take-a-call-on-lockdown/articleshow/82537582.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Wrestler death: Lookout notice against Sushil||NEW DELHI: A lookout circular has been issued against wrestler Sushil Kumar for allegedly thrashing to death a 23-year-old wrestler, Sagar Dhankad, and assaulting two of his friends inside Chhatrasal Stadium on Tuesday in northwest Delhi. Dhankad, son of a Delhi Police head constable, had succumbed to his injuries a day after the incident. His friend, Sonu, who was admitted for treatment, had named Kumar and his aides as the assailants in his statement to the police. The cops, during preliminary probe, had found that the fight between the two groups started over a flat in Model Town, which was owned by Kumar but Dhankad used to live in it. Police had then registered a case of murder and started a manhunt for Kumar and others in the case. Six days on, Delhi Police on Monday said they have issued a lookout circular against the Olympian, Kumar. “An LOC has been issued. Teams are also conducting raids in Delhi and the neighbouring states. We have possible leads and the suspects will soon be arrested,” said a senior police officer. So far, police have arrested only one person, Prince Dalal, a resident of Jhajjar, in the murder case. Following Dalal’s arrest, the police had recovered a video from his phone in which Kumar and others were seen assaulting Dhankad and his friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wrestler-death-lookout-notice-against-sushil/articleshow/82537583.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notices to the Union ministries of home affairs, women and child development and health, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi and the city police, seeking their stand on one of the petitions that has also asked for financial assistance for the families of the patients who died due to the alleged denial of healthcare such as hospital admissions, oxygen and medications. The court further also asked the Centre, Delhi government, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to respond to another PIL seeking an action plan or guidelines for rehabilitating abandoned children and children whose parents have succumbed to Covid-19 or any other causes in order to prevent child-trafficking during the pandemic and regulate the adoption procedure of such children in compliance with the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. The first petition filed by advocate Jeetender Gupta has sought directions to the authorities to provide the interim custody of such children to their nearest relatives or child-care homes and protect their identity. In his plea, Gupta wants the authorities to explore the options for legal adoptions. The second PIL filed by advocate Anand has claimed agencies do not have any data on the number of children whose parents have succumbed to Covid, and it says that in the absence of the data, these kids have become a target for traffickers. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pleas-to-protect-covid-orphans-from-trafficking/articleshow/82537613.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Telangana cops turn away Covid-19 patients from Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD/VIJAYAWADA: Dozens of ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients from Andhra Pradesh to Hyderabad were turned away at three border check posts for not having advanced bed bookings in Telangana hospitals. Patients and their attendants were shocked about the new rules being imposed by Telangana police at check posts in Krishna, Guntur and Kurnool. “It has been observed that several Covid-19 patients are going to Hyderabad in ambulances without making prior arrangements for beds in hospitals. After reaching the city they keep travelling from one hospital to another in the ambulance searching for oxygen beds and ventilators with patients in critical condition. To avoid such situations, we are allowing only those who have arranged with a hospital in advance for treatment,” Jogulamba Gadwal DSP Ranjan Ratan Kumar told TOI. On average, 200 coronavirus patients from different parts of Andhra Pradesh come to Telangana daily for treatment, and the numbers seem to have increased due to the lockdown in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. From Monday morning, Telangana police and health department and revenue officials started inspecting ambulances entering the state at various inter-state borders, especially the Andhra-Telangana border at Ramapuram in Kodad, and Pulloor toll plaza area in Jogulamba-Gadwal district where most of the vehicles coming from Rayalaseema districts enter Telangana. Police in Kodad, Suryapet district, which shares a border with Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, and police at Hudnoor, Sangareddy district, close to Karnataka’s Bidar town, and Mancherial district police, who face a lot of traffic from Chandrapur area of Maharashtra, are also checking ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients and turning them back if the patients don’t have prior arrangements with local hospitals in Telangana. While police officers privately said the health-department-initiated move was to stop the overflow of patients with a "virulent strain" of Covid-19 from entering Telangana, scientists at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) said there was a common strain in the twin states and the rest was rumour. Repeated calls and text messages on this issue to chief secretary Somesh Kumar, who is directly supervising the health department, went unanswered. Harried local police in Andhra Pradesh, meanwhile, got in touch with their Telangana counterparts to allow those who were on oxygen support and in critical condition to pass through. Kurnool SP Kaginelli Fakeerappa spoke with Jogulamba Gadwal district SP R Ratan Kumar, requesting him to permit emergency patients into Telangana. Some ambulances were later allowed to enter the state. However, at Garikapadu check post in Guntur, several ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients, including those on liquid oxygen support, were sent back after they failed to show bed confirmation proof. An advisory was later issued citing the rules framed by Telangana authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-beds-t-cops-turn-away-covid-19-patients-from-ap/articleshow/82539260.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Delhi||Metro pause leaves those engaged in essential services in the lurch||New Delhi: With the Delhi Metro coming to a halt following an extension of the lockdown in the capital with stricter restrictions, many people engaged in essential services, particularly healthcare personnel, took to social media to complain that going to work has become a harrowing experience for them. Last year, the Metro service was shut down for 169 days during the national lockdown and was reopened gradually from September 7, 2020. On Monday, it was shut down again. Sources in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), however, said that in the last three weeks, footfall was very low as only those engaged in essential services or exempted from the lockdown restrictions were allowed to travel after producing a valid ID. According to sources, Metro’s ‘passenger journeys’ ranged between 15 lakh and 20 lakh a day before the fresh lockdown was imposed. The average passenger journey between April 20 and May 8, however, was just 2.3 lakh. Though the numbers were low, for many of these passengers, travelling by the Metro was the only option. “I am a banker and I have to attend office despite the lockdown or curfew. Without Metro, I have faced so much trouble commuting from Noida to Delhi. Please start Metro services ASAP,” tweeted KM Sharfani, a commuter, adding that Metro could have been allowed to operate for during morning and evening peak hours. He also said that autorickshaw drivers were fleecing those who had to go to work. “Is Metro service available for healthcare workers (hospital staff) or it’s suspended for everyone?” tweeted Rahul R Nath. Another commuter, Rakesh Kumar, wrote that middle-class commuters engaged in essential services can’t spend on cab rides every day and were dependent on Delhi Metro. “Why did you not suspend the bus service? Moreover, how will the hospital staff be travelling to the hospital... we don’t have any mode of transportation. Hospitals are not organising any mode of transportation neither is the government,” tweeted Fahmida Nasreen. Although a large number of passengers using the Metro are likely to switch to buses for their daily commute, the reduced frequency of buses due to lower footfall might not be increased immediately. “Already, 1,655 cluster buses are in operation but don’t have many passengers throughout the day. We will immediately increase frequency in case there is any increase in passengers of exempted category on any route,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-pause-leaves-those-engaged-in-essential-services-in-the-lurch/articleshow/82537668.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Army jawan pedals 24,000km to spread word on immunity||HYDERABAD: Having gone through some tough training ahead of his first posting as an Army jawan, 24-year-old Jittaboina Bharath should have rested when he returned to his village in Mahbubabad district of Telangana for a break last month. Instead, he has taken on a new fight - telling people on the importance of staying fit and building up immunity in the midst of the pandemic. Part of the Madras Regiment, Bharath has cycled nearly 2,400 kilometres across 33 districts of Telangana creating awareness on the importance of immunity. He started his journey on April 26 and concluded it on May 9 in Hyderabad. He sees this as a battle he must fight before reporting back to duty on May 25 at Sikkim. “I noticed that everyone was scared because of the pandemic. Through my actions, I wanted to tell them that by improving their immunity they will be better prepared to fight Covid-19. Battles are all about being ready with the right tools,” said Bharath, who had joined the Army in 2020 and recently completed his training. He started cycling from Jangoan district, a place from where he completed his graduation and joined Fit India Foundation. On an average he covered about 170 km each day. Bharath said that in every district he used to make a quick stop at the Babasaheb Ambedkar statue to interact with members of the Fit India Foundation and locals and talk to them about the importance of physical activities. I used to start my journey at 4 am every day and would continue until 11.30 am. Afternoons were dedicated to resting. The journey was again resumed at 4 pm and is concluded by 8 pm,” said Bharath, a resident of Sadireddy Palli. An alumnus of ABV Government Degree College, he carried a mask and sanitizer with him and would buy mineral water along the way. “Families of Fit India Foundation took care of my meals,” he added. “I took all precautions in my journey,” he said. He said that hailing from an economically backward family, he is aware that not everyone can consume nutritious food to improve immunity. “But we can sweat it out by doing work, yoga, or exercise, which in turn is going to make us physically fit and improve immunity,” said Bharath.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Incomes already halved, cabbies find going even tougher||NEW DELHI: “I have just two options — go back to my village and leave the life I have built here bit by bit in the last two decades or end my life to end all miseries,” said Tapan Adhikari, a 39-year-old cab driver from Nadia district in West Bengal. Adhikari is just one of the thousands of cab drivers in Delhi-NCR who have been hit hard by the Covid lockdown, necessitated by an exponential surge in Covid-19 cases. TimesViewDriving a cab is risky in times of an epidemic. Cab drivers should be listed in the priority group for vaccination. This will not only enhance their safety, it will protect passengers too from what could otherwise be a risky setting. Knowing the driver is vaccinated would also raise the commuter's confidence, which should lead to more rides and indirectly help the economy.Drivers, many of whom had bought cars on loan to work as part of app-based platforms of cab aggregators, are finding it difficult to pay the EMIs. Cab drivers have seen their income nosedive ever since Covid-19 has hit the capital last March. Even as they were somehow managing, the current wave in Delhi again led to a sharp decline in the number of customers while the lockdown has come as yet another blow. “Whatever little saving I had has been spent on putting food on the table and if this lockdown continues, I will have no other option but to start selling the utensils and little furniture that I have,” said Pradeep Kumar (41), a resident of north Delhi’s Jahangirpuri who is the sole earning member of the family comprising his parents, wife and two children. “All cab drivers barring a few who have some financial support are running out of money to feed their families,” said Kumar, who, hoping for a better life, had bought a car on loan four years ago. “The dreams of high income shown by the cab aggregators is very far from the harsh reality. Now if I don’t pay the instalments it would lead to losing all the money I have paid till date and also the cab.” Kamaljeet Gill, president of Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi, said those who could had moved on to doing odd jobs just to sustain themselves. “For more than a year, a large chunk of our customers are working from home, which has made a big dent in our earnings. Now it seems this lockdown will continue for two months, one week at a time,” Gill said. “Most drivers don’t have money for food and the Rs 5,000 promised by the Kejriwal government has come as a huge relief. For those not earning anything, this amount is a life saver and no other government has helped drivers so much,” he said. “We now want all our pending taxes, fees and other charges waived off and want the central government to direct banks to give some relief from monthly instalments till we start earning again.” Adhikari, who used to work in a shoe factory after arriving in Delhi in 2002, soon took to driving and bought his own car on loan five years ago. “The last one year has seen all my savings getting depleted. Even the neighbourhood grocery store owners have stopped providing food items on credit.” “I am unable to provide two full meals to my wife and three children and haven’t sent any money back home to my ailing mother and widowed sister. I don’t know what to tell them,” he said. “Driving is all that I know and at this age, who will give me another job?” Adhikari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/incomes-already-halved-cabbies-find-going-even-tougher/articleshow/82537672.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: 7 disappointing turns as Covid cancels nuptials||NEW DELHI: Abhinav Singh postponed his marriage three times, but says that since his uncle runs the banquet hall they had reserved for the abortive nuptials, his family did not face penal setbacks when cancelling the bookings.  The first time, the wedding was cancelled due to the rising Covid-19 cases, the second when both Singh and his bride tested Covid-positive and the third was due to the lockdown. He is determined not to cancel the fourth, on May 14, the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritya. And because the current lockdown ends only on May 17, he will marry at home. Many couples are caught in the same dilemma. With the lockdown a dampener, they are either postponing their weddings or considering their homes as their most appropriate wedding venue, even if it means foregoing some of the lavishness of a normal wedding. Swati Subramaniam, 25, shifted to Delhi three years ago, met the man she wanted to marry and fixed the wedding for 2020. But Covid pushed the plans to March 2021. “We booked the caterers, venue, entertainers, everything and had to cancel it at the last moment. Our parents lost a lot of money,” said Subramaniam. “When we decided on a new date, we resolved it would be final. Now this lockdown has come, so we will get married on my groom’s terrace.” “My wife-to-be and I have been arranging things for our wedding for a year now,” said an exasperated Ahluwalia. “We first wanted to get married on February 16, which was an auspicious date, but dropped the plan since a close relative was getting married that day. The next date we chose was April 21, but since more than half of our family members tested positive for Covid, we had to let go of that date too. Our third option was Akshaya Tritya on May 14, but given the uncertainty due to the lockdown and the current Covid situation, we had to cancel that as well.” A 34-year-old looking forward to married life too has been left disappointed by the lockdown. “My parents had been looking for a groom for five years, but nobody seemed to want to get married to me, perhaps because of my squint eyes,” said the woman, preferring to remain unnamed. “Finally, when things had fallen into place and I was ready for the mandap, the pandemic took such a turn that my wedding date had to be put off. This is the second time when the ceremony was cancelled, and our pandit says that there is no auspicious date for us for at least four months now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/7-disappointing-turns-as-covid-cancels-nuptials/articleshow/82537677.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Probe into vaccination certificates ‘mixup’ at Cama hospital||MUMBAI: State medical education minister Amit Deshmukh has ordered a probe into a “mixup” of vaccination certificates at Cama Hospital days after senior citizens received texts that they had been successfully vaccinated there, even though they had been turned back without jabs as the stock had dried up, reports Chaitanya Marpakwar. The CoWin app generated their vaccination certificates. TOI had reported on the false certificates issued this past Friday. MLAs have called for an audit of the drive as certificate mix-up cases grow, alleging there’s a vaccine “ghotala” (scam) in the making.“We will probe the issue. I will ask the J J Hospital dean to submit a report on the vaccine certificates mixup. We will check if this was a data entry error or a software glitch. We will take strictest action against those responsible for this,” Deshmukh told TOI on Monday.While there have been several instances of senior citizens getting vaccination certificates without getting their jabs, there are also cases of many who received theirs more than 10 days after taking their shots. The certificates do not reflect the actual date of vaccination, which, seniors say, may create hurdles when they take their second jab. “There must be a detailed audit of the vaccination drive. It seems there is a vaccine ‘ghotala’ at Cama Hospital and other locations where such bogus certificates have been generated. A 53-year-old Mulund woman was to go for vaccination at a BMC-run centre in Vikhroli on Saturday but fell sick. The next day she got a certificate that she had been vaccinated,” said Mihir Kotecha, BJP MLA, Mulund. SP MLA Rais Shaikh said there were several complaints from Cama Hospital. “There must be a detailed audit of vaccine wastage at Cama and the total number of frontline and healthcare workers who have been vaccinated there. The medical superintendent must be suspended,” Shaikh said. “This is a technical issue related to data entry or a software glitch. We have given letters to all those who have not taken the jabs and yet got their certificates that they haven’t been vaccinated. We did not enter the mobile numbers of those who went away from outside. So there was no chance of registering them. We will fix the glitches soon,” said Dr Tushar Palave, medical superintendent of Cama Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/probe-into-vax-cert-mixup-at-cama-hosp/articleshow/82537903.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Business||Agree to terms or face limited functions: WhatsApp||NEW DELHI: You won't be able to access your chat list on WhatsApp and may have "limited functionality" on the country's biggest messaging platform if you do not accept the Facebook-owned messenger's latest privacy policy, the company said on Monday despite strong reservations expressed by the government, the Supreme Court, and the Competition Commission of India. While WhatsApp - which has over 53 crore users in India --says that the scale-down of services will not happen immediately for those who do not accept update to the new policy by May 15, the downgrade will happen subsequently when a user does not pay heed to repeated reminders from the company. While the company has made clear that it will not delete the accounts of those who continue to ignore the controversial privacy policy (that have received flak across the world as the update seeks to share business communication of WhatsApp users with Facebook), it has now made it clear that things may not be the same anymore. Through a blog post/advisory on its website, the company answers the crucial question of 'What happens after I receive a persistent reminder (to update)?', "At that time, you'll encounter limited functionality on WhatsApp until you accept the updates... You won't be able to access your chat list, but you can still answer incoming phone and video calls. If you have notifications enabled, you can tap on them to read or respond to a message or call back a missed phone or video call." Further, after a few weeks of limited functionality, "you won't be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and WhatsApp will stop sending messages and calls to your phone."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/agree-to-terms-or-face-limited-functions-whatsapp/articleshow/82538055.cms||Pankaj Doval

---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High court stops mentioning process in some categories||CHANDIGARH: Just three days after Punjab and Haryana high court bar association gave a call for boycott of the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court for not listening to the lawyers, the HC administration, on Monday, simplified the process by removing the mentioning process in hearing of some categories of cases. It means these cases would be heard by the HC even without making any prior request for mentioning by lawyers. These cases included habeas corpus petitions, anticipatory bail pleas filed for the first time and petitions seeking protection of life and liberty by the petitioners. Apart from this, the HC administration has also taken some decisions, including restricting entry on the HC premises only to those advocates whose cases are listed on that day, to facilitate them in having a video conference in the library. Entry to the HC premises would be permitted only through gate no-1. The mediation and conciliation centre, arbitration centre and Lok Adalat shall remain closed but the photostat shops and chemist shops on the court premises would be allowed to be open. As far as staff is concerned, only minimum possible staff of the HC not exceeding 50% shall attend office on any given day. The remaining staff would work from home. The HC staff, however, has been told not to leave the station and report immediately for duty in the office as and when required. An order in this regard was issued by Sanjeev Berry, registrar general of Punjab and Haryana high court. According to an official statement, these decisions have been taken by a committee of HC judges constituted to redress grievances of the bar. The committee includes Justice Jaswant Singh, Justice Rajan Gupta, Justice Ajay Tewari, Justice Jitendra Chauhan, Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Ritu Bahri. The committee held its meeting on Sunday. On Friday, the Punjab and Haryana high court bar association (HCBA), Chandigarh demanded the transfer of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha of Punjab and Haryana high court to some other high court of the country because of his “non-cooperative and disinterested” attitude towards the demands of the bar. The bar also declared that till the Chief Justice was shifted/transferred, bar members would boycott his court by not appearing before him regarding any judicial proceedings. However, the bar council of Punjab and Haryana, which is the Apex body of lawyers, stayed the resolution passed by HCBA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/high-court-stops-mentioning-process-in-some-categories/articleshow/82538165.cms||---

Cops destroy 5L poppy plants in Kullu||Manali: Lakhs of plants of poppy, the source of narcotics like opium and heroin, are growing on terraced fields in Kullu mountains. As plants are ready to harvest, state police have started scanning suspicious areas and destroying the crop with sticks and sickle. Over five lakh poppy plants have been destroyed in recent days and many persons booked under NDPS Act. The plants, including hybrid species, have been grown in remote areas. Many have cultivated them in apple orchards or have mixed other crops with them. The crop is being destroyed after photography. Ownership of the land under illegal harvest is being established with the help of revenue department. On Sunday, six teams of police destroyed 3,60,500 poppy plants on a 23-bigha piece of land. Based on a tip-off, police teams raided Khadangcha, Gauhar, Daran, Majharna and other villages in Sainj valley of Kullu and registered six cases. The owners of the land will be booked after getting ownership details. On Saturday, police destroyed poppy plants in Tinder area of Nirmand sub-division of Kullu, and booked Noop Ram (58) and Tej Ram (75). Police have also registered five cases for illegal cultivation of opium on 18 bigha of land in Sainj area of Kullu. A police team raided Bhithu Kanda region in upper Sainj where poppy flowers were growing in a vast area below the mountain. Cops booked Hukmi Ram, Thakur Dass, Kishori Lal, Ameer Chand and Shyam Singh and destroyed 1.45 lakh poppy plants found in their fields. Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh said, “The teams take photographs of the fields and establish the ownership of the land with help of concerned patwari. The entire crop is destroyed, along with the poppy bulbs. Our campaign will continue until all such crops are destroyed.” According to the SP, poppy bulbs in some of the fields had cut marks which are generally visible when the white resin is collected to make drugs. “The samples of the plants with cut marks on bulbs have been preserved for further investigation,” he added. Kullu has been notorious for cultivation of hybrid cannabis to produce high-quality charas. Cultivation of many varieties of poppy is a new challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/opium-replacing-cannabis-cops-destroy-5l-poppy-plants-in-kullu/articleshow/82538225.cms||Suresh Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Split wide open in Congress||CHANDIGARH: Infighting within the Punjab Congress gathered pace over the sacrilege issue on Monday, as a group of party leaders held a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue. The meeting comes at a time when chief minister Amarinder Singh and former cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu are engaged in a bitter war of words. chief minister Amarinder SinghOn Monday, a group of Congress leaders, including cabinet ministers, met to discuss the political implications of “negative perception” over sacrilege and Kotkapura firing case, even as three cabinet ministers issued a joint statement, urging the Congress high command to take disciplinary action against Sidhu for his “anti-party” act of “no holds barred” attack on the chief minister. Congress leaders, including minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa met at cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s residence on Monday to discuss the fallout of the quashing of the probe report on Kotkapura firing case. Sources said the Congress leaders were not only critical of the functioning of the office of advocate general (AG), they also expressed concern at the fact that even though a new special investigation team (SIT) had been set up by Punjab government, it was yet to visit the Kotkapura site, which showed the “non-serious” attitude. Some more MLAs too got in touch with the group later in the day. The fact that the twin reports by police officers Siddharth Chattopadhyay and Harpreet Sidhu on drug trade in the state were yet to be made public was also discussed by the Congress leaders, added sources. When contacted, Bajwa said, “The meeting was not against any leader or in support of anyone. Those who are concerned over fulfilment of the poll promise to ensure justice in the sacrilege and Kotkapura cases are coming together to express their concerns and find a way forward. Besides, the kind of vocabulary being used by the son of one of those who died in the Behbal Kalan firing case against the SIT amounts to indictment. All those who have faith in the Guru Granth Sahib are together on this issue.” The leaders also discussed how to galvanise more MLAs to highlight the twin issues of damage control on the sacrilege issue and also the inefficient functioning of the AG office. Ministers for action against Sidhu’s ‘anti-party’ act Taking exception to the “no-holds-barred” attack unleashed by Navjot Singh Sidhu against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, a group of Punjab cabinet ministers on Monday urged the Congress high command to take strict disciplinary action against the “dissident MLA”. Terming Sidhu’s “unmitigated onslaught” on the CM as an act of gross indiscipline and an attempt to undermine the Congress government in the state, the ministers said the MLA’s personal attack on Amarinder was an anti-party act, which called for immediate disciplinary action. The ministers, including Brahm Mohindra, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, came out in strong criticism of Sidhu’s actions and open criticism of the chief minister, while being an elected MLA from the same party. Sidhu’s recent spate of comments against the chief minister could no longer be dismissed as rantings of a disgruntled member of a democratic political party, said the ministers, adding that the open rebellion was damaging the interests of the Congress at a time when assembly elections in the state were less than a year away. “Failure to take action against Sidhu now could trigger unrest in the party’s state unit, which would be fatal for the party, which had suffered major electoral blows in the recently concluded assembly polls in five states,” the ministers warned. BOX ‘Ex-min’s intentions nefarious’ Punab ministers Brahm Mohindra, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot said it was more than evident now that Navjot Singh Sidhu’s intentions were “nefarious and motivated” by his vested personal and political interests. It was clear that the incalcitrant MLA, through his blatant accusations and allegations, was trying to fan dissent in the Punjab Congress against Amarinder, who had successfully steered the party to an unprecedented win in 2017 and in every major election in the state thereafter, they added. Dubbing Sidhu’s aggressive posturing on social media as an attempt by the disgruntled MLA to pressure the high command into succumbing to his unreasonable demands, ministers said unless urgent steps were taken by the partyto check his unbridled tirade, it would encourage other ambitious and rebellious members to raise their voice openly against the leadership while continuing to enjoy its patronage. Pointing out that the CM had made several overtures in recent past to resolve any perceived differences on Sidhu’s part, the ministers said it was clear that the latter did not want to be placated but only wanted to score political brownie points to further his personal ambitions. Intentions are evident, tweets Sidhu Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu continued to take pot shots at his own government’s chief minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, on Monday over the Kotkapura firing case of 2015. Sidhu tweeted: “Nefarious intentions are evident. No high court stopped you in 4-1/2 yrs! When DGP/CPS appointments are set aside, orders are challenged in higher courts in a matter of hours. Now, first you attack the high court, then from backdoor accept same orders to deflect people’s attention.” Sidhu shared a clip of the CM’s interview to a private channel, giving his reaction to quashing of the probe report into the Kotkapura firing case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/split-wide-open-in-cong/articleshow/82538249.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Chandigarh||No stipend paid, shifted MBBS interns threaten to go on strike||Amritsar: Medical services in all three government medical hospitals of Punjab may be hampered as nearly 250 MBBS interns have announced to go on strike if the government didn’t give them Rs 15,000 per month internship, as given to regular interns. The interns are students of two private medical colleges in the state — Gian Sagar Medical College at Banur and Chintpurani Medical College at Pathankot. They were shifted to medical colleges of Punjab by Baba Farid University of Health Sciences after both colleges were shut down by the state government on the directions of Medical Council of India, said Union Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP) president Dr J P Singh on Monday. One of the interns who didn’t wish to give his name said their course started on October 3, 2016, and the colleges were shut down on January 31, 2017, after they (colleges) failed to fulfil MCI’s guidelines. The students of these colleges were shifted to medical colleges on June 13, 2017. He said they had recently cleared their final professional examination on April 10 and started their internship under Punjab Medical Council from April 12. Dr Singh said not only URDP, but also medical associations of all the three government medical colleges of Punjab had extended support to the interns and would join their strike if the government didn’t start paying them Rs 15,000 per month, as given to the regular interns. On Monday, interns at Government Medical College, Amritsar, staged a silent protest in support of their demand. “We are performing all medical duties like frontline warriors and at least expect the government to not discriminate against us,” said another student, who also didn’t wish to give his name. Stating that all 250 shifted interns didn’t receive internship/stipend for the first month, Dr Singh said they had written to the governor, the chief minister and the health minister and if their demand was not heeded, they would be forced to go for a strike which could further put a strain on the already struggling health services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-stipend-paid-shifted-mbbs-interns-threaten-to-go-on-strike/articleshow/82538282.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu as guilty as CM Amarinder Singh in failing to arrest those behind sacrilege: Shiromani Akali Dal||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday held former minister “Navjot Singh Sidhu as guilty as Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh in failing to arrest and convict those guilty of the gruesome acts of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib”. The party also said that both these leaders were playing politics on this issue instead of fulfilling their commitment to ensure justice in the case. Akali MP Balwinder Singh Bhundur said it was shocking that after four years in government Sidhu was raising the sacrilege issue solely to snatch the chief minister’s chair from Capt Amarinder. “Navjot Sidhu has never done anything in the last four years to secure justice in the sacrilege cases and remained busy in his self-styled Indo-Pak friendship initiative. Had he worked as assiduously as he is doing now to bring down Amarinder, the sacrilege case would have been solved till now,” said Bhundur. He claimed Congress MLA Sidhu was holding meetings of ministers and legislators not to discuss the sacrilege case but to turn the his party’s leaders against the CM. “Sidhu also knows that people will ask him in 2022 as to why he did not do anything to secure justice in the case despite representing the holy city in the assembly and this is why he is raising the issue of sacrilege to escape the wrath of the people,” he added. The Rajya Sabha member also said the Congress government in Punjab first appointed chief minister’s close friend Justice Ranjit Singh (retd) to probe the sacrilege case. “When the former judge failed to nail the SAD in the case, the government gave this responsibility to its henchman and former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh,” alleged Bhundur. He added that the police officer also probed the case for three years but could not succeed in the Congress’s game plan to implicate the SAD and its top leadership, including former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and former home minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. Lately, this conspiracy was also exposed by the high court, which rejected the findings of Kunwar’s team in the Kotkapura firing case and disbanded the SIT, besides passing strictures against the former IG as well as the entire manner in which the investigation was handled. The new SIT should be allowed to function in a free and fair manner and should not be forced to proceed against the SAD as per the earlier game plan of the chief minister, said Bhundur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-as-guilty-as-cm-in-failing-to-arrest-those-behind-sacrilege-sad/articleshow/82538287.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Elderly couple found murdered in Jagadhri||AMBALA: Panic gripped a residential area in Jagadhri after an elderly couple living alone at Saraswati Colony was found murdered on Monday. The deceased have been identified as Rishipal Goel (80), a retired bank employee and his wife Snehlata (75). They lived in Saraswati Colony, Jagadhri. Police registered a case on the complaint of the son of the deceased, Amit Goel of Bhattanwali village, Paonta Sahib, under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Jagadhri City police station on Monday. Amit told the police that he lives in Paonta Sahib, where he runs a business. “My father and mother lived in Saraswati Colony, Jagadhri. My father used to give money on finance and we used to visit my parents often. We regularly talked to them over the phone to know about their health and I talked to them at about 8pm on Sunday. My nephew Dhruv also talked to them at 9pm. Till then, everything was okay. At about 11am on Monday, I called my parents to know about their health as my father had a light fever but the phone was switched-off. I tried again after 30 minutes but the phone was off,” said Amit. He said he contacted his nephew Vivek Goyal in Jagadhri and asked him to check on his parents. “Vivek went with his friend Anurag and saw that the door of the house was open. They saw that my parents were lying separately on their beds. They were bleeding from the mouth and my mother had a head injury. I along with my brother Anmol reached Jagadhri and saw the bodies of our parents. It appears that some unknown person murdered our parents,” said Amit. On receiving information, police and Yamunanagar superintendent of police (SP) Kamaldeep Goyal reached the crime spot for inspection along with forensic experts and dog-squad teams. SP Goyal said, “A retired bank employee, Rishipal lived in Saraswati Colony with his wife and they were found murdered at their home. Further details will be ascertained after postmortem examination. Prima facie it appears that they were strangled with a pillow. Two of their sons live in Paonta Sahib and family of another son who has died lives locally in Jagadhri.” The SP said teams of crime investigation agency have been deputed under the leadership of a DSP rank officer. Police said robbery could have been a motive for the murder as jewellery is missing from the house. Police said postmortem of the deceased would be conducted on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/elderly-couple-found-murdered-in-jagadhri/articleshow/82538303.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||9 years on, BJP questions cancellation report in blasphemy case against Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim||JALANDHAR: BJP has now started talking about the Badal government — of which it was a junior partner in alliance with SAD — not taking the blasphemy case of 2007 against Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim to a logical conclusion and rather filing a cancellation report in court. On Friday evening, in an online talk titled ‘Bargari sacrilege case: political and social ramifications’, which was also attended by a senior RSS functionary, BJP national spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura not only flagged this issue, but also asked why the questioning of Sirsa dera chief was not pursued by IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh after he was once not allowed by jail authority in sacrilege case. The online talk was hosted by a platform, The Punjab Pulse. RSS Samajik Samrasta north region head Parmod Kumar also attended it. In his concluding brief remarks, he praised the talk and advocated that cause of justice should be pursued. “The 2007 case, registered against Sirsa dera chief for imitating Guru Gobind Singh, was never taken to a logical conclusion and rather, just before 2012 assembly polls, Punjab Police filed a cancellation report in the court. It should come out who ordered closure of the case and why was it ordered,” Lalpura, himself a retired senior police officer, said in his talk. He pointed out that IG Kunwar Vijay Partap had gone to (Sonaria) jail to question Sirsa dera chief in April 2019, but he was denied permission by the jail authority. BJP has been in power in Haryana, where the jail is located. Lalpura said it was yet to be explained what attempts were later made to question the dera chief over the next two years. “I don’t think there is any political support to the dera chief now, but he was not questioned in the next two years,” Lalpura said. In his concluding remarks, Parmod Kumar said culprits of sacrilege should be punished without delay. “At that time also, RSS condemned the incidents and demanded that justice be delivered in the case,” he said. When contacted on Sunday, Parmod Kumar told TOI that all this happened under the “Panthic government” and Congress promised justice, but failed to deliver. “Guru Granth Sahib is respectable for all those in the country who are part of Bhartiya sanskriti (Indian tradition). People’s sentiments should not be exploited and justice should be delivered,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/9-yrs-on-bjp-questions-cancellation-report-in-blasphemy-case-against-sirsa-dera-chief/articleshow/82538305.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||As Punjab reels under pandemic, CM Amarinder Singh busy saving his job: BJP||CHANDIGARH: Punjab BJP on Monday expressed concern at the state governance crumbling in the face of the increasingly weakening position of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh within the Congress. State BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma asked why the chief minister was so helpless as to be slammed every day by senior Congress leaders in the state. He also asked why the Congress high command was maintaining a stony silence on this issue. “Many cabinet ministers have also fallen foul with the chief minister and have been blaming him for failing to deliver in more than four years. Is it not a sign of a concerted campaign against the chief minister to further paralyse his functioning?” asked Sharma. The BJP leader said such critical observations from Congress leaders have been coming without any fear of disciplinary action, which indicates that Congress high command is backing them. “At a time when Punjab was in the grip of horrible pandemic, a weak chief minister would be disastrous for the state,” said Sharma, demanding that Amarinder quit his office. Sharma also warned that an insensitive and insecure chief minister would be a grave liability to the state and said that the BJP demanded his immediate replacement in the interest of the state and panic-stricken people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-punjab-reels-under-pandemic-cm-busy-saving-his-job-bjp/articleshow/82538306.cms||---

Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock described the move as a "significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic." "Today's action allows for a younger population to be protected from Covid-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic," Woodcock said in a statement. "Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations," she added. The FDA previously granted an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to individuals aged 16 and older. "Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the Covid-19 pandemic," said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. The FDA said some 1.5 million Covid-19 cases in individuals aged 11 to 17 years old have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2021. The course of the disease is generally milder in children but they can pass it on to older, more vulnerable adults.

In a video which has gone viral on social media, the MLA said she’s not being given adequate food and water at the facility and that the family is in the dark regarding her health status. He also said that his wife was made to lie on the floor for three hours before she could be given a bed. In a close to two-minute long video message, the MLA claimed that his wife was turned away by the hospital guards when she reached there. The MLA then contacted Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh, who finally got her admitted to the hospital on Friday night. Lodhi said that although his wife eventually was admitted to the hospital in Agra, he had no update on her health in the past 24 hours. The MLA said he was not able to contact anyone at the hospital. Since he himself had just been discharged from the hospital, he was very weak and could not travel to Agra. “What would happen to a common man when an MLA’s wife cannot be given proper care,” Lodhi asked in the video. The BJP MLA had, too, tested positive for coronavirus and had returned home after recovering from the in fection on May 7. SN Medical College principal Dr Sanjay Kala said the allegations made by the MLA were “unfortunate”. “The MLA’s wife was admitted at Covid care centre at 7:30 pm. We maintain a computerized record for all patients. I personally attended to her. She was admitted in a critical condition with oxygen saturation level at 80. Following the life-saving efforts, her oxygen saturation increased to 98 without any external support on Sunday evening.” He added: “Now, she is out of danger and has been transferred to a private hospital. The allegations made by the MLA are unfortunate. We provided the patient with the best possible treatment amid huge stress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wife-lay-on-hospital-floor-for-3-hours-was-given-no-food-or-water-up-bjp-mla/articleshow/82538284.cms||Deepak Lavania

We will continue the service under the project ‘food for life’ of Iskcon temple.” To supply oxygen, a few foundations and business houses have stepped in. One such is Vardhman Steels. To get oxygen refills, one has to carry Aadhaar card, Covid report and authorised doctor’s oxygen demand letter with the patient. Vice-chairman and MD of Vardhman Steels, Sachit Jain said, “We were supplying oxygen to the needy people and we have given around 20,000 cylinders to government hospitals, including over 1,500 to individuals. A week ago, we have stopped the service to civil hospital after knowing that a middlemen were charging full from hospital authorities. Now, we are giving free to army hospitals and will supply further with nod of administration. I am thankful to the staff of 60-70 people working in the company including workers, maintenance people, security, and delivery employees, as they are working 14 to 16 hours on daily basis so that people can be helped in this time.” According to Jain, as the administration has issued a notice stating that no doctor can prescribe oxygen for home use, they have stopped supply to individuals. “We cannot give without doctor’s prescription,” he added. Jain International Trade Organisation’s (JITO) secretary Rakesh Jain said, “We are providing free oxygen service for those who have been advised oxygen therapy at home by physicians We have ordered 10 machines and we have received three so far and all are occupied. Machine needs to be picked and returned with recommendation of JITO member and any damages to the machine will have to be paid for by the family or referral. Also, a refundable security deposit of Rs 25,000 is compulsory. The minimal charges are Rs 300 per day for one to five days and Rs 800 per day if the patient has to use for six to 14 days. The patient has to compulsory return on the 15th day. The expenses of disposable accessories will be borne by the patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/volunteers-step-in-to-pitch-in-with-free-food-oxygen-to-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82538618.cms||Mehak Jain

As it was unable to move, it was tranquillized on May 9 for detailed physical examination.TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar said, “it was paraplegic in both hind limbs, apparently due to internal physical injury and hence was rescued and shifted to Gorewada Rescue Centre for treatment.”According wildlife veterinarians who examined the tiger at Nagpur, it seems to be a case of a road accident. The tiger has a severe spinal injury due to which both its hind legs have become paralyzed. It is unable to stand on its legs.“An x-ray will reveal the extent of damage. It is possible the tiger may have been tossed off the road by speeding vehicle. As the hind legs got damaged, it was unable to stand on its legs and still attempted to move and suffer lacerated deep wounds in the process,” they said.“Such an injury can be due to lumbar spine injury or protozoan, which occurs due to illnesses like malaria or dengue. However, it doesn’t look to be a case of protozoan but an road hit. Even the health certificate submitted by the wildlife vet Dr Ravikant Khobragade mentions blunt injury to the vertebral column, especially lumbosacral region,” they added.Sources said the Agarzari tiger was seen on a cattle kill a few days ago. This is the second case of a tiger getting injured in a road accident. On April 17, a full-grown male suffered fractures. Both these tigers are now in Gorewada, which has exhausted its carrying capacity.“There are 12 captured tigers now in Gorewada but we have only 10 enclosures. Two tigers have been kept in the hospital,” said FDCM divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai. Meanwhile, wildlife lovers have called for banning night traffic between Padmapur and Mohurli even for locals to check such incidents. An order from the district collector should be issued on the lines of Dnyanganga (Buldhana) and Koka (Bhandara) wildlife sanctuaries, they demanded.TATR deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad said, “Restrictions are already there for tourists and outsiders. The exit time from Padmapur gate is 9 pm. Besides, after 8 pm, barring locals, vehicles are not allowed.”“On the tiger case, we are verifying which vehicles entered and exited on May 7 and 8. Secondly, in Mohurli we have also installed another check post to curb the unwanted movement of vehicles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/paralytic-agarzari-tiger-may-have-been-hit-by-a-vehicle/articleshow/82545173.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Addressing journalists in Dhaka, Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming was quoted by local media as saying that bilateral ties would be “substantially damaged” if Bangladesh engaged with the four-country grouping. “We do not want any form of participation of Bangladesh in this alliance,” Li is reported to have said, stressing that Beijing sees the Quad as an anti-China grouping. The envoy said this message had been conveyed to the Sheikh Hasina government by Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe when he visited last week. The official readout during Wei’s visit had referred to a Chinese assertion against military alliances in South Asia that would lead to “hegemonism”, which observers took as a reference to India. Read AlsoNavies of the ‘Quad’ can swing together to tackle any threat in Indo-Pacific: Top Indian &amp; US commandersNEW DELHI: Top Indian and American military commanders on Wednesday said navies of the “Quad” countries could seamlessly swing into action for a joint military operation if the need arises to tackle a threat and ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. The messaging about the Quad grouping ofChina’s tougher stand as regards India has only sharpened from 2020. The reference to Quad and the undiplomatic manner in which Bangladesh was warned indicate Beijing’s deep annoyance with a grouping that intends to curtail its influence in the Indo-Pacific and areas that China considers its zone of influence. Just last week, China held a virtual round-table with South Asian countries on Covid-19 and vaccines. Now that the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm has received WHO ap proval, it will be much easier for India’s neighbours to switch to Chinese vaccines, specially when India-made vaccine Covishield is not available for export right now. Read AlsoPledging more aid, Kamala Harris says 'welfare of India is critically important to US'Asserting that the "welfare of India is critically important to the United States," US vice-president Kamala Harris, whose mother hailed from India and whose aunt is a physician in Chennai, pledged that the Biden administration will do even more for India than the aid currently in the pipeline andChina got a big thumbs up from Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa too last week, when he met Fenghe. Xinhua reported Rajapaksa as telling Wei that Sri Lanka “has been pursuing an independent foreign policy and will never bend to pressure from major powers outside the region as well as never forge an alliance with any country”. This was seen as an euphemism for India, the US and the Quad. With India too, China has not eased up on its belligerence. The negotiations for a disengagement in eastern Ladakh have stalled, and reports have emerged about China entrenching its positions in eastern Ladakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-threatens-bangladesh-says-ties-will-be-hit-if-it-joins-quad/articleshow/82538736.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||India||My removal not linked to Kumbh, says former Uttarakhand CM Trivendra||DEHRADUN: Former Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, in an exclusive interview to on Monday, dismissed recent reports that alleged it was the displeasure of the seer community that precipitated his removal as CM, bringing in Tirath Singh Rawat in his place. There has been swirling talk of late that it was because Trivendra Rawat wanted to go ahead with a symbolic Maha Kumbh in view of the Covid-19 threat that he fell foul of the sadhu samaj, who in turn put pressure for his ouster. "I don't think the akhadas were displeased with me," he said. "The seers understood the urgency of the pandemic and were ready to go ahead with whatever format of Kumbh the situation allowed." Trivendra Rawat added, "In the run-up to the Kumbh, saints and akhada seers held several meetings with me, my cabinet colleagues and state officials. Akhada members were updated on each and every detail related to the Kumbh and they never expressed any annoyance. In fact, they had given in writing that they would accept any format of Kumbh as they, too, were aware of the rising number of Covid cases." He further said, "We were strictly following guidelines issued by the Centre. Even the PM had no issues with the concept of a pratikatmak (symbolic) Kumbh in wake of Covid-19. It is wrong to link it with my removal. It's true that the initial plan was to host a divya (divine) and bhavya (grand) Kumbh but the situation did not allow that." Usually, the Kumbh starts in early January with the Makar Sankranti snan and lasts for four months. Initially, the plan was to observe only the four shahi snans (on March 11, April 12, April 14 and April 27) as Kumbh. After several rounds of deliberations, in late February, it was announced that the Kumbh would be observed for a month, from April 1 to 30. In that duration, some 91 lakh devotees, according to official figures, came to Haridwar to take a dip in the Ganga. In early March, Tirath Singh Rawat replaced Trivendra Rawat as the chief minister of Uttarakhand. In one of his first acts after taking over as CM, Tirath Singh Rawat said that "all were welcome to the Maha Kumbh". Later, he clarified that the Centre's SOPs, which mandated carrying a negative RT-PCR test report to gain entry at the Kumbh, would be followed and the statement was "just to dispel apprehension and confusion". A day after he took oath as the CM on March 10, he visited Haridwar for the first shahi snan on Maha Shivratri, March 11. Trivendra Rawat said, "It was very clear to everyone that the Maha Kumbh would be of an extremely short duration, with restrictions suggested by the Centre in place." Asked if in retrospect, he considered Kumbh had become a super-spreader, he said, "I had apprehensions about the infection spreading and therefore my government had made plans accordingly. It is not right for me to comment on anything as the facts are now before the people."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/my-removal-not-linked-to-kumbh-says-former-uttarakhand-cm-trivendra/articleshow/82538920.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Chennai||Covid leaves Chennai Super Kings with unfinished business||CHENNAI: Life has come to a grinding halt following the second wave of the pandemic that is raging across the country, and the Indian Premier League is no exception. After battling through the first three weeks of the tournament across four cities, the tournament had to be postponed as the bio-bubble burst. Covid positive cases were reported inside the bubble and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had no option but to postpone the tournament indefinitely. Chennai Super Kings reported two positive cases — of batting and bowling coaches Mike Hussey and L Balaji — and both are undergoing quarantine in Chennai. While the CSK team management has tried to put up a brave front and has refused to blame anybody for the mishandling of the situation that has led to the postponement of the event, there’s no doubt that they will be one of the teams who will feel the pinch. The team, after a poor last season, were off to a fantastic start this year, winning five of the seven games, and looked well and truly set for the playoffs. To many, they were one of the prime contenders to win the title, but all that is up in the air now. It could have been avoided had the BCCI listened to the franchises before the event and shifted the IPL to the UAE. But that was not to be and now we are staring at a first abandonment of the tournament, unless the BCCI pulls a rabbit out of its hat and manages to fit in a window of 20 days in September before the T20 World Cup. "We don’t know if the BCCI will be able to reschedule it because it will mean convincing the other boards to release their players. If it happens, CSK will try to recreate the performances they were doing," team CEO Kasi Viswanathan said. But that’s easier said than done. CSK are a team with a lot of senior players who are retired from international cricket. Before the event got off in April, the team had a one-month camp that stood the boys in good stead. But if the tournament is reorganised in September, it’s unlikely that CSK will get the preparation that they managed this time around. Add to that the advantage that other teams, which have a lot of current international players, will get. Most of them will have two months of competitive cricket under their belt while the likes of M S Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis and Imran Tahir will have to do their own preparation at home. Even an in-form player like Ruturaj Gaikwad, who isn’t part of any of the Indian sides, will feel the lack of game-time because there will be no domestic cricket either in these two months. It can well lead up to a 2020-like situation when the CSK players looked undercooked at the start of the event. It told on their performances and a few defeats early on led to their worst-ever showing. But Viswanathan insists the situation won’t be that grim this time. "Our preparation in March-April was superb and that’s why we played so well in the seven games. I agree that some of our players will be short on game time if it happens in September but we have learned how to work around that," the CEO said. He insists that unlike last year, the CSK players have learned how to deal with bubble life and other realities like playing in front of empty galleries and so on. The lessons have been well drilled in and the fact that most of the players are senior pros, it shouldn’t be too difficult to get going. That they are among the top two with an excellent net run rate should also make life a little easier if things get tough. But for that to happen, the BCCI has to first find a window, decide on a new venue and convince the other boards to release their players for a 20-day phase where they can fit in the remaining games. Given the situation at the moment, it’s a huge task and if the BCCI is unable to do this, the golden generation of CSK will finish their sojourn with a sense of unfulfillment that they didn’t really deserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-leaves-csk-with-unfinished-business/articleshow/82539047.cms||Dwaipayan Datta
---||Chennai||Dravidianism and Hindutva are not different: JP national general secretary C T Ravi||JP national general secretary C T Ravi, on Monday, said the month-long ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ did not pay much dividends to the party in the assembly polls. The yatra had very little impact, but it forced the DMK chief to take vel in his hands ahead of the elections. In an interview to Shanmughasundaram J, the BJP leader said it was a success for the party outside the frame of electoral politics. He said victory in four seats would help the party move forward in the state. Q: How do you rate BJP’s performance in Tamil Nadu assembly polls?We expected more seats. Our party candidates gave a tough fight in Dharapuram and Udhagamandalam constituencies and lost by small margins. We had 50-50 chances in Thittakudi, Thousand Lights, Virudhunagar, and Karaikudi seats. But we are happy our MLAs are entering TN assembly after a gap of 15 years. It is the beginning, not the end. Q:What went wrong for the BJP in the assembly polls?In Tamil Nadu, our alliance with the AIADMK is strong and we depend on them. We have strong vote banks in Kanyakumari and Coimbatore. We don’t have a strong presence in other regions. We have strong cadres, but we didn’t have strong local leaders in many places. It is our weakness. So, we are focusing on reducing our weaknesses and strengthening the party. In the neighbouring Karnataka, we had four MLAs during 1989-1994. We administer that state now. Similarly, we will move forward from the present position and form our own government in TN also. Q:Did Vel yatra help the BJP in consolidating Hindu votes?No doubt it created a small wave, but it did not help much. But the yatra influenced DMK leader M K Stalin and forced him to take Vel in his hands ahead of the elections. That was our victory. Q: There were reports that BJP candidates shied away from using the names and pictures of PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in their campaign material and projected themselves as candidates following the footsteps of Jayalalithaa. Your view?Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are our leaders and their leadership won many elections. They campaigned for state president L Murugan and other candidates. Our candidates never hesitated from using the pictures of Modi and Shah. We projected Modi-Amma as brother-sister combination. Q: Political critics feel the elections have proven that BJP’s Hindutva politics have failed in TN. What do you feel?Ahead of the polls, they said BJP will not win a single seat here. We proved them wrong. Similarly, political parties gave a wrong interpretation of Dravidian identity and ideology. Dravidians were believers and they built big temples. There is no difference between Dravidianism, Hindutva, and Sanatana Dharma. Hindu mantra (Om Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah) calls for universal peace and happiness. It is similar to the Dravidian ideology of social justice. So, they are all the same. But people give different names to the same ideology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dravidianism-and-hindutva-are-not-different-c-t-ravi/articleshow/82539107.cms||---
---||Chennai||Bring the tourists back||More than a decade ago, tourists who landed in Chennai never had to haggle with the auto drivers. They travelled to their small bed & breakfast accommodation on tourist-friendly autos which operated with a rate card. Sightseeing on ECR was a breeze as they could hop on to and hop off the bright yellow mini buses that came with a guide dressed in trim uniforms.The three key initiatives pioneered by the DMK government during their previous tenure — tourist-friendly autos, hop-on-hop-off tours on ECR till Mamallapuram and bed & breakfast scheme — fell prey to the political rivalry when AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa took over in 2011. The new government let these tourist-friendly initiatives disappear and instead announced grand schemes like a ‘Sentosa’ in Chennai, which never saw the light of day.The city had around 210 tourist-friendly autos. The project was expanded to Madurai, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari and Trichy. Similarly, affordable accommodation with chances to see how the locals lived led to the bed & breakfast scheme which was picking up. The hop-on-hop-off tours offered tourists the freedom to sightsee at their own pace unlike on group tours. But the government turned it into a one-day fixed tour after 2011 and later discontinued it.In addition, many innovations including promoting less known tourist destinations, eco-tourism and dark tourism were also discontinued. All these initiatives and aggressive marketing helped the government overcome the recession and achieve a 24.4% increase in tourist arrival in 2009. With DMK leader M K Stalin taking over as chief minister and Irai Anbu, who was behind most of the innovative tourism initiatives, taking over as chief secretary, there is hope that tourism promotion will get a new lease of life in the state. N Ravi, a retired Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) official, said the initiatives should be revived and more should be done as tourism is idling. "So much of planning and coordination between departments went into all of these initiatives. They were popular and were helping the tourists." J Sethuraman of Travel XS said, "The new government should set up a taskforce to strengthen, revive tourism and tourism infrastructure. It has to be brought back to the pre-Covid-19 level. Tour operators, hotels, guides all have taken a beating after being neglected for a long time. Domestic tourism should be promoted because foreign travellers will take time to return as our image has taken a beating due to the pandemic. The state should strive to get a ‘travel safe’ tag to have an edge over competing states. Promoting sustainable tourism will also be a crowd puller for foreigntourists."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bring-the-tourists-back/articleshow/82539166.cms||V Ayyappan
---||Chennai||CCTV footage helps nab chain snatchers||Chennai: The Chintadripet police on Sunday arrested two men for two separate robberies and seized stolen valuables including a two-wheeler. After a team led by crime wing inspector Padmavathi nabbed Vignesh and Pradeep with the help of CCTV camera footage, a court sent them to jail.In the first incident, a police officer said, Kannagi Nagar resident Vignesh, who was on a bike, on May 5 snatched a mobile phone from a woman named Suryah who was walking on a road in Chintadripet talking to a relative over phone. While Vignesh rode away before the woman could raise an alarm, Suryah lodged a complaint. A case was registered and a search was launched. A team collected CCTV camera footage from the traffic junction at Periyar statue and nearby showrooms. Egmore assistant commissioner Subramani said, “We assigned a special team to track the movement of the suspect watching the camera footage.”After Suryah helped a police artist recreate and draw the portrait of the suspect, members of the special team traced the registration number of the bike he used to escape after committing the crime. The registration number TN 07 CK 7060 of the Pulsar 220 was initially traced to a man named Velu of Saligramam. When questioned, Velu told police that he had recently sold the two-wheeler through a private financing firm in his neighbourhood. Further inquiries revealed that the vehicle was sold to Prathyush Bikes on Bells Road in Chepauk and the police team nabbed Vignesh from a hideout at Kannagi Nagar. The sets of fingerprints collected from Vignesh were sent to the state crime records bureau where experts on analysis found that he had been involved in a few more cases of robbery, one of murder, and a few cases of theft in the city. Four stolen mobile phones and the motor bike Vignesh used to rob the woman were seized, the officer said. The second arrest was of Pradeep, one of two men who had on April 21 snatched cash and valuables from a soft drinks shop on Singanna Chetty Street in Chintadripet after attacking its manager Suresh, the officer said. Later, the two men threatened an armed reserve police constable while fleeing with the booty. After apprehending Pradeep, 22, from a hideout, police launched a search for his accomplice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cctv-footage-helps-nab-chain-snatchers/articleshow/82539180.cms||---
---||India||Congress defers party chief’s election, to focus on Covid||NEW DELHI: Congress Monday deferred the much-awaited party president’s election after a unanimous plea that the organisation focus on Covid relief. While AICC general secretary K C Venugopal presented the poll schedule of June 23 to the CWC gathering after the agenda was spelt out by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the party should not hold the elections now. It led to a chorus from within for defer ment, with argument that the party could not go ahead with voting and an event when it was criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for holding assembly elections. The election gained importance after the demand was made by the dissident group G-23 and the CWC had earlier decided on June timetable to fill the vacuum created by Rahul Gandhi’s resignation after the rout in 2019 LS polls. In the CWC, senior leader Digvijaya Singh pleaded that Rahul Gandhi retake the reins of the party, adding that he never understood why he had resigned in the first place. At this point, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra pointed out that Rahul was not present in the virtual meeting because he was unwell (due to Covid). Sources said Singh remarked that Priyanka could convey his message while saying “that the family should take a decision soon”, according to a participant. Meanwhile, AICC later said Rahul was still recovering and had mild symptoms. Some of the leaders were ready for polls but were surprised by the demand for deferment and went along. There was a brief moment of awkwardness when a participant lauded Sonia Gandhi for her “steward leadership”. Apparently, Sonia shot back, “What steward leadership? We have lost the elections.” Sources said, Rajiv Shukla urged the CWC to leave the decision to the Congress chief, who then agreed with the demand for postponing the polls. While the poll schedule announced was only for the Congress chief, Azad apparently said the party can hold “all the elections” later, which some saw as demand for simultaneous polls for the top post and the CWC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-defers-party-chiefs-election-to-focus-on-covid/articleshow/82539178.cms||---

In addition, at least 5,000 patients who tested positive before April 26 are still under isolation. Plus, on Monday the city added another 7,149 cases into the Covid-19 registry. All international organisations such as WHO and CDC recommend at least 14 days isolation after a person tests positive for the viral infection. Patients with mild or no symptoms remain in home isolation for all 14 days, those with severe or moderate symptoms will have to continue home isolation even if they are discharged before two weeks from hospitals. “This is because patients can still transmit the virus and infect others even after becoming asymptomatic. Evidence shows that severe disease occurs in the second week. In that period morbidity and mortality is high,” said infectious disease expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan. The Greater Chennai Corporation is struggling to do surveillance and patient management, as the number of focus volunteers is 2,000 and the fever surveillance workers is 12,000. A ward, therefore, can be spared a maximum of 10 focus volunteers and about 60 fever surveillance workers. It is not enough, say zonal corporation officials. “Last year, while the number of fresh as well as active cases were less than half of what we have today, we had had about 15 focus volunteers in each ward. And fever surveillance workers covered at least 150-200 houses a day.” Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi inspected ward offices on Monday to check attendance registers of fever surveillance workers and ensure that field measures were being monitored. “The volunteers can be increased as the number of cases is high,” he said. As family clusters are big this time, tracing the extended contacts is time-consuming. “The problem in the past two weeks was that we couldn’t get the contacts of active cases to test. They are not ready as many are asymptomatic. But there is an increased chances of more transmission because of them. We are hopeful that this lockdown of 14 days will ensure that the transmission chain will be cut,” said an official.

---||Chennai||Govt tells TN hosps to be fire ready, but violations aplenty, say activists||Chennai: All major government hospitals in Tamil Nadu have been told to ensure that crisis management teams are available round the clock, given the spate of recent fire accidents at hospitals in other states, but activists say violations are aplenty.Hospitals are making ensure that ventilators and other heavy electrical systems in intensive care units (ICUs) are not overstretched, but doctors say that, given the increasing patient load, providing the required lay-off time for the various pieces of equipment to cool is becoming close to impossible.Ideally a ventilator should be given a break of 1-2 hours after an eight-hour operation. A spare set is necessary to use during this break. This has not been feasible in the current scenario, said a senior doctor from the Omandurar Government Medical College Hospital. “However, we are still able to ensure that the electrical wires don’t get overheated because of two reasons ‒ we don't use air-conditioners and non-invasive ventilation doesn't need so much power compared to invasive ones,” he said, requesting anonymity.Efforts are being taken to ensure that buildings in all medical college hospitals across the state have access to at least one ramp so that patients can be mobilised to a safe point quickly, said director of medical education R Narayanababu.A senior Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) official said staff at these hospitals were put through a one-month-long training programme on how to handle fire safety equipment in case of an accident and report fire without any delay. The TNFRS recently concluded a second fire audit in hospitals for the year and gave a clean chit in terms of fire safety compliance including availability of ramps, fire extinguishers, water sprinklers, hydrants and reporting systems.But activists say officials have been lenient while issuing fire licences for hospitals despite plenty of violations. Jawaharlal Shanmugam, who filed a Public Interest Litigation regarding this issue at the Madras high court, said that almost 99% of hospitals in the state have violated building safety rules.After he filed the case in 2015, the court directed the government to inspect the fire safety compliance status of all hospitals. Government findings in 2018 shocked everyone. Around 1,400 hospitals did not have fire safety licences, 1,270 lacked ramps and 2,023 did not even have a basic fire safety plan.Subsequently, the state health department and Indian Medical Association (IMA) introduced a slew of reforms to ensure basic fire safety. Building renovation and safety equipment installation was carried out using the ₹89 crore fund allocated for the purpose.A K Ravikumar, state secretary of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said getting a fire licence was a tedious process. “However, we have ensured that all our members have extinguishers installed in required members and trained in order to evacuate quickly.” “Though the case warranted some response, there is a still long way to go,” Shanmugam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-tells-tn-hosps-to-be-fire-ready-but-violations-aplenty-say-activists/articleshow/82539183.cms||Ram Sundaram

Recording the fact that central allocation of liquid medical oxygen to Tamil Nadu was 419 tonnes, as against the state’s demand of 475 tonnes, the judges referred to the rising need of the state, and said, “it is necessary to think of a Plan-B for the state to be prepared in case of a third wave.” The court also referred to changes in key personnel upon the formation of a new government in Tamil Nadu, but applauded the continuity in the office of health secretary to ensure that there is no loss in momentum or lack of rhythm in fighting the pandemic. On his part, health secretary J Radhakrishnan filed a status report saying based on a letter from chief minister M K Stalin to the Prime Minister, the Union government has increased it to 419 tonnes from 220 tonnes. “At present, Tamil Nadu’s daily consumption of oxygen is around 470 tonnes. This is expected to increase by another 400 tonnes in the next 15 days, which will make our total requirement around 850 tonnes if active cases under treatment and hospitalization in oxygen beds show corresponding increase,” the health secretary’s report stated and sought supply from plants in Palakkad (40 tonnes), Bellary (20 tonnes) and Rourkela (200 tonnes) to avert major catastrophe. Recording the state’s submissions, the bench noted that the state and the Centre should find ways of effective supply to western and southern regions of the state since supply from Sriperumbudur to central and western Tamil Nadu might be logistically difficult. “If, as the experts suggest, a third wave may be in the offing, it is necessary to be over-prepared,” the bench said. The court also took note of the submission that the Sterlite plant in Tuticorin will begin production from May 15 and said that in light of the present situation, it is necessary to rope in institutions such as the Defence Research and Development Organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ensure-supply-of-o2-vax-drugs-to-tn-pondy-madras-hc-to-centre/articleshow/82539185.cms||---

Mayor Jai Prakash said the ventilators were distributed among 15 hospitals on Wednesday, but not one was allotted to the municipal corporations, despite their requests. “We had already placed requests for at least 20 ventilators for Hindu Rao, where the footfall is maximum and waiting list high. But Delhi government is not providing any assistance, which is disappointing. We have three hospitals that are engaged in Covid duty, including Hindu Rao, Balak Ram, RBTB, and of them, only 10 ventilators are available at Hindu Rao,” the mayor claimed. TOI attempted to get Delhi government’s reaction on the issue but failed to get a response.

---||India||Covid-19:'Irrational’ use of convalescent plasma worries medical experts||Several clinicians, public health professionals and scientists have written to the principal scientific advisor to the government expressing concerns about “the irrational and non-scientific use of convalescent plasma for Covid-19 in India”. “Current research evidence unanimously indicates that there is no benefit offered by convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19. However, it continues to be prescribed rampantly in hospitals across India” they stated in an open letter. They stated that this situation “stemmed from guidelines issued by government agencies” and requested the urgent intervention of the principal scientific advisor Dr Vijay Raghavan to address the issue to prevent harassment of Covid-19 patients, their families, their clinicians and survivors. These professionals listed the current evidence on plasma therapy and pointed out that the ICMR guidelines were not based on the existing evidence. “The problematic scenario arises because of guidelines issued by ICMR/AIIMS which currently recommends plasma therapy (April 2021 version) as “off label” use. This is rather unusual as off-label use by its very definition implies “unapproved use”. We would also like to point out that international guidelines such as those from National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA and the IDSA guidelines also recommend against general use of plasma therapy for Covid-19,” stated the letter. The signatories requested Dr Vijay Raghavan to urgently review the guidelines and remove this unnecessary therapy “which has no benefit but is only causing harassment of patients, their families and even survivors who are being pressured to donate plasma. They also asked for clear instructions to blood banks across the country on this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/irrational-use-of-convalescent-plasma-worries-medical-experts/articleshow/82539186.cms||---
---||India||English-medium schools will be set up in every block: Mamata||KOLKATA: The government will set up an English-medium school in every block of the state, CM Mamata Banerjee announced after her first cabinet meeting on Monday. “This will help rural students avail the opportunity of English education,” the CM said, addressing a rural demand that has led to mushrooming of English-medium private schools in the districts. This will now be a priority for Paresh Adhikary, the minister given charge of school education. Banerjee’s decision comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government’s New Education Policy (NEP) advocates education in mother tongue. PM Modi during his election campaign in Bengal had repeatedly stressed that his government would help the poor and marginalised pursue even professional courses like medicine and engineering in their mother tongue. Political observers see Banerjee’s move as yet another challenge to Modi, this time on the education front. Bengal has witnessed fierce debates over the medium of instruction at the primary level since the Left Front banished English till class V in the Eighties. The move was aimed at bringing down the rate of school dropouts in rural areas, which experts in the party had ascribed to a fright of the language. The decision, however, proved counter-productive. English was finally brought back to classrooms after 24 years in 2004 when then CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reintroduced it in class I. as the Left Front’s language policy began to have an impact on its vote share. Aware of the past, CM Banerjee started pushing the English-medium agenda from her second term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/english-medium-schools-will-be-set-up-in-every-block-mamata/articleshow/82539199.cms||---
---||Kolkata||8 women and 7 minority MLAs among Mamata's 43 ministers||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has struck a fine balance between experience and fresh faces, packing her council of 43 ministers with eight women and seven members from the minority community. While handpicking her team, Banerjee has had an eye on district representation. She has also undertaken some major changes in portfolio distribution, possibly based on public feedback. Like earlier, the CM has kept for herself a few key departments such as home, Hill affairs, health and family welfare, land and land reforms, refugee relief and rehabilitation, information and culture, and north Bengal development. Glimpses at oath taking ceremony @MamataOfficial https://t.co/oocSDmxoDu— Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) 1620632034000She has passed on minority development and madrasa education to Ghulam Rabbani, three-time MLA from Goalpokhor in North Dinajpur. Under the new arrangement, higher education goes to Bratya Basu, like it was before Partha Chatterjee had taken over, and school education to former Left Front minister-turned-Trinamool MLA Paresh Adhikary. Retired IPS-turned-Trinamool MLA Humayun Kabir is the new technical education minister. Both Adhikary and Kabir are ministers of state. Chandrima Bhattacharya has got independent charge of urban development and municipal affairs, along with her responsibilities as MoS health, land reforms. Amit Mitra will look after finance.  He has been relieved of the commerce industry portfolio that has been assigned to Partha Chatterjee, other than parliamentary affairs. Former urban development minister and Kolkata ex-mayor Firhad Hakim is the new transport and housing minister. Aroop Biswas will handle power, sports and youth affairs while former power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay will manage the agriculture department. Moloy Ghatak is the new public works department minister and will also handle law and judicial portfolios. Ratna De Nag is the new environment minister. Madhyamgram MLA Rathin Ghosh is the food minister while Jyotipriya Mullick has been given forest portfolio. Two inductions from East Midnapore include Soumen Mahapatra and Akhil Giri. Mahapatra is a Cabinetrank minister in charge of irrigation and Giri is MoS in charge of fisheries. Another major inclusion in the Cabinet is Manas Bhuniya, Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member. He had served as Cabinet minister in the first Mamata Banerjee regime in 2011 till Congress (Bhuniya was then with Congress) pulled out of the government. Bhuniya is in charge of water resources and investigation department. The other cabinet portfolios remain more or less the same. Trinamool veteran Subrata Mukherjee has panchayat and rural development and also public enterprises while public health engineering goes to Uluberia Dakshin MLA Pulak Roy, a new entrant. Former cricketer Manoj Tiwari is minister of state for youth affairs. The new council has representation from backward classes, including Adivasis, that had been a major plank of the BJP. Bulu Chik Baraik, Sandhya Tudu, Srikanta Mahato, Birbaha Hansda and Jyotsna Mandi are among the prominent inductees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/8-women-and-7-minority-mlas-among-mamatas-43-ministers/articleshow/82539200.cms||---
---||Goa||India struggling to prepare for World Cup qualifiers with rising Covid-19 cases||Panaji: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has turned down India’s request to postpone the remaining World Cup 2022 qualifying games to be played in Qatar next month. India has been hit by a huge second coronavirus wave that has left the country devastated. The All India Football Federation’s efforts in securing a venue for the preparatory camp have also come to nought. AIFF then approached AFC for postponement of the three games against Qatar (June 3), Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15), only to be told that no changes in the schedule are possible. According to sources, national coach Igor Stimac contacted the players last night and told them to gear up for the challenges ahead, “whatever the difficulties.” “We were asked whether we are fit for the assignment. If a player has family issues with regards to Covid situation, he will be excused,” said a national team player. Two of the players – Ashutosh Mehta and Ashish Rai – are injured and will need more time to recover. Three other national team probables have tested positive for Covid-19 and are unlikely to make the trip to Doha. “Four members of a senior player’s family have tested positive for Covid-19. They are recovering, but we have to see whether the player is in the right frame of mind to play football,” a source told TOI on Tuesday. India were originally scheduled to kickstart their preparations from the last week of April in Kolkata but the rising Covid cases meant they had to change plans. Other venues in India, including Goa, were explored but didn’t seem feasible due to fears of packed hospitals. “Our plan was to travel straight to Doha on May 7 and train there. The idea was to minimise air travel and ensure we have enough time to prepare for the crucial games. We have not yet heard from the Qatar FA how soon we can arrive there. We are expecting a solution soon,” said another official. If, for whatever reasons, the team cannot travel to Doha early, they will head to Dubai for a preparatory camp. Other teams in the group have faced no such problems in their preparations. The Emir Cup is keeping players busy in Qatar, Bangladesh has resumed its domestic league while Oman have set up a training base in Dubai. Many Afghanistan players are busy with lower division leagues in Europe. Stimac is expected to announce the probables in the next 24 to 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-struggling-to-prepare-for-world-cup-qualifiers-with-rising-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82558010.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Stealth frigate INS Trikand arrived at Mumbai with 40 metric ton (MT) of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic containers from the Hamad Port at Doha in Qatar. “This consignment is part of ‘Oxygen Solidarity Bridge’ of France, through its mission in Qatar, to support India’s fight against Covid-19 pandemic,” said Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal. The India-French initiative is aimed at shipping over 600 MT of liquid oxygen to India over the next two months. Destroyer INS Kolkata, in turn, reached the New Mangalore port with two 27MT containers filled with liquid oxygen, 400 cylinders and some oxygen concentrators that were embarked at Qatar and Kuwait. Similarly, amphibious warfare ship INS Airavat arrived in Visakhapatnam with eight empty 20-MT cryogenic tanks and 3,898 cylinders, along with other medical supplies like oxygen concentrators, 10,000 rapid antigen test kits and 450 PPE suits, from Singapore. “These three warships are part of nine deployed under Operation Samudra Setu-II for shipment of liquid medical oxygen and associated medical equipment from friendly foreign countries in the Persian Gulf and South East Asia. Two more warships are on their way to India from Kuwait, while one is now at Brunei to embark medical supplies,” said Commander Madhwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-oxygen-and-med-supplies-three-warships-reach-india/articleshow/82539218.cms||---

Azeemuddin bagged 200 of the total 600 votes, edging past six other candidates in the fray, all of them from the Hindu community. He polled 85 votes more than his nearest rival. There are 27 Muslim voters in Rajapur and all of them are members of Azeemuddin’s extended family. “The rest of the votes have come from Hindus who reposed their faith in me,” said Azeemuddin, who called his poll victory a Eid gift. Azeemuddin, a farmer by profession, holds the degree of Hafiz and Aalim from a madrassa. He taught in a madrassa for 10 years before joining his family in far ming. “We have not voted on the basis of religion. We only kept in mind what is good for us. We are diehard Hindus but elected a Muslim cleric as our head to show as to what extent we follow secularism,” said Shekhar Sahu, a villager. Commenting on Azeemuddin’s victory, Athar Hussain, secretary of Ayodhya Mosque Trust, said: “It is a manifestation of our pluralism. It shows that the idea of cultural harmony in India survives despite all odds. Let us strengthen the bond of harmony and fraternity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hindu-majority-ayodhya-village-elects-muslim-cleric-its-pradhan/articleshow/82539223.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||India||Bengal: HC ‘appreciates’ state’s efforts to stem post-poll violence||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court five-judge bench on Monday “appreciated” the Bengal government’s efforts to stem post-poll violence and said, after being informed that no violence had been reported since Sunday, that it should “keep up” its work. Fault-finding could be done later, acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal observed, adding that both the state and the central governments should work together to maintain peace now that a new state government was in place. The court, comprising ACJ Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, has sought for the centre’s response to the state government affidavit and will hear the case again on May 18. The state home secretary’s report to the HC on post-poll violence said there were 15 “violent incidents”, leading to 16 deaths, till May 3, an official said. There were six political clashes but no death on May 5, the day the new government was sworn in. There was no death on May 6 and May 7 and, on May 8, there was one death in Birbhum’s Khairasol. There was no incident since Sunday (May 9), according to the state government. Cops had arrested 400 people, including 72 for crimes like murder and arson, and 34 FIRs had been drawn up against fake news (five of them in Kolkata). State advocate-general Kishore Dutta assured the court that all possible steps would be taken to preempt violence. Additional solicitorgeneral YJ Dastoor, however, told the court that it was not just one party highlighting “post-poll violence”; all parties that fought the poll had made similar allegations, which was borne out by the state affidavit. Complaints were not registered by police stations in several cases, Dastoor said, but Dutta disputed this as false.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-appreciates-states-efforts-to-stem-post-poll-violence/articleshow/82539231.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Delhi||Running out of vaccine stock for 18-44, says Delhi government||NEW DELHI: Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Monday that just one day's stock of Covaxin and 3-4 days' stock of Covishield for those in the 18-44 age-group are left in Delhi. If the stock position does not improve immediately, the AAP government may be forced to shut down the centres administering Covaxin for this age-group after Tuesday evening. "Delhi is facing an acute shortage of vaccines...We really want the entire population of Delhi to be vaccinated and are conducting a mass vaccination drive," Jain said while inspecting a 400-bed Covid isolation and treatment centre set up at Rakabganj Gurdwara by Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee. It has been attached to Lok Nayak Hospital. Speaking elsewhere, AAP MLA Atishi said the Delhi government will be forced to shut down the centres administering Covaxin (for the 18-44 age-group) after Tuesday evening. Centre Is Overlooking Vaccination Needs Of Citizens, Claims SisodiaSimilarly, we will have to close down the centres administering Covishield after four days,” she said. Covaxin is available only for six days and Covishield for 5 days for those above 45 years and healthcare workers. The AAP leader hoped that the central government would supply the vaccines at the earliest. Addressing a separate press conference, deputy CM Manish Sisodia launched an attack on the Centre over vaccine distribution. Sisodia said the Centre was overlooking the vaccine needs of the citizens. He said that though Delhi had placed an order for 1.34 crore vaccines, the Centre had distributed only 3.5 lakh vaccines in May. He said the BJP government gives unlimited vaccines to foreign nations but restricts the supply for Indian citizens. Claiming that the Centre had exported 6.5 crore doses of vaccines to foreign countries, Sisodia said the central government has insinuated that the Delhi government had asked for only 5.5 lakh doses which is a complete lie served to the people of this nation in times of a crisis. Presenting documents procured from vaccine companies and signed letters ed from the central government, Sisodia said: “After the Centre decided in April that state governments can directly tie up with vaccine companies, the Delhi government released a letter to acquire 1.34 crore vaccine doses for citizens between 18-45 yrs. But instead of receiving vaccines, the Delhi government received a letter from the central government stating that we would get just 3.59 lakh vaccines out of which 92,840 doses were of Covaxin and 26,7690 doses of Covishield.” Sisodia said it is the central government which ultimately decides how many vaccine doses will be distributed among states and sent to other countries. “If 6.5 crore doses had been administered to the people of our country, we would have been able to save lives of many Indians,” he said. Meanwhile, the BJP asked the AAP government to explain how many vaccines it had actually ordered. BJP spokperson Sambit Patra released copies of letters saying that they were letters of intent to purchase and couldn’t be passed off as orders. Atishi, however, said the Delhi government has already placed orders for 1.4 crore vaccines with Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India (SII) and added that payments are being made by the Delhi government immediately as and when the vials are arriving. Sisodia accused the Centre of being interested only in exporting vaccines to foreign countries. He asked the central government to put an end to “politics of lies and deception” and understand that the country is in a full-fledged crisis. “They need to open their eyes to all the suffering and pain people of this nation are facing because of this deadly virus,” Sisodia said. “When the whole nation was in agony due to Covid-19, the central government was busy fighting elections in Bengal and created superspreaders by organising the Kumbh Mela. Now, when it’s time to actually step up and save lives, the central government is busy managing its image internationally and exporting vaccines abroad. This apathy of the central government is a grave crime. I request the central government to open its eyes to all the suffering and immediately make vaccines available in large numbers to states instead of mismanaging the crisis and indulging in politics of lies,” Sisodia said. Delhi is administering the Covid vaccine on a large scale. Those between 18-45 years of age are being inoculated at 96 locations while those above 45 years and healthcare and frontline workers are getting the jab at 374 locations. Meanwhile, Jain said in the past few days, not only has the positivity rate been decreasing but there has also been a decline in the number of cases. “There was a time when Delhi was recording approximately 28,000 cases. This has fallen to around 13,000. The 36% positivity rate has now fallen to nearly 20%. We hope the spread will reduce. Nevertheless, we should not cut back on our preparations and need to continue to protect ourselves in every possible way. This has been India’s second wave but is the fourth one for Delhi,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/running-out-of-vax-stockfor-18-44-says-delhi-govt/articleshow/82539251.cms||AlokKNMishra

Sarma, who held the health portfolio along with finance, education and PWD in the erstwhile Sarbananda Sonowal government, said after being sworn in at the Sankardev Kalakshetra cultural complex that “both the CM and health minister will together together aggressively fight the battle against the pandemic”. Besides Sarma’s chosen six from among the newly elected MLAs who weren’t part of the previous government, governor Jagdish Mukhi administered the oath of office to seven others who had held various positions in Sonowal’s ministry. Ajanta Neog, who switched from Congress to BJP ahead of the polls, is the only woman in the new government. Sarma has the option of allocating five more berths. The old faces who made the cut include Parimal Suklabaidya, Chandramohan Patowary, Sanjay Kishan, Jogen Mohan and Pijush Hazarika. Sarma retained two members of ally Asom Gana Parishad — party president Atul Bora and fellow veteran Keshab Mahanta — and Urkhao Gwra Brahma from new partner United People’s Party Liberal. Besides committing himself to “controlling” the spread of Covid not just in Assam but the entire northeast, Sarma appealed to Ulfa (I) chief Paresh Baruah and all other militant groups to lay down arms and become a part of the mainstream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/himanta-13-mantris-10-from-bjp-take-oath/articleshow/82539254.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Chennai||Raw deal: Tamil Nadu got only 50% of doses despite more Covid-19 cases||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu received half the number of Covid-19 vaccine doses that three other states with similar populations did, data released by the Union health ministry show. With a population of 7.6 crore, Tamil Nadu received 72 lakh doses of the vaccine until May 7, according to a central government press release. Rajasthan with 7.8 crore population got 1.4 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat with 6.9 crore population received 1.3 crore doses and Karnataka with 6.6 crore population received more than 1 crore doses. While Tamil Nadu had used up 65.9 lakh (91%) of the vaccines allotted, the consumption was between 95 and 99 among the other three states. “It is a very raw deal,” said a senior health department official. “We have been fighting with the Centre for everything from oxygen to drugs,” he said. After presenting its case before the Madras high court for enhancement of oxygen supply, the state is now lobbying with the Centre for increase in allocation of antiviral remdesivir. On Monday, chief minister M K Stalin urged Union minister Piyush Goyal to increase the allocation of remdesivir for Tamil Nadu to 20,000 vials a day. Across the country, of the 17.35 crore vaccine doses that the Centre had provided to states/UTs, the total consumption on May 7 (including wastage) was 16.7 crore doses. Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported fewer Covid-19 cases compared to Tamil Nadu. Rajasthan has a case tally of 7.7 lakh and Gujarat has reported 6.7 lakh cases, compared to more than 19 lakh in Karnataka and more than 15 lakh in Tamil Nadu. Public health experts and hospitals said that in January when the vaccination drive was launched cases were low and there wasn’t adequate information about the vaccine. More than 16 lakh senior citizens vaccinated partially Many, including healthcare providers, did not get vaccinated. As the effectiveness of the vaccine became clear from scientific studies, cases were spiralling. “So, people went in for vaccination. Unfortunately, by then the supply dwindled too,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. On Monday morning, the state announced that at least 73% of its healthcare providers and 88% of its frontline workers have taken the first dose. Nevertheless, nearly two of five healthcare providers and three of five frontline workers who took the first jab did not return for the second. While more than16 lakh senior citizens are partially vaccinated only 5.7 lakh have taken the second dose. Similarly, only 5.2 lakh people of the13.9 lakh people above 45 years have taken the vaccine. Joint secretary immunisation Dr K Vinay said the state revised strategies by reducing vaccination centres as the supply came down. “We limited Covaxin only to those who had taken the first shot. Centres that had poor attendance were shut,” he said. The wastage of vaccine came to near 4% from more than12% two weeks ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/raw-deal-tamil-nadu-got-only-50-of-doses-despite-more-cases/articleshow/82539252.cms||Pushpa Narayan

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Hetero official held for Remdesivir sale||HYDERABAD: Telangana police on Monday arrested an area manager of Hetero for diverting life-saving Remdesivir injection on the sly and claimed to have busted the illegal racket with several arrests over the past few days. Police said they got the whiff of an illegal operation at a private hospital in Miryalaguda last week. The owner, Dr. J Ashok Kumar who runs the hospital, was arrested first in the case on May 7. Police seized 60 vials of Remdesivir injections which were being sold to patients for Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 a vial, Nalgonda DIG AV Ranganath said. Subsequent investigation revealed that over the past one month, Balakrishna, an area manager of Hetero was supplying Remdesivir vials to his friend, Ganapathi Reddy, who runs a private firm, called Q Labs. “Balakrishna has been supplying Covifor vials to Ganapathi Reddy for a little over Rs 3,000 per vial. For this purpose, they set up Q Labs company to generate supply and purchase bills,” Ranganath said. “Dr Ashok Kumar's associate, identified as Srinivas, purchased each vial for Rs 23,000 from Ganapathi Reddy. The same was sold to patients for Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000. Balakrishna through Ganapathi Reddy supplied 138 vials of Covifor to Surya Hospital in the past one month,” the DIG added. Balakrishna and Ganapathi Reddy were arrested on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-hetero-official-held-for-remdesivir-sale/articleshow/82539266.cms||---

The latest update on oxygen released by the Centre estimated that production was nearing 9,500 metric tonnes, 1,000 metric tonne increase over the last fortnight, amid diversion of supply from industrial purpose and capacity utilisation nearing 129%. “Commensurate with the increase in production and demand, LMO sale in the country has also increased from about 1,300 MT per day in March 2021to 8,920 MT on 6 May. During the first wave of COVID-19, the maximum sale of 3095 MT a day of LMO was seen on 29 September 2020. The sale of LMO grew more than fivefold from 1,559 MT a day on March 31, 2021 to over 8,000 MT mark by 3 May, 2021,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/24000-beds-soon-near-refineries-steel-plants/articleshow/82539271.cms||---

The address proof need not just be an Aadhaar card, driving licence, voter ID or passport. Lease or rent agreements, electricity bills, bank passbooks, along with a government-approved photo-identification card will suffice. The information was shared through the official Twitter handle of National Health Mission (UP) on Monday evening. But in the absence of a revised government order or circular, the social media post had little impact on the ground as officials at the session sites went by the order issued on May 7 and insisted on a UP-issued ID as address proof.  In Noida and Ghaziabad, where many Indians from other cities, including Delhi, have come to work and settled over the years, lease or rent agreements are often the only local documents that they have with the other IDs being from their home states.  Additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad told TOI, “Preference will be given to residents of Uttar Pradesh. But migrants who are settled in UP will not be left out. After booking a slot, they will need to carry some document to prove they are staying somewhere in UP. Clarification will be issued to the chief medical officers. The staff deputed at session sites will be asked to not refuse such population.” On Monday, centres in Noida and Greater Noida kept turning away people who did not have a UP Aadhaar card. Several people who went to get the shot alleged the staff at the community and primary health centres behaved rudely. “My father has a flat in Noida and we were carrying the purchase and possession letter. Since I am from Chandigarh, I have Punjab IDs,” said Yuvraj Sharma, who had come to the Bisrakh health centre. “But I stay with them in Noida and work in Gurgaon. I had been given an appointment and such rules were not mentioned on the slip. An argument broke out and the staffers turned abusive. I left with my father after we were humiliated without any mistake on our part,” he added. The health centre had pasted a notice near the gate which stated: “At the community health centre in Bisrakh, vaccination of the 18-44 population will take place according to the allotted date and slot and UP identity card will be needed for it.” In Ghaziabad, administration and health department officials said the government’s order on inoculating only UP residents would be followed till they get a revised order. Officiating DM Krishna Karunesh said local address would be verified before giving jabs. “It would be unjustified for people of UP if others take advantage of the drive,” he said. But he clarified that no one coming with pre-registration and under a specified time slot has been denied vaccine so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/docu-list-eased-to-clear-vax-hurdle-for-migrants/articleshow/82535861.cms||Shalabh

Karnataka reported 39,305 new cases and record 596 deaths in the past 24 hours even as the day’s national case count dropped to less than 3.3 lakh, the lowest in two weeks. Maharashtra, the worst-hit Indian state both in the first and the second wave, recorded 37,236 fresh cases and 549 fatalities.   Coronavirus live updatesBengaluru accounted for 374 of Karnataka’s deaths, the highest ever for the city. Bengaluru’s 374 deaths was higher than its previous highest toll of 346 deaths recorded on May 7. The city’s Monday death toll is second only to Delhi which has seen over 400 deaths in a day a few times. Bengaluru has now seen 8,431 Covid deaths till date.   Daily fatalities reported by Karnataka included 185 Covid victims who had died in April, and their details were reconciled in the daily bulletin issued on Monday by the state health and family welfare department.

---||India||Congress veterans slam AIUDF, ISF deals||NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leaders questioned the party’s decision to ally with AIUDF in Assam in the recent elections, saying sensitive issues should have been determined by keeping the national perspective in view, suggesting that such alliances only spark or consolidate a counter-polarisation. The remarks by two seniors, Digvijaya Singh and Ghulam Nabi Azad, a leading member of the G-23 group of dissenters, are a rewind to the post-2014 diagnosis led by Sonia Gandhi and A K Antony that BJP’s painting of Congress as a “pro-minority” party was a factor behind the Lok Sabha rout. The meeting of the Congress Working Committee on Monday saw Singh slamming the tie-up with AIUDF. West Bengal in-charge Jitin Prasada said ally Left’s decision to rope in the newly-launched Muslim outfit ISF was a bad decision which hurt Congress. Rahul Gandhi skipped the meeting, with sources close to him saying he was yet to recover fully from Covid-19. Firing his salvo, Singh said when he was AICC general secretary in charge of Assam, the late Tarun Gogoi twice steered clear of AIUDF and the party won handsomely. According to sources, Singh said the day the decision of alliance with Ajmal became public, people started believing Congress would lose. Ghulam Nabi Azad argued that big and sensitive alliances cannot be left to the state units to decide but should be debated in a central committee like the CWC. He also remarked that senior leaders like him, who have struck alliances in the past even if with mixed results, could have been consulted. He spoke of considering the national perspective in local pacts. While the veteran spoke of the role of state leadership, he hinted at the need for wider discussion and possible accountability. Azad spoke in a conciliatory tone but made his points. He said the party should not have lost Kerala where the opposition has won in every election , and emphasized Congress had never drawn zero in Bengal since 1952. But he said it was time for “unity” to fight Covid – citing his interview with TOI after the poll debacle on May 3 in which he had said the results were disappointing but time was not opportune to debate the reasons. Jitin Prasada said Congress suffered from the contradiction of the entire leadership in Delhi publicly wishing for Trinamool's victory while tying up with the Left in the state. He said the dichotomy of fighting the Left in Kerala and allying with it in West Bengal hurt the party as the electorate felt Congress was not a serious contender. He said Congress strongholds polled in the last two phases by when the contest had turned bipolar. Saying that terming the results “disappointing would be an understatement”, Congress president Sonia Gandhi announced a committee to probe the election performance. In his report on the Assam defeat, party in-charge Jitendra Singh slammed groupism and lack of belief among leaders that Congress could win. The party’s Kerala manager Tariq Anwar said the Left gained public support by its good work in Covid-19 relief, which was carried out by its cadres and block-level organisation, which was a weak link in Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-veterans-slam-aiudf-isf-deals/articleshow/82539292.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The decision came after much wrangling and muscle flexing. Party coordinator O Panneerselvam initially resisted the move and proposed former speaker P Dhanapal’s name, sources said. But there were few takers for the suggestion. The power struggle was in full display as Panneerselvam and Palaniswami squabbled over who was more eligible to be the leader of the opposition. But with little support from the newly elected MLAs, 63 of them discounting the two leaders, Panneerselvam gave in. He rejected the offer of deputy leader for himself, proposing Dhanapal for the post instead, and left the party headquarters in a huff, sources said. OPS fails to garner any support at party meet AIADMK deputy coordinator and erstwhile supporter of Panneerselvam, K P Munusamy, submitted a letter to assembly secretary K Srinivasan about the ‘unanimous’ choice of the legislature party, on the eve of the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected MLAs. Later in the evening, Palaniswami called on Panneerselvam at the latter’s residence and greeted him with a shawl and a bouquet. Panneerselvam returned the compliment, draping the same shawl on Palaniswami. Former ministers and senior functionaries accompanied Palaniswami. Allies PMK leader S Ramadoss and G K Vasan of TMC congratulated him. The legislature party unanimously elected Palaniswami as leader of the opposition with a majority of the MLAs, including former ministers, backing him. “Except Alangulam MLA P H Manoj Pandian, no one present at the meeting backed OPS. They were all urging him to sacrifice one more time, like he did when he agreed to project EPS as chief ministerial candidate for the assembly election,” a senior leader told TOI. The decision was made after a three-hour long discussion by MLAs at the party headquarters in Chennai, and Panneerselvam left after signing the necessary papers, “appearing unhappy”.The leader of the opposition must be chosen by Tuesday night since the Speaker-elect would have to be taken to the chair on Wednesday by the chief minister and leader of the opposition. On Friday too, AIADMK MLAs discussed for nearly three hours, but failed to arrive at a consensus. Panneerselvam did not get support even from his own community members and senior leaders in the southern belt. Close Palaniswami associates P Thangamani and S P Velumani and senior leader K A Sengottaiyan threw their weight behind him. The meeting began with Palaniswami stating he would accept whatever decision the MLAs took.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-is-tamil-nadu-opposition-leader-ops-rejects-deputy-leaders-post/articleshow/82539281.cms||Julie Mariappan

A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambani said “in the interests of justice, we are of the view that the release of the applicant/appellant is imperative in this hour of grief and personal loss and in the facts and circumstances of the case” ordering her immediate release so that Narwal could go to Haryana where the body of her father Mahavir Narwal is being kept in a hospital. See that Narwal maintains radio silence while on bail: HCWhile directing the release that was not opposed by the Delhi Police, the HC cautioned her lawyer to ensure Narwal maintains “radio silence” while on bail and refrains from social media to issue any statement or comments. “We are not recording this in our order but it may lead to cancellation of her bail,” the court warned. It also waived off the need for her to furnish a surety since her sole sibling Akash Narwal “is currently in self-isolation by reason of being afflicted by Covid-19” and she has already furnished sureties towards bail granted to her in two other cases. The bench directed Narwal to provide her telephone number to the special cell of Delhi Police and to the concerned SHO, and to keep the provided phone number operational. It further specified that she will wear a PPE kit at the time of the cremation, adhere to all Covid-19 rules and undergo a RT-PCR test three days before she surrenders. Since in other bail orders the court has prohibited her from leaving Delhi, the HC clarified that considering the ground and the purpose for which interim bail is being granted by it, Narwal’s travelling within Delhi and Haryana shall not constitute a violation of earlier condition. Narwal is in judicial custody in connection with cases accusing her of a larger conspiracy in the northeast Delhi riots last year. She has been booked under stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act after being named an accused by the Delhi Police in three FIRs registered in connection with the protests and violence in northeast Delhi. She was arrested on March 23, 2020, but was granted bail. However, soon after getting bail, she was again arrested by Delhi Police in another case and is now under judicial custody. She was also arrested in a third case later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-grants-3-week-bail-to-natasha-narwal-for-dads-last-rites/articleshow/82539288.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||‘Covid situation changed due to rise of fast-spreading mutated variants’||Amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, department of science & technology (DST), shared with TOI's Vishwa Mohan the challenges posed by new mutated variants, limitations of mathematical models, and strategies to control spread of infection and protect livelihoods. Excerpts:Did the scientific community and the DST anticipate the kind of Covid-19 situation India is facing right now?At the time the first wave was tapering, sero surveys such as the fifth serological survey in Delhi, conducted between January 15 and January 23, to detect Covid-19 antibodies showed 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled tested positive. Such a situation should in general reduce the number of future transmissions. But the situation changed due to the rise of new mutated variants that could spread more rapidly with greater impact, and large-scale laxity in observation of protective measures induced by fatigue due to the long-term social and economic restrictions. While many mutations were being observed all along the trajectory of the pandemic, the conclusive scientific understanding of the transmissibility and impact of mutations of concern is still continuing. It is for these and other reasons that the scale, speed, intensity and ferocity of the situation we witness today could not have been foreseen by scientific agencies and committees that were directly monitoring the situation. There was a lot of buzz around the Covid-19 second wave much before it actually hit the country. Was there any concrete scientific evidence to foresee it or its intensity? Of course, there are always varying perspectives and debates about many possibilities for the future evolution of a pandemic and on balanced strategies to contain its rise while keeping in view justifiable demands (to preserve) livelihoods. This is a problem that all countries have grappled with. I have examined predictions various globally well-respected models were making at that time. But there was no concrete scientific evidence by the end of March to early April to foresee its speed and intensity. It is only in retrospect that many rationalizations can be offered. Many relevant scientific facts are still being probed and pondered. For example, wider scientific acceptance of transmission of the virus by airborne aerosol route and its implications for ventilation of indoor spaces as a key protective measure are of recent origin. Is there any prediction on how long this second wave would continue? As one can expect, there are several differing predictions. For example, models developed at University of Michigan (US), Ashoka University and the SUTRA model indicate per day peak cases of around 8 lakhs, 5-6 lakhs and 4 lakhs respectively within a window of early May to late May. The models seem to indicate around two months after the peak to reach levels comparable to those seen at the end of the first wave. However, fidelity of long-term predictions depends on the adherence to appropriate behaviour -- masking, ventilation, distancing, testing, surveillance, isolation, vaccination, etc and on having no further game-changing mutations. Regardless of that, the needed key actions today and in the foreseeable future still remain in breaking the pathways of virus transmission in all its avatars. When should we expect the third wave? About the third wave and beyond, the future is not so much about predicting it, but actively imaging, inventing and shaping it. We do have the power to write our chosen destiny by shared objectives and shared responsibilities reflecting measures we put in motion today. There is no iron hand of mathematics or any other science pushing us on a preordained path. A virus such as SARS-CoV-2 and its mutated forms can remain in circulation indefinitely until its edge is blunted by greatly reduced transmission by protective measures, vaccination, evolution to more benign forms and the protection offered by the antibodies generated in infected persons. Do you think India should go for inoculation irrespective of age criteria, considering growing instances of infections among children during this second wave?In an ideal setting with unlimited supply, one should implement near universal immunization. However, in a supply constrained situation, a pragmatic strategy must factor in Covid-19 risk profiles and the system capacity. Major risk factors are partly related to age, partly to the job profile and partly to serious comorbidities. In the vaccination strategy being pursued, each of these risks is addressed.  In a large-scale vaccination program, prioritization must be done in a way which is unequivocal, clear, actionable, easy to implement, transparent and minimizes the risk to the entire population as a whole. India’s strategy has been in conformity with the best global practices (UK, USA, Australia, France and others) that have initially focused on their elderly and also in line with the WHO recommendations. Of course, as the supplies ramp up, the vaccination has to become universal including older children. Does the country have the capacity for a universal vaccination programme to fight the pandemic? A: The production and acquisition of vaccines in India are being ramped up by several measures being pursued including supply of raw materials, excess inventory and relaxation of certain intellectual property norms from other countries, allowing the import of foreign-approved vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik V and others, with plans for some of them to be manufactured in India; and more new vaccines being developed in India rapidly. Let me also recall a warning of the WHO Chief, “The inequitable distribution of vaccines is not just a moral outrage, it is also economically and epidemiologically self-defeating. The more transmission, the more variants. And the more variants that emerge, the more likely it is that they could evade vaccines.” I do think and hope that the nations more advanced in their fight against the virus will realize sooner that Covid-19, like its cousin - climate change, is a global beast, taming of which requires a committed global cooperation at an unprecedented speed and scale. For no man is an island. And this adage has never been clearer and more present. National mathematical model like the one called SUTRA by IIT scientists and others helped us know the Covid-19 trajectory. But, its prediction may not always be correct. What are the limitations of such models when we look at fast changing scenarios in terms of testing or reporting gaps in certain states and non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour by the general public?Any mathematical model of a pandemic spread is neither a crystal ball that foretells future with accuracy, nor a law of nature like Newton’s laws of motion. Predictions of a model depend crucially on the prevailing inputs such as the behaviour of the virus and people, and when they change significantly, the model needs recalibration. This is not a limitation of a particular model. All mathematical models of a complex pandemic can only predict the short term future with some certainty assuming that the world continues to be static.  There have been models by well-established scientists globally, published in the top scientific journals, which overestimated the peak disease and death burden of the first wave in India by as much as 1000%. That it did not come to pass has to do with the required stringent measures put in place and observed by the population at large at that time.  The SUTRA model on April 2 predicted the second wave to peak by the third week of April at around 1 lakh daily cases. The updated predictions today are different owing to the different realities, factored in different input parameters. Nevertheless, it is well recognized that models are useful in testing scenarios and identifying the major departures in the behaviour of people and viruses.  The DST had set up a diversified National Committee of 10 scientists soon after the onset of Covid-19, which submitted a report in September, 2020 on the pandemic modelling activities being pursued in India. Over 30 different groups of scientists were then funded to further develop the capacity for pandemic modelling in the country from different perspectives. SUTRA was developed by three of the members of the original committee in their individual capacity as scientists and is one among several other competing models. There is a long list of contributions made by the DST (CSIR’s institutions and others) to help India fight the pandemic. Would you like to identify a couple of inventions which really helped the country in testing and vaccine development? In the early phase of Covid-19, several critical products were identified -- ventilators, protective gears, diagnostics, disinfectants and vaccines -- which were then largely imported and were in severe short supply. Over 100 start-up and industries together with a score of academic and R&D institutions were identified to develop and manufacture these with an unprecedented speed and the best global quality, which have served us well in being self-sufficient.  In diagnostics, there have been significant innovations that have allowed greater speeds, ease and cost of testing. These include top of the line RT-LAMP platforms, rapid antibody and antigen tests, probe less RT-PCR kits, and workflow innovations such as dry swab testing that greatly accelerates testing, efficient nano-tech enabled RNA extraction kits and CRISPR diagnostics to perform faster nucleic acid testing without qPCR machines and many others. These enabled lower costs and more accessible testing at various scales, from manual systems with low throughput to automated robotic systems with high throughput. The urgency has now shifted to innovative, sometimes repurposed, made in India parts and devices for production of oxygen. A recently approved repurposed drug, 2-DG, developed by the INMAS/DRDO and Dr Reddy’s lab appears promising in reducing the hospital stays and oxygen dependency.  In vaccines, the Serum Institute of India remains the largest global producer of Covid-19 vaccines. Covaxin, India's first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech, was developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV) at a totally unprecedented speed. Several new Indian vaccine candidates are on the horizon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-situation-changed-due-to-rise-of-fast-spreading-mutated-variants/articleshow/82539302.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Days after Mt Carmel founder’s death due to virus, 100-bed Covid centre opens at school||NEW DELHI: Mount Carmel School turned part of its complex into a 100-bed Covid care centre on Monday, the first private school in Delhi to take up such an initiative. The Covid centre in Sector 22, Dwarka, is relying on volunteers from churches not only in India but also from abroad. Oxygen concentrators have been shipped from South Korea. By the weekend, an oxygen refilling plant will also be installed. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia visited the school on Monday and described the project as a mark of humanity. V K Williams, founder of the school, was known to have been very excited about the facility, but did not live to see its opening on Monday. The 83-year-old succumbed to Covid on May 2. The centre bears his name. Covid-positive individuals with mild or moderate symptoms will be accommodated at Mount Carmel. While 50 beds have been set up in the school auditorium, the remaining 50 are in 10 classrooms, five to a room. The patients will be looked after by doctors who have flown in from various parts of India and over 70 nursing students and paramedics. Classrooms, auditorium become life savers...William’s brother-inlaw, Sunil Gokavi, is overseeing the medical features at the centre. Residential facilities have been set up in the primary section for the use of the outstation doctors. "They will be here for 2-3 months," said Michael Williams, dean of Mount Carmel Schools. "The Akshay Patra Foundation is assisting with the food for patients." For now, the facility has been associated with Venkateswara Hospital in Dwarka and St Stephen’s Hospital in north Delhi to manage emergencies. Williams recalled, "The idea came up six weeks ago. We, friends from different churches, meet every month to pray. In one of our meetings, we wondered what we could do in the pandemic. Given the many Christian doctors and nurses, we hit upon the idea of a care centre for those affected by Covid The dean added, "We can add more classrooms if required. Men and women have been placed on different floors." Williams’ mother herself is recovering from Covid, while he lost his younger brother to the outbreak last November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-days-after-mt-carmel-founders-death-due-to-virus-100-bed-covid-centre-opens-at-school/articleshow/82539307.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||India||No financial aid given to SII & Bharat Biotech: Govt in SC||NEW DELHI: Clearing a cloud of claims over monetary aid given to Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, the Centre informed the Supreme Court that it has provided no financial assistance to either Bharat Biotech or Serum Institute for development of vaccines but financial support of Rs 46 crore was extended for clinical trials. “No governmental aid, assistance or grant is made either for research or development of either Covaxin or Covishield. However, they were given some financial assistance for conducting clinical trials,” the Centre said in its affidavit filed late on Sunday night in the SC. It clarified that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) spent Rs 46 crore on clinical trials of the two vaccines. The Centre also informed the court that it has given 100% advance money to Bharat Biotech International Ltd (BBIL) and Serum Institute of India (SII), totalling Rs 2,520 crore, for procurement of vaccine doses for the months of May, June and July. SII was paid Rs 1,732.5 crore for 11 crore doses of Covishield and BBIL was paid Rs 787.5 crore for 5 crore doses of Covaxin. It said Covaxin was developed under public private partnership between the ICMR and BBIL. “ICMR has not provided any funds to BBIL for Covaxin development. However, funds have been spent in various activities undertaken by ICMR and National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for Covaxin development. Also, its phase 3 clinical trials have been funded by ICMR. The trials have been conducted at 22 sites in 25,800 participants. Total estimated expenditure of ICMR is 35 crore,” the Centre said. “The bridging studies of Covishield on 1,600 participants in India were supported by ICMR in partnership with SII. No funds were provided to SII. Funds were transferred to 14 clinical trial sites. Total estimated expenditure of ICMR is Rs 11 crore,” it added. According to an central government official, the Centre has also helping vaccine development with autonomous institutes of DBT involved in generating animal models for SARS-CoV-2. The immunoassay labs are serving as national service facilities for vaccine development. In its affidavit, the Centre said the government was trying to ramp up production of vaccines and both BBIL and SII have expanded their facilities to almost double their production and provide 5.5 crore and 6.5 crore doses of vaccines, respectively, by the end of July. It said by then, Sputnik V production by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories would be around1.2 crore doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-financial-aid-given-to-sii-bharat-biotech-govt-in-sc/articleshow/82539319.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The tweet comes after police personnel across the state started blocking people who had come out for purchase in their vehicles. Since morning, police were seen caning people near shops, markets and other public places. Citizens reacted sharply to the caning and seizing of vehicles, saying police were not allowing them to use vehicles to buy daily essentials. Around 7pm, Sood tweeted: "To buy groceries, vegetables and daily needs, there is no bar on using vehicle to your neighbourhood shop in cities or nearest availability point in rural areas. Use this facility with discretion and not as a licence for free run every day. Stay at home for your own safety." The state government, in its lockdown guidelines issued last week, had banned use of private vehicles to buy groceries and other essentials from 6am to 10am. It caused hardship to the people, especially in districts where people have to travel 5-10km to the nearest town to buy essentials. Angry people were seen arguing with cops in many places and pouring out anger on social media. Oppn questions no-vehicle rule“I wanted to buy medicines and the nearest town is 8km away. Police did not allow me to use my scooter. Should I walk 8km,” asked a farmer in Chikkamagaluru town. Contact numbers of the state human rights commission were circulated by a few on social media asking people to complain against the cops. Sources said complaints of police action against the civilians reached Vidhana Soudha and opposition leaders, including Siddaramaiah, attacked the CM over the issue. Siddaramaiah tweeted: “It is a thoughtless decision by @BJP4Karnataka govt to ban vehicle movement while allowing essential commodities shops to open from 6am to 10am. Rural people will have to walk for 2-3km to buy groceries, milk or any essential goods. How can senior citizens & others walk with goods in hand?” “This is not the lockdown we suggested. We wanted a people-friendly lockdown. The government must focus on measures to fulfil daily needs so that people do not come out of their homes,” said former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. Soon after Sood tweeted, citizens said police personnel on roads should be alerted to the tweet. “Please circulate this order immediately to all the police stations across the state so that the public would not face any lathicharge from police… (Message must be) in Kannada for better understanding,” Sardar MTanaz tweeted. RiyazKhateeb posted on Twitter: “A bike of nursing staff @gulbarga has been seized by @KlbCityPolice while going to attend his duty and taken to behind mini vidhan soudha DC office Kalaburagi. Is there any directions to seize medical staff, pharmacists & patients attendees vehicles Sir? Twitter user Simon Riley said, “It’s been on news that cops are using brute force.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow records 1, 274 new Covid cases, lowest count in 34 days||LUCKNOW: As the decline in the daily Covid-19 cases continued for the second consecutive day on Monday, the city recorded 1,274 new infections in the last 24 hours, the lowest in 34 days. However, the drop was overshadowed by the deaths continuing to remain high with the novel coronavirus infection claiming lives of 26 patients at an average of a death every hour. With this, the tally and toll of the second Covid-19 wave that started on March 15 reached 1.4 lakh and 940, respectively. On these, 23,672 cases and 325 deaths have been recorded in the first 10 days of May alone. However, apart from the drop in the cases, another relief was that for the 17th day in a row, the number of recoveries — 2,915 on Monday — was more than the new infections. Overall 1.2 lakh patients have recovered during the second wave. As a result, the number of patients with active infection dropped to 21,941. However, there were still over 6,000 patients in the hospitals, of which the condition of about 2,500 was either serious or critical. Doctors said that though the cases may decline further, deaths are expected to remain high for some time because of the high number of critical patients who were infected when the second wave was at its peak. Experts also said that the second wave seems to have peaked in the city and the transmission rate is expected to decline in coming days. However, they warned that this does not mean that people let their guard drop. “Every individual needs to protect her/himself by strictly adhering to safety protocols, which will also help in protecting their family members,” said an expert. Over 9,800 take vaccine shots in cityAs many as 9,878 more perople were vaccinated against Covid-19 on Monday. Among them were 3,473 beneficiaries in the 18-44 years age group who received their first shots. More men (2,132) in this age group came for the jab in comparison to women (1,341). In the 45-59 years age group, 1,927 took their first shots and 1,967 the second. Similarly, in the 60 years and above category, 616 came for the first dose and 1,449 got their second jab. Several healthcare and frontline workers also took their first and second shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drop-in-cases-raises-hope-lucknow-lowest-count-in-34-days/articleshow/82539318.cms||---

TNMSC data shows the counter at Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital in Chennai sold 1,500 vials of the drug, followed by 560 in Coimbatore, 500 in Madurai, 393 in Trichy and 300 each in Salem and Tirunelveli, all at MRP. However, many continued to purchase it in the black market, with one person at a private hospital in Chennai shelling out ₹30,000 per vial. At the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, hundreds of people waiting to buy the drug protested when the sale counter closed hardly half an hour after it opened. While TNMSC staff said it was because the allotted 500 doses were sold by then, the protesters, many of who had come from neighbouring districts, suspected unfair practices. A hospital official said preference was given to the 63 people issued tokens the previous day. “With each patient requiring six doses, we could give it to only 20 new people,” he said. At the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital in Salem, hundreds returned emptyhanded. V Gopi Kumar, who had waited in the queue from 8pm on Sunday, said there were nearly 200 people ahead of him and he couldn’t get the injection for his father. K Srinivasan of Hosur said TNMSC officials asked him to come with the latest prescription on Tuesday as he was holding one dated Sunday. Hundreds from Madurai and surrounding districts had thronged the medical college hospital in the temple town from as early as 2am, but a majority of them had to return disappointed as the day’s stock soon ran out. S Pandian of Dindigul said his son was undergoing treatment at a hospital in his hometown. “His condition is critical and doctors asked me to arrange for Remdesivir. But I couldn’t.” The crowd at the government physiotherapy college in Trichy was so huge that collector S Divyadharshini said there was limited supply of Remdesivir. “Full-fledged distribution commenced today [Monday]. Let us monitor the situation. In case of need of more vials, we will inform the government,” she said. While counters remaining closed on Sunday was cited as one of the reasons for the huge crowds, Su Venkatesan, MP from Madurai, wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal, urging him to allocate more Remdesivir for Tamil Nadu as the allotment was barely enough for a fourth of the patients.

But I couldn’t.” The crowd at the government physiotherapy college in Trichy was so huge that collector S Divyadharshini said there was limited supply of Remdesivir. “Full-fledged distribution commenced today [Monday].

While counters remaining closed on Sunday was cited as one of the reasons for the huge crowds, Su Venkatesan, MP from Madurai, wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal, urging him to allocate more Remdesivir for Tamil Nadu as the allotment was barely enough for a fourth of the patients.

---||Madurai||Covid-19: Protests, serpentine queues mark sale of remdesivir in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Protests, long queues, heated exchange of words between disappointed kin and Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) officials and allegations of hoarding marked the sale of antiviral drug remdesivir across the state on Monday. TNMSC data shows the counter at Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital in Chennai sold 1,500 vials of the drug, followed by 560 in Coimbatore, 500 in Madurai, 393 in Trichy and 300 each in Salem and Tirunelveli, all at MRP. However, many continued to purchase it in the black market, with one person at a private hospital in Chennai shelling out ₹30,000 per vial. At the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, hundreds of people waiting to buy the drug protested when the sale counter closed hardly half an hour after it opened. While TNMSC staff said it was because the allotted 500 doses were sold by then, the protesters, many of who had come from neighbouring districts, suspected unfair practices. A hospital official said preference was given to the 63 people issued tokens the previous day. “With each patient requiring six doses, we could give it to only 20 new people,” he said. At the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital in Salem, hundreds returned emptyhanded. V Gopi Kumar, who had waited in the queue from 8pm on Sunday, said there were nearly 200 people ahead of him and he couldn’t get the injection for his father. K Srinivasan of Hosur said TNMSC officials asked him to come with the latest prescription on Tuesday as he was holding one dated Sunday. Hundreds from Madurai and surrounding districts had thronged the medical college hospital in the temple town from as early as 2am, but a majority of them had to return disappointed as the day’s stock soon ran out.

Finally, on Sunday evening, the family managed to find a bed and she was shifted inside. With help from her employer, she was moved to Janapriya Hospital on Monday afternoon but she remains critical. Jalaja Prasad, 57, was brought to the hospital by son Manju Prasad on Friday night after she tested positive and had breathing difficulties. The Vidyaranyapura resident has been on the housekeeping staff for two decades at a Tumakuru factory which manufactures plastic doors and windows. She had high fever on Wednesday night. "Her condition worsened on Friday and I rushed her to Yelahanka General Hospital where doctors said there were no beds. She collapsed in front of a shop outside the hospital and struggled to breathe. I pleaded with doctors to help and they gave me an oxygen cylinder but strictly said no admission as there were no beds," a tearful Manju told TOI. Pleas on social media helped patient get bedManju rushed home on Saturday and brought back a cot and mattress. “I placed the bed outside the shop and made her lie down and gave her oxygen support,” Manju said. Manju shot a video clip of his mother’s plight and sent it to her employer Arpith Shetty, who pleaded on social media for a bed for her. “I kept calling the BBMP helpline and all other sources but there was no hope till Sunday evening,” Arpith said. After more than 48 agonising hours, Yelahanka hospital authorities granted her a general bed and she was shifted on Sunday night. “Her situation didn’t change much and it kept deteriorating. She needed an ICU facility with a ventilator but I was told it wasn’t available,” said Manju. Following desperate efforts by Arpith and several Covid volunteers in the field, an ICU bed at Janapriya Hospital in Banaswadi was located on Monday noon through the BBMP helpline. She shifted by 1pm into a ventilator-support system. Manju is hopeful she’ll survive the ordeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-patient-waits-on-pavement-outside-hospital-for-48-hours/articleshow/82539355.cms||Petlee Peter
---||India||13 core Covid-19 vaccine doses will be produced per month by July: Govt to SC||NEW DELHI: The Union government has informed the Supreme Court that vaccine production in India will be ramped up to more than 13 crore doses per month by the end of July while negating the court’s suggestions for door-to-door vaccination under the national immunisation scheme as unsuitable for Covid-19 inoculation. “Production capacity of vaccines under the vaccination drive has been gradually ramped up and is expected to increase further in the next couple of months. Serum Institute of India has ramped up production from 5 crore doses per month to 6.5 crore doses per month and further ramp-up is expected by July. Bharat Biotech has increased production from 90 lakh/month to 2 crore doses/month and further increase is expected up to 5.5 crore doses/month by July. Sputnik V (distributed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories) is expected to increase production from 30 lakh to 1.2 crore doses/month by July,” the government said. “Efforts have been made to support scale-up of production of Covaxin, under Mission Covid Suraksha. Accordingly, support for one private industry and three public sector manufacturing facilities is under consideration, to make them ready with enhanced capacities to support augmented vaccine production over the next 6-8 months,” it added. “The vaccine manufacturers recommended for support are Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad; Indian Immunologicals, Hyderabad; Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals, Mumbai; Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals, Bulandshahr. An amount of approximately Rs 200 crore has been allocated for supporting augmentation of capacities for manufacturing, whereby, it is expected that the current manufacturing of Covaxin of 10 million doses/month will be enhanced to nearly 100 million doses/month in the next 8-10 months,” it said. The government expressed inability to give projection of vaccine production 6-8 months down the line. It said door-to-door vaccination was unsuited for administering vaccines, which require to be maintained at a particular temperature and the person vaccinated is required to be kept under observation for 30 minutes. The Centre said the liberalised pricing module for vaccines, wherein 50% of vaccines would be given free of cost to the Centre and at different prices to states and private hospitals, would encourage more private players to enter the field.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/13cr-doses-will-be-produced-per-month-by-july-govt-to-sc/articleshow/82539350.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Bengaluru||Doctors' ethical dilemma: Save the young or seniors?||BENGALURU: With an increasing demand for ICU beds and ventilators, clinicians are facing an ethical dilemma over allotment of beds: Young breadwinners or senior citizens? The focus is certainly more on saving the youngsters, multiple hospital authorities told TOI on the condition of anonymity. "Age has to become a criterion for ICU admission, apart from the patient's condition. Not that we are denying treatment for the elderly patients outright, but we do feel sorry for the families of young patients suffering from severe forms of the disease," said an intensivist. Coronavirus live updatesThe head of a hospital in west Bengaluru told TOI that he had never faced such an ethical dilemma in his 35-year career. "Who should get priority, given the limited resources? From a medical practitioner's perspective, we can't differentiate between the young and the old. Now, it is different. Between an ailing senior citizen whose prognosis suggests s/he may not make a recovery and a young man who has chances of survival, I would go for the latter. We do explain the situation to the families," the doctor said. Read AlsoDelhi: 9,400 funerals in April alone, worst month since the pandemic beganMore than 9,400 Covid protocol cremations took place in the municipal corporation-run 28 Covid-designated funeral centres in April— the worst impacted period, so far, since the pandemic began.Disease severity a criterion, not age: DocThere are very few hospitals that have the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, which is used to pump and oxygenate a patient’s blood outside the body, replacing the function of the lungs and heart. “We have had a 44-year-old man on ECMO for the past three weeks and he is making subtle but gradual improvement. There was only one ECMO machine. A week ago, we had a 22-year-old woman who recently required ECMO. She died in front of us. Being helpless is adding to our stress. Each life we are losing was the one that should have been saved,” said an intensivist from a corporate hospital in Bengaluru. Read AlsoWhen a 26-year-old doctor has to decide who lives and who dies"Who to be saved, who not to be saved should be decided by God. We are not made for that – we are just humans," the young doctor saysBesides age, the patient’s class matters as they get multiple calls if s/he is from an influential background. With resource crunch, NGOs helping several critical patients find a bed admit they do make a choice. “If the Covid patient is young and the only breadwinner of the family, we do make our best attempts to help find a bed,” says Mohammed Ismail, a volunteer working with Emergency Response Team of Mercy Mission. “On April 30, we received a request from the family of a 32-yearold man, whose oxygen saturation level was 70% and the private hospital where he was had no ventilator for him. His parents had died the previous day and his pregnant wife had gone for their cremation. We had to speak to several MLAs, officers to get him a bed and he was finally shifted to Victoria Hospital,” Ismail said. The priority goes for a young breadwinner of the family, pregnant women in need of ICU beds, he added. But some doctors look at the treatment path. The only criteria between an old and a young patient would be who is the sicker of the two, said Dr Smitha Thimmaiah, medical superintendent, Sparsh Hospital, Mysore Road. “If my parents were in this situation, I would not have ignored considering their age, right? The same is applicable to any other patient too. Age is not the criterion, but the disease severity and the need of treatment are,” said Dr Smitha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/doctors-ethical-dilemma-save-the-young-or-seniors/articleshow/82539363.cms||---
---||India||Vaccine Maitri grounded, neighbours turn to China for relief||NEW DELHI: With the government’s Vaccine Maitri grounded for now, India’s neighbours are looking at China to infuse some life into their own tottering vaccination programmes. Despite having blocked earlier the use of China’s Sinopharm vaccine for the local population, Sri Lanka just started administering the same to Lankans, after the vaccine was approved by WHO last week, and Bangladesh is expected to receive 500,000 doses of the Chinese vaccine from Beijing in the next few days. Vaccination in both the countries, as also Nepal, took a severe hit after the Serum Institute of India reneged on its commitment to supply the Covishield vaccine to them because of a sharp spike in infections in India. However, as her government approaches China and Russia to meet the shortfall, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina wrote to her counterpart Narendra Modi Monday expressing solidarity with India in the fight against the pandemic. Significantly, while confirming that Beijing was sending 500,000 doses of Sinopharm to Bangladesh, Chinese ambassador in Dhaka Li Jiming also urged Bangladesh to not join Quad and warned that participating in the ``military alliance’’ will substantially damage bilateral ties. Nepal is also expected to start its second round of vaccination soon with the Vero Cell jab donated by China. Donation alone from China though is unlikely to meet the requirements of these countries. ``We are pleading with our friends around the world to urgently provide us with essential medical items, life-saving drugs and vaccines,’’ wrote Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli in a column in The Guardian Monday. Nepal is currently seeing around 8000 Covid cases every day. Oli further said that billions of people in the global south still do not know when the Covid-19 vaccine will be made available to them and that solidarity with these nations was essential. In the case of Bangladesh, while Li announced that 500,000 doses will arrive from China on May 12, he added that the ``line is too long’’ for commercial supply to Bangladesh from China and that Dhaka should not expect it before December. The ambassador went on to blame Bangladesh for this saying that Dhaka had allowed emergency-use authorisation for Sinopharm only a week ago and that now there was a long queue for the Chinese vaccine. Most of India’s neighbours were reluctant to use Sinopharm for inoculation though as it wasn’t approved by WHO. While Sri Lanka received 600,000 doses of the vaccine from China in March, its health regulatory authorities blocked the use of Sinopharm. This meant that the Lankan government government could only administer the vaccine to Chinese nationals living and working in the island nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-maitri-grounded-neighbours-turn-to-china-for-relief/articleshow/82539367.cms||Sachin Parashar

On opposition leaders’ criticism of the way in which the state government is handling the Covid crisis, Eshwarappa said, “If they keep mum, then the lockdown will be a success.” He said former CMs Siddaramaiah, HD Kumaraswamy and Congress state unit chief DK Shivakumar should “keep their mouth shut for 14 days so that we can tide over the crisis”. “It is not the time to criticise the government since the pandemic has attacked India after 100 years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/we-dont-print-notes-to-give-doles-bjp-neta/articleshow/82539384.cms||---

On Monday, there were 1.5 lakh active cases with 54,443 patients in various hospitals. While most hospitals will receive a plant worth ₹16 lakh, hospitals in Perambalur, Virudhunagar and Nilgiris will have bigger plants with enhanced oxygen production capacity worth Rs60 lakh each. “In smaller hospitals like the one in Avadi the new plant will help supply about 40 beds,” he said. The state was ramping up beds as most oxygen beds and ICUs are full. “The incidence we are seeing now is four time higher than what we used to see earlier. We are doing our best to ensure quality care,” he said. On Monday, hotspot Chennai reported 7,149 new cases followed by 2781 in Coimbatore, 2181 in Chengalpet,1024 in Madurai and 1008 in Chengalpet.

While most hospitals will receive a plant worth ₹16 lakh, hospitals in Perambalur, Virudhunagar and Nilgiris will have bigger plants with enhanced oxygen production capacity worth Rs60 lakh each. “In smaller hospitals like the one in Avadi the new plant will help supply about 40 beds,” he said. The state was ramping up beds as most oxygen beds and ICUs are full. “The incidence we are seeing now is four time higher than what we used to see earlier. We are doing our best to ensure quality care,” he said. On Monday, hotspot Chennai reported 7,149 new cases followed by 2781 in Coimbatore, 2181 in Chengalpet,1024 in Madurai and 1008 in Chengalpet.

At least 31 districts reported deaths. With 67 deaths, Chennai remained on top followed by 20 each in Chengalpet and Kanyakumari, 15 in Coimbatore, 14 in Madurai, 13 in Kancheepuram and11 in Trichy. Of the 232 deaths, at least 58 people who died did not have any comorbid conditions. “Many people in their 20s and 30s report late to the hospitals. When they come late morbidity and mortality increases,” said RGGH dean Dr Theranirajan. Meanwhile, after reporting a lull for three days, the state carried out 94,890 vaccinations on Monday. So far, the state has offered more than 65 lakh doses of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/28978-covid-19-cases-232-deaths-in-tamil-nadu-7149-new-cases-in-city/articleshow/82539370.cms||---

But that hasn’t stopped either the foul smell of burning corpses from seeping inside her house or the ash from the ever expanding cremation ground sweeping in to form a thin layer on top of her furniture and often even food. With close to 80 bodies being cremated everyday now at the 100-year-old Surajkund grounds, civic authorities in Meerut have had to increase the burning area by taking up more space, inching closer to housing societies nearby. With 35 new platforms to burn the unceasing chain of people who have fallen to Covid-19, 40 families have now petitioned the local administration to help them as they can’t breathe. The administration has said it is helpless. “These days the funeral pyres are burning literally right next to our house,” one of the residents told TOI on Monday. “Day and night. Earlier, it was some distance away, but now they have built the platforms in the parking area close to our locality. This needs to stop.” A third resident, Amresh Gupta, highlighted the psychological impact. “Some of us are going crazy. I don’t know what can be done. But many of us haven’t been able to sleep well for days.” The city’s municipal corporation said while nothing much can be done as of now, they hope it is a “temporary arrangement”. Municipal commissioner Manish Bansal said, “Asfar asthe new platforms are concerned, these are just temporary constructions. Once the pandemic is over, they will not be used.” Watch Soot invades Meerut homes as cremation grounds expand, residents protest||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soot-invades-meerut-homes-as-cremation-grounds-expand/articleshow/82539392.cms||Sandeep Rai

The private hospital, which is treating Covid patients, approached authorities on Sunday midnight seeking fresh stock. They told officials they had only 45 minutes of oxygen left. However, authorities managed to arrange a refill in time. More than 650 Covid patients at Krishnarajendra Hospital, a government facility, faced a similar threat on Monday. The hospital in Mysuru has a tank of 13 kilo litres capacity. “Early on Monday morning, a tanker with 18KL arrived from Ballari, which saved the day,” said Pratap Simha, Mysuru MP, who heads Mysuru district’s taskforce on Covid management. “Of the 18KL, 11KL was supplied to KR Hospital while the rest was distributed among private hospitals and other government facilities.” He said private hospitals have been told to inform authorities of requirements at least six hours in advance. “It is a tightrope walk for us because of the demand-supply gap. It gets complicated when private hospitals do not specify requirements well in advance.” ST Somashekar, district minister, and Mysuru needs an extra 20KL supply daily over and above the 36KL allocated by the government. Chamarajanagar district reported 12 Covid deaths on Sunday which authorities attribute to comorbidities and not lack of oxygen. S Suresh Kumar, Chamarajanagar district minister, on Monday said he will approach chief minister BS Yediyurappa and the health department to scale up health facilities in the district as there are no private hospitals like in other districts. He said an oxygen plant will be built at Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences in six weeks, even while insisting there is shortage of oxygen supply in the district. He said the team of senior doctors who visited Chamarajanagar Covid Hospital have submitted their report on the 23 deaths to the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/oxygen-tragedy-averted-in-mysuru/articleshow/82539382.cms||---

Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Labs is the marketing firm for the imported jabs in the country and has conducted local bridging studies for Sputnik V in India. Apart from the 1.5 million doses that came on May 1, a second consignment with almost equal quantity is expected by end of this month. Overall, India will get 18 million doses of Sputnik V, three million in May, five million in June and 10 million in July, an executive said. The first consignments of Sputnik V are likely to start reaching private hospitals by end of this month. Apart from Sputnik V, supplies of existing vaccines are also expected to increase over the next few months. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is set to increase monthly production of Covishield to 10 crore doses next month. Besides, Covaxin production is likely to increase to 6 crore doses by August, as compared to around 1 crore now. The government along with Bharat Biotech has also drawn up a plan to further ramp up its production by involving some of the public sector units to raise production. The pipeline of expected supplies assumes significance as vaccination slots continue to be limited, particularly for the 18 plus population while Covid-19 infected cases are still high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sputnik-v-shots-may-hit-market-by-month-end/articleshow/82539399.cms||Sushmi Dey

The Jain temple at JB Nagar, Andheri east, has been converted into a full-fledged vaccination centre with CCTV cameras, refrigerators to store vaccine vials and rooms for doctors. The drive at the temple, listed as Tarunbharat Jain Mandir on the CoWin App, will be conducted by Seven Hills Hospital, reports Hemali Chhapia. “The derasar will be open to vaccinate everyone, irrespective of caste, creed and religion; vaccination will be done as per MCGM directions,” said Jinesh Shah, a local resident who has been instrumental in initiating the process. “It’s about giving back to society for a larger cause,” added Shah. The move has encouraged other Jain temples too with the derasar in S ward, IIT market, also applying for permission to carry out immunisation. Need more such centres, says local corporatorThe managing committee of Kantinagar Shwetambar Murtipujak Tapagach Jain Sangh conceived the idea to offer the temple months ago and monks living in the residential space or upashray were informed about the plan. After committee members decided to set up the requisite infrastructure in the temple compound, the site was covered from top so that immunisation could go on smoothly even in the rains. “The temples have been closed for almost a year now. If it has the necessary space and other infrastructure to support the vaccination drive, then why not, since it’s for the benefit of society,” said secretary of the sangh, Sanjay Vora. Corporator Jagdish Amin, who represents K east ward, praised the initiative. “We need more such centres,” he said. As he looks forward to the temple bells pealing on Tuesday after several months, Shah prays they ring in good health and hope for Mumbaikars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-jain-temple-to-open-doors-for-mumbai-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82539405.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The governments are haggling over the allocation of oxygen from manufacturing units as the commodity is fast dwindling in all the states. In the latest instance for ensuring liquid medical oxygen (LMO), the Centre’s revised allocation of 40MT from Inox Kanjikode in Kerala to Tamil Nadu, reducing the original allocation to the state, was overruled by the state through an order under the disaster management act. As per the order issued by chief secretary VP Joy under section 20 (read with section 24 and 65 of the disaster management act, 2005), Inox Kanjikode was asked to supply 150 MT of LMO to the state on Sunday (out of the 170 MT which is the full capacity of the plant), despite that the latest Centre’s order said that 40 MT has to be supplied to Tamil Nadu and 20 MT for Karnataka, which would effectively reduce the state’s share to 110 MT. Based on the order, the plant had to comply with the state’s directive. On April 30, the Centre had allocated 150 MT LMO from Inox Kanjikode to the state and 20 MT to Karnataka. Later, on May 8, through another order, the Centre revised the allocation from Inox Kanjikode. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin had on May 7 written to the Centre asking for the orders for the allocation of 40 MT oxygen from Inox Kanjikode for Tamil Nadu. In the revised allocation, the Centre said that while 20 MT LMO being supplied to Karnataka from Inox Kanjikode could be discontinued from Tuesday (May 11), Tamil Nadu has to be supplied with 40 MT for four days from May 9 to 12. This effectively reduced the state’s allocation for two days (May 10 and 11) by 40 MT, putting immense strain on the state’s buffer stock of oxygen, when the demand was going up, forcing the state to use its powers under the disaster management act. Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to the Prime Minister that the state will not be in a position to allocate 40MT LMO to TN from Tuesday, as the demand for LMO in the state is steeply rising. He said that the entire 219 MT of oxygen being produced in the state should be allocated to the state itself, as the rising number of patients needing hospitalization will necessitate around 450 MT of oxygen by May 15. Also, an earlier request from the state chief secretary to Karnataka chief secretary to allow the oxygen tankers from Wayanad to refill from oxygen plants in Mysuru has yet to materialize, it is reliably learned. Other than what is being produced in the state, the state is receiving 12-14 MT LMO from ISRO from its liquid propulsion systems centre at Mahendragiri in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-over-rules-centres-order-to-supply-oxygen-to-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82539414.cms||KP Saikiran

Petrol price was hiked by 26 paise a litre and diesel by 33 paise per litre, according to a price notification by state-owned fuel retailers. Times ViewHigh taxes imposed by the Centre and states are among the reasons behind the high prices of fuel. This, in turn, causes an upward surge in prices of essential commodities. In these financially trying times, the government should bring down taxes to help lower the prices of fuel. This will to some extent alleviate the problems of millions.While petrol prices had crossed the Rs 100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh a few days back, Maharashtra’s Parbhani joined the league on Monday. Petrol in Parbhani was priced at Rs 100.20 a litre, while in Bhopal it came for Rs 99.55 a litre. The fuel is sold at Rs 102.42 a litre in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and at Rs 102.12 in Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/maharashtra-joins-rajasthan-mp-as-petrol-price-in-state-crosses-rs-100/l/articleshow/82539418.cms||---

The incident came to light after a video of multiple bodies floating in the Yamuna in Hamirpur went viral on social media. Though ASP, Hamirpur, Anoop Kumar, did not rule out foul play, he said many families in villages still believe in ‘jal samadhi’ (immersion of body in river) and prefer it over cremation in some cases as per their beliefs. A probe is under way, he added. “We have contacted police in Kanpur Outer and Kanpur Dehat areas. Two bodies were brought from Kanpur in tractors and immersed in the river. We have apprised the two districts and have intensified vigil in the area,” said Kumar. Locals were, however, fearful that people have died in large numbers in villages in the second wave and their family members are dumping their bodies in the river out of fear of contracting the virus. A police official said “On an average, a few bodies are spotted floating in the Yamuna on the Kanpur-Hamirpur border daily. But, there has been a surge in the number of bodies found floating in the river recently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panic-as-bodies-found-floating-in-up-river/articleshow/82539440.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Prior to the commencement of hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta struggled to get properly connected to the system. Minutes after getting connected, he was seen requesting the SC control room to unmute senior advocates-cum-Congress members Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram, who were appearing for some state governments. Immediately after they were unmuted, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s speech at Congress Working Committee meeting was audio-streamed into the system as probably one of Congress members, who was participating in the SC video-conference was also linked in another device to the virtual CWC meet. It went on for a good one minute before a smiling Sibal was heard urging Chidamabaram to switch off the other device. A little later, justices DY Chandrachud, LN Rao and SR Bhat appeared on screen but their screens froze within seconds, never to get connected again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sonias-cwc-speech-audible-at-apex-courts-covid-e-hearing/articleshow/82539452.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||For now, Andhra Pradesh prioritises vaccine for second dose||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has decided to first give vaccines to people waiting for their second dose, after which priority would be given to those above the age of 45 years. Due to shortage of vaccine doses, jabs would be stopped for now for those above the age of 18 years and below 45 years. The government has also decided to set up permanent vaccination centres across the state. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy took the decision after a review meeting with health department officials at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday. The vaccination drive was initially launched at all government general hospitals and primary health centres across the state. Frontline workers were the first to receive the jabs, followed by people above the age of 65 years. Later, people above the age of 45 years received jabs. The government also decided to vaccinate people above the age of 18 years, as announced by the Union government. With vaccine shortage looming large, the government has now decided to give vaccines to only those who are due for their second dose. It has also decided to continue vaccination for all people in the state above the age of 45 years on priority. The government will write to the central government seeking allocation of more vaccine doses to meet the state’s requirements. It was also decided at the meeting to set up permanent vaccination centres — one in each mandal — across the state. The number of vaccination centres for municipalities and municipal corporations would be decided depending on the population of the place. The chief minister also asked officials to explain to people clearly that vaccine is under the control of the central government and the states have a limited role to play as it is the Union government which decides on allocating the number of doses to be supplied to the states. He once again reminded officials to ensure that distress calls from people to 104 helpline are immediately attended to and beds are made available for patients within three hours of the call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/for-now-andhra-pradesh-prioritises-vaccine-for-second-dose/articleshow/82539470.cms||Gopi Dara
---||World||Nepal PM Oli loses vote of confidence in House||Beleaguered Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli was driven further to the brink on Monday as he lost a crucial trust vote in parliament. The vote followed his rival and CPN (Maoist Centre) leader P K Dahal Prachanda’s decision to withdraw support to his government. Seen initially by many as a Chinese acolyte, Oli had made repeated efforts to reach out to India in the recent past as he managed to hang on to power virtually by the skin of his teeth. Oli secured only 93 votes in the 275-member lower house of parliament during a special session. Hours after Oli lost the trust vote, President Bidya Devi Bhandari called on political parties to form a majority government within next three days. After losing the confidence vote, the PM is automatically removed from his post and now the new coalition government will be formed as per the constitutional process, said senior Nepali Congress leader Prakash Man Singh. Oli though can still stake a claim to form government again if the House fails to throw up a government as he remains the leader of a party that still has the highest number of MPs. Senior leader of CPN-Maoist Ganesh Shah said that Oli should immediately resign. The CPNMaoist will join hands with the Nepali Congress and other parties who voted against Oli to form a coalition government at the earliest, he said. However, if this government fails to prove majority, the president can invoke Article 76 (3) to appoint as PM the leader of the party which has the highest number of members in the House. Oli required at least 136 votes in the House of Representatives to win the confidence motion as 4 members are currently under suspension. A total of 124 members voted against the confidence motion while 15 members stayed neutral, Speaker Agni Sapkota announced. The session was attended by 232 lawmakers. Some 28 lawmakers belonging to Oli’s rival faction, led by Madhav Nepal-Jhala Nath Khanal, abstained during the voting. The main opposition Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), which control 61 and 49 votes respectively, voted against Oli’s trust motion. Janata Samajbadi Party, which has 32 votes, however, was divided. The Mahantha Thakur-led faction stayed neutral while the Upendra Yadavled group voted against Oli. Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after the president dissolved the House and announced fresh elections at the recommendation of PM Oli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/nepal-pm-oli-loses-vote-of-confidence-in-house/articleshow/82539480.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Beneficiaries to be notified ahead of jab||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh health department has decided to bring in a slew of changes in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination programme. As most beneficiaries have been walking in to session sites without prior registration, several instances of people jostling with each other in serpentine, unorganised queues have been reported from vaccination centres. Moreover, with the limited vaccine stocks that are available every day, health care personnel are unable to administer the vaccine to all those who throng the centres. In fact, vaccination came to a halt in almost all parts of the state on Monday. The health department will now identify eligible beneficiaries and intimate them about their time slots a day ahead of the vaccination. The health department is also planning to send SMSes to the identified beneficiaries. The ward/village volunteers, ANMs and Asha workers would be engaged in the initiative to streamline the vaccination process. The health department has already stopped giving the first dose for want of stocks. Officials of various districts such as Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam have already announced that only those who received messages or were distributed slips by the health department should come to vaccination centres. About 23 lakh people in Andhra Pradesh are due for their second dose in May, including 12.9 lakh in the first fortnight. The Union government, however, has allocated only around nine lakh doses for the first fortnight free of cost. The state government wrote to the Centre, requesting it be allowed to use the purchased doses to first complete the vaccination process for people aged 45 and above. State officials expect the modifications needed for this to be completed by Tuesday in the CoWIN portal. Srikakulam district collector J Nivas said that only 100 people would be given the vaccine during a particular time slot. “They would be informed about the vaccinations by the evening prior to the vaccination day. Others would not be entertained during this time slot,” said Nivas. Principal secretary, health and family welfare department, Anil Kumar Singhal, said the states cannot purchase as many doses as they want as the quota is decided by the Union government. “Due to the same, Andhra Pradesh can procure only 16.85 lakh vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers in May. We have already got 4.93 lakh doses from these orders. Once the technical modifications are done in CoWIN, we can use the purchased doses for the vaccination of people aged 45 and above,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-beneficiaries-to-be-notified-ahead-of-jab/articleshow/82539485.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Singhal, however, added that manufacturers who intend to supply vaccines to AP should get the required statutory and regulatory clearances from the Union government first. “We will make a serious attempt to procure vaccines from manufacturers from outside the country to accelerate the ongoing vaccination drive. We are ready to purchase vaccines for all people of Andhra Pradesh in one go if anyone is ready to supply the required number of doses,” said Singhal. The principal secretary said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy will write to the Union government requesting the latter to explore options to ramp up the production capacity of Covaxin. “The vaccine is made in India with the support of various government agencies. The chief minister will highlight, in his letter, whether the vaccine needs any IPR or patent exemptions for its mass production simultaneously at several other labs/units across the country. If we get the required number of doses, we can complete the vaccination process as early as possible. Vaccination for everyone is the need of the hour as we cannot assess the future waves of Covid-19 and their impact,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-mulls-global-tender-for-procuring-vaccines/articleshow/82539497.cms||---

The exchange followed a police raid that morning on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites, that left hundreds of Palestinians and a score of police officers wounded, capping weeks of unrest in the city. At least 45 rockets were fired from Gaza shortly after 6pm, the Israeli army said. At least one landed in a village in the hills west of Jerusalem, causing damage to houses but no casualties. Palestinian health officials in Gaza said nine residents of Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, including three children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. An Israeli military spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny Israeli responsibility for the deaths and suggested that they might have been a result of friendly fire. But the spokesman confirmed that there had been an Israeli strike in the area. The Israeli army said in a statement that an Israeli airstrike had killed three Hamas operatives. Separately, militants fired an antitank missile along the Gaza perimeter toward an Israeli vehicle, wounding the driver. Hamas claimed responsibility for the rockets. Islamic Jihad, a separate militant group, claimed the anti-tank missile attack, as well as scores of other rocket attacks. The attacks capped a day of violence in Jerusalem, which began when police entered the mosque compound around 8 a.m. and fired rubber-tipped bullets and stun grenades at stone-throwing Palestinians. The Palestinians had stockpiled stones at the site in expectation of a standoff with police and Jewish far-right groups. By the afternoon, more than 330 Palestinians had been injured, with at least 250 hospitalized, according to a representative of the Palestinian Red Crescent. Tensions were already high in Jerusalem. Palestinians have been demonstrating daily since April against the planned expulsions of Palestinians from their homes in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/gaza-militants-fire-rockets-at-jerusalem-israel-responds-with-airstrikes-9-dead/articleshow/82539500.cms||---

ESIC is operating hospitals in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry and Tirupati. The corporation is also planning to make ESI dispensaries provide Covid-19 assistance to workers in other towns. ESIC has launched a portal that displays the availability of beds on a real time basis. “We have already converted many of our ESI hospitals into dedicated Covid-19 treatment facilities while making efforts to provide assistance through other dispensaries,” said an ESIC spokesperson. The spokesperson said ESIC has deployed an IT team to develop a dashboard that could function on a real time basis and reflect the availability of bed. “Presently, 21 hospitals with 3,676 isolation beds, 229 ICU beds and 123 ventilators have been provided in ESI hospitals across the country,” he said. Similarly, 26 hospitals run by the state governments have also been converted into Covid-19 dedicated hospitals, which have 2,023 isolation beds. At least 20 per cent of the total beds would be reserved for insurers, beneficiaries, staff and pensioners. ESI spokesperson said the beneficiaries could avail treatment in tie-up hospitals where there are no dedicated ESI hospitals. “Reimbursement will be granted for beneficiaries for treatment in referral hospitals,” said the spokesperson. Meanwhile, the corporation has also decided to extend medical benefits to workers registered under the scheme. In case the beneficiary has abstained from work after getting infected with Covid-19, they are entitled to 70 per cent of the average daily wage as compensation for 91 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-esic-hospitals-to-function-as-covid-treatment-facilities/articleshow/82539505.cms||Samdani MN

A state official said that with the 7 lakh doses received on Sunday, the state’s drive could continue for three days. On Monday, the vaccination drive in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) covered a total of 41,482 beneficiaries. More than 26,000 recipients were those who were due for their second dose. But Tuesday's drive is expected to be limited due to low vaccine reserves in the region. PCMC officials said the drive for second-dose recipients in the 45+ group has been suspended for Tuesday. The PMC said the vaccination drives for the 18-44 group will be held at only two hospitals within its limits — Kamala Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi hospital (both Covishield). PMC officials said there will be 35 vaccination sites administering Covishield and another 13 centres giving Covaxin for the 45-plus category.

On April 12, the capital reported 11,491 cases. The positivity rate, which is steadily declining, was 19.1% as against Sunday’s 21.67%. However, despite the decline in daily cases and positivity rate, the death count remains high. At least 319 Covid deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. On Sunday, it went under 300 and stood at 273, the lowest since April 21. Health minister Satyendar Jain said, “We can see a ray of hope now that in the past few days, not only is the positivity rate decreasing but there is also a downfall in the number of cases, which seems to be reducing to half.” On April 20, Delhi reported above 28,000 cases in a single day. “The 36% positivity rate has now fallen to below 20%. We hope the spread will reduce. Nevertheless, we should not cut back on our preparations, and need to continue to protect ourselves in every possible way,” Jain cautioned. “This has been India’s second wave but is the fourth one for Delhi. Nobody knew its severity and the ferocity of the infection rate. We cannot afford to relax right now,” he added. The number of patients who recovered on Monday was 13,306, higher than the new cases. But the number of Covid tests has also declined and only 66,234 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours. Currently, Delhi has 85,258 active cases while on May 1, the count was 96,747. Out of the 22,667 Covid beds, 19,438 are occupied and only 3,229 vacant. In all, 52,451 patients are under home isolation. Delhi has so far reported over 13.4 lakh Covid cases and 19,663 deaths.

Villagers said they saw at least 150 corpses, suspected to be of Covid-19 victims, floating down the river at dawn. The Buxar district administration pegged the number of bodies at 30. “The bodies are not of local residents. It seems they were dumped in neighbouring UP 3-4 days ago,” Buxar DM Aman Samir said. “Instructions have been issued to intensify river patrolling.” A local resident said he and other witnesses counted not less than 150 bodies. “The situation is dangerous. People in the area are in shock,” he said. Prem Swaroopam, executive officer of the Buxar Municipal Council, told a news channel that a probe had already been initiated into “people dumping bodies” in the river. “We have formed three teams to stop people from disposing of bodies like that. The government will bear the cost of cremating Covid-19 victims in accordance with the official guidelines.” Late Monday, sub-divisional magistrate KK Upadhyay said the cremation of the bodies that washed ashore in the morning had begun. He said bodies were found floating in the river in adjoining Ghazipur district of UP, too. Some local residents attributed dumping of bodies in the river to the higher cost of organising the cremation of Covid-19 victims and fear of getting infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/30-bodies-floating-in-ganga-trigger-covid-panic-in-bihars-buxar/articleshow/82539590.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Despite strictures by the district collector and commissioner not to overcharge for cremation, middlemen have fixed specific funeral packages to exploit family members of deceased Covid-19 patients. With the large number of Covid-19 cases in the city, the number of Covid-19 deaths has increased. Bodies of patients who died in various hospitals are packed and handed over to family members for performing the final rites. But shifting the bodies to burial grounds and performing funerals has become expensive. Agencies are charging between 20,000 to 35,000 for each cremation. Meanwhile, the situation of family members of Covid-19 patients who died at home is no better. As no one is coming forward to help, funeral agencies are demanding 15,000 to shift the body from home and preserve it for cremation till the next morning. “There is a scarcity of beds at the hospital and we failed to get a bed for my mother. She died at home and we did not know what to do . Neighbours started quarrelling and asked us to shift the body immediately late in the night. We tried calling helplines but there was no response. Then we contacted an agency which provided all services right from packing the body, shifting it from home, preserving it till next morning and cremation. They finally gave a bill for 36,000. Government should stop these illegal practices,” said M Jai Vijay, a resident of Kandrika. Many families who cannot afford the exorbitant price are waiting at the electric crematorium at Swarga Puri. With complaints pouring in, VMC plans to step in and regulate the price of funerals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/funeral-agencies-in-vijayawada-profiteer-during-pandemic/articleshow/82539628.cms||---

No comparison has been made to sales made in the same month last year (April 2020) as the country was under a complete shutdown then after the outbreak of the coronavirus, which saw all auto companies announce ‘zero’ sales. But April sales this year come as a setback as the industry had started seeing a resurgence in demand recently just when the second wave of corona — that too a more deadly and highly infectious — hit the country hard. According to numbers sourced from dealer body FADA (Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association), total vehicle retail sales in April stood at 11.8 lakh units against 16.5 lakh units in March this year. The fall was led by reversals in uptake of two-wheelers (-28%); passenger cars and SUV/UVs (-25%); commercial vehicles (-24%); three-wheelers (-43%); and tractors (-45%). FADA sources its numbers from the government’s Vahan registration data, but this does not have figures for Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Lakshadweep and Telangana. FADA said that the first nine days of May have also been “extremely lean” in terms of sales due to the lockdown announced by a majority of states. “Lockdown also means dealership outlets to remain closed, thus meaning zero sales… Even where dealerships are open, the walk-ins have dropped to 30% and customers are delaying their purchase decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-auto-purchases-slip-28-in-april-on-fresh-curbs/articleshow/82539638.cms||Pankaj Doval

The deal gives Blackstone a foothold in the warehousing industry, which has seen substantial investments from PE players in recent times due to a boom in e-commerce and the need for online retailers to store and ship items immediately to customers. The transaction is being done in two tranches. In the first, Blackstone is buying 10.6 million sqft for $400 million from Warburg. In the second — expected to be completed later this month — the remaining 11 million will be bought for $300 million, said a person familiar with the matter. “Logistics is one of the firm’s highest global conviction themes, anchored by our belief that e-commerce trends will further fuel demand for logistics space, especially near city centres. This is particularly true in India, where ecommerce is in its nascent stage,” said Asheesh Mohta, head of Blackstone’s Real Estate India Acquisitions. The world’s largest PE firm has bought 1.2 billion sqft of logistics space since 2010 globally. India’s e-commerce hub Bengaluru has only 30 million sqft of grade A and B warehouses, compared to 1.2 billion sqft in Chicago, Mohta added. The deal signals the end of Embassy’s tryst with the warehousing industry, which it entered in 2015 with Warburg through a $250-million joint venture. Embassy Industrial Parks’ warehouses are located in Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR. “This transaction between Embassy Group and Blackstone further strengthens and reinforces our partnership. We are extremely focused on consolidating our resources towards the growth of our core businesses of office and residential development and management,” said Jitu Virwani, chairman and MD of Embassy. Blackstone and Embassy are partners in commercial real estate projects. India’s warehousing industry gained impetus after the passage of the goods & services tax in 2017. Across top eight cities, the sector witnessed a threefold growth to 46 million sqft in 2019 from 14 million in 2017. It dipped to 41 million sqft last year due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/embassy-jv-sells-warehouse-business-for-rs-5000cr/articleshow/82539647.cms||---

The move came close on the heels of the Entertainment Network India Limited (ENIL)- owned brand launching its radio station in Qatar. Mirchi was launched in Bahrain on May 9, with the aim of expanding its international presence and catering to the entertainment and music demand of the South Asian and Indian diaspora. With Indians and South Asians comprising more than half of the UAE population, the Middle East is a significant and strategic market for the brand. Having established its stronghold in Dubai for over eight years, Mirchi re-entered the market through a partnership with Dolphin Recording Studio, with their old brand Suno FM now completely overhauled to become Mirchi 102.4FM. “After almost two decades of its presence, today, Mirchi has evolved into a multi-platform, multi-format, multi-language and hyperlocal entertainment brand,” said Vineet Jain, MD of Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd (The Times Group). “Taking cognisance of the sheer volume of South Asians in the Middle East and the need for Bollywood and Hindi entertainment, we have rolled out the Mirchi brand in key markets in the region — Dubai, Qatar, and Bahrain. We look forward to bringing the best of our talent, content and offerings to the discerning audiences in these dynamic markets.” In Qatar, with only one existing radio station for the South Asian diaspora, Mirchi fills the gap with its expansive programming and content and being a brand that is recognisable by anybody from India. Launching through a partnership with Marhaba FM, Mirchi will be known as MirchiOne 89.6FM in Qatar. With Bahrain being an untapped market as far as the South Asian population is concerned, Mirchi is launched through a 100% subsidiary — Mirchi Bahrain WLL. It will be the only private station in the market catering to South Asian audiences. Mirchi offers customised content to its audience, bringing its ‘secret sauce’ of curated music to its listeners in the Middle East along with Bollywood’s latest gossip, news and updates. Mirchi’s RJs, too, will bring some of their best content such as ‘Mirchi Murga’, ‘What the Farhan’, ‘Club Mirchi’ and more to the market. For Mirchi’s rapidly growing digital and brand solutions businesses, these launches provide an ideal platform for local, Indian and international brands to reach this specific target audience across these three markets in the Middle East.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/expanding-global-footprint-mirchi-forays-into-middle-east/articleshow/82539675.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Oxygen cylinders on roads near hospitals become safety hazard for commuters||BHOPAL: Placed under a tent, highly combustible oxygen cylinders are placed dangerously close on the main roads in the state capital by many hospitals. At first sight, the tent appears to be a makeshift reception area of a hospital. Banners on these tents states- Covid care centre- that in effect dissuades further inspection from authorities. One such hospital is located on street along Royal Market in the state capital. Silver coloured jumbo cylinders are placed along the main road. The density of traffic movement on the road is significant even during the lockdown. Ambulances speed through the road along with other intercity buses on the road ,which connects to the main railway station and bus stand. There is no protective barrier to stop a moving vehicle from barging into these oxygen cylinders. The development of hospital on the street has already been subjected to various litigations. A directive from the MPHC a few years ago had deemed the construction in the area as illegal. When contacted about this major safety hazard a BMC official said, he was not aware of the situation. Office of the chief medical and health officer (CMHO) did not respond to our queries. ‘National Building Code of India – 2005’ on ‘Fire and Life Safety’ states the requirements for fire prevention and life safety related to fire protection of buildings. The Code specifies construction, occupancy and protection features that are necessary to minimize danger to life and property from fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-oxygen-cylinders-on-roads-near-hospitals-become-safety-hazard-for-commuters/articleshow/82539751.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Aurangabad||Day after Parbhani, petrol breaches Rs 100 in Nanded too||Aurangabad: After Parbhani on Sunday, another district in Marathwada, Nanded, saw the price of petrol crossing the Rs 100 mark on Monday. In Parbhani, petrol retailed at Rs 100.01 per litre on Sunday and the price further rose to Rs 100.26 per litre on Monday. In Nanded, the price was Rs 100.19 on Monday. Fuel dealers from Parbhani said it was an irony of sorts that petrol was costing more than Rs 100 a litre while the daily sales of the fuel have dropped badly due to the Covid restrictions. “The transportation of fuel from far places like Manmad reflects in terms of relatively higher prices of petrol and diesel in our area. While the common man does not know this, many think petrol dealers are benefiting from the increased cost. That is not the case as our sales commission remains the same,” said Mohammad Khan, a petrol dealer from Parbhani. Parbhani resident Vikas Ratnparkhe said petrol prices should be uniform at least at the state level. “The government should either set up oil depots in our region or set uniform prices. It makes no sense to charge more from people who are part of the same state or country,” he said. Mangesh Pawde, a fuel dealer from Nanded, said retailers from his district purchase fuel from a depot in Solapur. “Solapur is around 280km from Nanded and therefore transportation adds to the cost of fuel. These are inevitable logistical issues which people need to understand,” he said. Meanwhile, diesel was retailing at Rs 90.12 and Rs 90.07 a litre in Parbhani and Nanded respectively, which was relatively high compared to other parts of Maharashtra. Among other Marathwada cities, petrol was selling for Rs 99.16 per litre in Aurangabad and Rs 99.04 in Jalna. In Nashik, the price was Rs 98.36 and Rs 98.16 in Kolhapur. In the bigger cities, the price was Rs 97.92 in Mumbai, Rs 97.56 in Pune and Rs 97.74 in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/day-after-parbhani-petrol-breaches-rs-100-in-nanded-too/articleshow/82539755.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Uttar Pradesh picks Maharashtra plan to make oxygen at ethanol plants||AURANGABAD: Uttar Pradesh, a big sugar producing state, has decided to follow Maharashtra’s path to produce oxygen at its sugar mills to meet the rising demand for treatment of Covid patients. The Dharashiv Sugar Mill in Osmanabad district of Maharasthra has already started the country’s first trial to produce medical grade oxygen at ethanol plants at sugar mills. Once operational, it will be replicated at almost all sugar factories in the state. There are 195 sugar factories in Maharashtra, out of which, 137 have ethanol plants. Whereas there are over a dozen standalone ethanol plants across the state. This process is likely to turn Maharashtra’s sugar bowl into an oxygen bowl amidst the ongoing pandemic. UP’s additional chief secretary for state excise, sugar industry, cane development department and sugar commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy told TOI, “We are implementing the Osmanabad pattern at 15 of our state excise owned distilleries cum ethanol plants. We aim to generate 300 metric tonne of oxygen from them.” He added that this set-up will be done with support and assistance of National Sugar Institute, as well as Pune based Vasant Dada Sugar Institute. Bhoosreddy said they are keeping a close watch on the developments here. “Till the time ethanol plants start generating oxygen, UP’s state excise and sugar industry and sugarcane development department have started installing oxygen generators in each of the 75 districts based hospitals for catering to the needs of covid patients,” he said. The 1988-batch IAS officer said that out of the 61 ethanol plants in UP, 15 are owned by the state excise department. “The ethanol plants having 60 KL capacity will generate 20 MT of oxygen, while the ones with 120 KL capacity will generate 40 MT of oxygen. The required machines and equipments are being sourced from Taiwan,” said Bhoosredday. Sources said the union government officials have also reached out to the Dharashiv Sugar mill authorities to know the developments in the pilot project and its feasibility. Professor Sanjay Patil, who is head and technical advisor at VSI’s department of alcohol technology and biofuels, said that the UP sugar commissioner had sought the pilot project’s details and they had readily sharing them. Dharashiv sugar mill owner Abhijit Patil said, “We are ready for production, just awaiting medical clearance stating that the produced oxygen is of medical grade and fit for medical use.” He said that the delay in getting equipments from Taiwan has delayed the production by at least three days. The mill is expected to produce 20 metric tonne of medical oxygen daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/up-picks-maha-plan-to-make-o2-at-ethanol-plants/articleshow/82539718.cms||Mohammed Akhef

At least 20 people were killed, including nine children and a senior Hamas commander, and 65 others wounded, Gaza authorities said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Hamas had crossed a "red line" by directing missiles towards Jerusalem and that the Jewish state would "respond with force". "We will not tolerate attacks on our territory, our capital, our citizens and our soldiers. Those who attack us will pay a heavy price," said Netanyahu, who held meetings with the heads of the army and the Shin Bet security agency. Israel's army said 150 rockets had been launched from Gaza, dozens of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome Aerial Defense System, with no casualties reported. "We have started, and I repeat started, to attack military targets in Gaza," army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. "We have made preparations for various scenarios, including high intensity ones... Hamas will get the message." The military said it had targeted "two rocket launchers, two military posts", a tunnel and eight Hamas operatives in Gaza. Hamas sources confirmed to AFP that one of their commanders, Mohammed Fayyad, had been killed. Tensions in Jerusalem have flared since Israeli riot police clashed with Palestinian worshippers on the last Friday of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan in the city's worst disturbances since 2017. Nightly unrest since then at the Al-Aqsa compound has left hundreds of Palestinians wounded, drawing international calls for de-escalation and sharp rebukes from across the Muslim world. Diplomatic sources told AFP that Egypt and Qatar, who have mediated past Israeli-Hamas conflicts, were attempting to calm tensions. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken strongly condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas, saying they "need to stop immediately". "All sides need to de-escalate, reduce tensions, take practical steps to calm things down," he said. Adding to the sense of chaos, a huge fire engulfed trees in the compound that houses the mosque, Islam's third holiest site, as hundreds of Jewish Israelis watched from the Western Wall esplanade below. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, earlier Monday warned Israel to withdraw all its forces from the mosque compound and the east Jerusalem district of Sheikh Jarrah, where looming evictions of Palestinian families have fuelled angry protests. Sirens wailed across Jerusalem just after the 1500 GMT deadline set by Hamas as people in Jerusalem, including lawmakers in the Knesset legislature, fled to bunkers for the first time since a 2014 Gaza conflict. A spokesman for Hamas' armed wing the Qassam Brigades said the rocket attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Sheikh Jarrah and around the Al-Aqsa mosque. "This is a message that the enemy must understand well: if you respond we will respond, and if you escalate we will escalate." A house in Beit Nekofa, about 10 kilometres (six miles) west of central Jerusalem, was also damaged by rocket fire, AFP TV reported. The Israeli army said on Twitter that, separate to the rockets, "as a result of an anti-tank missile fired from Gaza, an Israeli civilian in a nearby vehicle was lightly injured" in the Gaza border area. Fears of further chaos in the Old City had temporarily eased when Israeli organisers of a march to celebrate the Jewish state's 1967 capture of east Jerusalem cancelled the event. But then came the Hamas warning, followed by the rockets, which also forced the evacuation of the Western Wall and other sites. Militants in Gaza have recently also deployed incendiary balloons that have sparked dozens of fires in Israeli territory. On Monday evening, as during the previous nights since Friday, Palestinians hurled rocks at Israeli officers in riot gear who fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas. That came after morning clashes which left the ground littered with rocks, stun grenade fragments and other debris as loud booms and angry screams echoed from the ancient stone walls. There were dozens of newly wounded demonstrators. The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 395 Palestinians were wounded, including more than 200 who were hospitalised, five of them in critical condition. Siraj, 24, was wheeled into surgery at the large Makassed Hospital after suffering a spleen injury from being hit by a rubber bullet. "They shot everyone, young and old people," he said. Makassed director general Adnan Farhoud said most of Monday's injuries were to the head, chest, and upper and lower limbs. When "you mean to harm someone you shoot to the head", he told AFP. The Israeli police reported 32 injuries in their ranks. The violence since Friday has been fuelled by a long-running bid by Jewish settlers to evict several Palestinian families from their nearby Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood. A Supreme Court hearing on a Palestinian appeal in the case originally set for Monday was pushed back by the justice ministry due to the tensions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/twenty-killed-as-israel-strikes-gaza-after-hamas-rocket-barrage/articleshow/82539824.cms||---

Expressing concern over the seriousness of the situation, he said that in over 300 panchayats, the TPR is above 30% and added that there were 57 panchayats with active case load of 500 to 2,000. The chief minister said that the number of people who are testing positive in Kannur, Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam, continues to remain high and thereby serious, while it is slowly showing a reducing trend in other districts. The chief minister said that since oxygen continues to be in high demand, the government has initiated steps to reduce the wastage of oxygen. The government has also initiated steps to appoint more doctors and paramedical staff. The government will appoint retired doctors and those who have come back after leave and studies. He said that the government has taken steps to strengthen the home delivery system in the wake of Ramzan, and a special mobile application developed for the purpose can be emulated in other places too. Of the doses of Covid vaccine that the state has decided to purchase, 3.5 lakh doses have reached the state. These will be administered to those who are facing serious ailments, volunteers of ward-level samithis and media persons. The chief minister said that the local bodies can utilize the plan fund for Covid management. The chief minister said that the public should ensure that the lockdown rules are strictly followed, and the police passes for emergency travel should not be misused. Stating that more than a lakh people applied for passes within 12 hours of opening the pass portal, he said that such a behaviour would defeat the very intention behind locking down the state. He said that while it was a preventive lockdown in the first wave, it is an emergency lockdown in the present phase, which is intended to reduce the death rate. For the same reason, the current lockdown has the value of each one’s life, the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/situation-dire-as-testing-positivity-rate-over-50-in-72-panchayats-in-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan/articleshow/82540008.cms||---
---||Dehradun||My removal & Kumbh not linked: Trivendra Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: Former Uttarakhand chief minister Trivdendra Singh Rawat, in an exclusive interview to TOI on Monday, dismissed recent reports that alleged it was the displeasure of the seer community that precipitated his removal as CM, bringing in Tirath Singh Rawat in his place. There has been swirling talk of late that it was because Trivendra Rawat wanted to go ahead with a symbolic Maha Kumbh in view of the Covid-19 threat that he fell foul of the sadhu samaj, who in turn put pressure for his ouster. “I don't think the akhadas were displeased with me,” he said. “The seers understood the urgency of the pandemic and were ready to go ahead with whatever format of Kumbh the situation allowed.” Trivendra Rawat added, “In the run-up to the Kumbh, saints and akhada seers held several meetings with me, my cabinet colleagues and state officials. Akhada members were updated on each and every detail related to the Kumbh and they never expressed any annoyance. In fact, they had given in writing that they would accept any format of Kumbh as they, too, were aware of the rising number of Covid cases.” He further said, “We were strictly following guidelines issued by the Centre. Even the PM had no issues with the concept of a pratikatmak (symbolic) Kumbh in wake of Covid-19. It is wrong to link it with my removal. It’s true that the initial plan was to host a divya (divine) and bhavya (grand) Kumbh but the situation did not allow that.” Usually, the Kumbh starts in early January with the Makar Sankranti snan and lasts for four months. Initially, the plan was to observe only the four shahi snans (on March 11, April 12, April 14 and April 27) as Kumbh. After several rounds of deliberations, in late February, it was announced that the Kumbh would be observed for a month, from April 1 to 30. In that duration, some 91 lakh devotees, according to official figures, came to Haridwar to take a dip in the Ganga. In early March, Tirath Singh Rawat replaced Trivendra Rawat as the chief minister of Uttarakhand. In one of his first acts after taking over as CM, Tirath Singh Rawat said that “all were welcome to the Maha Kumbh”. Later, he clarified that the Centre’s SOPs, which mandated carrying a negative RT-PCR test report to gain entry at the Kumbh, would be followed and the statement was “just to dispel apprehension and confusion”. A day after he took oath as the CM on March 10, he visited Haridwar for the first shahi snan on Maha Shivratri, March 11. Trivendra Rawat said, “It was very clear to everyone that the Maha Kumbh would be of an extremely short duration, with restrictions suggested by the Centre in place.” Asked if in retrospect, he considered Kumbh had become a super-spreader, he said, “I had apprehensions about the infection spreading and therefore my government had made plans accordingly. It is not right for me to comment on anything as the facts are now before the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/my-removal-kumbh-not-linked-trivendra-singh-rawat/articleshow/82540064.cms||Kautilya Singh

Congresswoman Haley Stevens, in a letter to Biden on Monday, said that India is now the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “This past week India registered over 400,000 daily cases. On May 4, there were 3,786 deaths, bringing the total to 226,188 fatalities. The sharp increase in cases has severely strained the healthcare system, overwhelming hospitals, and depleting oxygen supplies. India is in great need of oxygen, therapeutics, and vaccines,” Stevens wrote.  Asking the White House to increase shipments of oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and ventilators to Indian hospitals, she thanked Biden for his support of more than USD 100 million to India.  “I urge you to provide the following items: Oxygen Cylinders, 10 liters and 45 liters Liquid Medical Oxygen Capacity; Oxygen Concentrator; Oxygen Generator Plants; Remdesivir; Tocilizumab, Ventilators/BiPAP,” she said.  “As you continue to assess the situation in India, I urge you to consider fulfilling the additional needs outlined above. As long as Covid persists in India, there is the potential for additional variants that could pose a serious threat to a vaccinated America. We must do our part to quell the virus everywhere it persists,” Stevens added.  India has been severely affected by the unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of health workers, vaccines, oxygen, drugs and beds.  After recording over four lakh fresh cases for four consecutive days, India witnessed a single-day rise of 3,66,161 Covid-19 cases on Monday, which pushed its tally to 2,26,62,575, according to the health ministry.  The death toll due to the viral disease climbed to 2,46,116 with 3,754 more people succumbing to it, the ministry's data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-congresswoman-urges-biden-to-send-more-direct-support-to-india/articleshow/82540183.cms||---

Asking the White House to increase shipments of oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and ventilators to Indian hospitals, she thanked Biden for his support of more than USD 100 million to India.  “I urge you to provide the following items: Oxygen Cylinders, 10 liters and 45 liters Liquid Medical Oxygen Capacity; Oxygen Concentrator; Oxygen Generator Plants; Remdesivir; Tocilizumab, Ventilators/BiPAP,” she said.  “As you continue to assess the situation in India, I urge you to consider fulfilling the additional needs outlined above. As long as Covid persists in India, there is the potential for additional variants that could pose a serious threat to a vaccinated America. We must do our part to quell the virus everywhere it persists,” Stevens added.  India has been severely affected by the unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of health workers, vaccines, oxygen, drugs and beds.  After recording over four lakh fresh cases for four consecutive days, India witnessed a single-day rise of 3,66,161 Covid-19 cases on Monday, which pushed its tally to 2,26,62,575, according to the health ministry.  The death toll due to the viral disease climbed to 2,46,116 with 3,754 more people succumbing to it, the ministry's data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-congresswoman-urges-biden-to-send-more-direct-support-to-india/articleshow/82540217.cms||---

A Covid-19 vaccination center has been set up on the periphery of Romania’s Bran Castle, which is purported to be the inspiration behind Dracula’s home in Bram Stoker’s 19th-century gothic novel “Dracula.” Every weekend through May “vaccination marathons” will be held just outside the storied 14th-century hilltop castle, where no appointment is needed, in an attempt to encourage people to protect themselves against Covid-19. “We wanted to show people a different way to get the (vaccine) needle,” Alexandru Priscu, the marketing manager at Bran Castle, told The Associated Press. Those brave enough to get a Pfizer vaccine shot receive a “vaccination diploma,” which is aptly illustrated with a fanged medical worker brandishing a syringe. “Besides the diploma, people benefit with free entry to the (castle’s) torture rooms, which have 52 medieval torture instruments,” Priscu noted. Since the light-hearted campaign was launched over the weekend — when nearly 400 people were vaccinated — Priscu said he has received scores of requests from foreigners wishing to get vaccinated in the spooky setting. Bad news for them: only residents of Romania can officially receive a jab. The campaign runs alongside a series of government initiatives as it pushes to speed up the inoculation campaign for the European Union nation of more than 19 million people. The government is hoping to vaccinate 5 million people by June 1 to herald in a “return to normality.” On Saturday, all vaccination centers in the country became appointment-free after 2pm, and round-the-clock “vaccination marathon” events have been launched in several cities throughout Romania. Since the pandemic started, Romania has recorded more than 1 million Covid-19 infections and 29,034 people have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/mad-mad-world/draculas-castle-proves-an-ideal-setting-for-covid-19-jabs/articleshow/82540209.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Exodus from Bengaluru could lead to spike in district cases, say experts||BENGALURU: With thousands fleeing Bengaluru — a Covid-19 hotspot — ahead of the 14-day lockdown which kicked in on Monday, experts fear the mass migration will fuel a surge in positivity rates in the districts. What prompted many migrants to leave is the belief that they would be better off in their villages, rather than be virtually imprisoned in the confines of their homes in Bengaluru, where Covid-19 cases are soaring. But experts say there are no safe havens and people could be carrying the virus back to their villages. Take Manoj Chengappa, 34, an IT firm employee for example. Allowed to work from home, he returned to his hamlet in Virajpet, Kodagu, presuming he and his family would be safe. However, shortly after they arrived in Virajpet, Chengappa and his family attended a gettogether in which another dozen people participated. A few days later, he and his family members developed symptoms. When health officials took swab samples, they tested positive. They are now all recuperating at a Covid hospital. “I couldn’t believe it,” Chengappa said. “We are so cut off from the rest of the world. We even grow our own vegetables. If the virus can invade my little village, then it can sneak into any village in the country.” While announcing the lockdown, chief minister BS Yediyurappa had appealed to people not to leave Bengaluru as infections could spread in the districts. But on Saturday and Sunday, there were serpentine queues on highway toll plazas. Many families vacated their rented homes and left with all their belongings. Some vowed not to return until the situation improves in the state capital. Social distancing norms were ignored as people jostled to get a seat on whatever transport they could find. Besides cars and vans, several even left on two-wheelers too. Health experts say the pandemic will play out very differently in rural areas than in cities where, although raging, doctors and health officials have got a measure of the beast — to some extent at least, thanks to the fact that 80% of doctors and 60% of hospitals are in urban areas. The bulk of the migrant movement began in the first week of April. Since then, cases have shot up by at least five times in 14 districts. District officials admit Bengaluru is a major source of transmission. “About 80% of new cases have travel history and a majority are from Bengaluru,” said Dr Kaverappa, a health expert. With cases surging in rural areas, district officials are rapidly scaling up capacities and repurposing existing beds, but lack of oxygen and ICU beds are a big concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/exodus-from-bengaluru-could-lead-to-spike-in-district-cases-say-experts/articleshow/82540321.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Dehradun||Government didn’t pay heed to warnings about second wave: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday took the state government to task for its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that “the scientific community had been warning since January about the second wave of Covid but the government did not heed these warnings and it is due to these unfortunate mistakes and negligence that the pandemic has taken such a gargantuan turn.” On the state government’s plea that it was constrained by financial limitations, the court said that in case of calamity and disaster, the state cannot raise the defence of financial limitations. The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma further said that it is the duty of the state to protect the lives of people and therefore it “has to extricate every single drop of its strength and every single penny of its finances” in doing so. When the bench was informed about fake Remdesivir injections being sold by black marketeers, the judges remarked why these people are not being booked for murder. “I am sure there are ample provisions for this under the Disaster Management Act,” said the chief justice. The judges also expressed dissatisfaction at the affidavit filed by the state health secretary Amit Negi saying that it was silent on most crucial questions including the number of mobile testing labs operational, the capacity of hospitals retained after Kumbh and whether the government will convert college buildings into isolation centres now that the education institutions have been closed. The court directed the state government to increase the testing facilities and dispatch testing vans to hilly areas as almost a quarter of total cases are now being reported from the hills. The government has also been asked to consider converting colleges and hotels into quarantine centres and to consult whether more Covid hospitals and Covid care centres can be established in towns across the state on a war-footing. Speaking to TOI, Shiv Bhatt, the counsel appearing for one of the petitioners, said that the court has said that since there is a shortage of oxygen cylinders, the state should contact the Centre and explain that it should be allowed to use the oxygen produced within the state since importing oxygen from other states like Jharkhand and West Bengal is creating delays. “Further, the state has also been directed to consult with the Centre and explore possibilities of importing oxygen concentrators so that they can be supplied to remote parts of the state,” Bhatt said. Meanwhile, another counsel, Dushyant Mainali, said that the court has also directed the state to book the people making spurious and adulterated Remdesivir injections. “It had come to the court’s notice that in several instances, simple glucose injections were being sold as Remdesivir. Therefore the bench has directed the state to ask the drug inspectors to book the fraudsters under Section 27 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act,” Mainali said. The court further directed the government to take strict action against private hospitals charging exorbitant fee and has given the government time till May 18 to fix the lacunae pointed out in the affidavit and present a detailed report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-didnt-pay-heed-to-warnings-about-second-wave-uttarakhand-hc/articleshow/82540392.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Bengaluru||We don’t print notes to give Covid aid: Karnataka minister||SHIVAMOGGA: Senior Karnataka minister KS Eshwarappa on Monday stoked controversy, saying the government does “not own a printing machine” to mint currency notes and hand out compensation to thousands of working-class people hit hard by Covid-induced lockdown. The minister said, “Do we print notes (to extend doles)?” at his hometown Shivamogga in reply to state opposition leaders’ demand that the BJP government must consider giving Rs 10,000 compensation to each working-class family. Eshwarappa is the second minister in the BJP government to make insensitive remarks about the plight of the people in less than two weeks. On April 28, state food and civil supplies minister Umesh V Katti had told a farmer-activist enquiring about foodgrain allotment to “go die”, following it up by saying that it is a “good time for farmers to die”. The audio clip of the conversation on phone had gone viral, causing major embarrassment to the state government. Oppn leaders should keep quiet for 14 days, says KSEOn opposition leaders’ criticism of the way in which the government is handling the Covid crisis, Eshwarappa said, “If they keep mum, then the lockdown will be a success (and allow positive cases to fall).” He said former CMs Siddaramaiah, HD Kumaraswamy and Congress state unit president DK Shivakumar should “keep their mouth shut for 14 days so that we can tide over the crisis”. “It is not the time to criticise the government since the pandemic has attacked India after 100 years… Nobody had foreseen it,” he said. Eshwarappa’s statement drew sharp reactions from Congress and JD(S), while the BJP offered a calibrated view on the issue. JD(S) leader HK Kumaraswamy said the statement is no different from that of Katti’s. “While Katti was crass, Eshwarappa is much more polished by stating it does not matter whether people die in the state.” Congress working president Saleem Ahmed said, “It is Eshwarappa’s decision whether he wants to print additional notes or take it from the state exchequer. However, as a minister and leader of the ruling party, it is the responsibility and dharma of the government to help people from poor background.” BJP state general secretary N Ravi Kumar said, “Opposition parties have been demanding a financial relief package, but that does not mean the government is in a position to provide it. The government will look into the needs of the people and will take an informed decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/we-dont-print-notes-to-give-covid-aid-karnataka-minister/articleshow/82540460.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Amitabh Chaturvedi quits as Karvy group CEO||MUMBAI/HYDERABAD: Amitabh Chaturvedi, a veteran of the banking & financial services industry who was brought in to steady the ship at scam-hit Karvy Group as its CEO for financial services operations, has put in his papers. Chaturvedi had joined the Hyderabad-headquartered business house in December 2019. He resigned from his executive role in January this year and is currently on the boards of three of the Karvy group companies as non-executive director. Chaturvedi's resignation letter, submitted by Karvy Stock Broking (KSBL) to the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Hyderabad, is dated January 14, 2021. “I hereby submit my resignation from the post of Chief Executive Officer-Financial Services businesses and Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) of the company, in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and the rules issued thereunder, with effect from January 14, 2021,” Chaturvedi said in his resignation letter addressed to the board of directors of KSBL. Sources said that while he has resigned from the post of CEO & KMP in the financial services businesses, he has been asked to continue on the boards of three Karvy group entities, in a non-executive role. He is on the boards of Karvy Capital, the group’s asset management arm, Karvy Financial Services, the NBFC focused on providing financial support to MSMEs and Karvy Investor Services, the entity that offers investment banking and advisory services. Chaturvedi did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. At the same time, C Parthasarathy, chairman, Karvy Group denied that Chaturvedi had quit. “No, he has not resigned from the services of the company. He has stepped down as KMP. He continues to be in the employment of the company as head of the financial services business and a CEO, not being a KMP,” Parthasarathy said. He also denied that Chaturvedi was serving his notice period at the group. Chaturvedi’s appointment was announced by Karvy Group on December 31, 2019, as part of a corporate restructuring exercise ostensibly aimed at cleaning up the house after the demat account scam by KSBL came to light in late November 2019. The rejig came a little over a month after stock market regulator Sebi banned Karvy Group flagship KSBL for pledging securities of its clients with lenders without permission from those very clients, to raise funds. This was a violation of the then newly introduced Sebi rules that had kicked in on October 1, 2019. KSBL had pledged securities of around 95,000 clients to raise over Rs 2,300 crore from various banks and financial institutions including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank. Chaturvedi was brought in to clean up the mess at the group’s financial services operations. Before joining Karvy, Chaturvedi, over a span of three decades, had worked with Essel Group, Dhanalakshmi Bank, Reliance (now Nippon) Mutual Fund and ICICI Bank. To come out of the bad phase, Karvy had plans to sell off some of its assets to generate funds to pay off its loans, release the pledged shares and pay back the same to KSBL’s clients. As part of this plan, it sold off its minority stake in Karvy Fintech, one of the leading register & transfer agents for the mutual fund industry. The company has since been renamed KFin Tech and is now majority-owned by global PE player General Atlantic. However, Karvy’s plans to monetise other assets failed and as a result to recover part of its dues, all the demat and trading accounts of KSBL’s customers were auctioned off to IIFL Securities and Axis Securities. NSE and BSE have also expelled the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-amitabh-chaturvedi-quits-as-karvy-group-ceo/articleshow/82540565.cms||Partha Sinha
