The new restrictions are being imposed on the advice of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and they come "in light of extraordinarily high Covid-19 case loads and multiple variants circulating in India," the White House said. The restrictions, which will kick at midnight on Tuesday, do not apply to American citizens and permanent residents with ties in the US. The ban will exclude aid workers and not effect the flow of aid and humanitarian assistance to India. A formal announcement on the matter is expected late on Friday. Coronavirus live updatesThe restriction on travel from India follows similar bans on South Africa, Brazil, UK, Ireland, China, Iran, and other countries that saw Covid-19 spikes and variants at various points in time. The ban comes on the heels of the State Department's Level 4 Travel Advisory, the highest level it issues, advising US citizens “not to travel to India or to leave as soon as it is safe to do so due to the current health situation in the country."

On April 15, 2021, UK home secretary Priti Patel had ordered the extradition to India of the 50-year-old diamantaire who has been lodged at Wandsworth prison in London since his arrest in London on March 19, 2019. India wants to extradite Nirav to prosecute him for defrauding PNB of Rs 6,498 crore plus interest, of laundering the proceeds of that fraud, and for interfering with the CBI investigation into the fraud by causing the disappearance of evidence and intimidating witnesses, including threatening to kill one. Nirav denies all the charges. District judge Sam Goozée had on February 25 sent Nirav’s case to Patel to make a decision on whether to order extradition, saying he was satisfied there was a "prima facie" case, meaning there is evidence sufficient to make a case requiring an answer. He also found it would not be unjust or oppressive to extradite Nirav despite his poor mental health in prison and found his extradition would be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The administrative court of the high court told TOI on Friday that Nirav’s appeal application was received on April 28. He wishes to appeal both Goozeé and Patel’s decisions. In the first instance, a single judge will make a decision on the papers as to whether to grant permission for an appeal hearing. This could take several months. If the judge refuses permission to appeal, Nirav can then seek an oral hearing to argue why he should be given permission. If the judge decides to give permission, the judge will decide on which grounds he is granted permission and the appeal hearing with one to three judges will follow several months later. If he fails to get permission, he cannot approach the Supreme Court and his only option is the European Court of Human Rights. Otherwise he will be extradited within 28 days of permission to appeal being refused. Extradition barrister Ben Keith said "The appeal court may well look at the Covid crisis in India when deciding whether to give permission as conditions in Indian jails are not good and the courts are barely functioning. So it is very uncertain what conditions he would go back to." He also said that Nirav could now try for bail again. "It’s going to be more difficult now that extradition has been ordered, though," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/nirav-modi-seeks-permission-to-appeal-against-extradition-to-india/articleshow/82334100.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Srinagar||Srinagar: Absconding rapist arrested after 33 years||JAMMU: The Jammu & Kashmir police arrested an absconding criminal from Srinagar who was on the run for the last 33 years. Ghulam Mohd of Kherkote in Banihal had disappeared after a rape and abduction case was registered against him registered at Mohore police station in 1988. The Reasi Police got information about the presence of the absconding criminal in Safakadal area of Srinagar and the accused was arrested with the help of the Srinagar Police. A warrant under Section 512 of CrPC was issued by the principal district and sessions judge, Udhampur on June 22, 1989, and that was executed after his arrest from Srinagar, the police said. Thirty-three years ago, at the time of the commission of this crime neither was Reasi a district nor was there was a sessions court in Reasi. The locality of Mahore at the time was under the jurisdiction of Udhampur district, with only two police stations, one at Reasi and the other at Mohore in the Reasi area. The other accused in the case — Amkala of Bathoi, Ghulam Mohd Sheikh and Sonaullah of Kherkote tehsil — were later bailed out. The Reasi Police, under the command of SSP Shailender Singh, has launched a special drive to apprehend absconders, who have been evading arrest and this is the seventh absconder arrested in the last two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/absconding-rapist-arrested-after-33-years-reasi-police/articleshow/82334120.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||AstraZeneca delays filing for US authorisation of Covid shot||LONDON: AstraZeneca said Friday that it intends to seek US authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine in the “coming weeks," acknowledging a delay in the much-anticipated filing that had been expected by mid-April. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker revealed the new timetable as it released first-quarter financial results, which showed that the company delivered 68 million doses of the vaccine to the UK, European Union and other countries in the first three months of the year. The company said it was continuing to work on its application to the US Food and Drug Administration, noting the “substantial size of the file" that will include data from US trials as well all other studies completed so far and real-world data collected from use of the vaccine in other countries. Among the issues that will likely be addressed are indications that the vaccine is linked to rare blood clots, particularly in younger people. Several countries have recommended that the shot be given only to older people because of the potential side effect. Vaccine experts say the blood clots are very rare, less than the blood clot risks of women taking birth control. When AstraZeneca released data from its US vaccine trial on March 22, company officials said they expected to apply for FDA authorisation in the first half of April. Once the application is filed, an FDA advisory committee will publicly debate the evidence behind the shots before the agency decides whether to allow emergency use. Ruud Dobber, an AstraZeneca executive vice president, said at the time that if the FDA authorizes the vaccine, the company would deliver 30 million doses immediately, followed by another 20 million within the first month. The White House said earlier this week that the US would begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca vaccine with the world once it clears federal safety reviews, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months. The move expands on the Biden administration's March decision to share about 4 million doses of the vaccine with Mexico and Canada. The White House is feeling increasingly confident about the supply of the three vaccines already being administered in the US — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The U.S. has also been under mounting pressure to share more of its vaccine supply with the world, as infection rates surge in countries like India and other countries struggle to get enough doses to protect their most vulnerable residents. More than 3.1 million people worldwide have died of Covid-19, including more than 572,000 in the U.S. More than half of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of vaccine, and the government expects to have enough supply for the entire population by early summer. AstraZeneca reported revenue of $275 million from deliveries of 68 million doses of the vaccine during the first quarter. AstraZeneca has pledged that it will deliver the vaccine on a non-profit basis as long as the pandemic lasts. The company said 30 million doses went to the EU, 26 million to the U.K., 7 million to Gavi, an alliance that secures vaccines for low-income countries, and 5 million to other nations. To date, AstraZeneca and partners such as the Serum Institute of India and Fiocruz in Brazil have supplied more than 300 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to over 165 countries, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said. The vaccine was developed by researchers at Oxford University, who licensed the technology to AstraZeneca in an effort to tap into the company's global manufacturing and distribution capacity. AstraZeneca in turn authorizes other companies to produce the shots around the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/astrazeneca-delays-filing-for-us-authorisation-of-covid-shot/articleshow/82334518.cms||---
---||Goa||Sporting emerge champions in Goa Pro League, dedicate triumph to Peter Vaz||Mapusa: Sporting Clube de Goa were ruthless in their 9-0 demolition of Guardian Angel SC as they emerged champions in the Goa Professional League at Chowgule ground, Margao, on Friday. In another match at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa, Calangute Association got the better of Salgaocar FC 1-0. The match had resumed from the 73rd minute with Calangute retaking a penalty which Domnic Fernandes converted. Calangute defended resolutely for the remainder of the match and dented Salgaocar’s hopes of winning the league title. Sporting finished at the top of the table with 23 points and remained unbeaten. Dempo took the second spot with 21 points, followed by Calangute on 20, the same as Salgaocar, but with a better head-to-head record. Sporting Clube led 1-0 at the break through Marcus Mascarenhas, who later completed his hat-trick with the final touch of the match. Philip Odogwu and Gautam Dias both scored a brace each, while Gaurav and Akeraj Martins also added their names to the scoresheet. "I would like to congratulate the management and players for being crowned champions. It was their hard work and perseverance that gave us results, especially during our testing times," said club president Natty Vaz. The club dedicated the record triumph to its former patron and owner Peter Vaz, who passed away in December last year. "Papa would have been proud of the boys. This win is especially dedicated to him. We were upset as we couldn't be present for the match due to the guidelines issued by GFA, but we are happy with the end result," said Peter’s son, Nathan. Daughter Danira said the performance of the team was “stupendous during the entire league." Club CEO Welvin Menezes said he was never in doubt that the team would emerge champions as a fitting tribute to Peter. “That they won the league without tasting defeat is remarkable. We are all missing Peter. He would have been proud of the team’s efforts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sporting-emerge-champions-in-goa-pro-league-dedicate-triumph-to-peter-vaz/articleshow/82334524.cms||---
---||Goa||Debutants FC Goa punch above their weight in ACL||Panaji: After picking up an injury against Al Wahda in the concluding group clash of the AFC Champions League, Dheeraj Singh was limping off the field with an injury when rival coach Henk ten Cate took him by surprise. The former Ajax coach walked up to the goalkeeper, shook hands and whispered three words: “You are brilliant.” The FC Goa goalkeeper was in fine form throughout, making a total of 25 saves in five matches, more than any other goalkeeper in the competition. He kept two consecutive clean sheets against Al Rayyan and Al Wahda, made it to the first two ACL matchday squads, and conceded a last-minute equaliser against Al Rayyan in the reverse fixture. Dheeraj’s performance mirrored that of his teammates, most of whom made a big splash on debut in Asian football’s top-tier club competition. When the fixtures were drawn and Goa found themselves in the toughest possible group — which included last year’s finalists Persepolis FC from Iran — most felt they would be like ATMs where clubs could just come and withdraw points at the end of 90 minutes. Save us the embarrassment, said many; others suggested a point would be good, while club officials thought two points would be great. In the end, Goa had three. Had it not been for a last-minute equaliser, the debutants could have even had a cherished win against Al Rayyan, coached by France’s 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc. “When the draw was announced, who must have thought FC Goa will finish third in the group and have three points,” asked assistant coach Clifford Miranda who deputised for Juan Ferrando in the concluding league clash on Thursday. “Nobody gave us a chance playing against last season's runnersup Persepolis, Al Rayyan and Al Wahda. But credit to the boys for doing such a fantastic job with so many difficulties. “We have been in the bubble for the past seven months. It is a fantastic performance by the players and the credit must go to Juan as well as the club for making this step in the premier tournament in Asia.” Ferrando believed in this team more than anyone else. When the Spanish coach took up the Goa assignment, he knew the “responsibilities” of guiding the first Indian club in a premier competition like the ACL. Goa had no experience. Except for James Donachie, no player had played in a tournament of such magnitude in Asia, and the Australian defender made everyone aware of the challenges that lie ahead. “James told us that the West (region) has tougher teams (than what he has played in ACL) and every match would be like climbing a steep mountain and back, over and over again,” said Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football who helped put the team together following departures of several big names after last season’s League Winners’ Shield triumph. Ferrando prepared Goa for the climb and the focus was clearly on the steps, not on how steep it is. Once the team managed a draw against Qatar’s Al Rayyan in the opening game, there was no looking back. “We had three points, finished above Al Rayyan, whose strengths we all know. But if we look back at our campaign now, looks like we could have had more,” said Puskur. Ferrando’s choice of foreign players to meet the three plus one rule was commendable. There were plenty of criticism as Golden Boot winner Igor Angulo was left out and captain Edu Bedia got the nod ahead of Alberto Noguera. But even before the foreign contingent was forced to pack their bags early due to growing fears over Covid-19 and miss the concluding clash, praise for them was unending. Ivan Gonzalez and Donachie, after all, were solid at the back, while Jorge Ortiz and Edu had precious goals to their credit. The Indian players, too, covered themselves in glory. Seriton Fernandes proved he is India’s best right-back, Brandon Fernandes showed he can spot an opening better than anyone else in international games, while Glan Martins did enough to catch national coach Igor Stimac’s attention. Even the likes of Devendra Murgaonkar and Sanson Pereira, thrown into the deep end out of compulsion rather than choice, hardly put a foot wrong. “You've done India proud, @FCGoaOfficial. The first Champions League campaign is never easy, just like we found out, but we're sure that the future is bright,” Bundesliga giants RB Leipzig, with whom Goa have a strategic partnership, said in a tweet. Well, nobody would disagree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/debutants-fc-goa-punch-above-their-weight-in-acl/articleshow/82334578.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Don’t book people for seeking help on social media: Supreme Court to cops||NEW DELHI: Warning state governments against booking people for making distressed social media posts on scarcity of oxygen, essential medicines and beds for Covid-19 patients, the Supreme Court on Friday said state police and DGPs would be hauled for contempt of court for any clampdown on citizens for airing grievances on deficiencies in healthcare during the pandemic. Without referring to scores of cases lodged against people in Maharashtra, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for making such posts, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat strongly objected to police action against social media posts by hapless individuals seeking help from every quarter to get a bed, oxygen cylinder or Remdesivir injection for their precariously placed Covid-positive relatives or friends. "If a citizen ventilates his grievances through social media posts, there is no presumption that it is not genuine. There cannot be and should not be any clampdown on free speech. If anyone is booked for airing their grievance about non-supply of oxygen, medicines or availability of hospital bed, it will amount to a clampdown and we will treat it as contempt of this court," Justice Chandrachud said while conveying strong disapproval of the actions taken by police in states in the name of health emergency under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, provisions of IPC, 1860, and the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Coronavirus live updates"Let a loud message go out to the states and their DGPs. We will brook no violation of the right to free speech of a citizen when the country is going through a humanitarian crisis during a health emergency. We will haul them for contempt," the bench said and cited Justice Chandrachud's judgment in the nine-judge bench verdict on Aadhaar validity in K Puttaswamy case in which he had cited the importance of free flow of information in combating a national crisis. In the Puttaswamy judgment, Justice Chandrachud, quoting economist Amartya Sen, had said that clampdown on free flow of information during the Bengal famine had led to an information blackout on availability and stock of foodgrain that resulted in a large number of deaths. On the other hand, during the famine in the 1970s in Maharashtra, free flow of information saved a lot many lives. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said he fully agreed with the bench and a person in distress highlighting his grievances on social media should not face any action from police. But the authorities must stop rumour mongering and spreading false information that could trigger panic in society, he added. The bench said, "Let there be free flow of information. Grievances aired through social media posts could actually help the government and local administration to attend to common deficiencies in the healthcare sector and attend to them speedily."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-book-people-for-seeking-help-on-social-media-supreme-court-to-cops/articleshow/82334559.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Kolkata||‘Today, my father would perhaps have directed Hirak Rajar Deshe 2’||Kolkata: Every year on his May 2, countless admirers pay a visit to his 1/1 Bishop Lefroy Road residence. None of that will happen on Satyajit Ray’s birth centenary this Sunday. Amid a raging pandemic, his 100th birthday has coincided with the counting day in Bengal to decide a keenly contested election. “Initial plans of allowing people to offer flowers to him have been cancelled,” said his filmmaker son Sandip Ray. Respect, of course, is in the mind and not just physical gestures.  Though Ray was not known for his political films, one wonders what he would have done in today’s digital world of political polarisation. “I don’t think he would have made an out-and-out political film. Perhaps, he would have directed ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe: Part II’. He was Professor Shonku himself and would do wonders with the new technology. Though I can’t visualize him shooting movies on iPhones, he would have loved working on the OTT platform that guarantees exposure and mileage,” the Ray scion said.  On Ray’s centenary, tributes are being paid from all quarters. A book is on the cards titled ‘Three Rays: Stories from Satyajit Ray’. It has more than 40 previously unpublished stories, autobiographical writings and illustrations by Ray. “In ‘Sandesh’, we are publishing headpieces of all his stories. None of them are available in the books. It’s good to see the global interest in his works. But I am against colourisation of his films, including Apur Sansar’, which are available online,” he said.  There are talks about biopics and a film on the making of ‘Pather Panchali’. “There is no question of granting permission to an authorized biopic using his name. Who will play Baba?” he wondered. What about unauthorized ones where the connection if evident despite fictional names? “One has to see who is doing it and the intent,” he said.  He doesn’t support the trend of paying tributes by recreating scenes from Ray classics with new actors. “Such recreations in the name of tributes need the permission of the original producer. The go-ahead from the Bansals is mandatory if a scene from ‘Charulata’ is to be recreated in a new film. There is complete disregard for seeking permission to adapt copyrighted material on screen and books. This violation of intellectual property rights is irritating and dangerous,” he said.  During last year’s lockdown, three diaries of Ray from 1935, 1936 and 1939 were found along with his letters and even a Christmas greeting card from Akira Kurosawa. The diary entries are interesting. “The last two pages after December 31 were kept for his reviews of Hollywood movies. He would give star ratings – just like the way TOI does now,” he said. So ‘Anna Karenina’ had got four stars which meant “outstanding” while ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’ had got two stars less meaning ‘good’.  Looking back, what does he think about his father’s style of working? Many of his films turned into flab-free masterpieces on his ruthless editing table. In some films where the acting was not consistently good, he would still retain those scenes if the actor’s face completely resembled the character’s look. A voice-over here or a piece of music there at the editing would make all the difference. “The editing was so seamless that nobody even understood what had happened during the shoot,” he said. Ray was merciless even in case of his own music compositions. “He believed in minimalism and the importance of silence. Often, he would scrap his own music during a film’s mixing. Instead he would use effect or ambient sound.”  Though Ray is regarded as a Renaissance man, did he have any conservative trait? “He was very open but if not showing physical intimacy on screen is conservatism, then he can be called that. But the censors wouldn’t have allowed intimate scenes. Besides, he felt an effective way is to leave a lot to the audience’s imagination.”  In retrospect, how does Ray come across as a father? Unlike other busy geniuses, he was a complete “family man who was remarkable at time management”. “Sometimes I wished he had got angry if people made mistakes. Baba remained calm even when we expected a showdown. He was a perfect gentleman and insisted that true power lies in controlling anger. That was part of his Santiniketan training under Nandalal Bose.”  During his advertising days, he had “creative friction” with clients at DJ Kemer. “He would draw something while clients did not want him to experiment. That’s why he finally branched out to cinema. In his film career, he was irritated when Cannes rejected ‘Apur Sansar’ after ‘Aparajita’. The Cannes rejection of ‘Charulata’ had upset him too. But he moved on,” he added.  That irritation had become public during the plagiarism controversy between ‘The Alien’ and ‘E.T.’ This film was supposed to be his sci-fi foray into Hollywood with Columbia Pictures bankrolling it. “In the first draft of ‘The Alien’, Baba had called it Avatar. But Columbia (Pictures) had told him to reconsider since they claimed that people wouldn’t understand the title,” Sandip recalled. It is another matter that in 2009, a film by James Cameron with the same title took Hollywood and the rest of the world by storm.  Back in the 60s, Ray had agreed to change the title of his movie but ‘The Alien’ never got made. In 1982, Columbia Pictures co-produced Steven Spielberg’s ‘E.T.’ which Ray believed was lifted from his own idea. Some insist that the honorary Oscar in 1992 was the West’s way of atoning for the injustice done to Ray. “That’s possible. It could be a way of making amends. The Oscar was an important event in Baba’s life since he had grown up on Hollywood movies. Merchant Ivory and Martin Scorsese had taken a lot of initiative for this. We have seen copies of letters written by some to the Oscar committee vouching for Baba.” Has he seen any letter from Spielberg on this? “No,” he said.  Does it seem a bit awkward that not one of Ray’s films was Oscar-nominated for the Best Picture or Best Director? “For that, a producer had to send the films for consideration. An Oscar nomination needs an international release. Jury members have to watch it. Our producers hardly had funds to do all that. They were happy that the films made money in India and were recognized internationally.” It is said that his ‘Apur Sansar’ and ‘Mahanagar’ were selected as the Indian entries for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards but were not accepted as nominees. That was in 1959 and 1963 respectively.  Now all that is just part of film trivia as the world gears up to celebrate the genius on his centenary. What remains is a spectacular oeuvre of an auteur whom even legends admire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/today-my-father-would-perhaps-have-directed-hirak-rajar-deshe-2/articleshow/82333942.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||I have done injustice to Manik-da: Madhabi||Kolkata: “Manika-da was an extraordinary human being - learned, well-behaved and refined”. That’s how fondly 79-year-old Madhabi Mukherjee describes Satyajit Ray – the director of three of her remarkable films - on the eve of the legend’s birth centenary on May 2. As the empowered Arati of ‘Mahanagar’ (1963), the lonely Charu of ‘Charulata’ (1964) and the evolved Karuna of ‘Kapurush’ (1965), Mukherjee’s nuanced performances join the dots to form a narrative about woman’s emancipation. Describing Ray as a director, Mukherjee said, “There are some professors who teach in a way that one needs to go back home, re-read and then understand. Then there are others who explain everything lucidly in class. Manik-da belongs to the second category.” He would give the script in advance. Then, there was a reading on the floor. “That was enough to understand what he wanted,” she said. Mukherjee, who was a regular on stage from the age of six, never found it difficult to express the silent courage of Aarti, the loneliness of the opera-glass holding Charu or the grace of the matured Karuna. “Remember Sophia Loren’s performance in Vittorio De Sica’s ‘Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow’ where she had played three different characters in the three short stories in that film? A complete actress, who can feel the characters, should be able to play any role. Of course, a good director is also required,” she said. Her casting in ‘Mahanagar’ was partly accidental since she had agreed to meet Ray only after the crew had offered her the taxi fare! “There were many such Aratis in middle class families around me. They are my idol and I dedicated the role to them,” she said, explaining the transformation of her character from being a coy homemaker to a self-confident and self-respecting working woman who confronts her boss when he fires her Anglo-Indian colleague, Edith, and puts forth her resignation in protest. The film was sent as the Best Foreign Film entry from India to the Oscar. But it never got nominated to the final five. “Manik-da got the Silver Bear for Best Director at Berlin for this film,” she pointed out. That was in 1964 – the year ‘Charulata’ released. The first poster of ‘Nashtanirh’, the Tagore story from which Ray adapted the film with Mukherjee, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sailen Mukherjee in the cast, still hangs in her room. “Few know why ‘Nashtanirh’ was not retained as the title. During title registration, it was found that Sunanda Devi had a film with the same name,” she revealed. That film had released in 1951 with Uttam Kumar in the cast. “After contemplating names like ‘Amal’ and ‘Bhupati’, ‘Charulata’ was chosen,” she said. Few, she said, know that the famous swing scene from the film where she hums ‘Phule phule dhole dhole’ was shot at Shibpur’s Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology. The scenes where she flits from window to window while watching the world pass by were shot at a Kolkata studio. Ray had described this as his “most flawless film” and had also gone to Cannes with it. Sailen Mukherjee, who had played her husband, had gone too. But why didn’t she? “Everyone was sure that I would win. The norm was that the award would be given to the one who was present in person. Back then, my financial position wasn’t good and I couldn’t afford the airfare,” she recalled. The award might have eluded her but as a recognition of her brilliance in the film, a gift would reach her doorstep from France every year. “Till his death, journalist Dilip Malakar would send me the best French perfume every year as a recognition of my performance,” she recalled. Yet, Mukherjee never collaborated with Ray after ‘Kapurush’ - the domestic drama about a scriptwriter (Soumitra Chatterjee) bumping into his old flame who is now married to the manager of a tea plantation where he is forced to spend a night. Mukherjee’s controlled acting relied heavily on the expression of her eyes that had no hangover of leftover emotions. That was in 1965. Some believe she was a victim of politics at play in the patriarchal world of film sets. Despite their 21-year age difference, others claim that an alleged relationship between them had led to trouble in Ray’s domestic life. Few also refer to a controversial interview where Mukherjee had allegedly admitted that there was “yearning from both sides”. Mukherjee avoids intrusion into personal space. Instead, she talks about being a victim of “nasty politics”. In her memoir titled ‘Madhabi Kanan’, she had mentioned about how not a word was said when Ray had directed Soumitra Chatterjee in 14 of his films while people within the unit and outside started talking when she did her second with him (‘Charulata’). “I don’t like dirty politics and decided to move away,” she explained. “The lead role in ‘Nayak’ was mine. I had asked Manik-da to forgive me while turning it down. I did the same when he offered me ‘Ashani Sanket’. At the end, he had asked journalist Sebabrata Gupta to convince me to act in ‘Ghare Baire’. But my reply was still negative. Manik-da would have wanted me to accept the offers. He must have felt bad when I refused him repeatedly. I told him that once I have left something, I wouldn’t go back to accept it.” Describing herself as “unyielding”, she said, “I can’t accept if my self-respect is hurt. I had just told him ‘no’ but never gave him my reason for it. I didn’t even confront the person who played politics.” Showing this “grace” undoubtedly made her “sad”. “I had one kind of trauma. Manik-da had another. He must have understood the politics being played. Yet, he could do nothing.” Didn’t she feel sad watching the roles offered to her being played by others? “I have never been greedy,” she said. In hindsight, she accepts that she wasn’t the only one who had to go through such complexities in life. “Uttam Kumar was the president of a society called Abhinetri Sangha where he was once labelled a thief! He had cried hearing this allegation. Seeing him cry, actor Bikas Roy, who was also a lawyer, drew up a constitution to help him set up Shilpi Sansad. That organization still supports artists in distress. Tagore too had faced so much in life. My trauma is nothing in comparison to what they felt.” Though she didn’t act, she honoured Ray’s invitations to his film premieres after 1965. “I have done injustice to Manik-da.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat also asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether the Centre was planning to impose curbs, short of lockdown, to arrest the further spread of Covid-19. It suggested tweaking policy decisions to combat the pandemic and asked the Centre to respond by May 10.  The bench said pricing of Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin respectively, was an extremely important issue and wanted to know the extent of financial assistance or grant given to the companies by the Centre for research and developing the vaccines.  It said the private firms could not decide the quantity of vaccines to be sent to a particular state. “How can private firms acquire equity rights over public good,” the apex court bench asked. The SC’s suggestion for universal free of cost immunisation came after it apprehended that the present policy of 50% supply of shots to the Centre to vaccinate frontline workers and those above 45 years and the rest at a higher price to states and private hospitals may exclude marginalised sections of society. In Uttar Pradesh the drive will start on May 1 in only seven of the total 75 districts. Health department officials said the drive will take place only in Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Bareilly initially. Rajasthan will start the drive in only three of the 33 districts — Ajmer, Jaipur and Jodhpur — and was expecting three lakh vaccine doses by Friday midnight. Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani announced that vaccination for the age group will start in 10 out of 33 districts. He said the state was expecting 3 lakh vaccine doses on Friday. The Odisha government announced the start of vaccination from Saturday after it received a consignment of 1.5 lakh doses of Covaxin on Friday evening. Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo said the government will roll out the drive from May 1, but will give priority to Antyodaya cardholders and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). However, all other states have deferred the drive due to uncertainty about the stocks. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma confirmed on Twitter that Centre had committed to provide five lakh vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group. However, considering the uncertainty about the date of arrival of the first consignment of vaccines, it is unlikely that the drive would start on May 1, top health officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-cant-all-get-free-covid-jabs-under-national-scheme-supreme-court-to-centre/articleshow/82335335.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The second wave will flatten by July after peaking in May only to recur by October 2021. According to TAC chief Dr MK Sudarshan, the younger population would be affected the most by the third wave as they would be unvaccinated. “Fully vaccinated senior citizens would be safe by then. Those below 18 years would be most vulnerable,” he said. “After each wave flattens, we have seen a resurgence in other countries too. It’ll take 90-120 days after the wave flattens for the virus resurgence,” said Dr CN Manjunath, head, Covid-19 expert committee and nodal officer for Covid testing in the state. Covid live updatesKarnataka’s experience, and that of European countries, shows that the third wave will be definitely there and preparation to tackle it must be taken seriously, say experts. Covid-appropriate behaviour like mask usage, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowds and hand hygiene, apart from vaccination, must be given utmost priority, they say.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); According to Dr Manjunath, all precautionary measures, restrictions on gatherings, religious events, political rallies, local body elections and fairs must be continued till December 2021. “The severity will be more in unvaccinated persons. The need is to speed up vaccination,” he said.

However, some states have flagged the shortage of vaccines and expressed their inability to start vaccination of people above 18 years from today.​He agreed with Dr Sudarshan that children would be more vulnerable. “There are trials of Pfizer vaccines on children. By then, we may get vaccines for children too,” he said. According to Dr KR Bharath Kumar Reddy, paediatric pulmonologist and director, Shishuka Children’s Specialty Hospital, children would be vulnerable because of lack of vaccination. “However, the virus transmission chain may break as adults at home would be vaccinated and they may not spread to kids. Currently, in most cases, adults are transmitting to children who are not going to schools,” Dr Reddy said. Unless those in the 18-44 years category are vaccinated by October, a high number of cases will be seen among them too, experts said.

---||India||Help people in ‘once in a century crisis’, says PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Emphasising that the recent surge in Covid-19 infections marked a “once in a century crisis” and “a big challenge for the world”, PM Narendra Modi on Friday asked his ministers to help people in their respective regions. “You have to be compassionate and patient with people who are going through distress,” the PM said in his virtual address to members of the council of ministers. Significantly, sources quoted the PM as saying that he, alarmed by the rising number of cases in Maharashtra, had held a meeting of CMs where he emphasised the need for state governments to be vigilant against the virus: something which acquires significance in view of the allegation in certain quarters that the government took its eyes of the pandemic after having tackled the first wave of infections. Modi, however, did not engage in finger pointing and emphasised the partnership among the various stakeholders in the fresh round of the fight against the pandemic, sources said. He said governments, industry and NGOs had all come together to ramp up production of oxygen and medicines. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal and chemicals minister Mansukh Mandaviya made presentations about the results of the attempt to boost production. Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul made a presentation on the spread of the virus and the steps, including the drive by the Centre and state governments, to augment availability of hospital beds and ventilators. “The measures being taken to further ramp up their supply and availability were also pointed out. Support measures for the vulnerable population in the form of provision of foodgrain and financial support to Jan Dhan account holders were also pointed out,” an official release said. The PM also held a meeting of the empowered group of secretaries on economic and welfare measures where he emphasised the need for partnering with state governments to ensure that the poor benefit from free distribution of foodgrain under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, which has been revived in view of the fresh surge. The empowered group on facilitating supply chain and logistics management briefed the PM to facilitate smooth movement of goods across jurisdictions when several districts have been put under “lockdown”. An official release quoted the PM as saying that ways should be found to relieve pressure on the beleaguered health personnel by assigning functions which are not directly linked to treatment, like facilitating communication between patients and their kin and hospitals and doctors, to ex-Services personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/help-people-in-once-in-a-century-crisis-says-pm-modi/articleshow/82335891.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Only six states to begin vaccination for 18+ from today||NEW DELHI: Only six states will be able to start vaccination for the 18 to 44 age group when the nationwide drive to inoculate the younger lot kickstarts on Saturday. All other states and Union territories have either deferred vaccination for this age group by a few days or are uncertain about starting the exercise as they are facing vaccine shortage. Even in these six states – Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Odisha – the May 1 drive will be a ‘token’ one. In most of these states, it will be limited to just a few districts. In Maharashtra, which is the worst affected Covid-19 state in the country, three lakh Covishield doses were distributed on Friday evening for the May 1 exercise after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that everyone in the 18-44 age group will be vaccinated and the state would bear the cost of the coverage. Pune, Mumbai and Thane each got the largest share of 20,000 doses while other districts were given anywhere from 3,000 to 10,000 doses each. Covid live updatesMaharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that “we have planned to start vaccinating this age group in a small way initially as we are still short of doses”. He said that while the state needs around 12 crore doses for a population of 5.7 crore in the 18-44 age group, both Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech have given in writing to the state that they could provide 13 lakh and 3.45 lakh doses, respectively, to Maharashtra in May alone.

Health department officials said the drive will take place only in Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Bareilly initially. Rajasthan will start the drive in only three of the 33 districts -- Ajmer, Jaipur and Jodhpur --- and was expecting three lakh vaccine doses by Friday midnight. Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani announced that vaccination for the age group will start in 10 out of 33 districts which have the highest load of Covid-19 positive cases. He said the state was expecting 3 lakh vaccine doses on Friday night. The Odisha government announced the start of vaccination from Saturday after it received a consignment of 1.5 lakh doses of Covaxin on Friday evening. Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo said the government will roll out the drive from May 1, but will give priority to Antyodaya cardholders and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). “The state will receive 1.5 lakh doses of Covaxin on Saturday afternoon. We have decided not to delay the vaccination programme and will start inoculation by (May 1) afternoon. The vaccination will continue to progress as vaccine stocks arrive,” Singhdeo said. However, all other states have deferred the drive due to uncertainty about the stocks. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma confirmed on Twitter that Centre had committed to provide five lakh vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group. However, considering the uncertainty about the date of arrival of the first consignment of vaccines, it is unlikely that the drive would start on May 1 as scheduled earlier, top health officials told TOI. Telangana has stopped the vaccination drive for two days (May 1 and 2) at government centres even for people aged 45 years and above because of vaccine shortage. Tamil Nadu is unlikely to roll out vaccination for 18-plus at its government facilities, but some private hospitals like Apollo have said that they will. Bengal will begin the vaccination from May 5 while the inoculation for the 45-plus age group will continue in government centres. However, it will stop in private centres as they are required to return unused vaccine stocks to the state government by Friday-end. The Karnataka government indefinitely deferred the vaccination drive for 18-44 group, which was supposed to start from Saturday, citing shortage of vaccines.

The scientists also said that the Aatmanirbhar Bharat policy has made importing of scientific equipment and reagents an extremely tedious and time-consuming process, requiring approval at the level of the secretaries of ministries or departments. “This has reduced our ability to scale up testing by developing new testing platforms and has impaired our ability to sequence viral genomes for surveillance rapidly and accurately. Adequate encouragement and support by the government are required for our country to become Aatmanirbhar in the future. Such restrictions, at this time, only serve to impede our ability to deal with Covid-19,” stated the appeal seeking the withdrawal of these restrictions. The scientists have asked for timely release of data on large-scale genomic surveillance for new variants, testing and clinical data for better predictions of the spread of the infection, the clinical outcomes of hospitalised patients and the clinical response to vaccination in the population. They sought wide access to the granular testing data that ICMR has been collating since the beginning of the pandemic. “The ICMR database is inaccessible to anyone outside of the government and perhaps also to many within the government. Most scientists including several identified by DST and NITI Aayog to develop new prediction models for India — do not have access to these data,” stated the open appeal. The scientists pointed out that public health measures in India would have to vary from one local area to another, as there was a great geographical variability in patterns of spread of the infection due to local conditions. This necessitates detailed analysis of large-scale granular epidemiological data available with ICMR, they stated. The appeal asked for funds to widen the network of organisations which could collect large-scale surveillance data on genome sequencing of the coronavirus and rapidly put the data in the public domain to enable efficient covid management. The scientists pointed out that the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), established for genomic surveillance was sequencing samples from only about 1% of infected persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/make-testing-data-available-400-scientists-to-pm-modi/articleshow/82336081.cms||---

The health ministry said since April, there has been a steep rise in the number of cases. India reported more than 66 lakh Covid-19 cases in April alone. Highlighting that the second wave has been much intense than the first one, the health ministry said in Uttar Pradesh, the numbers are over five times its last peak, in Rajasthan also five times, 4.5 times in Chhattisgarh, 3.3 times in Delhi and 4.1 times in West Bengal. It also said that countries across the world, including people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and go for vaccination. From April 5 onwards, the country saw over one lakh cases being reported in a day, while from April 15, the single-day rise in the number of cases went past two lakh and from April 22, it started recording over three lakh daily cases. “We saw a peak in September. After that, we again saw a peak in April. This trend was also observed in other countries. Some countries have also observed a third wave,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry.  Officials also said the pandemic is now spreading to Tier 2 and 3 cities, underlining the need to reduce the turnaround time in treatment so that hospital infrastructure is not strained so much.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-reporting-much-higher-covid-peaks-this-time-government-says/articleshow/82336215.cms||Sushmi Dey

The EC had said in its plea that the media was sensationalising the oral observations made by the court against it. The bench said: “Two aspects cannot be missed: the first is the Union’s endeavour to indicate the surge in numbers may have been unexpected and preparatory measures had been taken for quite some time, and the second is the Election Commission’s concern at sensationalism. The postmortem on either count may have to wait, particularly in the light of the immediate measures that may be put in place.” The court made the observation when a suo motu PIL initiated by it to monitor the Tamil Nadu government’s preparedness to tackle the second wave of the pandemic came up for further hearing. The immediate concern is what may happen during vote counting on May 2, it added. “Leaders of political parties should ensure that the rank and file maintain a degree of discipline and exercise extreme restraint,” the court said. Party leaders should keep supporters in check, ensure there is no rally or bursting of crackers, the court added, adjourning the plea to May 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/election-commission-fails-in-bid-to-gag-media-over-madras-high-court-flak/articleshow/82336385.cms||Suresh Kumar

It has also asked all state chief wildlife wardens to take preventive measures to stop the transmission and spread of the virus from humans to animals. TOI had written on Friday about the increasing spread of the virus in villages around Tadoba that may affect wild animals due to the interface between humans and animals. Many cases are going unreported in villages around Tadoba as locals are not taking rapid antigen or RT-PCR tests. There is also a great reluctance to get vaccinated. Forest staff also have not been fully vaccinated. The crumbling health infrastructure has added fuel to fire. Under “break the chain” orders in Maharashtra, Pench and TATR have already issued orders to shut down tourism till May 15. “We have advised tourists not to do advance bookings even after May 15. In case parks open for tourism, visitors can be allowed through spot bookings. However, further opening of parks will be as per NTCA orders,” said Pench CCF & field director Ravikiran Govekar. On the advisory on the virus transmission threat, Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University vice-chancellor Ashish Paturkar said, “There are chances of the virus spreading from humans to animals. The present mutation can occur in animals too if Covid affected people come in contact with animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-parks-sanctuaries-shut-to-shield-animals-from-virus/articleshow/82336766.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Confusion about the vaccine’s capacity to mitigate the impact of infection, rumours around its side-effects and the ongoing Ramzan are making many Muslims delay their first shot of the vaccine. “There is confusion among some people whether the vaccine works to fight the Covid-19 or not and many buy the rumour that it could cause side-effects. Such confusion and doubts need to be removed,” said Sohail Khandwani, treasurer, World Memon Organisation (WMO) Khandwanisaid WMO, in association with the two dargahs, could set up vaccination centres, provided the authorities give the necessary help. M Asif Farooqui, executive council member of Aligarh Muslim University, said while touring several slum pockets in Mumbai, he heard reservations about the vaccine among the community members. “The ulema or religious scholars need to come out and tell the members to go for vaccination,” said Farooqui.

EGI condoled the death of over 52 journalists who died of the virus in April alone and quoted a report by the Institute of Perception Studies that said over 100 journalists had died of Covid-19 since the lockdown was first imposed last year. “The Guild is extremely distressed that the central government has not yet taken any steps to hasten the vaccination of journalists over the last few months,” the EGI said. It also raised concerns about freelance journalists not being insured and some journalists not being covered by the organisations they work for. “Besides the health risks borne out of such reporting, there have been additional pressures from some of the state governments and agencies that have threatened against independent reporting of the pandemic in an effort to control the media narrative,” the Guild said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/put-journalists-on-priority-vaccination-list-editors-guild-of-india/articleshow/82336782.cms||---

Now we have done this for individuals too,” explained an officer in the directorate general of foreign trade, which notified the change in rule.  Under Indian guidelines, gifts over Rs 1,000 face customs duty and integrated GST. While the government has suspended basic customs duty on several oxygen-related equipment till July, IGST is required to be paid. Due to a short supply of oxygen for Covid-19 patients, individuals have been buying concentrators apart from stocking up oxygen cylinders to meet any eventuality. This has not only resulted in a shortage of concentrators but also pushed up prices significantly.  The DGFT’s move is expected to ease the burden although shipments may take a few days before they can reach India and will need to be cleared. Customs authorities too have been seeking to expedite consignments meant for use by Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-now-foreigners-can-send-oxygen-concentrators-as-gifts/articleshow/82336905.cms||---

Jaishankar held a series of high level conversations on Friday, primarily with his US counterpart, Anthony Blinken, and earlier, with Wang Yi of China. The Jaishankar-Blinken conversation, which was “exhaustive”, covered key supply issues for medical oxygen, key pharma ingredients for drugs and therapeutics and unclogging the vaccine supply chain. Jaishankar asked the US to ease supplies of key APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Key Starter Materials (KSM) for production of drugs which would enable Indian pharma companies to enhance production during the current emergency. This is particularly important for drugs like Remdesivir, which is in high demand, given the severity of the Covid spread. Sources said, Indian companies have already increased production of remdesivir, and the supplies of KSMs by the US would help them further. The third issue India needs right now is unclogging the vaccine supply chain — India has enormous vaccine demand, and massive production capacities. Jaishankar asked the US to release vaccine components like adjuvants and resins that are needed for vaccine production. Blinken has reportedly agreed to move on this quickly. The conversation happened as US military transport aircraft dropped off oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies. India wants more oxygen generators with large capacities, something the US can provide. US NSA jake Sullivan, speaking to the Aspen Security Forum this evening, said the White House was in deep discussions on moving vaccine supplies to other countries, and firm up the US’ global vaccine strategy. An official readout by the US State Department of the conversation said, Blinken “reviewed comprehensive ongoing U.S. government efforts in support of the Indian government’s COVID-19 response operations. He also noted the outpouring of support from U.S. industries, non-governmental institutions, and private citizens for COVID-19 relief efforts in India.” Earlier in the evening Jaishankar held a conversation with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, where China agreed to allow cargo flights by Indigo and Spice Jet to Chinese cities to bring COVID supplies. In the coming days, Jaishankar is expected to travel to London for the G-7 ministerial, where he will emphasise prioritising medical supplies to India. The government plans to tap key European countries and some south-east Asian countries as important sources of supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaishankar-talks-to-blinken-over-medical-oxygen-api-supplies/articleshow/82336936.cms||Indrani Bagchi

According to auto dealers, car and SUV retail sales are likely to be lowest in 6 months hovering around 2 lakh units in April. Overall automobile sales could be down around 12%-15%. While auto factories have been vaccinating their workforce and families, 80%-90% staff at dealerships and workshops are typically in the 25-40 age group and not yet eligible for the jab. Result: around 7,000 dealerships are unoperational in 8 Covid critical states, many of them with their shutters down because the staff are infected. “Around 80%-90% of the workforce in auto retail are less than 45 years old and not eligible for vaccination. Around 7,000 dealerships are unoperational across 8 states — Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka and partially Gujarat. These are across segments from two wheelers to passenger vehicles to commercial vehicles. We expect April retail (excluding April 2020) to be the lowest in the last 5 years and there could be around 35%-40% decline in two wheeler showroom sales,” said Nikunj Sanghi, MD, JS 4Wheel Motor. Cars and SUVs will also see bookings dwindle particularly in states that have imposed partial or complete lockdown.According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), the states worst hit by the pandemic are some of the biggest auto markets. Hence the hit. “Passenger vehicle retail will be around 2,00,000-2,10,000 units because many of the high volume states have gone into lockdown since mid-April. Around 50% of the dealerships in these states are closed due to restrictions.The situation is very bad as the average age is low and 80% of the manpower are below 45 in auto retail,” said Vinkesh Gulati, president, FADA.While PV retail is low, thanks to the waiting period it is not as bad as two wheelers. “In PVs most models are under a waiting period so if some state is not taking delivery because of lockdown the OEM is able to give the vehicle to a state where there is a wait list," said Sanghi. But, say the dealers of a top volume car major in the NCR region, even here stocks have jumped from 12-15 days beginning of this month to 27-32 days now.But in two wheelers, where retail was already slow, things are more complicated. “We have been shut for the last 10 days. Business is affected but it's been going slow since January. April is over and it’s 40% of our average sales,” said a Karnataka-based Honda two wheeler dealer. Worse, stock pile up is a big issue here. “The high level of inventory that dealers have in two wheelers is a big issue,” said Gulati. “A rough estimate is that dealers are carrying 55-60 days inventory and some of the big OEMs are still pushing billing.” However with top two wheeler companies like Hero Motocorp and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India announcing Covid-related plant shutdowns, some of the production pileup will be automatically corrected. Dealers say the two wheeler stress is because the products have become more expensive and purchasing power has gone down. “From March 20 to now two wheelers have seen a 15%-20% price increase due to regulations, raw material cost pressure and other reasons,” said Sanghi. Two wheeler retail started showing a lag since late last year itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/auto-retail-hits-roadblock-sales-dip-15/articleshow/82333948.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

And within the next 24 hours, Keshav’s son and son-in-law too got hospitalised as they got infected with the Coronavirus. For the next fortnight, the entire Thakkar family was on the edge. But the trio didn’t just beat Coronavirus, they are now hale and hearty. “It was in the last week of March that we were detected with Covid-19. First my grandfather-in-law Keshav Thakkar was tested positive and within the next three days I and my father-in-law Janak Thakkar contracted Coronavirus,” said 41-year-old Sameer Thakkar. Keshav was admitted on April 1, while Janak, 64 and Sameer were moved to Bhailal Amin General Hospital (BAGH) the next day. “It was a tough time for us as my wife Janki and 11-year-old son Nandish too were tested positive for Covid. Fortunately, they were under home quarantine. Our relatives and neighbours helped us in the hour of crisis,” Sameer, who works as a supervisor in Bright School, told TOI. Of the three, Keshav’s condition was serious so he had to be kept on oxygen in the ICU. Sameer’s oxygen too dipped for a few days. “But by god’s grace and the medical treatment we got, I and my father-in-law managed to recover within a week. Keshav Thakkar too got discharged on April 12 and we all rested at home for 10 days,” Sameer added. Sameer said that Keshav was one of the founding members of Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh and a member of Jan Sangh. “He has been a fighter throughout his life and we all draw our inspiration from him. His wife Deepika Thakkar was a councillor for 10 years from Raopura,” Sameer said. “When Keshav was admitted, he was in a serious condition while Sameer too was kept in the ICU for some days. They both were in the same ICU and kept interacting with each other which helped too along with the treatment we gave. All the three have completely recovered now,” said Dr Neel Thakkar, pulmonologist who treated the Thakkar family at BAGH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/father-son-and-son-in-law-beat-covid-within-days/articleshow/82333831.cms||Tushar Tere

According to police, victim Pratap Ranavaya (58) and his son Bharat (30) were attacked by the former’s nephew Dharmesh Ranavaya. Pratap’s father had divided agriculture land among four brothers, but the unpaved road leading to Dharmesh’s farm was passing through Pratap’s land. “The dispute over the issue was long-standing and Pratap had narrowed the path leading to Dharmesh’s farm. At around 3pm, they again had a heated verbal altercation over this. Sometime around 6pm, Dharmesh, armed with a sharp-edged weapon stabbed Pratap. When Bharat came to his father’s rescue, Dharmesh stabbed him too,” said an official of Una city police station. Both victims received seven to eight stab wounds and were declared dead before admission at a local hospital. Dharmesh has been detained and police have also recovered the murder weapon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-son-murdered-in-land-dispute-by-kin/articleshow/82333929.cms||---

---||Business||Sensex tanks 984 points on virus spread, lockdowns||MUMBAI: More state governments imposing local lockdowns weighed heavily on investors’ minds on Friday after analysts said these steps would hurt the fragile economic revival process. As a result, the sensex lost 984 points, or 2%, to close at 48,782 with strong selling in banks and financials. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 264 points down at 14,631. The day’s across-the-board selling also left investors poorer by Rs 2 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 209 lakh crore. Friday’s selling was led by foreign funds. These recorded a net selling figure of Rs 3,465 crore, taking the total net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflow from the stock market for the month to a little over Rs 13,000 crore. April was the first month since September last year that this monthly figure turned negative, CDSL and BSE data showed. Despite the day’s slide, the Indian market was one of the best performing ones globally in the past week. According to a note by Kotak Securities, during the week — even though India witnessed the highest number of new Covid cases for any country in the world — the Nifty was up 2.5%, Nifty midcap 100 was up 3.2% and BSE smallcap 3.4%. However, the spate of state-government imposed lockdowns and restrictions could hamper future economic activities. According to Kotak Securities executive VP & head (fundamental research) Rusmik Oza, to contain the spread of Covid virus, more states may extend curbs. “The staggered state level restrictions and mini lockdowns this time are having a bigger impact on the services sector and lesser impact on the manufacturing sector. We will certainly see GDP growth estimates and earnings estimates getting cut over the next 2-3 months,” Oza said. “Persistent rise in commodity prices could be another threat that could hit margins of manufacturing companies.” What could cushion the fall, according to analysts, is strong results from leading corporates during the ongoing earnings season. Commentaries about their business and earnings would also dictate the market’s direction, they said. For example, after Wipro improved its earnings guidance for the current quarter, the stock rallied to a life-high at Rs 512 on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-tanks-984-pts-on-virus-spread-lockdowns/articleshow/82334498.cms||---

The committee, headed by Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS-Patna, has already sent a form to all the hospitals across the state for seeking information about their daily oxygen need. The report would be submitted before the high court during the next hearing on Monday. The committee would also inform the high court about how oxygen is being brought for refilling and supply to the hospitals. Besides, the division bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Shah also directed the state government to install two cryogenic oxygen tanks at IGIMS within suggested two months’ time period at all cost. It was the state government which submitted before the high court on Friday that two tanks for storing cryogenic oxygen would be installed at the IGIMS in two months. Once turned into a dedicated Covid-19 facility, IGIMS would have altogether 1070 beds for Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, Dr Bhadani inspected the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) and a private oxygen cylinder refilling plant at Fatuha on Friday. In his report, he mentioned discrepancy in the need of oxygen at PMCH and NMCH. He apprised the court that even after having less number of beds, PMCH is generating more demand of oxygen while NMCH has more beds but its oxygen demand is less. He even submitted that those involved in maintaining oxygen supply at PMCH cited leakage of the gas from pipes as the reason for more oxygen. The high court then directed Dr Bhadani to carry out a proper inspection that if there is actually a leakage of oxygen resulting in its more need or if there was black marketing of oxygen supplied to PMCH. The court also directed the state government to ensure ESIC hospital at Bihta becomes functional with at least 300 beds for treating Covid-19 patients within two weeks’ time. Additional advocate general Anjani Kumar submitted that security personnel have already been deployed at the hospital. The court also directed amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli to verify if the portal launched by the state government to display information about beds and other facilities available for Covid-19 patients is working properly or not. The direction was issued after the state government submitted that the portal has become functional. Besides, the court directed an NGO to explore the feasibility and apprise it on Monday if a Covid-19 facility could be set up in the Centenary building of the high court for lawyers. The state government had refused a separate facility for lawyers in the building on grounds that every other section would make such demand later on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-seeks-report-on-oxygen-requirement-of-hospitals/articleshow/82333511.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Padma Shri Bimal Jain, secretary of the Dadhichi Dehdaan Samiti, said the organisation is delivering food packets under their ‘Prabhu Prasad Seva’ initiative to Covid patients as well as to those waiting at crematoriums. The Samiti can be reached at 8084053399 and 9110137152. "We are delivering 100 food packets daily voluntarily prepared by Marwari Awaas Grih. The members of the organization take care of funding for this cause. We aim at providing food to 1,000-1,200 families in the coming time," Jain said. Adding to that, Mukesh Hissariya, another member of the Samiti said they were facing challenges in gathering volunteers. "We are constantly searching for volunteers in different parts of the city to carry the food packets. Hopefully, we will soon get enough volunteers to cover the whole city," he added. Anupama Singh and Neelima Singh, who are also providing free meals to Covid- affected families, said they don't want any monetary help from people rather they want sufficient people to take the initiative of supplying food in their localities. They can be approached at 8340570194. "We thoroughly believe every single person can be a social hero.

---||Business||Bank credit grows slowest in 4 years||MUMBAI: Bank credit to businesses and individuals slowed to a four-year low of 4.9% in FY21, down from 6.8% in FY20 due to the pandemic. Credit growth during the year was, however, higher than forecasts made last year when many expected flat or even degrowth in loans. Growth in bank credit during the financial year was driven by personal loans and credit to agriculture and allied activities. While advances to large industry fell, lending to the micro, small & medium enterprise (MSME) segment grew, bolstered by government-guaranteed schemes. Credit growth picked up substantially in March this year on the back of a lower base in the same month of 2020 due to the imposition of a lockdown. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday, non-food credit of all banks stood at Rs 96.6 lakh crore as on March 26, 2021 — up 4.9% from Rs 92.1 lakh crore as on March 27, 2020. Banks added Rs 2.6 lakh crore to their loan portfolio during the year, taking the loan book to Rs 28.1 lakh crore. The share of personal loans has gone up from 27.7% in FY20 to 29.1% in FY21 and is now close to the share of credit to the industry, which has fallen from 31.5% to 30.2% during the same period. The share of the services sector in bank credit has fallen from 28.2% to 27.2% during the fiscal due to a sharp fall in growth of loans to professional services. In absolute terms, the biggest consumer of incremental bank credit during FY21 was agriculture and allied activities which grew Rs 1.4 lakh crore to nearly Rs 13 lakh crore, followed by housing which expanded by Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 14.6 lakh crore. Credit to large industry shrunk by 0.8%, or Rs 19,608 crore, to just under Rs 24 lakh crore. Within the large industry, loans to the road sector grew the most (by Rs 60,623 crore) to Rs 2.4 lakh crore. The biggest dip was in loans to the telecom sector which shrunk by Rs 30,680 crore to Rs 1.1 lakh crore. Reliance Jio had significantly reduced its debt after selling a stake to international investors. Steel industry saw its outstanding loans shrink by nearly Rs 30,000 crore during the year partly due to the debt resolution process of some companies. While personal loans were a big driver of growth, they have been slowing down in the third quarter. Personal loan growth decelerated to 10.2% in March 2021 from 15% a year ago. However, vehicle loans and loans against gold jewellery continued to perform well during the month, registering accelerated growth. According to Care Ratings, the credit growth of close to 5% is in the range of 4-5% forecast by the rating agency. “Overall credit to the industry did turn the corner and was 0.4% after being negative for 11 months while growth to the large industry remains negative for the year. Growth in credit to services was lower this year at 1.4% as against 7.4% last year. The drop was largely on account of NBFC and other services,” a note from the rating agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bank-credit-grows-slowest-in-4-yrs/articleshow/82334618.cms||Mayur Shetty

That would shame humanity itself,” Sister Helen, matron at the hospital told this newspaper. “After the patient died, some men dragged two nurses from the ICU on the 2nd floor to the medicine ward and assaulted them. The PPE kit that they ripped apart saved one nurse from being stripped of her uniform,” the matron said, adding that nurses, who are selflessly working round the clock, were distraught. Officials, including the SDM and SDPO, reached the hospital even as the frightened nurses were huddled together and the wards remained unattended for over an hour. Just a floor below, the Covid ward was almost full with 118 patients and roads leading to the hospital were being punctuated with screeching ambulance wails. “The culprit has been arrested,” SP Upendra Nath Verma said while maintaining that it was not possible to keep a man to man watch. “The focus of police personnel deployed here is in and around the Covid ward,” hospital superintendent Pramod K Tiwary said. But what about the guards from a private security agency that the GMC has had in place from before? “Yes, there were private guards who weren’t able to prevent the incident,” Tiwary admitted. The nurses, meanwhile, picked themselves up to declare that they shall continue with their duties even though the task may seem insurmountable in the pandemic. “Nurses are serving round the clock. We pray that doctors, too, be on their watch in the wards 24X7,” matron Helen said, stressing that the kin of patients are also on the edge. “The presence of doctors will certainly help assuage panic tempers,” she stressed, reiterating, “The absence of doctors is triggering alarm.” “Yes, the nurses have placed certain demands like installation of CCTV cameras and hooters to ring alarm whenever anything untoward occurs and more security,” Tiwary said. “Just increasing the number of security personnel won’t do. What is needed is capable security,” the matron maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-hospital-nurses-brave-assault-to-carry-on-with-service/articleshow/82332932.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

The government directed principals and superintendents of teaching hospitals to immediately appoint special teams with senior professors to take care of Covid-19 patients. Sources said patients have complained that doctors do not visit the wards even once a day to check their vitals. While PG doctors make a daily visit, the responsibility of monitoring the health of patients, including the critically ill, is left to the nurses. In some cases, the condition of patients is said to be deteriorating in the absence of doctors to monitor the health of those on ventilators and oxygen support. At GGH, Guntur, Covid-19 special officer and principal secretary Usha Rani appealed to senior doctors to treat patients. “We have information on how many professors are visiting the wards and how many are skipping duties. It is not fair on your part,” said joint collector Prasanthi, in-charge of Covid-19 operations in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/senior-docs-give-covid-wards-a-miss/articleshow/82333334.cms||Samdani MN

Vigilance sleuths unearthed irregularities in private hospitals, including diversion of emergency Remdesivir injections to the black market, and booked criminal cases against the violators. The vigilance and enforcement department launched the state-wide drive following complaints from the public a couple of days ago about the collection of charges over and above the allowed costs for treatment of Covid-19. The inspections also exposed the diversion of Remdesivir stocks. “We are not harassing any hospital management with the inspections. We are only cracking the whip against those who are resorting to irregularities either in extending treatment to Covid-19 patients or diversion of the emergency drugs,” said vigilance and enforcement director general KVN Rajendranath Reddy. “We have conducted raids against just 35 hospitals following specific complaints about irregularities and violation of rules. In fact, we have booked cases against only nine hospitals as the charges were very severe,” said Rajendranath Reddy. He said the private hospitals association in Kadapa has agreed to resume operations for Covid-19 patients following negotiations with their officials. Irregularities by a few would bring disrepute to all doctors working to save lives, he pointed out. The vigilance and enforcement chief, however, warned that they would continue with surprise inspections whenever specific complaints about violations is received. He said no one would be allowed to exploit patients, adding that 18 special flying squads in all districts will check alleged irregularities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/raids-carried-out-in-response-to-specific-complaints-ve-chief/articleshow/82333357.cms||Samdani MN

Speaking to the media on Friday, Singhal said that as per the communique received from the Union government, Andhra Pradesh can purchase about 13 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers in May. “But the state government is of the view that it is better to complete the mass inoculation drive for the existing priority groups first by diverting even the purchased vials. However, we can allocate the same quantum of vials for the vaccination drive of people aged between 18 and 45 later as the Union government would continue supplying vaccines for 45+,” said Singhal. Singhal said Andhra Pradesh has identified 2.04 crore people aged between 18 and 45. “The Union government has recently decided to divert the liquefied natural gas tankers for transportation of medical oxygen. Two such tankers have been allocated to AP, which would help in speedy oxygen transportation. We are also exploring various options to procure more cryogenic tankers for transportation of oxygen,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-keen-to-finish-ongoing-drive-before-phase-3-rollout/articleshow/82333326.cms||---
---||Patna||Chest physiotherapy techniques a boon for Covid patients: Experts||PATNA: Chest physiotherapy techniques can prove to be a boon for patients as chest infections are becoming a cause of concern for doctors amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts said it could improve oxygen saturation level in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Senior physiotherapist at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (IGIMS), Dr Ratnesh Choudhary, said the new Coronavirus strains are leading to pneumonia in many patients, and physiotherapy can play a great role in treating them. "Chest physiotherapy is a technique, which improves the lungs capacity by stimulation of the lungs muscle. It helps in releasing the secretions trapped in the chest. There are several techniques such as breathing exercises using respirometer lung exerciser, which enhances the capacity of lungs," Dr Choudhary said. He added that physiotherapy can be used during both pre and post-recovery treatment of Covid patients to address breathlessness, weakness, mental confusion and gastric issues. Dr Choudhary along with other physiotherapists have started a free-of-cost initiative to provide telephonic consultation to Covid patients. He claimed that the techniques administered to the patients help in early recovery and cut the need for artificial supplementation of oxygen. Gaya-based physiotherapist, Dr Mrityunjay Kumar, said lying in the prone position is a must-try for patients with low oxygen saturation level. "Huffing and coughing, chest and back-patting are few exercises that relieve breathing scope," he said. Another physiotherapist from Gaya, Dr Ajit Kumar Keshri, also emphasized the importance of chest physiotherapy. "Patients facing a drop in oxygen level are suggested to do the respiratory exercise using a respirometer. Besides, that people in home isolation should do clapping, vaporization and walking," Dr Kumar said. Adding to that, a Muzaffarpur-based physiotherapist Dr Abhishek Suman said blowing off a candle is a good exercise and can be done easily at home. "A patient with severe symptoms of chest congestion should practice one candle blowing while a better condition patient should do the same with more candles," Dr Suman said. Om Prakash, a Covid survivor said being under the guidance of a physiotherapist helped him a lot in balancing the oxygen level with the suggested exercises from the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chest-physiotherapy-techniques-a-boon-for-covid-patients-experts/articleshow/82333020.cms||---

The Bihar government had placed an order for the Covishield vaccine with the Serum Institute of India (SSI) but health officials said the SII has not given any dates for the supply of the jabs. Sources claimed it is likely to take a few days for the vaccine consignment to start arriving in a staggered manner. The existing stock or any fresh stock to be sent by the Centre is to be used only for inoculation of people above 45 years. Accordingly, even if youths can register themselves on the CoWIN portal, they will not get any slot for vaccination. Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said only 10-12% of the population in the country, including Bihar, has been vaccinated since January 16. "There is an urgent need for an increased supply and proper distribution of vaccines in Bihar as well. The vaccine must be available in every public and private vaccination centres in Bihar to speed up the vaccination coverage by vaccinating the 18+ population," Dr Shah said. Patna-based physician Dr Pratyush Kumar said it's important for the younger generation to get the vaccine doses because they can spread and catch the virus more easily owing to their hyperactivity and mobility. The youngsters, on the other hand, are disappointed with the delay in their vaccination. Shashank Mohan (20), an undergraduate student from Patna City, said, "It is disappointing that the vaccination drive will not start from May 1. I tried all day to register on the CoWIN portal, somehow I got registered but I came to know that vaccination is delayed. The vaccine is the only is a ray of hope but we will still have to wait for it. The government must make arrangements as soon as possible." Shristi Prakash (21), an undergraduate student from Mithapur said, "The government needs to take the required action and vaccinate the young population. Many people have taken their first dose and now they'll take the second dose of the vaccine. Government shall arrange the vaccines sooner or this delay can lead to many deaths." Shianjany Pradhan (21), an undergraduate law student from Patliputra, said, "Even if it's a little late, it's manageable if we keep ourselves safe. I hope the government provides vaccines to everyone as soon as possible."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youths-feel-let-down-by-delay-in-covid-vaccination/articleshow/82333063.cms||---

Not only the medicines for Covid, but the equipment such as pulse oximeter, nebulizer, glucometer, portable oxygen cylinders and steam inhalers are also out of stock at many places. Medicines like Fabiflu and Tocilizumab injection are also in short supply. Rajesh Arya, secretary at Patna Chemist and Druggist Association, told this newspaper that there is shortage of medicines, including Remdesivir, Azithromycin and even vitamin supplements, in the market. “We supply medicines of the same composition of different brands to avoid shortage and use them as substitute. We are putting in every effort to provide basic medicines, so that more and more lives could be saved,” he said. Shaiwal, owner of a pharmacy at Khajpura said: “It’s terrible that we can’t provide people with basic medicines prescribed to Covid patients, such as Azithromycin, zinc tablets and even Paracetamol as they are in short supply. We are trying to make them available at the earliest. There is a spike in demand for pulse oximeter and thermometer as well.” Satendra Kumar, who works at a chemist shop at Sheikpura, said: “Many people who are not Covid positive are also purchasing the medicines in bulk out of fear of shortage. They are also grabbing equipment like oximeter and thermometer to monitor their oxygen and temperature regularly.” Owner of another pharmacy in the city said there is shortage of paracetamol as it is very much in demand because of the rise in Covid cases. “It’s a difficult time to cope with these uncertainties. Basic injections and medicines prescribed for patients are is short supply but we are trying to make them available,” he said. Shashank Mohan, an undergraduate student from Patna City, said he went to buy Fabiflu and Remdesivir but both weren’t available at the moment. “The chemist told me they didn’t even have paracetamol. I somehow arranged the medicines,” he said. Ritika Kumari, an undergraduate student from Gardanibagh, said she had never felt so helpless. “Some people are taking this situation for granted and selling medicines and injections at exorbitant prices. However, there are some people who are providing us the verified information regarding the availability of the medicines on social media. It’s somehow helpful,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/basic-drugs-equipment-out-of-stock-in-many-pharmacies/articleshow/82332907.cms||---

The hospital at Howrah had allegedly confirmed to the man’s son about his “stable health” at 10.30am on Wednesday before they started claiming the next morning that no patient named Gopal Chandra Kundu was admitted there. The family — most of them suffering from Covid and in home isolation — sought help from police who went to the hospital on Thursday evening and found the man had died at 8.20am on Wednesday, more than 38 hours ago and the hospital had not informed the family. The incident was reported from Baltikuri ESI Hospital in Howrah. TOI had called the district CMOH to seek an explanation. “I have been told the hospital had called the family but none responded. We are busy these days with so many critical patients, hence they couldn’t follow up over a long period of time and disposed of the body. If the family has some other allegation, they can submit a written complaint and I will see to it,” he said. Speaking to TOI the man’s daughter, an assistant teacher at a government school and a resident of Garia, said, “We were told the Covid test report would take three days to arrive, but my father was having difficulty breathing.” After several refusals from hospitals, multiple calls to the state health department and help from social media got himadmitted to a Baruipur government hospital on Tuesday evening. “The hospital conducted a rapid antigen test and the report came positive. But the doctors said the hospital was converted into a Covid unit just that day and my brother had to carry my father to the ward by himself,” she said. Some hours later, the hospital informed the family the man had to be shifted to KS Roy Hospital in Jadavpur. The man’s son conducted the formalities, but later, he received a call from the Jadavpur hospital alerting him the man was shifted to Baltikuri ESI Hospital. “My brother went to the Howrah hospital on Wednesday where the officials gave him a number to call between 6pm and 7pm to know my father’s status. But none took the call. When I called on Thursday, an official said my father wasn’t there,” she said. The family then contacted KS Roy TB Hospital, as well as the state health department, but none could trace the man. The woman then posted her ordeal on social media and someone tagged Kolkata Police, who guided her to Howrah City Police’s control room. “We lodged a complaint with Howrah City Police around 7.30pm and within one-and-a-half hours, cops informed us that my father had died more than 38 hours ago and the hospital hadn’t informed us,” the woman said. The man’s son went to the hospital on Friday where he had to wait for six hours to be showed the body for identification before they disposed of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mystery-of-missing-patient-ends-in-death/articleshow/82333686.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

While the city and surrounding areas have been recording around 35-40 Covid deaths daily, nearly 200 bodies are sent to Covid crematoriums — including those who have died with Covid symptoms without a test and those whose results had not arrived. The state on Friday issued an order stating that last rites of all Covid victims will be carried out free of cost amid complaints of fleecing by doms and middlemen at crematoriums and burial grounds. Nimtolla Covid crematorium will be turned into a full-fledged facility. At present, it has two furnaces for Covid cremation. Civic officials said this was inadequate and two furnaces had to be added. It will also be separated from the new complex to minimize chances of infection. Currently, around 35-40 Covid bodies are cremated at the facility daily. One of the two furnaces in use developed a snag a couple of weeks ago, leading to bodies being sent to Birjunala crematorium. The KMC health department is also monitoring Dhapa Covid crematorium as it shoulders the maximum load. “We have added two furnaces. Now we are focusing on maintenance to minimize breakdown,” a KMC official said. The KMC is looking to set up makeshift arrangements for Covid cremation in Garia, Behala and Rajpur-Sonarpur, a KMC health official said. A state control room number (033-2214-1995) and a helpline (18004191198) have been launched to answer queries and address grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-furnaces-for-covid-crematorium/articleshow/82333653.cms||Saikat Ray

R Rajani (28) had been working at Government General Hospital, Guntur, for the past five years on a contractual basis. She is survived by her husband and their three-year-old son. According to her colleague Maneesha, Rajani initially tested negative for Covid-19 about a fortnight ago. Subsequently, she tested positive when she consulted a doctor at St Joseph’s Hospital where she was undergoing check-ups for delivery. Sources said Rajani and her husband Bharath, who is also an employee at GGH, left for Rajani’s home in Nellore on April 21, following a request from her sister who is also a nurse at a government hospital in Nellore. However, the couple failed to get admission for delivery anywhere in Nellore due to the high number of Covid-19 cases, prompting them to rush to Chennai. With private hospitals in Chennai also refusing to admit Rajani, Bharath took her to a government Covid-19 hospital in the city on Friday. Sources said that the doctors performed a C-section for delivery. However, both mother and baby died soon after the delivery. “It is shocking news for all of us as Rajani had bravely served Covid-19 patients during the first wave and other patients till her last days of service,” said GGH superintendent Dr Neelam Prabhavathi. Her colleagues said Rajani had not availed leaves despite her pregnancy, saying she was assigned to serve the poor. Assistant collector Subham Bansal, Dr Prabhavathi and staff nurses held a candlelit condolence meeting on Friday. “We request chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to grant Rs 50 lakh ex-gratia to the kin of the nurse,” said Rajani’s colleague Maneesha. She also demanded the GGH superintendent and medical college principal to spare a separate ward for nurses for treatment if they tested Covid-19 positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/admission-delay-leads-to-death-of-newborn-and-pregnant-nurse/articleshow/82333344.cms||Samdani MN

Guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who reviewed the Covid-19 scenario in the district during a meeting organized at district collectorate along with the state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse and deputy speaker of assembly Narhari Zhirwal, said that the district was scheduled to get a liquid oxygen tanker through the oxygen train in a couple of days. “We have been following up with the railways that is running Oxygen Express and, hence, Nashik is expected to get an oxygen tanker in the next couple of days,” said Bhujbal. He also pointed out that the district administration, Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and zilla parishad was working overtime to tackle the problem of availability of oxygen and remdesivir. Meanwhile, leader of opposition in assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and leader of opposition in council Pravin Darekar on Friday visited Nashik city and reviewed the Covid-19 scenario. Briefing the media after a meeting with divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game, Fadnavis said that Nashik will be provided with two liquid oxygen tankers to meet the rising demand. “We met the divisional commissioner, discussed and finalized the arrangement of two liquid tankers from Jamnagar in Gujarat which will take a couple of days to reach Nashik,” Fadnavis said. Fadnavis said that the situation warranted that the state government pays more attention to Nashik in terms of making essential things available for treatment of patients. “It is a known fact that district is facing shortage of oxygen and remdesivir. Central government used the logic of higher number of cases while allocating oxygen supply and remdesivir. The same logic should be used by the state to ensure that oxygen and remdesivir are made available judiciously to the region that is most-affected,” Fadnavis added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-to-get-liquid-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/82332287.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But the liberalization of vaccination may have its own ‘side-effect’.The National Blood Transfusion Council prohibits the donation of whole blood for 28 days after taking the coronavirus vaccine due to which blood banks in Surat are speculating a shortage of blood for a couple of months. Blood banks in Diamond City have appealed to citizens to come forward and donate blood before they take the jab after May 1. The Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion (IHBT) at SMIMER Hospital has started circulating messages among the people to come forward and donate blood. The message asks citizens to plan by donating blood and avoid a possible shortage of blood in the next two to three months due to mass vaccination. Citizens were requested to circulate the messages in their WhatsApp groups and also share it on their social media profile. “Right now planned surgeries are not taking place, but the blood is required during delivery of babies, emergencies and for thalassemia patients,” said Dr Ankita Shah, head of IHBT department at SMIMER Hospital. Before the pandemic struck in March last year, the blood bank in SMIMER used to receive 1,000 units of blood every month, but that has reduced significantly since. The blood bank at New Civil Hospital too has witnessed a reduction in blood donation due to the pandemic and they too are planning to stock up before mass vaccination begins. “After the pandemic, our monthly blood collection has come down to 400 to 500 units which used to be anywhere between 800 to 1,000 units,” said Dr Mayur Jarag, in-charge of the blood bank at NCH. He added that anticipating a further reduction in blood stock, they have requested organizations to conduct blood donation camps even in smaller places. “Right now, people may hesitate to gather and come forward for blood donation so we are requesting organizations to ramp up the collection by conducting camps in residential societies,” Jarag added. Surat Raktdan Kendra and Research Centre (SRKRC) too has been requesting people to come in a group of five for blood donation. “There is already a demand for blood plasma, but whole blood too is equally needed so we are requesting people to donate blood plasma as well as whole blood before taking the jab,” said Nitesh Mehta of SRKRC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/blood-banks-appeal-citizens-to-donate-blood-before-taking-covid-jab/articleshow/82334050.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Member companies in the IT sector are working with state governments to set up BPO centres to provide real time data on availability of beds in hospitals, oxygen cylinders and other critical items required for treatment of patients, he said.Taking the shortage of Remdesivir into consideration, CII said its members in the pharma sector have ramped up production of Remdesivir antiviral drug on a war footing. “These companies have a production capacity of manufacturing 1 crore doses of Remdesivir in the coming months,” said Ranganathan. The association has also urged state governments to step up the vaccination drive by collaborating with industries in setting up vaccination camps in their factory premises. Such an initiative, could cover vaccination of over 3 lakh people comprising industrial workers and their family members and communities in the neighbourhood in the six southern states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cii-ramps-up-mfg-of-essential-medical-supplies-in-southern-states/articleshow/82334011.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Business||RIL’s Q4 net increases over 2X to near Rs 15k cr||Mumbai: Fourth quarter profit of Reliance Industries (RIL), India’s largest company in terms of market value, more than doubled after growing 129% to Rs 14,995 crore, benefiting from higher price realisations in its digital services (Jio) and retail businesses. Profit also included a one-time gain of Rs 797 crore, which it made from the sale of US shale assets. RIL had posted a one-time loss of Rs 4,267 crore in Q4FY20. Revenue edged up 11% to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, it said on Friday. Operating profit marginally improved to Rs 26,602 crore in the January through March months despite the O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business clocking weak earnings. The company had combined its refining and petrochemicals units to form O2C. “To me, the contributions (RIL’s help in Covid fight) are far more satisfying than our company’s strong, overall operational and financial performance for the year,” said its chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani. For the whole year of the pandemic-hit 2020-21, RIL’s profit rose 35% to Rs 53,739 crore. “While Covid-19 has disrupted livelihoods, we have added nearly 75,000 jobs to the economy (during fiscal 2021),” Ambani said. The jobs were added by RIL’s consumer business (Jio and retail), which accounted for 47% of its operating profit. In the year-ago period, Jio and retail together accounted for 36% of the company’s operating profit. Operating profit of O2C dropped 5% to Rs 11,407 crore due to lower product sales and price realisations. But operating profit of digital services climbed 31% to Rs 8,945 crore due to an improved average revenue per user (ARPU) and higher data usage by people, while remaining sheltered at homes due to Covid. ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Jio’s ARPU was Rs 138 in the March quarter, up from Rs 130 a year ago. Launched in 2016, Jio has 426 million customers and saw data and voice traffic growth of 27% and 18%, respectively, on its network. Operating profit of retail increased 41% to Rs 3,623 crore, despite restricted normative operating conditions. This growth was enabled by doubling of consumer electronics profits, cost-management initiatives and a boost from investment income of Rs 534 crore, RIL said. Operating profit of financial services, which the company recently started to report separately, plunged 59% to Rs 144 crore. Oil & gas, however, turned around, with revival in KG-D6 gas production. It made an operating profit of Rs 480 crore as against an operational loss of Rs 46 crore in the year-ago period. RIL’s debt at the end of the quarter was Rs 2.51 lakh crore, but it had Rs 2.54 lakh crore in cash and cash equivalents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rils-q4-net-increases-over-2x-to-near-rs-15k-cr/articleshow/82334607.cms||---

It has also asked them not to follow their usual practice of partially freezing accounts up to May 31, if KYC is not updated. In its letter, SBI said that in cases where KYC is due, the bank can update records based on documents received from customers through post or registered email ID. The communication by the country’s largest bank followed a tweet from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who had flagged her ministry’s departments on the issue raised by a journalist. Banks usually ask customers to update their KYC once every 10 years for low-risk customers, once every eight years for medium-risk and every two years for high-risk customers. The categorisation according to risk depends on the value and frequency of transactions. Salary accounts are usually safe. The move will benefit thousands of customers who have found their accounts frozen for want of KYC amid the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-will-not-freeze-accounts-if-kyc-is-not-updated/articleshow/82334521.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, various major works worth several crores are being carried out in the Danapur division. “The second wave of the coronavirus has caused suspension of works at 40 construction sites in Danapur division. Out of 220 workers engaged in the project works, 23 have so far left the sites and went to their native places,” he said. Work on 10 out of the 20 ongoing construction sites under Sonepur division has been temporarily suspended due to sudden exodus of workers from the sites. “Altogether 250 workers were engaged in carrying out construction works at these sites. Ongoing works at five sites came to a halt in Bihar under the jurisdiction of Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya division so far,” the CPRO said. Under Samastipur division , railways was carrying out gauge conversion, track-doubling, new lines laying and advanced signalling works. Out of 10 major sites, work at eight has been temporarily stopped. “Altogether 62 workers engaged in Samastipur division have left the construction sites,” Rajesh said.

District magistrate Abhishek Singh has asked deputy collector Shailesh Kumar Das, who has been made the nodal officer of the cell, to ensure proper supply of oxygen to the hospitals. Earlier, owners of private hospitals had met the DM and requested him to ensure adequate oxygen supply. The administration has allowed six private hospitals to treat Covid patients. Meanwhile, the DM, who held a meeting with representatives of hotel associations on Thursday, asked them to make Covid wards in the hotels. He said 15 air-conditioned rooms should be on separate floor of the hotel. As per government rate, one will have to pay Rs 2,800 per day for a hotel room while food will be available at Rs 175. There will be two categories of hotels with government rates fixed at Rs 2,800 and Rs 2,200.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man gets 1-year jail for hurling abuses at woman cop in 2019||MUMBAI: A sessions court this week convicted and sentenced a 56-year-old man to one-year simple imprisonment for verbally abusing a woman police constable while she was on duty managing traffic at a junction at Ghatkopar in 2019. The accused, Satish Gaonkar, was drunk at the time of the incident. While Gaonkar was found guilty on charges of outraging a woman’s modesty and also fined Rs 1,000, he was acquitted of the charge of using criminal force to deter a public servant from performing her duty. “There is no evidence showing that the accused had any motive or object to assault the informant being a public servant and in execution of her duty as such a public servant,” the court said. The court also refused to let the accused off on a bond of good behaviour. “The proved offences have been committed against a woman who is a police person. The accused repeatedly abused and rushed on her person. Having regard to this background, it will not be appropriate to release the accused on probation or to take a lenient view,” it said. Among the witnesses who deposed were the victim cop and a vada pav stall owner who helped her. The woman told the court that on June 16, 2019, around 10am, when she was on duty at the junction, she saw Gainkar walking towards her, hurling abuses. She realised that he was under the influence of some intoxicant substance. The woman constable said she felt that he would hit her, so she moved away. However, the accused rushed towards and kept abusing her using expletives. At that time, the vada pav stall owner and another person came to her rescue. By then she also sought assistance from the control room. Two policemen arrived at the spot and caught the accused. He was taken to the police station and an FIR was lodged. The accused denied the allegations. The court observed that the woman constable’s deposition was corroborated by the the vada pav vendor and the policemen who came to the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-gets-1-year-jail-for-hurling-abuses-at-woman-cop-in-2019/articleshow/82334532.cms||Rebecca Samervel

It will cover over 14 crore people. As per the schedule drawn up by the department of food and civil supplies, distribution of foodgrains will be done under National Food Security Act till May 14, after which an additional 5kg of foodgrains will be distributed under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. Food commissioner Manish Chauhan told TOI that distribution of foodgrains will thus be done in two cycles. “The exercise would be closely monitored and carried out while observing Covid protocols,” he said. Officials of the food and civil supplies said that ration distribution will be done under the supervision of a nodal officer at every ration shop amid adherence to Covid safety protocols. Ration will be distributed through biometric authentication as done last year during the lockdown period. Also, the department will be resorting to online monitoring of ration distribution, which would be done through electronic point of sale (ePOS) machines. Data of the food and civil supply department shows that Prayagraj has the maximum number of 10.5 lakh ration card holders, followed by nine lakh in Sitapur and over eight lakh each in Kheri and Gorakhpur. They are provided 3kg wheat and 2kg rice at the subsidised rates of Rs 2 and Rs 3 per kilogram, respectively, through 80,000 ration shops. According to an estimate, 7.5 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains needs to be raised every month to be distributed as ration to 14.5 crore people in the state. On April 16, the CM had announced at a high-level meeting with the officials that the state government will give free rations and maintenance allowance to the labourers and poor families as he did during the last year’s lockdown and had directed the officials to update the list of eligible recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3-5cr-ration-card-holders-to-get-5kg-foodgrains-in-up/articleshow/82335684.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Delhi: Paying an arm for bootleg Remdesivir — and not getting it eventually||NEW DELHI: One must have seen at least a thousand SOS messages in social media for Remdesivir, a name that will forever remind of Covid-19. In the past two weeks, the demand for this anti-viral injection has gone through the roof, forcing desperate people to pay any amount asked for a vial of the drug, frequently opening them up to the risk of being duped. Reena, who is based in Kolkata, was looking for the injection for her cousin’s father in Jorbagh, central Delhi. Speaking to TOI, Reena said, “Since my cousin was busy taking care of her father, who even now is in critical condition, she requested us to call people selling Remdesivir. We stumbled upon a number, and the seller asked for an advance. He promised to give us six vials for Rs 28,000. The payment had to be transferred to an account whose holder name was listed as ‘Cipla Company e Foundation Ltd’. He asked for the prescription, Covid reports and Aadhaar card details. We sent these and transferred the money.” Having been told that the vials would be delivered to the hospital or to the patient directly, the family waited in vain. Neither were the vials delivered nor was the money returned. “At a time when people are fighting to save their loved ones, it is sad to see this sort of unscrupulous acts are being perpetrated,” rued Reena. Palak too was duped by the same person. “I was looking for Remdesivir for a relative. I received a contact number on a college friends WhatsApp group and since the payment account had the Cipla name, I trusted it and went ahead,” narrated Palak. “The seller asked me to pay Rs 10,000 as advance, which I did. He promised delivery by 6pm the following day. The vial never reached us. I only want to say that money can be earned again, but someone’s life cannot be brought back.” Palak sent an email to Cipla apprising the drug company of the fraud and also filed an FIR. “Cipla responded by saying it was an unfortunate incident and that it had also come to their notice. They have been issuing cautionary notes to the public on all social media platforms regarding this, their email said,” Palak mumbled. Southwest Delhi resident Pramukhesh, 28, eight of whose relatives are Covid-positive, was on the lookout for the injection. “The injection is required to treat Covid patients but not everyone can pay such amounts. My 45-year-old cousin was struggling for life in an east Delhi hospital and her husband paid Rs 50,000 for two vials and picked them up from Gurgaon,” said Pramukhesh. “I feel its gross negligence on the administration’s part not to regulate the sale of this vital medicine. People are running around for the injection and are being charged a bomb for it.” Like Pramukhesh, many Delhiites are wondering how they can afford to pay so much for bootleg Remdesivir. “We paid Rs 50,000 for two vials and there are people who need six vials!” exclaimed Pramukhesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/paying-an-arm-for-bootleg-remdesivir-and-not-getting-it-eventually/articleshow/82335726.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Traders warned on fake Alphonso & Konkan Hapus||Navi Mumbai: State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse’s recent statement warning mango traders of legal action if they mix up genuine Alphonso mangoes of Konkan with poor quality mangoes of Karnataka region has led to APMC administration issuing a letter to fruit merchants to ensure that only genuine Hapus mangoes of Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and surrounding areas are sold as top variety, so customers do not feel cheated. The letter states that mango boxes arriving at wholesale market must be clearly marked to indicate from which area or region they were sourced, so that there is no confusion or mix-up in identifying genuine Alphonso mangoes from Konkan region. APMC mango trader and fruit exporter, Avadhut Dongre, told TOI, “Since Alphonso mangoes coming from Karnataka look similar to top quality Hapus Alphonso mangoes of Konkan belt, some wholesale and retail traders try to push these variants as the Konkan mangoes to profit. Hence, APMC did the right thing to remind traders they can be punished for cheating consumers.” Another trader said the conflict between top quality Ratnagiri and Devgad Alphonso mangoes with those from Karnataka had been going on for several years, which is why in 2018, Konkan Alphonso mangoes were given a Geographical Indication (GI) tag to vouch for geographical sourcing and good quality. Unscrupulous sellers try to repackage Karnataka mangoes as those from Konkan. So far, nearly nine lakh boxes (with 4-6 dozen mangoes per carton) have arrived at APMC from various regions this season.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Every police lines in state to get Covid hospital||LUCKNOW: Taking a cue from the decision of Kanpur zone police to set up 20-bed L1 and L2 hospitals in police lines in all nine districts under its jurisdiction, the Uttar Pradesh police has issued directives for the establishment of similar facilities across the state. ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar told TOI that the step would not only provide better treatment to policemen but would help in proper utilization of facilities and infrastructure at police lines. “Setting up of Covid-19 L1 and L2 hospitals in police lines, mooted by Kanpur police zone in nine districts and Kanpur Nagar commissionerate, is a model for others to emulate,” he said. He said the infrastructure at police lines was already available and there only trained paramedical staff was required to look after patients admitted in these facilities. “Police personnel who have taken ill after their return from panchayat poll duties may need isolation. Some may even require a bed with oxygen cylinder. It is essential to make such preparations at police lines after coordinating with the chief medical officer and chief medical superintendent of the district concerned. Setting up facilities in police lines will help ease off pressure on district hospital,” the ADG said. “Efforts are being made to make available articles of daily use for the families of policemen so that they don’t have to venture outside. A certain budget has also been allocated to police in each district for purchase of infrared thermometers, disposable hand gloves, pulse oximeters, and PPE kits which can be reimbursed after sending the purchased items to finance controller, UP police, DGP headquarters,” he added. ADG, Kanpur, Bhanu Bhaskar, said idea behind the initiative was to ensure that policemen (as frontline workers) keep themselves safe from infection so that they may discharge their duties properly and help citizens. “An 11-point strategy was prepared in coordination with the chief medical officer and chief medical superintendents of all nine districts. The zone has a force of about 25,000 policemen, including home guards and helping staff,” the officer said. “It was decided that as police lines already have adequate infrastructure, small L-1 and L-2 hospitals with isolation facilities can be started there. Hospitals with oxygen-support facility have already been started in Etawah, Kannauj and Jhansi,” he added. The ADG said a coronavirus control centre in each district, to be headed by the SP concerned, would come up soon, while IG and DIG of ranges will also talk to the affected police personnel and their families on a regular basis. Plasma banks may come up in all police lines: Senior police officials at the DGP headquarters said the announcement of establishing a plasma bank in police lines across the state is likely to be made on Saturday. The first such step was taken up by Noida police commissionerate, where a ‘plasma pool’ was created. Plasma of all those who got infected with coronavirus was preserved in the plasma poll which later helped in treatment of people. With all the 75 districts having such a facility, not only the cops but citizens will also benefit from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-police-lines-in-state-to-get-covid-hosp/articleshow/82335729.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Party worker cons kin of Covid patient desperate for ICU bed||Mumbai: A political party worker has been arrested on negligence charges for allegedly taking money from the family of a Covid-positive patient to help get her an ICU bed, but failing to keep his word. The patient subsequently died. Anjanamma Shetty (50) was admitted to a Covid care centre at Worli earlier this month. As her health was dipping, her daughter, Chitra, was looking for an ICU bed with oxygen facility. Chitra learnt from her sister that Shamsu Usmani, who worked at the Bandra office of a political party, helped Covid patients find beds. So on April 16, Chitra and her friend visited Usmani at the office. Usmani allegedly told them that they wouldn’t have to pay for the ICU bed to the hospital, but would have to give him Rs 4.5 lakh. Later that day, Usmani ask-ed Chitra to provide copies of documents like Aadhaar card, besides the cash. Chitra told him that she would pay only after her mother got a bed. But when Usmani insisted on an advance, she paid Rs 50,000 cash. Around 5pm, Anjanamma was wheeled into the emergency ward of Nanavati Hospital in Vile Parle. “Usmani kept demanding for more money. When I iterated that I would pay once we got an ICU bed, he threatened that my mother would have to vacate the emergency ward and her oxygen facility would be taken away. Scared, I paid him Rs 2 lakh,” Chitra said, in her complaint. Around 11pm, doctors in the emergency ward told Chitra that her mother’s condition was deteriorating further and asked her to take her to another hospital as Nanavati did not have any ICU beds available. At this point, Chitra realised that Usmani had duped them. She called him and threatened to go to the police. He turned up around midnight and returned Rs 1.5 lakh. “When I called him for the balance amount the next day, he offered to find an ICU bed in other leading hospitals. He asked for two days’ time, but gave us nothing except excuses,” Chitra said in her complaint. “In the meantime, I paid the emergency ward bill and kept searching for an ICU bed for my mother. Finally on April 18, I found an ICU bed in the same hospital and my mother was admitted. But two days later, she passed away. On April 22, we performed her last rites.” On April 26, Chitra approached Bandra police and an FIR was lodged against Usmani under IPC sections 304(A), 420 and 406. He was later arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-party-worker-cons-kin-of-covid-patient-desperate-for-icu-bed/articleshow/82334576.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Chennai||EC ‘murder charge’: HC rejects plea to gag media||Chennai: The Madras high court on Friday rejected a plea by the Election Commission of India to gag media from reporting oral observations made by judges in courts. “A postmortem into such concern has to wait till we cross the present crisis,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy. The EC’s request came two days after the bench slammed the commission and said it should face ‘murder charges’ for its failure to enforce Covid protocol during election campaigns. The poll panel said media was sensationalising oral observations made by the court against it. Rejecting the plea, the first bench said: “Two aspects cannot be missed: the first is the Union’s endeavour to indicate that the surge in numbers may have been unexpected and that preparatory measures had been taken for quite some time, and the second is the election commission’s concern at sensationalism. The post-mortem on either count may have to wait, particularly in the light of the immediate measures that may be put in place.” The court made the observation on Friday when a suo motu PIL initiated by it to monitor the Tamil Nadu government’s preparedness to tackle the second wave of the pandemic came up for further hearing. “It may also be clarified at this stage that this court does not regard itself to possess the expertise necessary to suggest measures that should be adopted. The object of the exercise is to ensure that the authorities tasked with such obligation devote their complete attention in such regard, so that the measures may be monitored in some degree,” the bench said. The immediate concern is regarding what may happen during vote counting on May 2, the court added. Noting that the role of the political parties cannot be overemphasized, the court said: “The leaders of political parties should ensure that the rank and file maintain a degree of discipline and exercise extreme restraint whether in celebration or otherwise.” The leaders of political parties should keep the supporters in check, ensure that there is no bursting of crackers or taking out of rallies, particularly on the day of counting and till such time that the present grim situation continues. The leaders of political parties are requested to take a proactive stand in such regard and lead by example, the court added. Asking the citizens to exercise a degree of restraint that the state would be best suited to advise on, the bench said, “It also appears that several persons continue to have reservations in taking the vaccine. Drives have to be initiated, whether through public announcements in the lesser towns and rural areas, to encourage people to come out and take the vaccine.” The court then adjourned the plea to May 5 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ec-murder-charge-hc-rejects-plea-to-gag-media/articleshow/82333718.cms||---

"Working on the specific inputs with regard to black marketing of the Remdesivir injection vials, we roped in the crime branch team, led by DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil, who initiated the investigations. A police personnel from the Kakadeo police station became a decoy customer in which he traced one Ayush Kamal, a black-marketeer hailing from Vijay Nagar area of the city” said police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun. A sting operation was conducted and he managed to strike a deal with Kamal for getting a vial for Rs 30,000-Rs 35,000. Subsequently, the police arrested Anshul Sharma, a private hospital worker, Arun said. During interrogation Kamal revealed names of two LLR hospital nursing staff members involved in the racket. He said that the LLR nursing staff Vikram, used to steal Remdevisir injections meant for patients for the hospital and sell them to his staff member Chetansh for Rs 10,000 each. From Chetansh, Anshul, a private hospital worker used to buy each vial for Rs 20,000 and further sell it to him for Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000 per vial, the commissioner said. Police later arrested Vikram and Chetansh besides Ayush, who confessed to their crime, the city police commissioner further said. He said that NSA would be slapped against anyone resorting to black marketing of Remdesivir. "Police are now trying to procure the call detail records of the arrested persons to nab other members of the racket," the commissioner added. With the shortage of Remdevisir in the open market, anti-social elements are leaving no chance to exploit the demand for the drug, and are hoarding it and selling it in the black market. The injection of various brands are being sold in the range of Rs 1000-Rs 3500 in an open market. Not long ago, the commissionerate police had seized 265 Remdesivir injections from the possession of three people, including a Haryana resident in the city's South area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/police-bust-racket-arrest-four-for-selling-remdesivir-in-black-market/articleshow/82334780.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Nagpur||Doctors using anti-cancer drugs to treat Covid +ve||NAGPUR: The repurposed cancer immunotherapeutic agents or the anti-cancer drugs like Tocilizumab, Bevacizumab, Infliximab, Itilozumab and others seems to have become potent weapons for the medical fraternity treating SARS-CoV-2 patients, despite the risk factor associated with them. Though the immuno-suppressant properties have triggered high concern, the medical fraternity still feels that taking calculated risk is better than losing a battle without a fight. Apart from life-saving Tocilizumab, Infliximab, Bevacizumab, Itilozumab, drugs like Baricitinib and Tofacitinib are among the ones that too are the lesser-known experimental therapies in the gamut of the anti-Covid treatments. As per the experts, the use of Tofacitinib with steroids has yielded a higher degree of success so far in many cases. Baricitinib, which was earlier approved to treat Rheumatoid arthritis, has shown reduced inflammation effects by blocking SARS-CoV-2 and saving the cells from its damages. Dr Rajesh Atal, senior physician and attached to Orange City Hospital, said the anti-cancer drugs are basically monoclonal antibodies that acts on the inflammation cascade. “These anti-cancer drugs have a mechanism by which they act on a specific antigen,” he said. Dr Atal said he had been using relatively newer drugs like Tofacitinib. “The extrapolated data of cancer treatment are being used to apply in Covid. These drugs are helping many patients from proceeding to severity from moderate level,” he said. Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease expert, said these anti-cancer drugs are the repurposed ones that have been used with some success. The doctors said the Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a life-threatening inflammatory response, is common in cancer patients. Similar pattern of inflammatory response has been observed in Covid patients. The worldwide studies are being done to ascertain whether the anti-cancer immunotherapies can be extrapolated in Covid treatment too. The doctors also stated that monoclonal antibodies of these drugs are formulated in such a way that they get attached to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 at different locations creating a barrier for it to enter the patient’s cell. Dr Sanjay Jain, director of the Shanti Mohan Hospital, said the anti-cancer drugs are immunomodulators that release cytokine suppressants paving way for their control which in turn helps the Covid patients to overcome the disease. “Using these immuno-suppressants should be done with great caution as they tend to push up the fungal and bacterial infections,” said Dr Jain. According to an experienced pharmacist, doctors have started prescribing Barricitinib and Tofacitinib that are now available in the markets and are in demands. “Doctors are using these new drugs to see their effects. The demand has increased,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-using-anti-cancer-drugs-to-treat-covid-ve/articleshow/82333730.cms||Soumitra Bose

Azamgarh district magistrate Rajesh Kumar said, Akhilesh Yadav’s proposal has been received for installing an oxygen plant and bolstering medical infrastructure at Tarwa Hospital. “The funds would be used to augment healthcare facilities for Covid patients, buying testing kits and procurement of PPEs for doctors and health workers,” he said. Another oxygen plant is being set up at the district hospital with PM CARES Fund. Sadar MLA Durga Prasad Yadav too has offered Rs 25 lakh from his MLALAD fund for buying lifesaving drugs, oxygen, Remdesivir injection and oximeter. The DM claimed currently there was no oxygen shortage in the district. “We have already provided a licence for oxygen production from Liquid Medical Oxygen in March. The unit has a capacity of filling 800 jumbo cylinders per day. Earlier, oxygen was imported from Mau as there no such plant in Azamgarh. Now, the requirement is being fulfilled locally,” the DM said. The number of beds have also been raised by roping in private hospitals and district has 790 beds in three government and three private hospitals. “Both Tarwa and Lalganj hospitals have 100 beds each.

The vaccination programme will be carried out at 15 sites, including 11 government hospitals in the city and four community health centres in rural areas, on Saturday. Additional chief medical officer (ACMO) and district immunization officer, Dr Teerath Lal, told TOI, “On the first day, the department has set a target to administer 3,000 beneficiaries at the 15 sites.” He also said that vaccination of people above the age of 45 years would continue at all 97 sites as usual. Dr Teerath further added that only those persons belonging to the age group of 18 and 45 years who have registered themselves on the CoWIN web portal and taken an appointment for the jab, will be administered the vaccine. No walk-ins/on-site registrations will be entertained for those above 18 and less than 45 years. Those above 45 years of age can still avail the facility of on-site registration to get vaccinated. “We have set a target of 3,000 recipients on the first day. Gradually, we will increase the strength of recipients,” said the ACMO, adding, “The medical and paramedical staff have been assigned duties for the vaccination drive,” he added. So far, over 3.4 lakh Covid vaccine shots have been administered to beneficiaries above 45 years of age at 97 sites in the district. The number of recipients who took only the first jab is thrice the number of those who also took the second jab. Health officials said that the special campaign is starting from Saturday at 15 sites. The 11 sites in the city include SRN hospital, Beli Hospital, TB Hospital, Colvin Hospital, Railway Hospital, Dufferin Hospital, MD Eye Hospital and Daraganj UPHC, where people above 18 years will be eligible to take the vaccine shot as per the protocol of the Union government. As about 60 per cent of the district’s population falls in this age group (between 18 and 45 years), officials said that they would increase the number of recipients in the coming days, and create a database of people in the target age group. Eligible recipients of the district continued their efforts to get themselves registered on the CoWIN web portal. For better management, registering on CoWIN portal and taking prior appointment to get the shot will be mandatory for those aged between 18 and 45 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/around-3000-recipients-between-18-and-45-years-of-age-to-get-first-jab-at-15-sites/articleshow/82334899.cms||---

The man is identified as Jitendra Pratap Singh, and his son identified as Tushar Singh, residents of Kishanpur (Kandhai). Police said that on the complaint of the staff, a case under Sections 323, 504, 353, 188 and 269 of IPC, Section of 7 CLA Act, Sections 3and 4 of Epidemic Act was registered against three persons, including Jitendra Pratap Singh, Tushar Singh and Saumitra Shekhar, all residents of Kishanpur. The trio had left a wardboy, Jai Prakash Yadav, injured during the assault. The incident took place inside Pratapgarh district hospital around 6 am. After a heated exchange between the three attendants of a Covid patient, and the hospital staff over the use of oxygen cylinder, the situation turned uglier as the trio assaulted the staff, leaving a ward boy injured. A group of agitated hospital staff locked the emergency room. Senior administrative and police officials rushed to the hospital campus and pacified the angry staff, assuring that stringent action would be initiated against the errant attendants. The hospital staff alleged that there has been a spate of cases recently when attendants of patients directed their anger on the medical and paramedical staff and even attacked them. Insiders, meanwhile, said that emergency services remained disrupted in the hospital for more than four hours, as the medical and paramedical staff staged a dharna threatening to boycott work. This was the second incident of assault on the hospital staff in 48 hours.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab rules out lockdown, tighter containment strategy in 6 districts||CHANDIGARH: Ruling out a complete lockdown for now, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday directed deputy commissioners (DCs) of the six worst-affected districts to further tighten the micro-containment strategy and ensure 100% testing. “Lockdown is not a solution, as it will lead to an exodus of labourers and force them to go to states with even lesser medical facilities,” said Amarinder, directing the district administrations to enforce all restrictions strictly and to stop dine-in facility in all high positivity areas, with Covid testing of staff in restaurants by the health department. Urging the industry to set up their own Covid treatment centres and makeshift hospitals to treat their labourers suffering from mild/moderate infection, he stressed on teamwork to fight the Covid battle. He also directed the chief secretary to look into encouraging retired doctors and nurses, along with final year MBBS students, to rejoin for handling L2/L3 facilities, and suggested setting up of temporary health care facilities in halls/gymnasiums. Amarinder was chairing a virtual emergency meeting to review the Covid situation in the six worst-hit districts of Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala, and Amritsar. Expressing concern over the fewer number of containment zones in Mohali and two other districts that were among the most badly hit, the CM ordered immediate steps to strengthen the containment and testing mechanism. The micro-containment strategy must be strictly implemented and encouraged, he said, directing all district officers to give this their highest priority to control the spread. He expressed concern over the fact that 14 districts in the state currently had over 10% positivity rate, while five had more than 60% bed occupancy. A prefab 100-bed hospital will come up in Mohali and a 250-bed temporary hospital is being set up near the Bathinda refinery, with oxygen supply from the refinery, he said, urging all departments to be prepared for the peak and identify areas in the various districts for the establishment of temporary hospitals. While the occupancy at level 2 is still manageable, it has already reached 82% in level 3. An additional 2,000 beds are being added in Punjab with 600 beds at GMCH, Patiala, and Amritsar, he said. Taking note of the shortage of “Fateh Kits”, mainly on account of lack of oxymeters, he acceded to the suggestion to request recovered patients to return their oximeters for use in kits after proper sanitisation. Dr K K Talwar, who heads the Covid expert group advising the state government said all hospitals had been provided detailed guidelines to check oxygen wastage. Ludhiana DC Virendra Kumar said the defunct oxygen unit at Vardhman mills had been revived, and so had been another. The district, with positivity standing at 16% as of April 30, was getting a large number of patients from other places, including several from Delhi and Gurgaon, he said. There are currently two containment and eight micro containment zones in the district. Earlier, health secretary Hussan Lal pointed to the rising positivity and case fatality ratio and disclosed that Punjab positivity rate currently stood at 12, with Mohali) reporting the highest at 22.9. Ruling out a complete lockdown for now, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday directed deputy commissioners (DCs) of the six worst-affected districts to further tighten the micro-containment strategy and ensure 100% testing. “Lockdown is not a solution, as it will lead to an exodus of labourers and force them to go to states with even lesser medical facilities,” said Amarinder, directing the district administrations to enforce all restrictions strictly and to stop dine-in facility in all high positivity areas, with Covid testing of staff in restaurants by the health department. Urging the industry to set up their own Covid treatment centres and makeshift hospitals to treat their labourers suffering from mild/moderate infection, he stressed on teamwork to fight the Covid battle. He also directed the chief secretary to look into encouraging retired doctors and nurses, along with final year MBBS students, to rejoin for handling L2/L3 facilities, and suggested setting up of temporary health care facilities in halls/gymnasiums. Amarinder was chairing a virtual emergency meeting to review the Covid situation in the six worst-hit districts of Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala, and Amritsar. Expressing concern over the fewer number of containment zones in Mohali and two other districts that were among the most badly hit, the CM ordered immediate steps to strengthen the containment and testing mechanism. The micro-containment strategy must be strictly implemented and encouraged, he said, directing all district officers to give this their highest priority to control the spread. He expressed concern over the fact that 14 districts in the state currently had over 10% positivity rate, while five had more than 60% bed occupancy. A prefab 100-bed hospital will come up in Mohali and a 250-bed temporary hospital is being set up near the Bathinda refinery, with oxygen supply from the refinery, he said, urging all departments to be prepared for the peak and identify areas in the various districts for the establishment of temporary hospitals. While the occupancy at level 2 is still manageable, it has already reached 82% in level 3. An additional 2,000 beds are being added in Punjab with 600 beds at GMCH, Patiala, and Amritsar, he said. Taking note of the shortage of “Fateh Kits”, mainly on account of lack of oxymeters, he acceded to the suggestion to request recovered patients to return their oximeters for use in kits after proper sanitisation. Dr K K Talwar, who heads the Covid expert group advising the state government said all hospitals had been provided detailed guidelines to check oxygen wastage. Ludhiana DC Virendra Kumar said the defunct oxygen unit at Vardhman mills had been revived, and so had been another. The district, with positivity standing at 16% as of April 30, was getting a large number of patients from other places, including several from Delhi and Gurgaon, he said. There are currently two containment and eight micro containment zones in the district. Earlier, health secretary Hussan Lal pointed to the rising positivity and case fatality ratio and disclosed that Punjab positivity rate currently stood at 12, with Mohali) reporting the highest at 22.9. PU ADVISED NOT TO HOLD SENATE POLLS Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan said Panjab University, Chandigarh had been advised not to hold senate elections at present in view of the grave situation. AMRITSAR DC FLAGS OXYGEN CRISIS Amritsar DC and police commissioner raised concerns over the oxygen crisis, which needed firefighting every day through emergency supplies from other districts via green corridors. Oxygen audits were being done in both government and private hospitals, they said. Medical education minister O P Soni informed the meeting that OPDs in all medical colleges in Amritsar had been closed and staff diverted to Covid duty. 90% BED OCCUPANCY IN MOHALI The worst affected Mohali district was currently showing 90% bed occupancy, the meeting was informed, with DC Girish Dayalan disclosing that a large number of patients had come from Delhi-NCR. With other regions in the Tricity not agreeing to a weekend lockdown, the situation was grim, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-rules-out-lockdown-tighter-containment-strategy-in-6-districts/articleshow/82334573.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Mull segregating patients on symptoms: Punjab and Haryana HC||CHANDIGARH: Considering the alarming situation in the region due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday suggested that Punjab, Haryana, and UT Chandigarh can segregate patients, based on their symptoms, into three categories to manage the current situation. “We have proposed that the categories of patients maybe segregated into three parts, such as critical, mild to moderate and mild and the plan be drawn up accordingly. The counsel representing all the three states assure the court this proposal shall be examined and response given in the next status report to be filed on their behalf,” observed the HC while reviving the hearing of a case related to the Covid-19 pandemic filed by senior advocate Rupinder Khosla, who has been assisting it as an amicus curiae. Covid situation grave, says high courtThe high court has also empowered investigation agencies of both states and Chandigarh as well as the central agencies to take action against those hoarding oxygen and lifesaving medicines. “As regards the issue of hoarding of oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, and essential medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, needless to observe that the respective investigating agencies of all the three states in their own jurisdiction, even central agencies, are at liberty to take cognizance and initiate action,” observed the division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh. Khosla, who had filed a plea for revival of the petition on the current Covid-19 situation in the region, told the HC that a grave situation has arisen in all the three states in view of the non-availability of essential drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Oxygen, ICU beds, ventilators, and oxygen concentrators are in short supply due to which a high number of deaths are being reported. According to him, an impression has percolated to the general public that no help is forthcoming from any quarter. Hearing the contentions raised by the amicus, the high court revived the matter and also issued notice to the Union ministry of health and family welfare and the ministry of home affairs (MHA) seeking response on the issue. Relying on the status reports filed by UT Chandigarh and the Punjab government, the amicus told the HC that it is clear from the two status reports that infrastructure to fight the pandemic is grossly inadequate. “It is almost at its edge and can tilt over any time. Before the situation gets out of hands, the intervention of this court is imperative,” the amicus told the HC. After going through the status reports, the bench observed, “We feel that the situation is indeed grave”. Satya Pal Jain, additional solicitor general of India, who was present during the virtual hearing of the case, informed the HC that a virtual central control room has been set up by the Government of India and if the three states have any difficulty in any of the aforesaid issues, they can get in touch with the control room and the matter would be looked into forthwith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-to-punjab-haryana-ut-consider-segregating-patients-into-three-categories-based-on-symptoms/articleshow/82334566.cms||Ajay Sura

The ward, which includes the western suburbs of Juhu, Vile Parle, Andheri, Jogeshwari and Oshiwara, reported 900 cases on a single day on April 15, but BMC officials said that the lockdown measures seemed to have worked in bringing down the number of positive cases being reported. “We are now reporting between 250-350 cases a day. Looking at the massive case spike, we adopted a holistic approach which included not only increasing the number of Covid care facilities in the ward through community participation, but also a check on those who were in home quarantine. We started conducting yoga sessions via Zoom App for patients where all those in our Covid care centres and patients in home quarantine could also join in. In such times, physical and mental well-being are both important and we hoped to boost this through yoga,” said assistant municipal commissioner of K-West ward, Vishwas Mote, adding that they were also planning to hold post-Covid recovery sessions also with patients. Shirish Sanghavi, director of Mukta -The Wellness Clinic which has started this free initiative said, “We have been teaching patients various breathing exercises. The response has been very good. Nearly 60-70 participants join in the one-hour session held in the morning and evening,” he said. Civic representatives said WhatsApp groups started with authorities also worked to bring down the graph. They say people would post requests for hospital beds on these groups. Ameet Satam, MLA from Andheri, said as the case numbers went up, the demand for hospital beds also shot sharply. “We then decided to form a WhatsApp group of the 13 corporators and MLAs through which requests for beds were immediately put out and the ward war room or the officials concerned could act accordingly,” said Satam, adding that they are also in the process of augmenting the capacity of oxygen beds in the ward and 25 beds should be up and functioning at Ritambhara College in JVPD Scheme in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lockdown-curbs-help-bend-the-curve-in-andheri-juhu/articleshow/82335850.cms||Richa Pinto

Hemlata Agarwal, 42, succumbed to the disease on Thursday, hours after she was admitted. District magistrate (DM) of Mathura, Navneet Singh Chahal, has marked an inquiry against the KD Medical College, a private hospital empaneled by the district administration. “Strict action will be taken against the hospital,” he told TOI, adding that it's shocking that the hospital is “not missing any chance to overcharge patients during the crisis of pandemic”. The hospital was initially refusing to pay back any amount from the Rs 6.75 lakhs deposited by the family at the time of admitting the patient. The audio of the conversation purportedly between the doctor and the patient’s family member seeking a refund of Rs 6.75lakh charged by the hospital went viral on social media. Later, the hospital authorities returned Rs 3lakh to the grieving family. When contacted, KD Hospital’s owner Manoj Agarwal, told TOI that he has also heard about the audio recording of Dr Bhalla, who is in-charge of Anaesthesia in his hospital and he was inquiring about the incident. “At present, Dr Bhalla is in Delhi and I will talk to him once he will be here.” He told TOI that Covid-19 patients are being provided treatment at government prescribed rates. Hemlata’s brother-in-law Ashok Agarwal told TOI that the patient was not admitted by the hospital till he deposited Rs 6 lakh at the reception counter. He added that the hospital authorities even refused to provide an ambulance for transporting the body to the cremation ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/private-hospital-in-mathura-charges-rs3-7lakh-for-a-days-treatment-of-covid-patient-she-dies-later/articleshow/82333763.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Agra||Army, IAF help set up new O2 plant in Agra||AGRA: In order to address the shortage of medical oxygen in Agra district caused by the huge surge in Covid-19 cases, the Army and Indian Air Force (IAF) helped the district administration to set up a new oxygen plant in the city, which became operational on Friday at 1:05 am. Distribution started in the afternoon with the disbursement of 1,000 cylinders. The plant was set up in seven days in the Tedi Bagiya locality on Jalesar road here and has the capacity to fill large-size 1500 “D- type” medical oxygen cylinders a day. Each cylinder has a capacity of 10 cubic metres of oxygen. Officials indicated that the capacity could be increased in future. For a district with an estimated daily demand of 70 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen a day by medical facilities alone, the opening of the new plant has come as a relief. Till now, the city was getting about 25 MT a day. During the pre-Covid days, maximum demand ranged between 15 and 20 MT. Talking with TOI, Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh, who has been in the forefront of getting the plant set up, said, “Following help of the Army, Air Force and local authorities in Ahmedabad, we managed to set up the air-to-oxygen plant and began public supply within seven days. On the first day of production, 1,000 oxygen cylinders were supplied from the facility. We will be increasing the production in the coming days. The new plant will help in filling the gap between demand and supply for medical oxygen.” Singh added, “As much as 60% of the oxygen produced in the plant will be supplied to hospitals. People can also take away the oxygen cylinders from the plant after showing a doctor’s prescription. It will help us to better serve the Covid-19 patients in home isolation. A dedicated team of officials has been deployed at the centre to look after operations of the plant and ensure hassle-free supply of oxygen cylinders,” he said. Ideally, it would have taken at least a month to set up the plant. But DM Singh ensured that the power connection and required “no objection certificates” from different agencies were available within 24 hours. Singh sought the help of his counterpart in Ahmedabad, Sandip J. Sagale, for handling logistics and necessary permissions for time-bound delivery of the crucial components required to set up the plant. The Indian Air Force supplied the intercooler copper tube bundle and other components of the plant, which were airlifted from Ahmedabad on April 29. The Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME) corps of the Army helped in the installation of the oxygen production plant, which was ready within 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/army-iaf-help-set-up-new-o2-plant-in-agra/articleshow/82333747.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nair hospital sees more deaths of pregnant women in second wave||Mumbai: The BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central has seen a higher number of deaths among Covid-positive pregnant women in the second wave compared with the previous year. Data shows the hospital, the city’s main referral centre for Covid-positive pregnant women, has already recorded 26 deaths this year compared with 12 fatalities between April and December last year. A senior doctor said the mortality rate that was around 0.2% last year has increased to more than 0.8%. “We being a referral centre tend to get critical cases, but there has been a rise in deaths. A few have lost their babies too,” the doctor said, adding most have been in women aged between 25-35 years. “The deaths have been caused by complications of lungs, kidneys and even brain triggered by the infection. There were no deaths due to obstetric reasons,” the doctor added. Another doctor said they have encountered cases where the mother was largely asymptomatic till the seventh or eighth day, but suddenly collapsed with a drop in oxygen saturation. Nair has attended to more than 1,500 positive women since last April when it became an exclusive Covid facility. Till now, it has done deliveries of over 1,000 women, including 400 via C-section. In all, there have been 38 deaths in expectant mothers. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean, Nair Hospital, confirmed more deaths and called it “worrying”. “One of the main reasons is delay in coming to us. We found many waited at home and came to us after turning serious. There were also those who went to one to two hospitals before they were referred here,” he said, adding many were from MMR. Sion Hospital that also conducts deliveries, though, has cut down on work since the labour ward is under renovation. Gynaecology head Dr Arun Nayak said they have carried out only 40 deliveries this year and there haven’t been any deaths so far. Doctors at Cama and Albless Hospital, dedicated for women and children, too said they haven’t had any maternal mortalities, but the oxygen requirement appeared to be higher. Medical superintendent Dr Tushar Palve said unlike last year, shortness of breath is seen in a slightly higher number of patients. “The majority of them are asymptomatic. But among those who have symptoms and breathing difficulty, the requirement of oxygen is more,” he said. Gynaecologist Dr Nikhil Datar said women in their second half of pregnancy already have a compromised respiratory reserve. “Dilemmas of whether or not to give drugs like Remdesivir remain,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nair-hospital-sees-more-deaths-of-pregnant-women-in-second-wave/articleshow/82333775.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In a video message that went viral, Mahavar alleged authorities didn't allow her to go to hospital and forced her to stay at the polling booth. After the video went viral, police shifted her to a nearby community health centre.Case 2: Vivek Shukla, a 36-year-old inter college teacher in Rae Bareli, attended poll training on April 10. Soon after he came home, he complained of dizziness, cough and fever. When his family took him to the district hospital, he was asked to quarantine himself at home. On April 25, his condition worsened and his oxygen level dropped to 60. By evening, he died leaving behind his wife and two children, who are 12 and 8 years old.LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Shikshak Sangh convener Hem Singh Pundir said, “Before deploying teachers for panchayat poll duty, the state government didn’t even think it was important to get them vaccinated.” As per the list curated by the association, 706 primary teachers lost their lives after the third phase of panchayat polls. While Rae Bareli district condoled the death of 25 teachers, tributes were offered to 20 teachers in Lucknow. “There’s not a single district where teachers have not fallen prey to Covid-19 after being deployed on poll duty. Each day, numbers are rising. During training, one can see over 50 teachers together. Physical distancing has gone for a toss at polling booths too. There are viral pictures of teachers being ferried on trucks to polling centres. There is total chaos. Nobody knows who is Covid positive and who is not,” said Sanjay Shukla, a primary teacher. Another teacher’s association, Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, has written to the chief minister and state election commissioner demanding “proper arrangements” for maintaining Covid protocols at counting centres. “We want Covid-19 protocols in place before the counting of votes is done. The government should get Covid tests done for all teachers deployed on duty. Only in cases where teachers test negative should they be deployed for counting. Sanitisation of counting centres should be done after each box is counted,” said Om Pal Singh, secretary of the association. “Boycotting the counting of votes is our last resort,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-election-duty-teachers-poignant-video-goes-viral/articleshow/82335858.cms||Isha Jain

Senior superintendent of Mathura jail, Shailendra Maitrey, said, “Kappan was taken to AIIMS in an ambulance on Friday morning. A jail doctor and deputy jailor were also with him.” On Wednesday, the apex court had directed the state government to shift Kappan to Delhi for treatment after his medical reports revealed that he had multiple health issues like diabetes, heart ailment, blood pressure, and bodily injury. Kappan had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to a Mathura hospital for over a week. He was later taken back to Mathura prison after he tested negative. Meanwhile, Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) has demanded that Solicitor General Tushar Mehta withdraw his “baseless statement” made about the union in the Supreme Court and publicly apologize for it. Mehta, during the hearing of Kappan’s case, had stated in the court that “this is a purported association of journalists, not even a well-known one. When this person was arrested, he was carrying a card of a newspaper called ‘Tejas’ which hasn’t functioned for years.” Kappan was arrested on October 5 last year when he was going to a Hathras village from Delhi to report the alleged gang-rape and murder of the Dalit girl. Three others including a driver were also arrested with him. Later they were accused of trying to foment disturbance and booked under stringent charges of sedition and UAPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kerala-journalist-siddique-kappan-shifted-to-aiims-delhi-from-mathura-prison/articleshow/82333777.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to the FIR, the incident occurred between January 22 and 28 this year. On January 22, the complainant, Abhijit Kingsinghe of Bibvewadi, received a call. The callers, claiming to be officials from a private insurance company in Delhi, asked to speak to his father in connection with a refund of a central government insurance scheme. When Kingsinghe replied that his father was no more, the caller convinced him to initiate the process of claiming the refund, worth Rs3,40,750. Police said the suspects told him to transfer Rs 7,120 via net banking for a no-objection certificate to claim the refund. Without verifying the callers’ credentials, Kingsinghe transferred money from his mother’s bank account. Kingsinghe stated in his complaint that the suspects called him again on January 25, this time asking him to transfer a refundable deposit of Rs 2.16 lakh. He transferred the money, again from his mother’s account. Kingsinghe made a third transfer, of Rs1.58 lakh, before he realised he had been cheated — his mother never received the “refund”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/callers-float-insurance-refund-bait-dupe-man-of-rs-4-74-lakh/articleshow/82333844.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Some Nagpur University colleges forcing students to appear for offline exams||NAGPUR: Scores of Nagpur University (NU) students are in a quandary as a few colleges are allegedly forcing them to appear in offline examinations amid rising number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities. They have taken up the issue on social media in a big way demanding NU officials to direct their managements not to force them for offline exams. The aggrieved students, particularly postgraduate, external and backlog students, claimed that colleges were also inviting them for filling up forms, depositing exam fees and for submitting practical worksheets. Others offering a residential programme in engineering said many of them hail from other states and cities and it would be very difficult for them to come to Nagpur just for exams and risk their lives. “Even our parents are apprehensive about sending us. Even if we’re asked to stay in hostels inside the campus, the teachers would be coming daily, thus risking them of the disease. In hostels, we use common toilets and even in the mess, we sit together, which is again risky,” they said. Coming to their support, Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA) warned the colleges of lodging a complaint with chancellor BS Koshyari, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and higher and technical education minister Uday Samant if they forced the examinees to appear in exams from their premises. “When the minister has clearly stated that all university exams should be held online, there’s no point in calling them to colleges in these conditions. Who will take guarantee of their safety?” MSWA president Vaibhav Edke asked. Endorsing him, social activist-cum-influencer Shashank Gattewar said NU should initiate strict action against such erring colleges for putting the students’ lives at risk. “Last year too, one such institute had made it mandatory for the students to appear offline. It was only after the issue was raised in the media that they changed their decision.” Board of Examinations and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable said the NU circular was clear that all colleges had to conduct online exams through Google forms or other platforms. “It’s impossible for the students to reach the exam centre in curfew. The students should clearly say no to colleges if they’re pressing them for offline papers in this situation. We will probe into the students’ allegations,” he said. Asked colleges not to invite students: VC Vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari told TOI that the colleges were clearly asked to conduct online papers of all students and only those, particularly from the rural areas where connectivity was the issue, can opt for offline mode. He said he had contacted one of the colleges and asked them not to invite students till the end of current crisis. “They told me that they had only called on failure students to appear in practical exam. But after my call, they agreed to conduct everything online.” The VC said the situation wasn’t conducive for offline papers and the colleges should allow students to appear in exams from home. “I will talk to the heads of colleges concerned on this issue. In case where practical is must, they can defer those till the current situation normalizes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-nu-colleges-forcing-students-to-appear-for-offline-exams/articleshow/82332428.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

UP Shikshak Mahasangh president Dinseh Chandra Sharma told TOI, "They (the government) are not at all bothered that we lost 706 teachers due to elections duty. The number could increase. After a final meeting, we have decided to strike work that day. They can take any decision they want. The lives of the teachers are more important than anything else."He added: “Nearly 75% of polling staff are teachers. How can they work inside the polling room where chances of getting infected are higher. Unlike policemen, teachers were not covered under the initial vaccination drive." The unions claim to have more than 60,000 teachers with them. Spokesperson of Akhil Bharatiya Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, Virendra Mishra, said, “This decision was taken on the call of teachers as we were flooded with requests to save their lives. They are very scared. Experts have said that Covid’s peak will arrive in May."" All of us will boycott election duty if it is not postponed.” Leaders of Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh were also present in the meeting. Ankur Tripathi, another union leader, has approached National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) against the state election commission. He alleged that teachers were forced to work in hazardous conditions and their lives were put at risk.On Tuesday, the Allahabad HC had sent a notice to the state election commission seeking explanation on Covid preparedness and the alleged deaths of teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/60k-teachers-to-skip-may-2-counting-of-votes-in-rural-polls/articleshow/82333807.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Ahmedabad||AMC installs O2 tank, another coming up||AHMEDABAD: The AMC has set up a 13 kilolitre oxygen tank in Behrampura, which is expected to start supply this weekend. The corporation is also installing another tank, of 20 kilolitre capacity, at the same spot. AMC officials said the corporation has applied for permission to supply oxygen. Once government gives its nod, the AMC will begin supply to hospitals in case of emergencies. The AMC’s move comes when the demand for oxygen has spiked at hospitals across the city. The 13kL oxygen tank in Behrampura can refill 1,200 oxygen cylinders a day. Officials said this facility will be for hospitals that fail to get their regular supply or face emergencies. At present, the city has 14 supply units from which hospitals can refill their oxygen tanks. A joint control room to regulate the supply of oxygen has been set up at Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited office. With Food and Drugs Control Administration and Gujarat Pollution Control Board, the AMC has managed to secure 1,640 cylinders that can be used to supply liquid medical-grade oxygen. The officials said that a group of 250-plus private hospitals, nursing homes, and other Covid facilities has been formed. Regular updates are taken every four hours to ensure that there is no short supply of oxygen at any facility. The AMC has also ensured the deployment of an official round the clock at each of these 14 facilities and the person’s job is to facilitate smooth operations. If a hospital sends a distress message on the group that a vehicle will arrive at a particular time for refilling, the official at the site is contacted and priority filling is done for the vehicle. An officer said that if a hospital reports that the oxygen supply cannot last even till the vehicle returns after refilling, the control room gives 10 cylinders from its emergency quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-installs-o2-tank-another-coming-up/articleshow/82333825.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Patna||95% Covid patients don’t need hospitalisation, says Doctors||PATNA: Amid scarcity of beds in government and private hospitals, doctors and healthcare experts have suggested certain ways to fight the disease without hospitalisation. They said 95% Covid patients can be cured at home if the virus is detected at the right time. State IMA senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said many people are getting admitted in hospitals even if they need mild oxygen. “Such patients can be cured at home. Their hospitalisation is hampering treatment of people whose blood oxygen level is below 90%,” he said. “Utmost rest can cure severe complications. Asymptomatic positive patients should take anti-allergic medicines, vitamin supplements and Paracetamol tablet on doctor’s advice. Self-monitoring of blood oxygen level is also important,” Dr Ajay added. He said respiratory exercises along with prone ventilation (lying in face-down position with the chest raised) should also be done. “It improves oxygenation and reduces the chance of hospitalisation. In prone ventilation position, heart rests on the chest bone and gives space to the lungs to expand which eventually increases the blood circulation and number of breaths,” he added. Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said most Covid cases can be managed at home with appropriate guidelines. “Covid patients should monitor their oxygen saturation level at regular intervals. When blood oxygen level dips below 94%, they can start prone ventilation as it increases the oxygen saturation level. Right time for hospitalisation is when the patient starts facing breathing issues, high grade fever and failure in maintaining oxygen saturation despite prone ventilation or if the HR-CT scan of chest shows significant lung infection,” he added. S N Dubey, manager of a private hospital at Patliputra, said, “Despite deaths happening due to Covid, we have seen people recovering from this deadly virus and going back home. We are discharging approximately 2-3 patients on a daily basis, when they no longer need oxygen beds or ventilators.” Sunita Agarwal (35), a homemaker from Fraser Road, said, “My father is a Covid survivor. When his blood oxygen level went below 95%, we somehow arranged the oxygen cylinder at home and avoided going to hospital as it is risky. As my father didn’t have severe infection, he recovered at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/95-covid-patients-dont-need-hospitalisation-docs/articleshow/82315630.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Covid surge overwhelms Level III facilities in Pb||Chandigarh: With the second wave of Covid-19 overwhelming the available health infrastructure, Punjab is staring at possible shortage of beds at the Level III facilities having intensive care units (ICUs) and oxygen support systems. Like many states in the country, Punjab is going through the worst phase of the pandemic with the number of new infections skyrocketing. As the surge shows no signs of abating, pressure on already stress limited resources will mount in the coming days, hampering the state’s response. As per the hospital occupancy report, about 85% of ICUs and 50% of oxygen beds were occupied till the noon of April 30. Out of 2,036 ICU beds — 550 in government and 1,486 in private hospitals — only 309 were available: 10 in government and 299 in private. The state has a total of 8,871 beds fitted with oxygen supply, of which 4,514 were available. Due to the rise in the number of new patients getting critically ill, the occupancy of ICUs and oxygen beds has gone up recently. Sample this: A total of 67 new patients required ICU support on April 29, the number of which was 20 on April 28, 40 on April 27 and 13 on April 26. As on April 29, as many as 648 patients were on oxygen support. Maximum occupancy of Level III facilities has been reported in districts reporting heavy caseload that include Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala and Bathinda. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar shared that the state government has decided to increase the number of Level III beds in all the medical colleges and the private hospitals have also been asked to enhance their existing capacity. There are about 200 private hospitals that are supporting the government in the fight against the pandemic. Besides, there is a plan to increase the count of Level II beds in all the districts hospitals. “The situation is being monitored on a real-time basis and the bed capacity is being enhanced accordingly,” said Dr Bhaskar. Districts Without Level III Beds Eight districts — Barnala, Fazilka, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Mansa, Ropar, Sangrur and Muktsar — without any Level III facilities. Of these districts, there has been a considerable rise in the number of Covid deaths in Gurdaspur, Sangrur, Muktsar and Fazilka. Neck-and-Neck With a steep rise in patients requiring oxygen support, the daily medical oxygen consumption has touched 222 MT while the daily availability is about 227 MT. Of the total, the central government’s allocation is 177 MT and the state’s own sources contribute 50 MT. Anticipating a rise in demand, the Punjab government has written to the Union government for enhancing its allocation. Of total available oxygen, a maximum of 60 MT is being consumed in Ludhiana, 32 MT in Jalandhar, 29 MT in Mohali, 26 MT in Amritsar, 24 MT in Patiala and 17 MT in Bathinda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-surge-overwhelms-level-iii-facilities-in-pb/articleshow/82334621.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four months after dismantling Covid centre, BMC to rebuild at Rs 45 crore||MUMBAI: After dismantling the 900-bed jumbo Covid centre at Mahalaxmi Racecourse without admitting a single patient there, BMC will now build a new Covid centre at the same location. While the earlier one was built using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, BMC will spend around Rs 45 crore on the new centre. BMC floated tenders for the new centre that will have 200 ICU beds and 250 oxygen beds.TimesViewIt’s a good move that the BMC is setting up more jumbo Covid centres. These centres have proven to be a game-changer in the city’s fight against Covid-19. However, BMC must ensure that all existing jumbo centres are fully utilised and capacity is not wasted. There is no point in creating new centres when existing ones are lying vacant. If they are constructed, they should be fully used and not turned into white elephants.The old centre had 900 beds spread over 4 waterproof hangars. Officials said three hangars had 700 regular beds that were dismantled first in December. Later, one hangar that had 200 oxygen-supported beds was kept on standby but later dismantled. The BMC is now facing flak from the opposition for poor planning and having to spend Rs 45 crore for a new centre in place of the one it dismantled just four months ago. The Mahalaxmi Covid facility, complete with oxygen support, was handed over to the BMC in July. But the centre, built by the Naman Group, remained unutilised as nearby facilities, particularly NSCI Dome and BYL Nair Hospital, could absorb the patient load. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said that the BMC should spend the money to instal ICUs at Byculla’s Richardson and Cruddas centre. “BMC has once again failed in planning and is on a spending spree. These tenders are rigged, and tender conditions have been drafted in such a way as to favour certain contractors who built jumbo centres last year. Now the city has a new cartel of jumbo centre contractors,” Shaikh said. Additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal said that the centre was being built by the BMC. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said shutting down the centre without using it was a waste of public money. “Even if it is CSR funds, it was money meant for the public. This shows lack of planning and poor coordination by BMC. The centre should have been used when cases were peaking and there was a huge shortage of beds. Hundreds of people were dying every day but this centre was only used for publicity. And now again they will spend Rs 45 crore. By the time the centre is ready, it may not be needed again,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-mths-after-dismantling-covid-centre-bmc-to-rebuild-at-rs-45cr/articleshow/82335902.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The Congress has launched helplines on social media to arrange beds, Oxygen and injections for Covid patients. On Friday, Haryana BJP claimed to have arranged 426 Oxygen concentrators for Covid-affected districts of the state. Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda has started a special platform called “Team Deepender” to provide assistance and help on the messages received on social media platforms. Leaders of both parties are repeatedly sending out messages on social media platforms about their services. “There is no politics behind this. This is basically service to mankind. We did the same last year by providing food, masks and sanitiser bottles. Now, our teams have made efforts to arrange oxygen concentrators to give back-up support to hospitals as well as those in home isolation,’’ said Haryana BJP president Om Parkash Dhankar, adding that the party contribution is other than arrangements made by the government. Haryana Congress media coordinator Nilay Saini said, “This is the time of national crisis. Being an opposition party, we are keeping an eye on the government and its activities but this campaign is to help out those in distress. We have even got call from those associated with other parties.’’ Help from USA Haryana health minister Anil Vij said 250 oxygen concentrators are being sent to Haryana by the US India Foundation. In the first phase, 112 oxygen concentrators will be sent to Haryana. Vij said he has spoken to the Union minister of Aviation, Hardeep Puri to get these oxygen concentrators from the US and he has given his consent to get the concentrators airlifted from the US at no cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-pandemic-bjp-cong-leaders-vie-with-each-other-to-provide-help/articleshow/82334656.cms||Manvir Saini

The woman, in her complaint, accused the man of first raping her at her house in 2019. He had secretly recorded their video and then repeatedly raped her by threatening to make it public, she said. “The woman registered a police complaint when she found out that the suspect had posted a screenshot of the video on a social media platform,” said an officer from the Chatushrungi police station. The officer said, “The woman stated in her complaint that the man had been stalking her since she was 15 years old. He even had forced her to come along with him and demanded sexual favours from her.” He said in 2019, when the complainant was alone at her home, the suspect forcibly entered the apartment and raped her. “He had secretly recorded the act. He later repeatedly raped her by threatening to show the video to her mother and make the clip public,” the officer said. According to the woman, the suspect also had threatened her friend and posted the screenshot on the social media, the officer added.  “We have booked the suspect under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act,” the officer said.

Gujarat is facing an acute demand-supply gap of medical oxygen as cases of Covid-19 patients requiring oxygen continue to pile up across hospitals in the state. According to top government sources, the demand for medical oxygen in the state has reached between 1,150 and 1,200 metric tonnes daily. “This means that we are today facing a shortfall of between 150 MT and 200 MT of medical oxygen. The state government has introduced strict medical oxygen audit measures to ensure there is no wastage. Prevention of losses during transportation and handling will increase availability of resources,” said a source in the government. In addition, hospitals have been asked to rationalise the use of oxygen for optimum gain. Local district authorities have also been asked to source oxygen requirements from local unorganized suppliers, who do not come under the purview of the present central government regulations. Sources further said that fortunately, there is no drastic increase in medical oxygen demand over the past three days and the government expects the demand to stabilize now. “If there is a marked increase in demand for medical oxygen, we will have to make a representation to the central government, but we hope demand will further reduce in the next couple of days,”said sources. The peak demand for medical oxygen was seen around Diwali last year, when the requirement rose to 220 tonnes per day. Until March 15, the maximum medical oxygen demand hovered around 150 MT mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-daily-oxygen-shortfall-reaches-200mt/articleshow/82333874.cms||Kapil Dave

The city’s daily positivity rate (PR) has dropped 50% — from 20.8% on April 1 to 9.9% on April 30 — giving hope that the second wave could be ebbing. Experts said the infection continues to rage in the rest of Maharashtra with Nagpur, Nashik and Thane showing a positivity of more than 30%. Daily PR, statewide, remains as high as 23%, declining by barely 2% in the last 30 days. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said Mumbai was perhaps the only city in India with such a low PR at present. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray endorsed the view that curbs had helped reduce cases. The city’s daily positivity had dropped under 5%. April began in the city with a 21% PR that rose to a high of 28% on April 4. A civic official said the drop to single digit has come about after 45 days. The last time the city’s positivity rate was below 9.94% was on March 13, when it stood at 9.62%. In comparison, Delhi had a PR of 32.82% on Thursday. Neighbouring Pune city’s positivity too was 26.6%. Ward officials said one of the reasons for the dip is a drop in number of index cases. Even wards like M west (Chembur) that were first to see the surge are seeing a dip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mumbais-covid-positivity-rate-drops-to-9-9-from-20-8-on-april-1/articleshow/82336986.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kochi||Consider ‘red button’ in train coaches: Kerala HC to govt, railways||KOCHI: The high court, on Friday, registered a suo motu case over a woman passenger having to jump off a train to escape robbery and rape. Considering the case, justice Bechu Kurian Thomas asked the government and railway authorities to consider measures to ensure safety of passengers, including installation of an emergency ‘red button’ in each train compartment. The state police chief and principal chief security commissioner of Southern Railway should hold a meeting and suggest measures for ensuring safe travel of rail passengers in Kerala and it should be informed to the court within six weeks, the bench directed. The principal chief security commissioner (PCSC) of Southern Railway was made a party in the case by the court. Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy had submitted that a ‘red button system’, by which a passenger in distress can directly communicate to the guard or to the control room by pushing a button installed in each coach, is required and it is railways that has to act. Government Railway Police (GRP) had contacted PCSC several times raising the need for installing CCTV cameras in all relevant stations. Computer-aided dispatch system, in which a commuter can dial 119 and a location-enabled message will be sent to the railway beat police, is also being planned, the court was told. Railways has also been informed about the need to change standalone coaches or ‘cut’ coaches, which prevents police on trains from coming to the aid of a woman passenger in distress, the senior prosecutor had submitted. Look out notice issued With police yet to arrest Babukuttan, the man accused of robbing and assaulting the woman in Mulanthuruthy on Wednesday, a lookout notice was issued across the state on Friday to locate him. Though railway police strengthened the manhunt in different places, including his native place in Nooranad, Alappuzha, they are yet to get any leads. “We have passed the information about the accused to all stations and a special team comprising of 20 officers, including a deputy SP, is hunting him. We have already checked the places which he usually visits. We hope to arrest him soon,” said police sources. The lookout notice featuring the photograph of the accused has been disseminated across the state. The accused has a defect in one of his eyes and the police highlight this to identify him. GRP has already registered a case invoking relevant sections of IPC, including 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery). Meanwhile, the survivor of the attack is recuperating in a city hospital and her condition is said to be stable. Hospital sources said that though she is yet to recover from the mental shock of the incident, there was nothing to worry. The incident pertaining to the case happened on Wednesday around 8.45am shortly after the clerk at the higher secondary regional office in Chengannur boarded Punalur Express from Mulanthuruthy station. According to her statements, she was alone in the compartment and when the train departed, the accused came in, assaulted and robbed her. When he dragged her by hair to the washroom she made a bid to escape by jumping out of the door.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consider-red-button-in-train-coaches-hc-to-govt-railways/articleshow/82333888.cms||---

Adani Foundation, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of the group, will convert the Adani Vidya Mandir school campus into a supportive care facility for Covid-19 positive patients. “Our Adani Vidya Mandir school in Ahmedabad will be converted by the Adani Foundation into a covid care centre with oxygen support and other medical amenities,” tweeted Gautam Adani, chairman, Adani Group. Through the Adani Vidya Mandir Covid care centre, the Adani Foundation will provide patient beds, nutritious food, and medical care. The conversion process involves arranging accommodation and resting units for both patients and medical personnel, setting up technical facilities to provide medical oxygen, medical supplies and monitoring systems. Adani teams will also put in place the registration, reporting and security protocols required by the government, the city administration and state health authorities. The facility aims to lighten the load on the city’s government and private health infrastructure. It will take care of those who are isolated from their families. This isolation facility will also protect their other family members and contribute to slowing down the spread of Covid-19. “We expect to leverage our group’s execution experience in rapidly putting up the infrastructure at the Adani Vidya Mandir. We will convert our school’s halls of learning into halls of life – from vidya-daan to jeevan-daan,” Adani Foundation said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adani-group-to-set-up-covid-care-centre/articleshow/82333885.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Modi to blame for snags in vaccine drive: Congress, NCP||MUMBAI: Both Congress and NCP on Friday came down heavily on the NDA government, saying the much publicised vaccination drive has failed to take off owing to the inability of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide vaccines across the country.  “Modi must accept responsibility. He had declared the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group, but the NDA government has failed to provide vaccines,” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. Malik said while talks on providing vaccines were on for a long time, complete absence of planning derailed the drive. “Modi must explain to the nation why there was a delay. The state BJP leadership too failed to pressurise the NDA government for securing adequate quantity of vaccines,” Malik said. Congress spokesman Sachin Sawant echoed Malik. “Modi must accept responsibility. The NDA government has miserably failed to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, a blame game is on and BJP is trying to shift responsibility,” he said. Sawant said a week ago, the NDA government had declared it would launch the biggest ever vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group from May 1, and it asked state governments to set up infrastructure for the purpose. “Our government is ready with infrastructure and manpower, but there are no vaccines. Unfortunately, the plan will have to be abandoned in the absence of vaccines. There is absolutely no planning,” Sawant said. Sawant pointed out that at a juncture when the vaccination drive has been launched on a war footing across the world, Modi has not learnt any lessons. “We are paying a heavy price as there is a huge spurt in Covid deaths. While we have not been able to launch the drive for younger people, even vaccination for 45+ age category has come to a grinding halt due to non-availability of vaccines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-ncp-slam-modi-for-problems-in-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82335937.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Interestingly, it was also the retirement day of the RDO, C Lathika. She laid down her office after handing over Rs 60,000 to the ailing elderly woman, Kalyani, who was staying in a dilapidated house at Irinjalakuda. Kalyani’s husband Kuttan and elder son Jayakumar had passed away earlier, while the younger son Thadhayan, who was staying separately, also had some health issues and severe financial constraints. Kalyani was managing her routines on her own till recently and was surviving with her son’s support. However she fractured her leg following a fall at her home two months ago. She was bed-ridden after that and her condition was brought to Lathika’s notice by one of her relatives. Lathika immediately directed Marshal C Radhakrishnan who is a technical assistant with the social justice department, to find out about Kalyani’s condition. It was then that Radhakrishnan found out that Thadhayan’s son Sachin, an autorickshaw driver, was supporting Kalyani with his limited income and she was also getting a meagre amount as old age pension. Based on his report, Lahtika directed that Kalyani be shifted to Santhi Sadanam old age home at Irinjalakuda and that steps be taken for her treatment. Sister Merlin who was in charge of Santhi Sadanam took Kalyani to a doctor and was informed that at least Rs 60,000 would be required for the surgery and treatment. Since Kalyani did not have the amount, Lathika offered the help. “I helped her just like her own daughter. Suppose our own mother is facing such a pathetic predicament, what would we do,” Lathika asked. The surgery will be carried out in a couple of days, if her health permits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribunal-head-offers-help-to-treat-ailing-woman/articleshow/82333926.cms||T Ramavarman

As of now, only theory exams were being conducted online and practical examinations for both semester I and II were supposed to be held after the end of semester I examinations which started on April 10. The university has estimated that the colleges will not be able to reopen for another two months. Students cannot be given the final mark sheet without calculating practical marks and without the final mark sheet they would not be able to apply for higher studies of jobs. Hence, SPPU officials have suggested that practicals be uploaded online in a centralised manner and students be allowed time to go through each. Students may be told to appear for an online viva/assignment/task on the basis of which their practical marks may be calculated. The suggestion from SPPU’s Board of Studies needs to be approved by both the Board of Deans and the Board of Examination.Sanjay Chakane, principal, Arts Science Commerce College, Indapur said, “We have told the dean of science faculty to have their best teachers design and perform the practicals required in each year. These will be shot either in the university or at colleges that have good studios. The entire process will be explained and queries covered. This will then be uploaded on the learning management system software and all students can see how these practicals are performed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-to-award-marks-for-practicals-from-online-viva/articleshow/82333898.cms||Ardhra Nair

The police said that the woman (38) and the duo lived in the same area and knew each other. “Some local residents said the youth, Sainath Randive, and his minor friend are in the habit of creating nuisance by loitering late at night, engaging in mischief, drinking alcohol and stealing petrol from vehicles,” senior inspector Yunus Shaikh said on Friday. “Fed up with their behaviour, the woman had urged social activist Sachin Dhiwar to counsel and convince them not to cause inconveniences for the residents,” the officer said. “As news spread that the woman had spoken to Dhiwar about the duo, they poured petrol on her car and torched it. They caused damage to the tune of Rs3 lakh,” he said.

---||Nagpur||Some ‘connected’ patients, some serious ones finally get Tocilizumab injection||NAGPUR: One each of the highly in demand Tocilizumab injection was given to 63 Covid hospitals on Friday, most of them within the city and it’s periphery, with only one dose going to Umred’s Archeangle Hospital in the rural areas. Even after this, some patients with high-level connections got access to this injection over deserving cases, while some hospitals have kept the drug in reserve for now. At Rs41,700 per injection, the cost symbolises the high-profile chase for the drug. Sources alleged strong lobbying by politicians and other influential persons had influenced the distribution and also administration of the drug at various levels. Though Gondia (6), Gadchiroli (3), Wardha (5) and Bhandara (10) got only a handful of doses, Chandrapur’s quota of 21 left many surprised. It’s learnt a political person was behind it, just like the quota of 30,000 Remdesivir injections sent to Jalna district. Some hospital sources claimed the ‘political’ game had started even before the drug had arrived on their premises. “We had got calls from many influential persons to influence our decision to administer the drug,” said a hospital source. Another hospital source said the personal secretary of a politician had called up asking for the Tocilizumab injection, which the management decided to hand over to avoid any future complications. Around 800 Tocilizumab were allocated to Maharashtra, of which 63 had come to the district a day ago. Out of the total 5,895 functional bed capacity and 1,936 ICUs in the city and some Dedicated Covid Hospitals in the periphery as on Friday, 63 hospitals got one dose each. District collector Ravindra Thakare had a day ago claimed there was no pressure on him for any decision, and the injection would be distributed as per need. However, the single dose injection left most hospital managements wondering how to use it. Dr Anup Marar of Orange City Hospital said Tocilizumab works by blocking the effects of (interleukin) IL-6. “Our injection would go to the neediest person, whose IL-6 would be the highest,” he said. “Generally, there are two doses, one after another. Hence, one injection can fulfil merely 50% of the requirement,” he said. Orange City Hospital was yet to use their allocated injection as of Friday evening. Alexis Multispecialty Hospital too is learnt to have decided to retain the one dose allocated to them after a brief meeting of their clinicians and experts. “Our dedicated team would take a call on the use of the only injection we have been allocated,” said Niranjan Joshi, spokesperson of the hospital. Dr Praveen Singh Bais of Nucleus Mother and Child Hospital said he had administered the injection to a woman in her 50s who did not have any political connection or other influence. “The injection was administered with a clinical decision only,” he said. In the meanwhile, there was some respite for the medical fraternity as 4,223 Remdesivir vials were distributed among the Covid hospitals and facilities in the district. The state had revised the allocation order for the anti-viral drug in view of the high court order that pegged the allocation at 11.94%, in line with the total active patients (80,028). Earlier, the centre too had raised the state’s allocation to 4.72 lakh vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-connected-patients-some-serious-ones-finally-get-toci-injection/articleshow/82334688.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||Delhi: 5,850 die in 30 days, 375 in last 24 hours||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 375 Covid-19 deaths on Friday, taking the total toll due to the disease in the national capital to 16,147, the second highest in the country after Maharashtra where 68,183 people have succumbed to the infection since the beginning of the pandemic. In the past 30 days, from April 1 to 30, Delhi has recorded 5,850 deaths, averaging 195 daily. The maximum deaths in a day in Delhi — 395 — were recorded on Friday. In March, the average was around four. The number of new cases reported on Friday was 27,047, higher than Thursday’s 24,235. This could be due to an increase in testing. In the past 24 hours, the data shared by the health department shows, 82,745 tests were conducted as against 73,851 recorded a day before. In the second week of April, the city conducted over one lakh tests, of which nearly 70,000 tests were RT-PCR, considered the gold standard for testing Covid-19. The positivity rate of Covid-19 is around 33%, meaning one in every three persons getting tested are positive for the disease. The total number of active cases stands at 99,361. The availability of oxygen and ICU beds remains scarce. The health department data shows 52% of the active cases are recuperating under home isolation. The number of patients admitted in various hospitals is 24,831, 25% of the active cases. Still, there are very few vacant beds. Hundreds of patients requiring admission, especially those in need of critical care, can be seen waiting outside the emergency of various private and public hospitals. According to Delhi Corona app, 44 ICU beds are available in the city. Public health specialists say the death toll may go up further if the issue of shortage of ICU beds couldn’t be tackled effectively. The shortage of oxygen supply across the capital is also affecting treatment, say many doctors. “I was awake all night on Thursday waiting for oxygen supply. It is causing nervous breakdown among our doctors and other healthcare workers, who are already stressed due to overburden,” said a doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5850-die-in-30-days-375-in-last-24-hours/articleshow/82334747.cms||---

However, the vaccination drive will be launched in only 10 districts due to insufficient availability of vaccine doses. All registrations are to be on the online portal cowin.gov.in with no provision of spot registration. The vaccination programme is being launched with the help of the central government, said Rupani. The chief minister said the 10 districts are Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Kutch, Mehsana, Bharuch and Gandhinagar where the incidence of the pandemic is higher. He said the Gujarat government is keen to launch the programme early for the safety of the youth, and has given order for 2.50 crore doses of vaccine to ‘swadeshi’ (domestic) producers and authorities are in constant touch with both the companies. Three lakh doses of vaccine are reaching Gujarat by air by this evening to start the vaccination in these 10 districts tomorrow at 9am. He said that Gujarat will get 11 lakh doses of vaccine during the month of May, while the state government is keen to procure more vaccines, and include more districts in a phased manner. After registration, the person who gets vaccinated will get SMS showing the date, place and centre. The government will ensure there is no disorder in the arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rupani-to-launch-18-vax-drive-on-may-1/articleshow/82333930.cms||---

The FIR was filed against her for posting an appeal on Facebook to the government to ensure food and kits for dalit and adivasi families at Arippa in Kollam. Her FB post highlighted the dire situation of over 160 families, including older people and children, who are part of communities struggling for the right to cultivable land on which they had built their huts for over a decade. Their condition had aggravated during the Covid-induced lockdown. Kusumam had posted the appeal in April 2020 and Kulathupuzha police had registered a case against her based on the complaint by Kulathupuzha gram panchayat secretary on April 18, this year. But, Kusumam was notified about the FIR only on April 28 through a notice asking her to surrender her mobile phone within 72 hours, said the activists. Writers and activists from Kerala KG Sankarappillai, Sarah Joseph, K Aravindakshan, C R Parameswaran, K Venu and CR Neelakandan have made a similar appeal. They pointed out that the LDF government was speaking against the human rights violations and atrocities against dalits and minorities in India under BJP-RSS rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-urged-to-drop-fir-against-activist/articleshow/82333935.cms||---

The accused were trying to smuggle the contraband from Hyderabad to Australia through the courier service. Acting on inputs, NCB sleuths zeroed in on a parcel booked from Hyderabad to Australia on April 23. The team inspected the consignment at the courier service office. The peddlers, identified as S Hamid and K Vadayappan, had booked a consignment of kitchen utensils to Gilles Plains in South Australia. The NCB team opened the parcel and found a set of casseroles. On dismantling the casseroles, and officials found packets of white crystalline powder concealed in cavities at the bottom. The samples of the substance were sent for analysis, and the lab report revealed that it was pseudoephedrine, a controlled substance under NDPS Act, 1985. Meanwhile, when the accused realised that the NCB team was on their trail, they moved to Visakhapatnam. When the team followed them, they duo fled to their base city, Chennai. On April 29, the NCB arrested Hamid after a car chase near a toll plaza on the outskirts of Chennai. Based on his confession, they arrested Vadayappan after a brief high-speed car chase in another part of Chennai, said an NCB official. The NCB is trying to find out from where did the two procure the contraband, and since when they have been into narcotics smuggling. According to NCB, controlled substances like ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are used as intermediary for manufacturing detergents, perfumeries and dyes. However, drug manufacturers use them for manufacturing amphetamine type stimulants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drug-worth-rs-25l-headed-for-oz-seized-in-city/articleshow/82334771.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The state government has pledged 2.5 crore shots to cover the 18-45 age group,” said an official, adding that the hospitals can directly procure the vaccine. When TOI checked the CoWIN portal on Friday night, majority of the sites did not allow the registration for persons below 45 years of age. State officials however claimed that they have received registrations and they would carry out the vaccination according to schedule. Even after the announcement by the state government on the sessions open from May 1, many faced issues getting themselves registered. The health department did not clarify whether the drive would impact the ongoing vaccination for 45-plus age group.

---||Patna||Bettiah hospital gasps for O2 as demand shoots up||BETTIAH: Within a week of claiming that the brand new oxygen generating plant has been pumped into in-house production, Bettiah’s Government Medical College is panting with inadequate supplies with the number of Covid patients rising. “The demand (for oxygen) has shot up. We are augmenting our supplies from Harsiddhi and Gopalganj,” Hospital Superintendent Pramod K Tiwary said on Thursday even as kin of admitted Covid patients were horrified with hearsay reports of depleting oxygen stocks. Lal Babu, attendant of a Covid patient Vijay Kumar told reporters early Thursday morning, “Last night, we panicked when a nurse said that the hospital’s oxygen supply was rapidly depleting. Another patient’s kin shared his fright on hearing that the hospital, with 107 Covid patients in the isolation ward, had just three hours of oxygen supply left." With a large pile of empty oxygen cylinders lying without refill, a technician told reporters that the new plant is having hiccups in generating oxygen. Just a few days back, the hospital administration had claimed that the plant had been made operational and would help avert any crisis. While the technician felt the need for a dedicated power line to prevent voltage fluctuations, hospital manager Shanawaz felt the urgent need to augment transport with a dedicated fleet of vehicles to ferry oxygen from Harsiddhi and Gopaganj. Officials, including the civil surgeon, hospital superintendent, the Bettiah SDM and senior deputy collector Madan Kumar went into a huddle on Thursday afternoon to overcome the looming crisis. “We already have in place a green corridor to maintain the oxygen supply. We are working overtime to prevent any crisis,” SDM Vidya Nand Paswan told this reporter. While the SDM claimed that the plant would go on steam by Thursday night, hospital administration bemoaned the plant’s limited production capacity. “The OGP is fettered with teething problems as the required pressure is not being built up,” superintendent Tiwary said, adding that an engineer from the commissioning company has arrived to solve the problem. “On full steam, it can produce up to 40 cylinder fills,” he added. A greenfield project, the Bettiah GMCH, it may be mentioned, is still not fully ready. When fully built and furnished, it will have 850 beds. “At present, we have a total of 450 beds and we are expanding the number of beds for Covid patients," he further said. Asked about the wisdom of installing the oxygen plant with limited production capacity, he said the capacity was insufficient for the Covid crisis. The plant was installed by the Bihar Medical Supplies & Infrastructure Corporation, a State government enterprise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-hospital-gasps-for-o2-as-demand-shoots-up/articleshow/82324540.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha
---||Chandigarh||SAD, BSP try to forge alliance, hold talks on seat sharing||Jalandhar: With infighting in Congress increasing, uncertainty looms over party leaders and cadres. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is in talks with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to forge an alliance and consolidate its position. Although leaders of both parties are not ready to comment on record, well placed sources said they have made significant advances in talks and the seat-sharing formula has also been discussed in detail. It is learnt that the top brass of Akali Dal is keen on an alliance with the BSP and they have also managed to take party leaders of the Akali Dal, who feared losing their seats in case of an alliance, on board. Punjab BSP leaders also support the idea as election results over the past two decades show that only an alliance can clinch victory over some seats in the state where it always existed as a third alternative. Sources privy to the developments said while talks have been held with a few senior BSP leaders at the central level, Mayawati will have the last word. “In the last meetings, two senior leaders of BSP, both from UP, participated to thresh out different issues, including seat sharing,” said a source. However, sources in the BSP said their party has not yet closed other options. SAD chief Sukhbir BadalThere has always been a feeling among BSP cadre and most of its state leaders that the party needed to have an alliance to share power but in most of the elections, party supremo Mayawati would decide to go solo and her calculations would mainly be based on politics in UP. This time, the biggest factor is that the Shiromani Akali Dal has severed its ties with the BJP and is free to forge an alliance. Both the Shiromani Akali Dal and BSP have different core constituencies among the electorate. SAD has managed to build its base among Dalits as well. Out of its four MLAs in Doaba region, three are from reserved constituencies. BSP also has its pockets of strength in the Doaba region. The vote share of the BSP has remained in single digit and kept falling further as it consistently contested solo, but it still has its committed vote and cadre base in certain pockets, which can be crucial in tilting the balance. Its alliance with PDA in the 2019 election demonstrated once again that when in alliance, BSP’s vote aggregating capacity increases significantly and it can eat into the Dalit vote share of the Congress. BSP got its first MP in Punjab in 1989 when it entered into an alliance with the Simranjit Singh Mann-led Akali Dal and then three MPs in 1996 when it had an alliance with the Parkash Singh Badal-led Akali Dal. However, after the results, Badal unilaterally announced support to the BJP, which led to severing of ties between SAD and BSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-bsp-try-to-forge-alliance-hold-talks-on-seat-sharing/articleshow/82334819.cms||IP Singh

---||Delhi||‘If supply in, city will get 9k beds with O2’||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that the capital desperately needed oxygen and urged decision-makers to allot the required amount of the gas to the city. Kejriwal said that Delhi was facing an acute oxygen crisis and while the demand was of 976 metric tonnes (MT) per day, the city received just 312 MT on Friday. “Even today, we received SOS calls from hospitals all across Delhi. A lot of difficult situations are emerging. We have conveyed it to the courts as well as written to the central government that Delhi has a requirement of 976 metric tonnes of oxygen per day,” the CM said, adding that “ Delhi has been allotted only 490 MT oxygen, but is not even getting that.” “On Friday, 312 metric tonnes were provided. If only 312 metric tonnes are being provided as against 976 metric tonnes needed in Delhi, how are things supposed to work out? Today, there is a huge uproar in most hospitals,” he told reporters after visiting a vaccination centre on Saturday. “Many hospitals have said that they will have to turn down their patients. Delhi needs oxygen. Therefore, I appeal to all those listening and those who are the decision-makers to give us oxygen,” he urged. Kejriwal further said that the Delhi government was cracking down on black marketing of medicines, but oxygen was the most important thing right now. The government has set up the infrastructure of beds for Covid-19 patients, but is unable to make them functional because of the oxygen crisis. Kejriwal said it was only because of oxygen that patients were facing difficulty in getting beds. “In Radha Soami Satsang Beas, we have prepared 5,000 beds but only 150 beds are functional because there is no oxygen. In the Commonwealth Games and Yamuna Sports Complex, we have prepared for 1,300 beds but there is no oxygen,” he added. “In Burari, we have arranged for 2,500 beds. If we get oxygen today, 9,000 oxygenated beds will be ready in Delhi within 24 hours. Delhi does not produce its own oxygen, to whom do we go to and from whom should we borrow oxygen?” the CM asked. The Delhi government is also creating 500-bed Covid facilities each next to Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals, apart from 200 ICU beds at the Chhattarpur facility. Talking about black marketing of Remdesivir and ambulance facilities, Kejriwal said, “I just want to say that had we received the oxygen supplies and were able to create the beds, then an official system could have been prepared. One could also have received the doctor-prescribed medicines there.” “Now, people are laying their hands on whatever they are getting. The government is taking action, but the only way to tackle this is by increasing the number of oxygenated beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/if-supply-in-city-will-get-9k-beds-with-o2/articleshow/82347855.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat colleges get vacation from May 1 to June 5||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has announced vacations for all universities and colleges in the state from May 1 to June 5 amid the prevailing Covid-19 situation. The decision comes after concerns were raised by student bodies and faculty members against the instruction to staff and faculty members to report for work at colleges and universities. The government had made it compulsory for colleges and universities to continue running at half the staff strength on the rotational basis. The government began re-opening schools and colleges from January this year after they remained closed for over nine months due to the pandemic. But soon the government decided to shut them down as Covid-19 cases began rising in the state; online education was resumed. “Usually the summer vacation is for 45 days but this time due to Covid-19, the period has been shortened to ensure that students start their new academic year on time,” said a source. A few universities declared vacations ahead of the state government’s announcement due to the worsening Covid-19 situation. North Gujarat University announced its May vacation a few days ago. On Friday, ahead of the state’s announcement, Gujarat Technological University (GTU) announced its vacation from May 3 to June 2. A GTU official clarified that since the government has made an announcement, the varsity will recall its circular. GTU has announced its online exams between May 4 and May 13 for the final semester regular/remedial summer 2021 batch; the exams will be in the MCQ format. They will continue as planned. Faculty members and the heads of institutes will have to perform exam duties as required by the university. Gujarat University recently decided to give merit-based progression to second and fourth semester students of undergraduate programmes and to second semester students of postgraduate courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/colleges-get-vacation-from-may-1-to-june-5/articleshow/82333947.cms||---

---||India||The unnamed warriors: Study details valiant war on Covid waged by nurses||MUMBAI: They wore the same PPE kit through the day, sometimes donned jute PPEs because of shortage and even put on an HIV suit. They saw new moms get infected and fight to live for their babies, while others went home with fears about infecting their own children. Some were thrown out of homes as neighbours feared contamination, while many dispatched their families to their native places for safety and didn’t see them for months. Yet, shedding their anxiety and inconvenience, nurses have been working tirelessly for over 13 months now to counsel and comfort patients. Up to 88% of them worked in Covid units for more than six months at a time. In an exhaustive report titled ‘Lived Experiences of Nurses with Covid-19 Care in India — A Phenomenological Study’, five senior nursing principals and faculty members captured their journey from unpreparedness to anxiety to the pressures to the new meaning it gave their lives whilst battling Covid. Principal researcher Meena Ganapathy, principal of Pune-based BT Institute of Nursing Education, said she found that 50% of nurses in the study felt powerless and experienced anxiety, depression due to changes in the patient’s condition as mild symptoms progressed to breathlessness to severe respiratory problems resulting in death. Initially, nurses would stay on hospital premises so that they do not spread illness to their family and community. “The nurses were made to work for one week and given a week of rest. This pattern continued for some time but with the increasing influx of Covid cases, they were made to work for two weeks straight and given two weeks of rest. Slowly, the rest period has been shortened to three days. “My first rotation was for 65 patients, and two of us were there. Initially, once patients learnt they are Covid positive, they used to get breathless. That time, corona meant death and oxygen beds were limited,” recalled a nurse, interviewed for the study. “Initially, we were very anxious as we had no PPE kits. We used HIV/Red kits,” said another. “There was a shortage of PPE. We did not feel like wasting it. So no drinking water, no washroom visits for seven-eight hours,” said another. Apart from the inconveniences, coping with the uncertainty was the toughest. “It was disturbing, depressing seeing patients die every day. Sometimes eight-10 deaths per day, and at times six-seven deaths in a six-hour shift. Relatives were not able to see the patients. Even children were testing positive for Covid. It was a depressing atmosphere,” said another nurse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/the-unnamed-warriors-study-details-valiant-war-on-covid-waged-by-nurses/articleshow/82337136.cms||Hemali Chhapia

TOI had earlier reported that transport minister Mauvin Godinho had said that there are backend services that must be completed to monitor and track the vehicles, following which the devices would be installed. In addition, the vendors have also hit a roadblock due to the Covid situation. A Delhi-based vendor – Rosmerta Autotech Pvt Ltd – which was supposed to arrive in Goa last week, has postponed the visit. “The team could not travel from Delhi to Goa to carry out preparatory work at service centres due to the lockdown and restrictions imposed in Delhi due to Covid-19 second wave,” Satardekar said. “It will not happen now. Maybe we could start in another 15 days. The department is ready for the implementation. We will announce the dates,” he told TOI. Given the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Goa, Satardekar said the installation of the devices will be carried out in a staggered manner. “There are separate vendors for buses and taxis, and the installation will start together. People will have to take prior appointments and then we will schedule it according to the date of their choice,” he said. While Rosmerta Autotech Pvt Ltd will handle taxis, Accord Digital Meters will handle buses and Atlanta Systems Private Limited will manage installation of vehicle location tracking device makers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-surge-delays-digital-meters-implementation/articleshow/82334920.cms||Nida Sayed

In view of the surging second wave of Covid-19, the state government had on April 21 issued orders making online registration mandatory for those coming to the Himalayan state and also specified that they will be required to bring RT-PCR-negative report not older than 72 hours. "The checking exercise has been going on since April 22. Most people who are being returned either did not have RT-PCR reports or they had submitted wrong information while registering,” said a senior police official in police headquarters overseeing the exercise. Ashok Kumar, director general of police (DGP) Uttarakhand, told TOI, that the government order regarding RT-PCR report requirement was being strictly enforced which is why, such large number of people are being returned from the borders. “We are not letting anyone who does not have the required documents or RT-PCR report to enter the state borders. For migrants who are coming back to their homes in the state, our personnel are sensitising them to register on the government portal and observe strict home quarantine. Their RT-PCR reports are also being checked." In the last 48-hours, the DGP added, over 5500 people were stopped at the borders and asked to return as they did not have required documents. Among the people who were returned, maximum were those who were coming on short personal and professional trips, followed by migrants and those travelling to Haridwar for performing last rites of their deceased family members, he added. As per police, there are 40 checkpoints functional on inter-state borders currently where people coming to Uttarakhand are being checked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-45k-people-without-rt-pcr-valid-docs-returned-from-ukhand-borders-in-1-wk-claims-police/articleshow/82332498.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Chandigarh||Above 18 yrs will not be jabbed from today||Chandigarh: The UT will not be inoculating residents of age 18 years and above from May 1. The decision was taken in a war room meeting chaired by UT adviser Manoj Parida on Friday. He said, “The existing stock of nearly 1 lakh vaccines will be used for above 45-year-old persons for the first or second dose. For above 18 years, vaccination will start only after adequate supplies are received. So, their vaccination will not start from May 1.”The UT health department has asked the private and government facilities not to create vaccine sessions for 18 years and above, as no consignment for this group has arrived. The diversion quota has been refused by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The UT health department had proposed to divert 20,000 doses from its then 94,078 doses kept for the 45 years and above age group for 18 years and above group. There are now almost 8,500 doses with the UT health department and these have to be administered to the existing priority groups. “After the order from the Central government that the states are supposed to procure their own vaccines, we have not got a new consignment. We have been speaking with the Serum Institute of India (SII) for at least 20,000 doses, but there has been no response,” said UT director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kang. The UT health department had requested for 1,00,000 doses from the SII. “At a time when the positivity rate here is 20%, vaccine coverage should have been enhanced. There have been studies that show that after vaccination, one is 12 times less likely to get Covid,” said a faculty member in PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/above-18-yrs-will-not-be-jabbed-from-today/articleshow/82333949.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kolkata||No jabs at pvt centres from today, hospitals await ‘govt clarification’||Kolkata: No vaccination will be carried out at private hospitals from Saturday. The state government had assured private vaccination centres of help and had said it would mediate and procure the vials from Saturday so that the drive there could continue unhindered but no definite communication reached the private hospitals. The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), which has over 20 major hospitals as members, wrote to the government on Friday, appealing for help and seeking clarity on the method to be followed for the supply of second-dose vials. “We have got the letter from the hospital association, seeking clarity and help so that they can carrying on with the vaccination drive. The issue is being discussed,” said a source at the state health department. Private vaccination centres said the supply had been erratic for the past two weeks, as a result of which they had to scale down the number of recipients against the capacity. “It will basically be a full stop to the drive from Saturday. Hopefully, the government will come forward with a solution so that we can resume the drive at least next weekend,” said the CEO of a private hospital. Hospitals said they would wait for the government response till Saturday morning before they put up no-vaccination display boards. They had already stopped taking appointments for about a week now due to the uncertainty of supply. The government on Thursday had said it was setting aside 1 lakh vials for the second dose and that, it was writing to the Centre on the purchase of 3 crore doses for the first dose for the 18-44 age group. The state decided to allot the 1 lakh second doses to private hospitals so that the second jab could be administered on those who had taken the first one there. The government said it wanted to order 2 crore first-dose shots to state vaccination centres and 1 crore to private units. The hospital authorities’ letter feared a roadblock in the inoculation drive if a smooth chain was not established. “You had assured to help us in keeping our commitment to people whose second doses are due for which supply will come upon an agreed methodology. We seek your advice and guidance on developing this methodology. This will help us assure people, who have received their first doses and want to come back to respective hospitals for the second doses,” read the letter to the health secretary. “How can we carry forward the drive without vaccines? Forget about the first dose, we have not been clearly told about the supply for the second dose, which the government had assured would come,” said the CEO of a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-jabs-at-pvt-centres-from-today-hospitals-await-govt-clarification/articleshow/82333968.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Election agents rush for Covid test to secure entry into counting centres tomorrow||Kolkata: With barely a day left to go for the counting, candidates and their agents made a last-minute dash for Covid test mandated by  Commission of India for entry into counting venues on May 2. While all “private help has been enlisted”, maximum crowds were reported from counting centres like Netaji Indoor Stadium and Ballygunge Government School, where district election officers (DEO) arranged for rapid antigen tests. “At present, arranging for the RT-PCR test for all of us is impossible. The papers need to be submitted by Saturday through the chief polling agent to the EC. We were asked to stand in a line to get the test done and the reports were given to us in half an hour,” said Manik Singh, a Trinamool Congress’s counting agent at Ward 26 from Jorabagan constituency. Ajmal Khan, a Sanjukta Morcha candidate from Jorasanko, said that several counting agents or their family members had tested positive. “We will get all the agents tested before sending them to the counting centres. Meanwhile, we are looking for persons to replace the agents who have tested positive,” said Khan. Almost all candidates have arranged for back up in case their agents test positive before going to the counting centres. “We have made two lists of counting agents in case some from the first list test positive. They have been told to be on stand-by,” said Santosh Pathak, a Sanjukta Morcha candidate from Chowringhee. The bigger parties like Trinamool, BJP and CPM did not merely depend on the booths set up by the EC. Several workers of these parties were seen queuing up at the KMC ward offices. “We are ready to slog it out for the party,” said Debajyoti Basu, a TMC leader from Kalighat. “Didi has provided us the necessary tips. We are not worried about Covid,” he added. According to EC officials, each candidate can send one counting agent per table. Others have to be kept ready as relievers. With an average of 16-26 tables at each centre, the EC is looking at accommodating minimum 21 and maximum 42 counting agents at specific constituencies. “The onus is on the EC. If we miss out on arranging a few counting agents till evening, we have tied up with a private lab collaborator for a few specific tests,” said Ganapati Bera, a BJP functionary at the Tollygunge constituency. “We have held a video conference with the candidates who have already submitted the names of counting agents. We need to conduct around 8,000 tests,” saidAntara Acharya, a DEO in South 24-Parganas that has 31 assembly constituencies. TMC candidate from Bhowanipore Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay said he has finalised the names of his polling agents who have had two doses of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/election-agents-rush-for-covid-test-to-secure-entry-into-counting-centres-tomorrow/articleshow/82333991.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||GMRT captures facets of a rare cosmic explosion||Pune: Scientists from the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR), Pune have used the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to determine that AT 2018cow, the first of a newly discovered class of cosmic explosions, has an extremely patchy environment. AT 2018cow is a unique supernova, an explosion that marks the end of a star. Supernovae, scientists said, release an enormous amount of energy which fades extremely rapidly. Poonam Chandra from NCRA and her former doctoral student A J Nayana carried out the radio observations of AT 2018cow for two years with the uGMRT to determine the properties of AT2018cow’s extended environment and emission region. The environment has an extreme blue colour and is called a fast blue optical transient (FBOT). It is a bright pulse lasting a very short time caused by some very high energy astrophysical process. Proposed models indicate that the origins of FBOTs include explosion of a massive star, collision of an accreting (grow by accumulation) neutron star and a star and the merger of two white dwarfs. “The unique low-frequency capabilities of the uGMRT helped our study. The telescope’s observations of the ‘cow’ was unique in finding the non-uniform density around this explosion,” Nayana said. Their work provides the first observational evidence of inhomogeneous emission from an FBOT. The density of the material around this explosion falls around 0.1 light year from the transient. “This indicates that the progenitor star of AT2018cow was shedding mass much faster towards the end of its life,” she added. AT 2018cow is unusual and has been observed for a long time. The longer one can observe the post-explosion emission, the more distance the material that was ejected during the explosion has travelled, Chandra added. This allows one to study the large-scale environment of the source. “This is the first FBOT seen for this long at low radio frequencies and the uGMRT data gave crucial information about the environment of this transient. This is the beauty of low-frequency radio observations. One gets to trace the footprints of the progenitor (original) system much before it exploded. It is interesting that the material from the explosion is moving with speed greater than 20% speed of light 257 days after explosion, without any deceleration,” Chandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gmrt-captures-facets-of-a-rare-cosmic-explosion/articleshow/82333958.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Pune||Pune: District gets 5,192 remdesivir vials; no tocilizumab supply||PUNE: The district received 5,192 vials of remdesivir on Friday, but not a single vial of tocilizumab could be made available for the severely ill Covid patients, officials of the Food and Drug Administration said. There has been no respite from the severe shortage of these key Covid drugs in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) for more than a month now. While remdesivir, an anti-viral drug, is primarily meant for moderately ill patients, tocilizumab -- an imported drug -- is given to severely ill Covid patients. “We distributed 5,192 vials of remdesivir among the hospitals treating Covid patients in the PMR. But we did not receive a single vial of tocilizumab for distribution on Friday,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drugs), FDA, Pune. A total of 87 vials of tocilizumab were distributed among 27 hospitals on priority on Thursday. Tocilizumab’s manufacturer, Roche, had stated late in July last year that during trials, the drug had failed to improve the condition of severely ill patients hospitalised with Covid-19 pneumonia. But doctors in Pune have continued to use the expensive drug. Specialists and infectious disease experts from the city claimed that the drug had been effective in carefully selected patients. “It’s not totally useless,” senior physician Atul Joshi had said in an earlier interview. “Tocilizumab can do the trick if used judiciously in the right subset of patients, and before there has been irreversible damage. In fact, it’s one of the most useful drugs in a certain group of critical patients with Covid-19,” he said. Doctors from the Pune wing of the Indian Medical Association and the Association of Physicians of India also said subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab continued to be “effective”. The specialists added that tociluzimab, if given to the right patients at the right time, had shown improvement in clinical conditions. In some cases, they said, X-rays revealed perceptible improvement. The drug tocilizumab, doctors said, yielded good clinical outcomes in patients with early-stage hypoxia (absence of enough oxygen). Infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag, said, “Tocilizumab needs to be used early during hypoxia, not when lung damage has progressed to an irreversible stage. When patients have advanced respiratory failure and are on mechanical ventilation, it means lung damage is substantial. At that point, tocilizumab may not make a difference.” Unlike remdesivir, produced by over seven pharma companies in India, tocilizumab is an imported drug. Cipla Pharmaceuticals is the only Indian company to have an import licence. The drug is very costly (Rs50,000 per vial) and its supply has remained erratic for over a year now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-5192-remdesivir-vials-no-tocilizumab-supply/articleshow/82334862.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The interviews are more than 8,000 minutes long. While the interviews were recorded mostly in the late 1970s and mid-1980s, those were upgraded in 2008, and footage and images of the interviewees were added to each of them. The interviews are available on https://nfai.gov.in/audio_interview.php The longest of these, according to the NFAI, is an interview with the recently departed Bengali film actor Soumitra Chatterjee, which runs for more than nine hours. “These interviews are generally about their lives in the industry, how they entered the film world, or the important roles they played, or some of the iconic directors they worked with, and what has been their experience in the industry. We have now collated all these interviews into one link on our website, and anyone can access it.We are also making available the transcripts of these interviews in English,” said Prakash Magdum, the NFAI director. There are interviews with personalities in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu film industries, among others, along with some interviews in English as well, such as the one with JBH Wadia, the patriarch of the Wadia Movietone studio, which became famous for bringing in Mary Ann Evans, better known as the stuntwoman Fearless Nadia, into the film industry. Also, part of the project features actors such as Nilu Phule, as well as PG Bhosale. The project, released on the birth anniversary of film pioneer Dadasaheb Phalke, also features some of the associates in his journey in the film industry, such as Phalke’s daughter Mandakini Athavale, and make-up artist Sahadevrao Tapkire. “Tapkire’s story is extremely interesting as he started off with Phalke doing small, bit roles. He recognised that he was not going anywhere in his acting career, so he focused on being a make-up artist, and Phalke helped him in his journey. He was later asked to come to Chennai by SS Vasan of the Gemini Studios, and he lived and worked in Chennai for more than 25 years,” the NFAI director added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/history-of-indian-films-in-8000-mins-on-nfai-site/articleshow/82333983.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

While the Centre had assured 4.35 lakh vials of remdesivir for the last 10 days (April 21-30), the state has received only 2.65 lakh vials “The state continues to reel due to the shortfall of the injections since the allotted supply has not been given to the state. There is a shortfall of 1.70 lakh vials from the assured supply. We are demanding 7 lakh vials for the next 10 days for the state to meet the demand and supply,” the minister told TOI. He said that the Centre should give the shortfall as well as 7 lakh doses as demanded because the state has nearly 7 lakh active cases and there should be enough stocks, if required. The minister also said that seven companies have been allotted by the Centre to allocate the doses but only one company was catering to the requirement, which was causing the shortfall. He has requested the Centre to ensure that all the companies supply the required allotment of the drugs in time With complaints of black marketing of the vials coming to fore, the minister said that on Friday he had taken a video conference of all his staff to ensure that there is active vigilance on the overall supply In addition to the Centre’s supply, the state has floated a global tender and is expected to have more manufacturers supply to Maharashtra. The minister said that companies from Bangladesh and Singapore too are likely to come forward and meet the demand. He said that a Mumbai-based company too is involved in production on behalf of Cipla, but the production is not enough. The department had earlier invited tenders for supply, but the manufacturers were not interested in supplying at low rates and one of them even said that they would want to do so by the end of May while another said they would provide only 500 vials. The entire issue cropped up after the centre reduced the daily allocation of 36,000 vials to 28,000 vials. It was only after pursuing with the Centre that the allocation of 4.35 lakh vials was assured. However, the state requires 65,000-70,000 vials daily and this has not been supplied, stated FDA officials. State food and supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal too had raised an alarm over the poor allocation, which was not sufficient for districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-government-demands-7-lakh-stock-for-next-10-days/articleshow/82334897.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Lockdown extended by another week: CM||New Delhi: As Delhi recorded 412 Covid-19 fatalities on Saturday, the highest single-day toll till date, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the lockdown in the capital has been extended by a week. With an exponential and unprecedented rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had imposed curfew on the movement of individuals in the capital from 10pm on April 19 to 5am on April 26, which was further extended and would have come to an end at 5am on May 3 (Monday). After reviewing the Covid-19 situation in Delhi, DDMA observed that “both Covid-19 positive cases as well as positivity rate are still very high and the bed occupancy in the dedicated Covid government and private hospitals and nursing homes is on the very higher side.” In order to contain the spread of the virus and to break the transmission chain, the curfew needs to be extended for another week in Delhi, except for essential activities and services, an order issued by it stated. DDMA has extended the restriction of movement of individuals except for essential activities and services till 5am on May 10, Monday or till further orders. After imposing the weekend curfew, a complete curfew was initially imposed in Delhi as a ‘last resort’ from April 19 and was announced by Kejriwal after a meeting with LG Anil Baijal. The move was aimed at arresting the spread of Covid after Delhi started recording more than 20,000 new Covid-19 cases every day. Deploy teams at oxygen refilling units: DDMAIn a separate order, DDMA has directed all district magistrates to monitor medical oxygen refilling centres round the clock to ensure its supply to genuine patients and hospitals. In the order dated April 28, district magistrates have been directed to deploy teams at all medical oxygen refilling establishments and plants to prevent any hoarding and pilferage. They have also been told to ensure that medical oxygen is sold strictly as per their licence conditions. Also, refilling units will have to mandatorily check ID cards of those receiving oxygen, authorisation letters from the institution like hospital, ambulances, etc for which oxygen is being sought and record the type and number of cylinders refilled. If a doctor has prescribed medical oxygen to any Covid-19 patient, the retailer will only sell the prescribed oxygen after checking the doctor's prescription, and ID cards of the patient and the person receiving the oxygen. District teams will also have to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed at the oxygen refilling plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lockdown-extended-by-another-week-cm/articleshow/82347859.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A division bench comprising justices Devan Ramachandran and MR Anitha was considering a public interest litigation (WP-C No. 10855/2021) seeking to declare gatherings and processions illegal during May 1-4. The court ordered the state police chief, district collectors and district superintendents of police to take effective and requisite steps to ensure that no social or political assemblages, meetings, gatherings, processions or parades of any kind are held in violation of Covid-19 protocols anywhere in the state, including counting stations and offices of political parties, between may 1st and May 5th. Orders issued by the Election Commission (EC) and the state government in this regard should be strictly followed, the bench directed. The court also criticized that the orders of EC and the state government were not implemented during election campaigning. “We are certain that the directives of the Election Commission of India and that of the government cannot merely rest on paper; as it seemingly were when the election campaigns had been completed. This court cannot, therefore, afford to allow anything to chance, when our state is on the brink of a precipice,” the order said. State attorney KV Sohan had told the court that authorities are fully alive to the rapidly-evolving Covid-19 scenario and that no gatherings or meetings or processions or parades in violation of Covid protocols will be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-gatherings-processions-till-may-4-rules-hc/articleshow/82333995.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Mucormycosis spreading like wildfire; medicines costly, government must step in’||NAGPUR: Dr Shailesh Kothalkar, a head and neck cancer surgeon, is practicing in Nagpur for the last 20 years. An alumnus of Panjabrao Deshmukh Medical College (Amravati), Dr Kothalkar says in these two decades he has operated just 11 or 12 patients of mucormycosis – a fungal infection. But now, he is performing three to four surgeries daily since the last two months at Seven Star Hospital where he is a director. In an interview to TOI, Dr Kothalkar talks about its causes, threats, prevalence and government role. Excerpts... How did the disease start spiralling? I’m performing three to four surgeries on mucormycosis patients on a daily basis for the last two months at our Seven Star Hospital. Initially, we started getting patients from places like Akola, Amravati and even Manmad, Bhusaval and Jalgaon which turned hotspots in February. Of late, local patients are coming in OPDs. What kind of complaints are they walking in with? In the post-Covid phase, they come with vague facial pain, swelling over the eye, loss of vision, drooling of eyelids and facial paralysis. Suspected cases are investigated with diagnostic nasal endoscopy, CT scan and if required, MRI. In which scenario is the surgery planned? Immediately, mucormycosis spreads like wildfire. Recently, a patient was hale and hearty a day before. By the next morning, he had already lost his vision and by evening, his palate turned black, indicating decay. We have to perform a surgery at the earliest because it is a highly invading fungus, causing necrosis (bone decal). If surgery is delayed, the patient losses vision as the fungus invades the eyeball, brain and lungs also. What does the surgery entail? We have to get rid of the fungal load through radical debridement (removal of the rotten part). Our top priority is to save the patient’s life. Once the threat subsides, temporary or permanent obturators are implanted. The most important part of this disease is radical and repeated debridement along with the anti-fungal medication. What about the medication? The worrisome part is that all the anti-fungal medication is costly. One anti-fungal vial (50mg) costs Rs8,000. According to the dosage, minimum 5mg of Amphotericin B has to be given i.e. 5mg per kg body weight. So a 50kg patient needs 250mg which means Rs40,000 for eight vials. Apart from this, another anti-fungal Posaconazole has to be given. The daily dose costs Rs4,000. Recently, one more drug added for treatment is Isavuconazole. One injection costs Rs12,000. On the first day, 3 injections are given, and the next day onwards, two per day. The treatment part is very costly. Hence, the government must step in and cover at least Amphotericin under some scheme. One patient is incurring an expenditure of Rs5 to 6lakh only on medication. These are life saving drugs. How are government hospitals treating it? The mortality is 50 pc in all patients who are suffering from mucor. At government hospitals, doctors are using conventional Amphotericin – it is a raw molecule which has major side effects and can damage the kidney. All the three drugs mentioned above are the most safest but costly. If these drugs are provided in abundance, with a tax waiver, then everyone can treat the disease properly. Was the disease prevalent in first Covid wave? We didn’t see a single patient in the first wave. This is happening in the second wave. So far I have treated 76 patients. Only three died of hearts attacks at home after a month of discharge. The prevalence of this disease is in post-Covid patients with diabetes as during the Covid infection a high dose of steroids are given which is making it worse. Even those who never had any comorbity are probably at the same risk of mucormycosis like a diabetic. Any patient getting an immune-suppressant is prone to this disease. What is the age group? The youngest I operated was 17 years old while the oldest was 89. The commonest age group is 35-40 to 65 years. How can one prevent mucor? Any facial numbness, pain over the sinuses, eyeball, headache, blood- stained nasal discharge, loosening of teeth, blackening of palate are early sysmptoms of the disease in the post-Covid phase. Facial pain is the commonest symptom. On the basis of suspicion, we have found fungus sitting on the corner of the sinus. How are you educating patients? In the Last three to four days, we have started posting on social media about symptoms to look out for and appealing to recovered patients to consult ENT surgeons. Similarly, patients are being given leaflets asking them to consult a specialist if they notice any symptoms. Earlier the diagnosis, better are the outcomes. I’m also doing webinars on treatment modalities for other doctors. What is the treatment duration? Post surgery, if the patient has an aggressive and diffusive disease, the recovery takes two weeks’ hospitalization with IV anti-fungals and other supportive treatment. For limited disease, one week of hospitalization and the discharged patient has to take anti-fungal oral medication for one to three months which also cost around Rs4,000 per day. We covered some of the patients, but beyond the insured sum, patients have to bear the expenses. Are mucor cases going to surge? Once daily Covid cases decline, recovered patients will continue to get infected for another two to three months. What is your assessment about the surge in mucor this time around? Every hospital is treating Covid patients. It is not necessary that qualified doctors are treating them. Heavy doses of steroids are being given at some places. But doctors are becoming wiser, and rectifying their mistakes. Still, if the patient is in a crisis then you are left with no option but to add the steroid dose because only that works in the end. In hospitals which are maintaining good ICU hygiene, chances of patients catching mucor infection are less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mucormycosis-spreading-like-wildfire-meds-costly-govt-must-step-in/articleshow/82334046.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Visakhapatnam||AP: Covid care centres see no rush, collectors to probe||AMARAVATI: With nearly 80 per cent of beds in Covid care centres left unoccupied, the state government has asked district collectors to inspect the centres and submit a report. The government asked the collectors to find out reasons for low occupancy in Covid care centres while there was heavy rush to hospitals for admission. The government directed the collectors to take measures to improve facilities including sanitation and drinking water in order to make people prefer the Covid care centre for their stay during the isolation duration. According to the official report submitted to the group of ministers (GoM), around 4,700 beds were occupied in Covid care centres against the available 33,000 beds. Nearly 20,000 beds were occupied in Covid care centres during the peak of the first wave of Covid-19 in last September. The government set up nearly 116 care centres with a total bed strength of nearly 50,000. Keeping in view of the previous experiences, the government has so far opened 60 Covid care centres to cater to the needs of over 33,000 people. “Although the case load is going up, occupancy at Covid care centres is very low. We have asked district collectors to immediately look into the issue,” said Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary, health.Although the Covid care centres would not have oxygen beds and treatment facilities, the medical officer and paramedical staff would be available 24x7 to extend required support during emergency. However, worried over health issues cropping up during the second wave, people were not preferring to stay in the care centres. “Over 75,000 people are in home isolation. This is also a reason for the fast spreading of virus as there is no proper monitoring of those staying in home isolation,” said a medical officer on condition of anonymity. Many people, who were tested positive and asymptomatic, are going out for different errands resulting in fast spreading of infection. “Shifting of majority of people to Covid care centres at least in rural areas will help contain the virus spread as it would be difficult to monitor the movements of positive tested people,” said a district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-care-centres-see-no-rush-collectors-to-probe/articleshow/82323403.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Massive rush at vax centres on last day before supply to private hospitals stops||KOLKATA: As private hospitals conducted its inoculation drive for the last day on Friday till the new supply chain is established, the facilities witnessed a huge rush, with queues extending along the entire stretch of the roads outside. Many hospitals extended the vaccination schedule so that they could accommodate as many recipients as possible. Even the government centres saw a massive turnout with many fearing the entire private-hospital crowd would shift to state-run units from Saturday. The “last-day” rush was also due to the fact that the price of vaccines, which was capped at Rs 250 a dose at private facilities, was due to go up from Saturday. “I had to wait for close to three hours but managed to get my second dose. It was a long wait but I was lucky that I got my turn,” said Rina Das, a Beliaghata resident. Many who had turned up for their first dose of vaccination had to return without getting the shot. Several centres witnessed chaos as in spite of people queueing up since morning, they were told that priority would be given to those waiting for their second dose. “Our vaccination drive is usually held till around 6.30pm but we had to continue till 8.45pm on Friday so that we could accommodate all those who had come for their second doses. But still, we had to send back a few people who needed their first dose,” said an official at a private vaccination centre. “We vaccinated around 550 people a day in past trhree days. But on Friday, we administered the doses on 800 recipients,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health, of which RN Tagore Hospital is a part. “Friday was the last day when all private hospitals, including AMRI, got supply of vaccines through the state health department. We have come to know that those who received their first dose at private hospitals will also be able to get their second doses from government healthcare facilities,” said Rupak Barua, Group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. Two units of AMRI Dhakuria could inoculate 1,152 recipients, mostly those getting their second doses. The scene of rush was similar at Peerless Hospital. “There was a huge rush and we had to carry on the drive till 7pm to accommodate all the 578 people who had come,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/massive-rush-at-vax-centres-on-last-day-before-supply-to-pvt-hosps-stops/articleshow/82334031.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Hyderabad||Telangana's peak case load likely in 10 days: Experts||HYDERABAD: Even as the Covid-19 cases in second wave are increasing and the daily count is breaking the earlier records, an analysis has shown that Telangana has an R value of 1.5 if the estimated figures of April are taken into consideration. Technically, R value of 1 means 100 infected people will be infecting another 100 people. Telangana has an R value of 1.5, which means that every 100 infected people will infect 150 people who, in turn, will infect another 225 people. The R number is a key factor in gauging the pandemic and refers to the effective ‘reproduction number’ of Covid-19. “The 225 people would infect 338. In three rounds of infection, the number of people with the virus would have more than quadrupled to 438,” an expert said. This explains why the coronavirus was able to spread at a fast clip among the people, he explained. Experts said an R of less than 1 means that the virus will eventually die down. “The lower the R, the more quickly the virus will peter out. An R of 0.5 means that 100 people would infect only 50, who would infect 25, who would infect 13,” an expert said. A team of professors from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and Hyderabad used the ‘susceptible, undetected, tested (positive) and removed approach’ (SUTRA) model to estimate the case load in the country and R values a few days ago, which was published in medRxiv, an Internet site distributing unpublished e-prints on health sciences. Experts said an R value of 1 is an important threshold to assess the pandemic and its spread. “Though we have not looked at revised numbers of Telangana in the absence of cumulative numbers of districts, the peak case load will be in next 10 days in Telangana,” professor Vidya Sagar, national science chair, IIT-Hyderabad, said. Looking at the numbers made available in the health bulletins, the daily count will be around 8,000 constantly and in next few days about 80,000 cases will be added, he explained. Experts said an assertive R value will give an idea on how much population is still susceptible to infection. In this scenario, as the cases go up, more number of people will be infected, while the number of vulnerable people will come down. Though an estimation is not made on the assertive R value, health experts and doctors said much will depend on people and their behaviour. “A face mask is still people’s biggest weapon. Vaccination will take some more time. The more we are disciplined, chances of bringing the R value down are more. The chance of one person infecting another person will come down automatically,” said Dr Kiran Mandal, ICMR-certified researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-peak-case-load-likely-in-10-days-experts/articleshow/82334911.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Pune||Pune: Auto drivers cite curbs, overcharge passengers||PUNE: Kausalendra Mohta, who reached Pune from Delhi last week, was charged Rs500 by an autorickshaw driver for the trip from the airport to Shivajinagar. “After I boarded the autorickshaw, the driver told me that it would cost me more if I go by the meter since he would have to take a circuitous route to avoid barricades put up by the police. The fare was fixed at Rs400 but after I reached my destination, he asked me to pay Rs100 extra, saying he would not get any passengers on his way back,” Mohta said. A similar situation unfolded at the Pune railway station last week when two persons were charged Rs700 for a trip to Lullanagar with the autorickshaw drivers convincing them that there was a full lockdown and a longer route needed to be taken. Many autorickshaw drivers said that they don’t have any choice. “Now, I hardly get two to three passengers daily from the earlier 20 to 25. From making Rs800 to Rs900 per day, I make just Rs150 to Rs200 daily. The state government is yet to start the registration system, which would have allowed us to receive grants. What do we do under such circumstances? A majority of us are not ready to go by the meter now,” an autorickshaw driver said. Last week the police caught around 200 autorickshaw drivers for overcharging from the Pune station, but let them off with a warning. “We need at least some money daily to survive,” said another driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-drivers-cite-curbs-overcharge-passengers/articleshow/82334908.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||8 operated for mucormycosis, half of them have lost eyesight||ENT specialists, dentists and neurologists are seeing a sudden spike in mucormycosis, a deadly fungal infection, in recovered Covid-19 patients. Use of steroids in treating diabetic patients for Covid-19 is leading to the fungal infection in many cases, say doctorsNagpur: Eight patients were operated for a deadly fungal infection mucormycosis at a leading hospital in the city in the last 48 hours. At least half of them have lost their eyesight for life. Doctors – right from infectious disease specialists, head and neck surgeons, intensive care specialists, ENT specialists, dentists, maxillofacial surgeons, neurologists, diabetologists and general physicians – are worried about the sudden spike in mucormycosis cases. Experts told TOI that this is just the beginning as central India has number of diabetic patients and the extent of Covid-19 infection is such that they need steroids to get over it. Use of steroids is allowing the fungal infection to become active in a patient’s body. “Mucormycosis is a new, unforeseen challenge and devastating complication of Covid-19 infection. Sinonasal, orbital and rhinocerebral, all types of mucormycosis are on rise in post Covid-19 patients,” said veteran head and neck surgery Dr Madan Kapre. Dr Kapre further said that treatment planning and execution requires coordinated efforts between ENT surgeons, infectious disease specialists and intensive care experts. In infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade’s words, “It’s raining mucor. It’s really painful to see young and elderly suffering. People are losing their battle to mucor post Covid,” she said. Dr Tayade stressed awareness, early referral, early intervention, good sugar control, cutting down steroids and reviewing the infection control practices to manage mucormycosis. Dr Ramakrishna Shenoi, professor & head, Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery at VSPM Dental College, said that low immunity, diabetes and prolonged hospitalization gives fungul infection full chance to attack. “Many of the drugs administered to severely infected patients during Covid-19 are life-saving but may induce the growth of the fungus that can spread into the sinuses present in the facial bones such as maxillary sinus, ethmoidal sinuses, frontal sinus etc and can cause extensive tissue destruction and disfigurement,” he said. Doctors told TOI that diabetic patients suffering from Covid-19 must keep their sugar under control. They must not ignore symptoms like sinusitis, blackish nasal discharge, facial pain, headaches and pain around the eyes. “This was not the case in the first wave of Covid-19 in September,” said Dr Chandrashekhar Bande, maxillofacial surgeon and dentist. Most of the patients start experiencing toothache and facial pain and first report to dentists. So, dentists should be aware about the latest developments about this infection. “As soon as body’s immunity is compromised due to Covid-19 medication, it seizes the opportunity and attacks,” said Dr Bhande. Long time use of steroids, uncontrolled diabetes and nutritional deflection are the causes of mucormycosis. According to Dr Bhande, one out of 10 diabetic patients who suffers from Covid-19 is experiencing some or the other form of mucormycosis. The worst is rhinocerebral mucormycosis which starts from the sinuses, and moves very fast to nasal passages, oral cavity, and finally brain. People lose their teeth, jaw, eyes and many bones if this infection is not treated on time. Maxillofacial surgeons can reconstruct the lost parts of face, but it’s a time-consuming and costly affair. Even treatment for mucormycosis is costly and best way of prevention is to keep blood sugar under control. Neurologist Dr Dhruv Batra said that diabetic patients who recovered from Covid-19 should not ignore a prolonged headache. “I am coming across unusually high number of patients with mucormycosis in second wave of Covid-19. We conduct the MRI which shows that the fungus is growing rapidly,” he said. According to Dr Batra, early detection and timely surgical intervention ensures less damage. Diabetologist Dr Mohan Nerkar said people who are obese, have uncontrolled diabetes and took high dose of steroids are more prone to mucormycosis. “Faulty prone position with high flow oxygen too can leave sinus injured which makes it vulnerable to the fungal infection. I suggest iron depression therapy and anti-fungal medication during Covid treatment and tight control on sugar and steroids to prevent the disease,” he said. According to Dr (Major) Vaibhav A Chandankhede from ENT department of IGGMCH, it’s necessary to report early for an early diagnosis and evaluation to minimize and control this opportunistic co-infection. “Both medical and surgical treatments are available,” he said. First case of lungs The first case of post Covid mucormycosis of lung has been detected on April 30 in Getwell Hospital. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar said that the patient reported with post Covid complaints. “Doctors are giving steroids from day one which is wrong, Steroids are not to be given from day of diagnosis but indicated only when oxygen saturation drops or after a week in case of severe pneumonia,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/8-operated-for-mucormycosis-half-of-them-have-lost-eyesight/articleshow/82334039.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

BSES discoms are geared-up on all these aspects to meet the demand of over 4.5 million consumers and around 18 million residents in south, west, east and central Delhi,” a BSES spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/discoms-gear-up-to-meet-high-demand/articleshow/82347864.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Pakistan’s ancient Katas Raj temples back under control of govt board||Amritsar: The administrative control of the Katas Raj cluster of temples is back under Pakistan government’s Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB). The ancient Hindu shrine had been under the administrative control of the archaeology department of Pakistan’s Punjab province since 2006. ETPB chairman Aamer Ahmed informed TOI on Friday, “ETPB had been looking after the management of religious rituals. Yesterday, we took over the administrative control of temple complex from the provincial government.” ETPB secretary (Hindu shrines) Faraz Abbas said Pakistan’s former prime minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain had performed the groundbreaking ceremony for restoring Katasraj cluster of temples, while handing its management to Pakistan Punjab’s archaeology department in 2006. The cluster of temples is situated about 6km from Choa Saiden Shah in Chakwal district of Pakistan. The temples are largely dedicated to Lord Shiva and have been existing there since the times of Mahabharata. The myth is that Pandavas had spent substantial time of their exile at this place. Ahmed said the divison of control had been creating troubles in managing the shrine. “Now, there is only one agency which will look after the Katasraj cluster of temples and we will make sure that things improve,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pakistans-ancient-katas-raj-temples-back-under-control-of-govt-board/articleshow/82334945.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Kolkata||Health workers at Cov patients’ service skip voting||Kolkata: When people in Bengal were casting votes, some healthcare workers were busy fighting the war against the coronavirus. Not that none of them wanted to exercise the franchise, rather they chose to stay put in the Covid wards of hospitals and attended to the patients. With 300-plus Covid patients admitted in the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BGH), the preference of the infectious diseases specialist, Yogiraj Ray, went to his patients. A voter of Berhampore constituency that went to polls on Thursday, Ray would have loved his vote to be counted. But travelling to his native place would have meant that his patients would have been deprived of his service for at least two days. “Almost all patients admitted in our hospital need oxygen support while many of them need meticulous monitoring. It is like a war zone. Given this situation, I couldn’t have taken the luxury of going to my hometown to cast my vote,” said Ray. An assistant professor at School of Tropical Medicine (STM) Kolkata, Ray was roped in at ID&BGH at the beginning of the pandemic last year. When the first wave was over, he was released to STM in March this year, only to be called back to the state’s nodal hospital for Covid-19 four weeks later as cases started spiking. “There is already a manpower crisis in the face of the surge in Covid cases. Instead of spending time in the queue to cast my vote, I preferred to report to duty sharp on time so that I could attend to maximum number of patients,” said Anindita Sarkar, a nurse at the Covid ward of a government hospital. Emergency medicine consultants Anindya Dasgupta and Uttpal Brahma of Rabindranth Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences were planning to take out an hour from hospital to cast their votes. But none could step out because the patients needed them. “As a citizen I would have wanted my vote to make a difference. But with so many patients needing care, attending to them was more important to me than going to vote,” said Brahma. The Covid wards in all hospitals, both government and private facilities, are fully occupied. Doctors said that during the second wave most of the patients coming to the hospitals require oxygen support. “It would have been my first time if I had cast my vote. But with patients being on a rise in the Covid ward, I chose to stay in the caring for patients rather than visiting my native place,” said a young nurse at CMRI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-workers-at-cov-patients-service-skip-voting/articleshow/82334051.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Pune||Pune: Police get ‘unnecessary & frivolous’ e-pass requests||PUNE: The city police said they had been inundated with applications for e-passes for travel, most of which were unnecessary and some even frivolous. The e-pass system was started on April 23 in view of the strict, lockdown-like restrictions. Since then, the 24-strong team of officers set up for this purpose has been working round the clock, fielding an average of 4,000 applications per day. Police said many of these applications were for travel from one area of Pune to another, which was not necessary; some other applications were for a holiday to Goa, which they said was irresponsible. Deputy commissioner of police Shrinivas Ghadge, the nodal officer for e-passes, told TOI these unnecessary applications were creating pressure on the special team and wasting their time. “A major problem is applications to moving within the city limits. We would like to clarify that people don’t need an e-pass to travel within the district,” Ghadge said. He said they were also getting e-pass requests for tourism. “We get applications for travel from Pune to Goa. The e-pass is to be issued only for emergency travel purpose,” Ghadge added. Flyers seek exemption Passengers from the city who need to travel to Mumbai to catch flights have demanded an exemption from the e-pass system. “We have a valid air ticket, which should be proof enough,” Sovit Surya, who is slated to fly to Kolkata on Monday, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-get-unnecessary-frivolous-e-pass-requests/articleshow/82334958.cms||Joy Sengupta

The incident came to light when farm owner Ramesh Shelke went to the well to start the motor pump on Thursday morning and spotted the floating carcass. Forest officials said the animal might have come to the farm in search of prey, as there were sheep in the nearby areas. Junnar range forest officer Ajit Shinde told TOI, “The well had no compound wall. Since there are sheep in nearby areas, we suspect that the animal came to hunt but fell into the well instead. Unfortunately, her head got stuck in a plastic bag.” A veterenary doctor at Manikdoh leopard rescue centre carried out the post mortem of the dead animal. “A preliminary investigation revealed that it died due to suffocation. We have sent samples to a laboratory in Pune,” Shinde added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leopard-falls-into-well-dies-as-head-gets-stuck-in-plastic-bag/articleshow/82335001.cms||---

LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan said the exit poll surveys confirmed the LDF government’s public acceptance. “Kerala society wishes for a continuation of the LDFgovernment. That’s going to become a reality. It would be a heavy blow to the Congress-led UDF,” he said. Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the poll surveys that television news channels had started broadcasting on Thursday were absolutely baseless as they failed to reflect the way people have voted against the Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala. Recalling how the poll surveys that predicted an upper hand for LDF in the Lok Sabha elections proved wrong, Chennithala said the UDF doesn’t believe in such surveys. “We are fully confident. We would get the majority to form the next government. People want to put an end to the government that is engaged in corruption and nepotism. This would be proved when votes are counted on Sunday,” he said. Meanwhile, UDF has also initiated a morale-boosting exercise to kindle the spirit of its rank and file. In a circular issued addressing UDF election agents and counting agents, Chennithala, who is also the chairman of UDF, said the exit poll results were manipulated ones. Chennithala asked the counting agents at the postal ballot tables to handle the counting resolutely. “If the result comes with a narrow margin and is not favourable to the UDF, the chief election agents should demand recounting in writing,” Chennithala said. IUML rejects exit poll results IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty rejected the exit polls which predicted an upper hand for LDF in assembly polls and said that these surveys are totally unreliable. He added that the conflicting results provided by many surveys have exposed the fact that they were conducted in an unscientific manner. “We suspect that such surveys are detrimental to the conduct of fair counting of votes as it could demoralize counting agents. The surveys conducted by various agencies are contradictory in nature. For instance, one survey has said that UDF won’t get a single seat in Kozhikode while another survey has said the front will bag nine seats. That shows that the surveys are unreliable,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-welcomes-udf-decries-exit-poll-results/articleshow/82334048.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

RT-PCR tests cost Rs 500 if person walks into the laboratory, Rs 600 for a hospital test, and Rs 800 if samples are collected from home. A state health official said strict action will be taken against private laboratories that do not follow the government rates. Consumables and the kits cost Rs 150-200 and so there is no loss, he added.A city based laboratory’s in-charge said capping of prices has reduced the profit margin with rising home visits. The state is conducting 2 to 2.5 lakh tests daily of which 1.5 lakh are RT-PCR tests. Of these, 40,000 tests are conducted in Pune district.Another laboratory said the cost of the viral transport medium had gone up. Though they carry out tests in Mumbai and Pune, they are unable to expand as operational cost is high and test rates are low. Four new mobile laboratories will be in operation from May 1, CEO of Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Mission Sudhakar Shinde said, who heads the committee on testing rates. The labs will work in in Nashik, Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad using Feluda kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/small-testing-labs-feel-the-pinch-over-govt-set-rates/articleshow/82334990.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A division bench comprising justices Devan Ramachandran and MR Anitha said it is of the prima facie view that section 66(1)(b) of Factories Act, which restricts women from working between 7pm and 6am, is not intended to curb opportunities of women. In the present era, it is imperative for the employer to ensure that women are given sufficient protection to work at all times.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Cops rescue baby lying next to dead mother for two days||PUNE: Two women constables from the Dighi police on Tuesday rescued a one-year-old boy lying quietly next to the body of his mother in their house at Phuge Vasti in Pimpri Chinchwad. Police suspect the baby’s mother might have died a couple of days back. The neighbours knew about her death when foul smell started emanating from the house but, fearing Covid, they did not help the boy who was starving for at least two days. The two constables, Sushila Gabhale and Rekha Vaje, fed the baby milk and biscuits and took him to a hospital after he regained senses. “The boy tested negative for Covid-19. According to the directives of the Child Welfare Committee, we have shifted him to a child care home,” senior inspector Mohan Shinde of the Dighi police said. Shinde said, “The reason behind the death of the baby’s mother, Saraswati Rajesh Kumar (29), is not known. After the post-mortem, her viscera has been preserved for chemical analysis.” Shinde said Saraswati’s husband, Rajesh Kumar, was a daily wager. About six months ago, the family had come to Dighi from Uttar Pradesh and was staying in a rented accommodation. “Last month, the woman’s husband had gone to UP for some personal work. Since then, she was staying alone with her son,” he said. Shinde said one of the neighbours informed the landlord on Tuesday that Saraswati had not opened the door for two days. “When the landlord tried to look inside the window, he got a whiff of foul smell and alerted us,” he said. The police found the woman dead on entering the house. “But her son was alive. We tried to seek help from the neighbours but, in the current situation, everyone was reluctant. So, our two women constables took charge of the baby and fed him. He is fine now. We have informed the woman’s husband. He is yet to reach Pune,” Shinde said. The Dighi police have registered a case of accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-rescue-baby-lying-next-to-dead-mother-for-two-days/articleshow/82335009.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government extends night curfew after high court prodding||HYDERABAD: After the high court made it clear that it won’t accept procrastination and will step in to enforce a strict Covid-19 protocol to check the spread of the cases, the Telangana government on Friday said the night curfew had been extended till May 8. The judges took a serious view of the government’s delaying tactics on imposing lockdown or extending the night curfew. “We do not accept filibustering. If you do not decide, then we will take that decision,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy warned and insisted on a firm decision from the government. As the night curfew ended by Friday, the high court made it compulsory for the government to take a call on extension of the curfew or introduction of a stricter regime to combat the spiralling cases. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar’s claims that the government was still deliberating on the issue and that it would take an appropriate decision after assessing the situation did not cut much ice with the court. In a veiled warning, the judges said: “We are still leaving it to you because it is in the executive domain and we do not intend to interfere unless you force us to do so.” At this, advocate general BS Prasad took time and got back to the court in the afternoon conveying the decision of the government to extend the night curfew till May 8. The judges then verified with the state counsel if the government has consented to hold any more elections to the local bodies. The AG replied that there were no elections planned. He informed the judges that sale of liquor had been banned and that there will be no liquor sale on the counting day from 8 am till the conclusion of the counting process. The judges wondered whether the government would allow celebrations and rallies by winners after the counting as flow of liquor in such celebrations is normal. Prasad said the SEC and the government have decided not to allow any victory rally or celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-extends-night-curfew-after-hc-prodding/articleshow/82335014.cms||---

The region added more than 2.95 lakh patients in April as against over 2.57 lakh recoveries, data provided by the district health office showed. In February, PMR recovery rate stood at 82%, which dived to 59% in March due to the rapid rise in cases. However, it jumped to 87% in April, following timely intervention by the health authorities. The data showed that the recoveries in the Pune municipal limits have been on the rise since the last two weeks, pushing up the overall recoveries in April. For 10 continuous days (April 18-27), the recoveries in the PMC limits stayed above the daily new cases. Even in PMR, for 10 days in April, the discharges were more than the daily positive tally. A senior health official said the region reported 5-digit recoveries on several days in April. The gap between the daily cases and recoveries also reduced considerably after mid-April, the official said. He said the rise in discharges has also pushed down the active caseload in the region. “At the end of March, the progressive recovery rate of PMR was at 86% and it is in the same range now. Efforts are on to treat the serious patients to keep the fatality rate low,” the official said. A PMC official said, “The city has recorded good recoveries in the last two weeks, however, the critical cases and those on the oxygen support are still to report a drop. Most recoveries have been of the patients in home isolation with mild symptoms. We are putting efforts to provide required medical assistance to the serious patients.” Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical chief at PMC, said people should continue to follow the social distancing and mask norms to keep the cases in check. “The citizens are appealed not to ignore the symptoms and go for testing and treatment immediately,” he said. Recoveries in PMR April : 87% Cases: 2.95 lakh. Discharges: 2.57 lakh March: 59% Cases: 1.26 lakh. Discharges: 74,087 February: 81% Cases: 28,696.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab rules out lockdown, 6 worst-hit districts to tighten micro containment strategy||Chandigarh: Ruling out a complete lockdown for now, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday directed deputy commissioners (DCs) of the six worst-affected districts to further tighten the micro-containment strategy and ensure 100% testing. “Lockdown is not a solution, as it will lead to an exodus of labourers and force them to go to states with even lesser medical facilities,” said Amarinder, directing the district administrations to enforce all restrictions strictly and to stop dine-in facility in all high positivity areas, with Covid testing of staff in restaurants by the health department. Urging the industry to set up their own Covid treatment centres and makeshift hospitals to treat their labourers suffering from mild/moderate infection, he stressed on teamwork to fight the Covid battle. He also directed the chief secretary to look into encouraging retired doctors and nurses, along with final year MBBS students, to rejoin for handling L2/L3 facilities, and suggested setting up of temporary health care facilities in halls/gymnasiums. Amarinder was chairing a virtual emergency meeting to review the Covid situation in the six worst-hit districts of Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala, and Amritsar. Expressing concern over the fewer number of containment zones in Mohali and two other districts that were among the most badly hit, the CM ordered immediate steps to strengthen the containment and testing mechanism. The micro-containment strategy must be strictly implemented and encouraged, he said, directing all district officers to give this their highest priority to control the spread. He expressed concern over the fact that 14 districts in the state currently had over 10% positivity rate, while five had more than 60% bed occupancy. A prefab 100-bed hospital will come up in Mohali and a 250-bed temporary hospital is being set up near the Bathinda refinery, with oxygen supply from the refinery, he said, urging all departments to be prepared for the peak and identify areas in the various districts for the establishment of temporary hospitals. While the occupancy at level 2 is still manageable, it has already reached 82% in level 3. An additional 2,000 beds are being added in Punjab with 600 beds at GMCH, Patiala, and Amritsar, he said. Taking note of the shortage of “Fateh Kits”, mainly on account of lack of oxymeters, he acceded to the suggestion to request recovered patients to return their oximeters for use in kits after proper sanitisation. Dr K K Talwar, who heads the Covid expert group advising the state government said all hospitals had been provided detailed guidelines to check oxygen wastage. Ludhiana DC Virendra Kumar said the defunct oxygen unit at Vardhman mills had been revived, and so had been another. The district, with positivity standing at 16% as of April 30, was getting a large number of patients from other places, including several from Delhi and Gurgaon, he said. There are currently two containment and eight micro containment zones in the district. Earlier, health secretary Hussan Lal pointed to the rising positivity and case fatality ratio and disclosed that Punjab positivity rate currently stood at 12, with Mohali) reporting the highest at 22.9. PU ADVISED NOT TO HOLD SENATE POLLS Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan said Panjab University, Chandigarh had been advised not to hold senate elections at present in view of the grave situation. AMRITSAR DC FLAGS OXYGEN CRISIS Amritsar DC and police commissioner raised concerns over the oxygen crisis, which needed firefighting every day through emergency supplies from other districts via green corridors. Oxygen audits were being done in both government and private hospitals, they said. Medical education minister O P Soni informed the meeting that OPDs in all medical colleges in Amritsar had been closed and staff diverted to Covid duty. 90% BED OCCUPANCY IN MOHALI The worst affected Mohali district was currently showing 90% bed occupancy, the meeting was informed, with DC Girish Dayalan disclosing that a large number of patients had come from Delhi-NCR. With other regions in the Tricity not agreeing to a weekend lockdown, the situation was grim, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-rules-out-lockdown-6-worst-hit-districts-to-tighten-micro-containment-strategy/articleshow/82334072.cms||---

KCR on Friday ordered a probe into allegations that Eatala has encroached several acres of assigned land to expand his hatchery, Jamuna Hatcheries. Although the note issued by the state government for a probe by the vigilance department does not mention Eatala directly, it is clear who it is aimed at. The health minister, on the other hand, responded aggressively to the allegations and asked for a probe by a sitting judge. Eatala called it a pre-planned conspiracy to defame him and that he was ready for any punishment if a fair inquiry proves he had grabbed land. Asked if he would resign, the minister said, “Let the government complete the inquiry. I will rub my nose on the ground if it is proved that I have grabbed land.” The probe was ordered following a complaint lodged by some farmers to KCR alleging that the minister and his associates grabbed nearly 100 acres of assigned land allotted to them on the outskirts of Achampet and Hakimpet in Masaipet mandal of Medak district. They appealed to KCR to restore the land to them. Sources in TRS said that KCR and Eatala had not been on the same page for some time. Eatala had been attacking the Centre for the past couple of days for botching up vaccine supply even as KCR and other ministers had maintained a studied silence. Earlier, there were also reports of Eatala talking about the need for a new political party led by the leaders from Backward Classes, but he had denied the talk. He belongs to Mudiraj community, a strong BC caste in Telangana. Opposition parties reacted sharply to the development, with BJP state chief spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao demanding an explanation from CM KCR on accusations of land grabbing by his senior cabinet colleague. “BJP stands vindicated on its charge that CM KCR is leading a corrupt government and most of his ministers and MLAs are land grabbers,” he said. Terming it as a political conspiracy against a minister from the BC community, AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan said if the heads were to roll in the KCR government for land grabbing allegations, it should begin with TRS working president and municipal minister KT Rama Rao (KTR) who, Congress MP A Revanth Reddy had charged with owning an illegal farmhouse. KTR had denied the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/probe-into-land-grab-charge-kcr-eatala-fight-out-in-open/articleshow/82336075.cms||Roushan Ali

He said that Delhi government is yet to receive vaccines from the companies and after the doses arrive in a day or two, the government will begin the drive after due announcement. “Beginning May 1, the vaccination drive for those between 18-44 years is set to begin. The drive for those aged 45 and above is already in motion,” Kejriwal said addressing a digital press conference. “We have not yet received the vaccine and are in continuous touch with the companies and hope the vaccines will be delivered in a day or two. We’ve been assured of this,” he said, adding that the third phase of the drive has received an overwhelming response and many people have registered for getting the jab. Kejriwal said that three lakh Covishield vaccines are to be delivered by Saturday or Sunday and thereafter more doses will arrive. “It is therefore my humble request that you not queue up at the centres, for this should not lead to a law and order situation or hinder social distancing protocols,” he said. “Once we get the vaccines, we will make an official announcement, following which, only those who are registered and given appointments are to come to the vaccination centres. I request everyone, not to rush,” he said. “Each and every person will be vaccinated. The Centre and Delhi government are working together, and only once all of us are on the same page, can we be guaranteed success,” he said. Kejriwal said that both the manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin have been urged to provide 67 lakh doses each within three months, for which Delhi government is prepared to bear the financial costs. “The people of Delhi will be provided the vaccines for free and we have also demanded a schedule from both the companies specifying the days when they will supply the vaccines within these three months,” he said. “We are trying our best that within the next three months the entire population of Delhi gets vaccinated. We have formulated a plan and even the infrastructure needed for this is in place. Now it will depend on the two companies how swiftly they can provide us with the vaccine,” he said. “If they are able to provide sufficient quantities, then we will try to inoculate the people of Delhi within three months,” he added. Kejriwal said that it has been observed that those who have been inoculated are comparatively better off than those who haven’t. “It is not that they are prevented from catching Covid-19 but even if they do, it is not fatal and does not turn into something serious. The vaccine acts as a protective shield,” he said, urging everyone to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-queue-up-for-your-jabs-yet-vaccines-not-in-kejriwal/articleshow/82334117.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Chandigarh||Temporary cremation ground set up in Pkl||Panchkula/Mohali: A temporary cremation ground has been set up adjoining the existing one in Sector 20, Panchkula, which is overbooked. Cremation workers have also set up platforms at the ground.A worker said when a body is brought as per the Covid protocol, it cannot be kept for a longer duration, so arrangements have been made. He said, “We had maximum bookings of Covid patients. It was around 60% of the total bodies received at the cremation ground. Two days ago, the ground was full of bodies burning. So, we have set up a temporary cremation ground at the adjoining vacant land.” A gasifier chamber started operations at the Sector 20 crematorium on Friday. On the day, the bodies of 15 corona patients arrived at the crematorium, of which 14 were cremated at the ground and one in the gasifier chamber. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said the gasifier chamber was needed due to increase in the number of deaths and it was set up at a cost of Rs 70 lakh. Mayor appealed to the people to stay at home to avoid infection and get out only if the work is important. In view of the increasing number of deaths due to coronavirus in Mohali, a team of Mohali MC, led by mayor Amarjit Singh Jeeti, visited the crematorium and issued instructions to the authorities. Sidhu said MC officials told him that about eight bodies were cremated daily in Mohali, but the number has increased to 20 during the second wave of Covid. He said there was an electric crematorium as well, where four to five bodies were being cremated daily. Sidhu said CCTV cameras have been installed at the crematorium and he has requested the Mohali Industries Association to provide another funeral van so that bodies could be taken to for last rites with respect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/temporary-cremation-ground-set-up-in-pkl/articleshow/82334079.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: LSGD sets up war room to coordinate local body activities||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the wake of increasing Covid cases and local bodies having a significant role to play in undertaking field-level activities, local self-government department (LSGD) has set up a war room to coordinate the activities of local bodies. The war room has been set up by including representatives from panchayat directorate, urban directorate, rural development commissionerate, town and country planning department, Suchitwa Mission, MGNREGS and Kudumbashree. Heads of these departments have been asked to nominate one officer, who is not below the rank of an assistant director, as a representative of the concerned department to the war room. The main task of the war room will be the analysis of data, made available from the health department, and coordinating tasks of nodal officers who have been appointed to each local body across the state. The war room will instruct them on the issues that need focus based on the data from health department. The data will be on test positivity rates, vaccination, functioning of FLTCs, details of ambulances that are pressed into Covid duty in each local body, updates on Covid Jagratha portal, details of volunteers in Covid control duty and the funds spent on Covid duty by each local body. The nodal officers appointed to each local body, would report to the president and the secretary of the concerned local body without becoming a parallel reporting authority. The nodal officers should also share the report of shortcomings, if any, and the activities being undertaken in each local body to the concerned local body president and the secretary, district disaster management authority (DDMA) and the war room. The nodal officers would be appointed from a pool of officials, selected by the DDMA. Last week, government had come up with detailed guidelines on the role and responsibilities of local bodies in fighting the pandemic. Government had issued guidelines amid criticism from various districts that local bodies aren’t active as they were during the first wave of the pandemic last year. According to the order, local bodies should form ward-level monitoring committees and rapid response teams that are responsible for community surveillance in wards, create awareness among the public about symptoms and testing, undertake immediate measures in case of emergency, ensure that people follow Covid protocol and large-scale gathering and unsafe travel are controlled. The committees also have the task of ensuring that those in home quarantine receive proper facilities, failing which they must be taken to FLTCs. In places where prohibitory orders are prevailing under CrPC Section 144, local bodies are tasked with ensuring the functioning of community kitchens. Ensuring proper and scientific disposal of waste, especially used masks, PPE kits, gloves and other biomedical wastes also forms a major task of local bodies. Local bodies had played a significant role in undertaking community-level containment activities during the first wave of the pandemic last year. However, in most local bodies, the then existing team was changed after election in December 2020 and new teams are yet to get accustomed to their roles and responsibilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lsgd-sets-up-war-room-to-coordinate-local-body-activities/articleshow/82334091.cms||KP Saikiran

Looking at these figures, it is evident that most patients rushing to hospitals are just panicky about the current situation, say health officials. A hospital official said that the district administration has set up two Covid care centres in two different directions of the city and doctors will discharge those patients who can be quarantined at home or can get treatment at care centres so that only critical patients can get beds and treatment in JLN hospital. Doctors said that they have started reviewing every patient admitted in JLN hospital and discharging those who have recovered or have mild symptoms. Sources said that before starting this process, doctors asked the district administration to close the doors of hospital and put all attendants and relatives out otherwise there can be security problems.

The authorities of GDMC were then asked to start testing by the government and a team of few doctors and technicians made it possible in a bare minimum time of 30 days. Since it came into existence, in April 2020, the lab is back-bone of Covid testing in Doon as well as in Garhwal region and is continuously working non-stop even when almost half of its staffers---which includes technicians as young as 22-year-old --- tested positive in the last one month. Dr Ashutosh Sayana, principal Government Doon Medical College told TOI that the medical college managed to get the high-end machines, train the staff and got accreditation from ICMR in a short span of two weeks. “We had an online inspection from ICMR for the approval of the lab. Then our staff had to undergo one day training at PGI Chandigarh. After this, we got a nod from ICMR to go ahead with Covid testing,” added Dr Sayana. Dr Shekhar Pal, principal investigator of VRDL and HOD, Department of Microbiology said that the lab at GDMC is of Bio Safety Level-2 (BSL2) at present and proposal for upgrading it to BSL-3 has already been sent to ICMR. “Once we get the BSL3 certification, we will start research of virus-related strains and even for vaccines at our lab,” he added. Talking about the year- long journey of the lab, Dr Deepak Juyal, assistant professor, department of microbiology said that it has been a roller-coaster ride. “On April 25, 2020, we tested 16 samples.A year on, we have completed testing over 2.3 lakh samples which is highest in the state, even more than AIIMS Rishikesh, that has two testing labs.”“On April 25, 2020, we tested 16 samples.A year on, we have completed testing over 2.3 lakh samples which is highest in the state, even more than AIIMS Rishikesh, that has two testing labs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amidst-challenges-and-staff-crunch-biggest-govt-virology-lab-at-govt-doon-medical-college-doing-maximum-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/82333291.cms||Ishita Mishra

Like many states in the country, Punjab is going through the worst phase of the pandemic with the number of new infections skyrocketing. As the surge shows no signs of abating, pressure on already stress limited resources will mount in the coming days, hampering the state’s response. As per the hospital occupancy report, about 85% of ICUs and 50% of oxygen beds were occupied till the noon of April 30. Out of 2,036 ICU beds — 550 in government and 1,486 in private hospitals — only 309 were available: 10 in government and 299 in private. The state has a total of 8,871 beds fitted with oxygen supply, of which 4,514 were available. Due to the rise in the number of new patients getting critically ill, the occupancy of ICUs and oxygen beds has gone up recently. Sample this: A total of 67 new patients required ICU support on April 29, the number of which was 20 on April 28, 40 on April 27 and 13 on April 26. As on April 29, as many as 648 patients were on oxygen support. Maximum occupancy of Level III facilities has been reported in districts reporting heavy caseload that include Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala and Bathinda. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar shared that the state government has decided to increase the number of Level III beds in all the medical colleges and the private hospitals have also been asked to enhance their existing capacity. There are about 200 private hospitals that are supporting the government in the fight against the pandemic. Besides, there is a plan to increase the count of Level II beds in all the districts hospitals. “The situation is being monitored on a real-time basis and the bed capacity is being enhanced accordingly,” said Dr Bhaskar. Districts Without Level III Beds Eight districts — Barnala, Fazilka, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Mansa, Ropar, Sangrur and Muktsar — without any Level III facilities. Of these districts, there has been a considerable rise in the number of Covid deaths in Gurdaspur, Sangrur, Muktsar and Fazilka. Neck-and-Neck With a steep rise in patients requiring oxygen support, the daily medical oxygen consumption has touched 222 MT while the daily availability is about 227 MT. Of the total, the central government’s allocation is 177 MT and the state’s own sources contribute 50 MT. Anticipating a rise in demand, the Punjab government has written to the Union government for enhancing its allocation. Of total available oxygen, a maximum of 60 MT is being consumed in Ludhiana, 32 MT in Jalandhar, 29 MT in Mohali, 26 MT in Amritsar, 24 MT in Patiala and 17 MT in Bathinda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-surge-overwhelms-level-iii-facilities-in-punjab/articleshow/82334099.cms||Vinod Kumar

Though Mohali had earlier imposed weekend lockdown, the Haryana government did so on Friday. In the review meeting in the afternoon, it was first decided not to impose weekend lockdown, but later in the evening, the UT administration issued orders for its imposition.Former PGI director Dr KK Talwar and Dr GD Puri, professor and head of anaesthesia, PGI, attended the meeting along with UT officials. In the meeting chaired by the UT administrator, it was decided that GMCH-32 would set up additional 20 beds of L3 on its campus. Additional 30 beds would be set up on the first floor of the Sector 48 Covid hospital to provide A2-level facility. It was also decided that a pipeline for oxygen be laid at the earliest.The physical OPDs in GMCH-32 would be closed, so that the doctors could concentrate on corona patients. Only Emergency would be kept open. It was decided that final-year students of MBBS and nursing would assist doctors and nurses. The GMCH-32 would create a plasma bank, and hospital’s faculty staff would be asked to join Covid-related work, the meeting agreed. For better Covid management, final-year medical students would replace doctors sent on mobile duty outside, so that they could attend to serious patients in hospitals. The PGIMER specialists would make periodic visits to administration’s hospitals, including GMCH-32, GMH-16 and the Sector 48 Covid hospital, and give special medical advice to instill confidence in patients.The UT administrator directed the health department to ensure adequate availability of remdesivir and tocilizumab injections, both in hospitals and chemist shops.

Turns out, when it comes to transporting bodies of Covid-19 victims, these private ambulances are even forcing people to opt for a package that includes transportation and last rites at astronomical prices. On April 28, a family had to shell out Rs 82,000 for a 7km ride from KPHB road no. 1 to Hi-Tec City graveyard for the last rites of a 47-year-old man who succumbed to Covid-19. “The hospital directed us to an ambulance service who asked for Rs 82,000 for transportation and cremation. As Covid-19 bodies cannot be taken home, we had no option except to pay them as demanded,” said a relative, whose brother-in-law died of Covid-19 on April 28. The deceased was a software engineer in the city and was a resident of the Secunderabad. In another case, Rs 80,000 was charged to transport a body of a Covid-19 patient from Gandhi Hospital to the Erragadda graveyard, family members claimed. In the state, the GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (EMRI) or 108 services, run 428 ambulances. While the waiting time for an ambulance used to be about 20 minutes in urban areas and 30 minutes in rural areas, it has increased during the second wave of Covid-19. A staffer of EMRI admitted that while they used to receive about 20-30 Covid-19 calls per day about a month or two back, the number has now increased to 350-400 calls per day, making it difficult to answer all calls. As a result, many patients are forced to depend on private players for an ambulance to transport Covid-19 infected people to hospital. “We had to shell out Rs 12, 500 and 8, 500 to transport two patients from Habsiguda to a hospital in Madinaguda,” said Srinivas B, adding that normally it hardly costs Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000. In yet another case, a family said that they had to pay Rs 8,500 to reach Osmania General Hospital from Kukatpally. Sai Teja of Feed the Needy NGO, said families were desperate and ambulance operators are trying to cash in on their misery. “The state should immediately bring in regulations on ambulance and cremation charges,” Teja added. Cyberabad and Rachakonda poice commissionerate officials said they have also started free ambulance services to help patients, and promised to crack down on private operators. “People can approach us if they are fleeced by ambulance service providers,” said VC Sajjanar, Cyberabad police commissioner. “We also urge the public to make use of free services started by the police instead of opting for private players. There is not much waiting time for the ambulance or last rite services run by the police,” he added. GVK EMRI has also added another 79 ambulances as part of the ‘Gift a Smile’ programme to serve more patients in less time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-rip-off-rs-82000-charge-for-7km-ambulance-ride/articleshow/82336079.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The prospectus for both diploma and second year direct entry seats has been released by the directorate on its website. However, the actual dates for form submissions and other academic activities will be notified later, DTE said. “Schedule of admission activities, including details of submission of application forms, display of eligibility and merit lists, and conduct of rounds of admissions for various courses shall be notified on DTE website, by end of July, 2021,” the directorate said, with regards to admission to direct second year entry seats. A percentage of seats at second year of the degree programme in engineering and pharmacy are reserved by the DTE for diploma holders in engineering and pharmacy and BSc graduates to seek admissions to the degree programme. The scheme is meant to provide lateral growth to diploma and BSc degree holders. Engineering students can only apply for second year degree seat in a stream in which they hold a diploma. For instance, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering stream can only seek entry to mechanical seat for second year direct entry. BSc degree holders are considered for admission to vacant seats, under direct lateral entry into second year of degree course in engineering only if any seats are left after filling them with eligible engineering diploma holders. BSc degree holders are eligible for admissions to the streams of electrical & electronics engineering, electronics and telecommunication engineering, computer engineering and information technology. Meanwhile, for admissions to diploma seats, DTE said, “Schedule of admission activities, including submission of application forms, display of eligibility and merit lists, and conduct of rounds of admissions for various courses shall be notified on DTE website.” The prospectus for both diploma and second year direct entry seats has been released by the directorate on its website.

These are not always needed. Covid-19 has two phases — the first is when the virus spreads in the body causing fever and congestion. Sometimes when it spreads to the lungs, oxygen falls and anti-viral drugs are given. The second phase is when the immune system fails, and the body inflames. That is when steroids are needed. If given early, steroids can promote viral replication which is already on in the first phase,” said Dr Guleria. The Centre also issued guidelines on the management of Covid-19 in children with rising infections being seen in those under 18 years. Guleria said health infrastructure can work to a limit and it is crucial to reduce cases, while appealing people to launch “break the chain movement” by gifting masks to those who are not complying and by preventing crowding. “Proper management is key. The pandemic is going to Tier 2, 3 cities. Training of doctors is needed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/overuse-of-steroids-could-be-counter-productive-says-aiims-chief/articleshow/82337195.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Portal says beds vacant, but ground reality different||JAIPUR: The bed availability situation is worse than what the recently launched government portal states. Out of the total 11,675 beds in the state in general category, only 4,789 beds are occupied as on Friday. Of the beds with oxygen facilities that are in short supply, the covidinfo.rajasthan.gov.in portal says, 14,466 have been occupied, while 1,741 are available for use. When it comes to ICU beds, the status says 280 out of the 2,747 are unoccupied. About 143 ICU beds with ventilators are still available. Going by the difficulties people face finding a bed or an oxygen one, the bed availability data put up by the health department does not seem to confirm the ground realities or it could be that the oxygen beds have no supply. On Friday, health minister Raghu Sharma said that Rajasthan has enough beds, but there is shortage of oxygen. In Jaipur, out of the 3,206 general beds, 1,820 are lying vacant. Of the 3,574 oxygen beds, 136 remain unoccupied. 40 ICU beds out of 994 remain available, while ICUs with ventilator beds are fully occupied. TOI tried to reach senior officials in the health department to understand why the ground reality is different from the data put up by the portal. But junior officials on the condition of anonymity said that besides oxygen the beds need to be attended to by doctors and nurses whose number is falling short in the face of rising cases. “There is huge shortage of doctors, nurses and other supporting staff. It’s not only oxygen. That’s why the bed availability data needs to be seen in totality,” he added. In districts like Chittorgarh, Kota, Sawai Madhopur, Tonk, all the oxygen beds are fully occupied. Alwar, Rajsamand, and Bikaner are better placed. But the beds become functional only if there is regular supply of oxygen. The data uploaded on the portal is live and vary from time to time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-portal-says-beds-still-vacant-but-ground-reality-different/articleshow/82335080.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Khaunte has also recommended that the state’s borders be sealed and phase-wise vaccination of all Goans above 18 years be done. Khaunte, whose constituency has 1,431 Covid cases, has also demanded that the government prepare a plan for areas like Margao, Porvorim and Candolim where infection rate is high. “As per the Centre’s parameters for areas that need targeted action, Goa has crossed the threshold mark of 10% positive testing rate. There is a need for an urgent lockdown,” he said. “The government could also tie up with call centres to respond to availablity of beds, ventilators, oxygen, etc around the clock,” the legislator added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-bats-for-15-day-lockdown/articleshow/82335074.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Send 201 tonnes of oxygen: Gehlot SOS to Centre||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday urged the Centre to send 201 metric tonne of medical oxygen on an emergency basis to the state to help it deal with the crisis arising out of the raging coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, chief secretary Niranjan Arya on Friday constituted a three-member team under ACS Subodh Agarwal to explore the sources of importing oxygen concentrators and other vital medicines from other countries. The other members of the team are Pritam B Yashwant and Tina Dabi. Gehlot said the state government needed 466 metric tonne of medical oxygen for those under treatment for Covid-19, but has only 265 metric tonne in its stock. “Today, there is a shortage of about 201 metric tonne of oxygen in Rajasthan. The number of infections in the state constitutes 5% of the total cases in the country, but oxygen allocation is just 1.6%. The state will require 550 metric tonne of oxygen within a week. Therefore, there is another request for the Central government that 201 metric tonne of oxygen be allocated to the state today as an emergency,” Gehlot tweeted. He said the number of active coronavirus cases in the state currently is 1.70 lakh and 20,400 patients require oxygen support. According to the estimate, about 12% of patients require oxygen. That means about 20,400 patients in Rajasthan today need oxygen. Based on the calculation of active cases, today the state requires 466 metric tonnes of oxygen, but currently only 265 metric tonnes of oxygen is available. The state government could not make use 185 MT of oxygen allotted from Bhavnagar in Gujarat due to the shortage of cryogenic tankers o transport the same to the state. He said the central government had taken control of oxygen and medicines for better management but if the states want to help each other, they should be allowed under the supervision of the Centre, Gehlot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/send-201mt-tonne-oxygen-gehlot-sos-to-centre/articleshow/82335088.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Jaipur||Ajmer: Gates of JLN hospital closed, only serious patients to get entry||AJMER: Looking to the security of doctors and staff, Ajmer administration on Friday closed the gates of JLN Hospital as a number of attendants are coming with Covid patients. There are three gates to enter JLN Hospital. Two gates are closed and police is deputed there while one gate is open for ambulances. Police will decide whether the patient in ambulance is serious or not. The administration has directed to review the condition of patients admitted in the hospital so that non-serious patients can be discharged and serious patients can get beds. The administration also asked doctors to review whether a patient really requires oxygen. On Friday, 580 positive cases were recorded in the district while patients and their relatives crowded at JLN Hospital. Looking to the large number of people in hospital, the district administration decided to close the gates and deployed police for 24 hours. Even Covid testing in JLN hospital has been discontinued and only critical patients will be allowed to enter the premises. The two Covid care centers opened in Satellite and Panchsheel hospitals are also full and patients here want to move to JLN Hospital for ventilators or oxygen. Sources said that doctors fear that attendants and relatives of patients can misbehave with them. Sources said that administration also asked doctors to ensure that patients of Ajmer district and those referred from other hospitals get admission first. There are reports that patients in metro cities and even from Delhi are coming to Ajmer as they feel that these small cities have facilities for treatment which are not available in Delhi. Patients from Madhya Pradesh are coming to Udaipur for treatment leading to a situation of chaos. Meanwhile, the administration continued door-to-door survey and police closed markets as per the time decided in guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gates-of-jln-hosp-closed-only-serious-patients-to-get-entry/articleshow/82335054.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai’s positivity rate drops to single digit from 28% on April 4||MUMBAI: Gains from the lockdown-like curbs are beginning to show, though only in Mumbai and a couple of other districts. The city’s daily positivity rate (PR) has dropped 50%— from 20.8% on April 1 to 9.9% on April 30—giving hope that the second wave could be ebbing. Experts said the infection continues to rage in the rest of Maharashtra with Nagpur, Nashik and Thane showing a positivity of more than 30%. Daily PR, statewide, remains as high as 23%, declining by barely 2% in the last 30 days. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said Mumbai was perhaps the only city in India with such a low PR at present. “Our positivity rate is in single digit now despite carrying out 44,000 tests,” he said. CM Uddhav Thackeray too endorsed the view that curbs had helped reduce cases. The city’s daily positivity had dropped under 5% towards the end of January before rising again through February and reaching an average of 20% in March. April began with a 21% PR that rose to a high of 28% on April 4. The same day the government announced restrictions such as night curfews, a ban on gatherings of more than five persons and shutting down of non-essential shops. The decision proved a turning point—PR slowly began to dip. More curbs on movement followed on April 14 and April 22, including banning non-essential workers from using trains. A civic official said the drop to single digit has come about after 45 days. The last time it was below 9.94% was on March 13 (9.62%). In comparison, Delhi had a PR of 32.82% on Thursday. Neighbouring Pune city’s positivity too was 26.6%. Ward officials said one of the reasons for the dip is a drop in number of index cases. Even wards like M west (Chembur) that were first to see the surge are seeing a dip. M west, where cases peaked at 392 on April 5 is now reporting less than 150; K west is down from a peak of 900 to 250-300. South Mumbai’s D ward has fallen from over 400 cases to below 200 cases. A senior official said Mumbai was the only exception among bigger cities of Maharashtra. “The only reason Maharashtra had a 2% drop in positivity since March 30 when PR was 25% is due to Mumbai’s declining graph,” he said. A near-stagnant graph is a cause for worry and indication that there’s been no slowdown in transmission, said a professor from Government Medical College in Nagpur. He cited Nagpur’s positivity rate that remains stagnant at more than 30% in the last one month. In fact, at least 18 districts have a PR higher than state average. Eleven (Palghar, Buldhana, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Osmanabad, Hingoli, Nagpur, Gadchiroli, Thane, Satara and Parbhani) have positivity of more than 30%. Palghar and Gadchiroli continue to see a jump in PRs. On the lower end, Dhule and Jalgaon have a PR of less than 10%, said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. In Gadchiroli, particularly, positivity has jumped from 7.3% early in April to 35% between April 18-24. Dr Anil Rudey, civil surgeon of Gadchiroli, said the district has been conducting 500 tests daily of which 70% are using antigen and 30% using RT-PCR. A manpower and infrastructure shortage forced them to rely heavily on antigen, he said. The district has added a second RT-PCR machine and hired a microbiologist to boost testing. So far, Gadchiroli has tested over 2lakh people. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said new cases of Covid-19 have stabilised to some extent due to strict implementation of restrictions. “If we had not imposed strict restrictions, the number of active cases would have crossed 9 to 10 lakh as per the projection…we managed to control it to 6-6.5 lakh due to restrictions and cooperation from the people of Maharashtra,” said the CM. Giridhar Babu, head of Lifecourse Epidemiology at Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said a drop in positivity rate was good news for Mumbai and a relief for an exhausted healthcare system. “Wherever restrictions have been put in place and they are effectively implemented, you will start seeing results in 7-14 days. Mumbai’s decline in positivity could mean restrictions are working,” he said. Babu reiterated the WHO recommendation of opening up only after positivity has dropped to 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-positivity-rate-drops-to-single-digit-from-28-on-april-4/articleshow/82336083.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The extended lockdown will push the Covid graph downward. The four-day lockdown ends on Monday morning and the government hasn’t taken a decision on extending the lockdown, chief minister Pramod Sawant told reporters. Stating, better late than never, IMA Goa president Dr Vinayak Buvaji said that they wish to see the lockdown being extended by another 15 days or more. “We wish for the cases to come down steeply in the shortest time possible. Learning from the pandemic wave last year when the lockdown was extended, the lockdown should be extended by 15 days or till the positivity rate drops to 10%,” Buvaji said. For the past seven days, Goa’s average case positivity rate has been around 40%. On Thursday, it shot to 51%. The health care, the IMA Goa president said, will be able to manage better if the caseload drops as the mortality rate will also reduce. Also people have to voluntarily reduce their movement, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/extend-lockdown-by-15-days/articleshow/82335121.cms||---
---||Delhi||Corpns put on hold new drive till the arrival of vaccines||New Delhi: The municipal corporations on Friday decided to put on hold the launch of Phase III of the Covid vaccination drive for the people belonging to the age group of 18-44 years till Delhi government arranges vaccines. “Unlike in the past, when we were getting directions from the Centre, all arrangements are supposed to be made by Delhi government this time. Since it has shortage of jabs, we have also decided to put the drive on hold. For those above 45, the drive will continue at all centres,” said Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), following a joint meeting. But the corporations aren’t stopping their preparations for the new phase. The civic bodies have decided to offer their polyclinics, community halls and dispensaries to avoid crowding and reduce burden on hospitals. Senior officials say since bigger hospitals are already reeling under the pressure of Covid patients, smaller health facilities can provide perfect alternatives to reduce the risk of infection. However, only centres with facilities to tackle rare adverse events following the immunisation can be used for the drive, they caution. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said 57 mother and child care centres, 20 dispensaries and polyclinics, and similar civic facilities would carry out the drive. “We have already sent a list of proposed sites for expanding the drive,” he said. South Delhi Municipal Corporation is currently running 52 sites and has proposed to add at least 50 health units, 122 schools and 20 community halls. “The idea is to avoid chaos at one place,” an official said. The EDMC mayor said it had applied to the district administration for adding 20 centres and seven — four in Shahadra South and three in Shahadra North — had already been approved. “We will use this time to put in place all equipment and facilities received from Delhi government.” The number of centres needs to be increased, too, Jain admitted. EDMC will involve staffers from the Ayush department to meet the additional manpower need, the mayor said, adding that all Covid-appropriate norms would be strictly followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-put-on-hold-new-drive-till-the-arrival-of-vaccines/articleshow/82334142.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Principal secretary Puneet Kumar Goel said that the state government has launched ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat - Swayampurna Goa’ programme to make the government beneficiary-oriented schemes reach at the doorsteps of the last person, attain self-sustainability by identifying and tapping the potential, identifying the skills of unemployed youth and needs of the people, thereby fulfilling the aspirations of the needy people with less government and more governance. “As a preventive measure, due to rising number of Covid cases in the state, all the swayampurna paryavekshaks. taluka nodal officers, swayampurna mitras and swayampurna sahayaks shall suspend all the activities under this programme till further orders,” Goel said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had launched Swayampurna Goa in municipal and panchayat areas. Under the scheme, panchayats and municipalities were supposed to avail of the various state and central governments schemes to provide better facilities to the public. The CM had said that Swayampurna Goa has received good response in villages. Various schemes were listed and offered by the state and the central governments to help different sections of society under the scheme. Under Swayampurna Goa, panchayats and municipalities were supposed to get funds under the 15th Finance Commission and under the 60th celebration of Goa’s Liberation. The state, through the scheme, wanted to ensure 100% coverage of water and electricity connections to the people.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Another lost season looms large over strawberry farmers||IDUKKI: As the first wave of the pandemic subsided, farmers growing strawberries in Munnar area saw a glimmer of hope with demand picking up for their produce among domestic tourists who had begun to trickle in after several months of lockdown. But within a few weeks, the second wave of infections and the subsequent restrictions have dashed all their hopes. Over the years, Marayoor and Kanthalloor regions have been fast emerging as major destinations for agritourism, with winter vegetables, fruit farms and jaggery production being the main attractions. Several farmers had taken up agri-tourism for the extra money it offered them. Tourists used to throng the strawberry farms, till their arrivals fell sharply last year due to the lockdown. Things were beginning to look up this year, before coronavirus infections began to surge again. Shelju Subrahmanyan, a strawberry farmer in Vettukad near Kanthalloor said that there was a steady flow of tourists from February this year. The fruits are harvested during the period from February-May. “Strawberries were sold at Rs 500 a kilo and the tourists were happy to buy the farm-fresh fruits from us. But within a couple of weeks the situation totally changed. Now, there are no takers for the fruits and we are looking at making value-added products like jams and squashes,” said Subrahmanyan. “We lost last year’s season due to lockdown and now another season too seems to be at risk,” he said. CT Kuruvila, a fruit farmer in Kanthalloor, said the tourism sector in Marayoor and Kanthalloor had begun to limp back to normalcy at the beginning of this year. In order to encourage farm tourism, Horticorp had started a strawberry park in Munnar with the support of UNDP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/another-lost-season-looms-large-over-strawberry-farmers/articleshow/82334147.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The cops this year have an important mandate to execute — they have to ensure that no victory processions are taken out under strict instructions from Election Commission of India in order to check spread of Covid. To help cops at 13 counting centres and maintain peace, a record 118 companies of central forces — more than 8,000 personnel — will be staying back in the city. “As of now, we plan to depute 100 personnel outside each counting centre to remove any sort of gathering outside them,” said joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. The EVMs for Kasba, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and Behala have been secured at Vivekananda College in Thakurpukur, Hastings House, Behala Bratachari School, Dinabandhu Andrews College, Geetanjali Stadium and the Alipore treasury, said officers at Lalbazar. Six more centres were added to this list between April 26 and 29 when south and north Kolkata finished voting. St Thomas School, Sakhawat Memorial Government Girls’ High School, Ballygunge Government High School, West Bengal University of Teachers’ Training, Netaji Indoor Stadium and Rabindra Bharati University were included in the list. Till May 2, when the counting of votes is scheduled, only authorised personnel of the central forces and authorised Election Commission officials can go anywhere close to strongrooms where the sealed EVMs have been kept. Even officers in the lower rung of Kolkata Police will be restricted to providing security for the outermost layer, said sources. Guard rails have been kept at approach roads to the counting centres to prevent any vehicle from getting close and pickets have been set up outside the strong rooms with sandbags and armed personnel of central forces to foil any attempt to snatch EVM machines. “Only valid polling agents — with their IDs and their Covid reports in place — will be allowed to enter. Each one of them will be subjected to at least two layers of checking by the CAPF,” said an EC official. Meanwhile, each police division — and in specific cases, even each police station — has been assigned additional men from the battalions to maintain peace in the city. According to Lalbazar, all men on patrol will be asked to carry body-cams. In certain sensitive pockets like Entally and Cossipore, the cops will be carrying video cameras. Police have removed all crowds from sensitive Covid-hit zones as early as Friday. Sources said the cops will focus on three aspects — quick response to distress calls, monitoring of specific areas that have history of poll violence and putting up nakas and checkpoints to ensure outsiders do not get a free hand in creating trouble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/15000-security-personnel-to-guard-counting-units-streets-from-today/articleshow/82334174.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Hyderabad||Vaccination drive on hold even for those above 45 years in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A shortage of vaccines has forced the state health department to stop the vaccination drive for two days (May 1 and 2) at government centres even for people aged 45 years and above. A message sent to local authorities stated that as doses have not been received, the vaccination drive will be on hold for two days. On Friday, Telangana director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao made it clear that due to vaccines being in short supply, the intended vaccination drive for residents between 18 and 44 years will be delayed. Telangana has a population of 1.72 crore in that age group, and the government had a plan to vaccinate 6.6 lakh people daily through 5,000 centres. It is estimated that the state needs nearly 3.6 crore doses of vaccine to complete the programme for this age group. The state has a daily vaccination capacity of ten lakh people. “This ambitious plan will work out only if stock is available. The administration of the first dose can be completed within one month. Clarity will come only after CM K Chandrasekhar Rao holds a meeting,” said a state official. Sources said that process of procurement from the private companies has to be started as well. Having announced free vaccine for everyone in the state, the health department has even asked the local authorities to take back the unused stock from private hospitals meant to be given to residents of age 45 and above. On Thursday, state health department stopped the supply of vaccine without any explanation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vaccination-drive-on-hold-even-for-those-above-45-years/articleshow/82335120.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Hindustan Zinc to supply 500 cylinders a day||JAIPUR: Hindustan Zinc set up a bottling plant at Dariba which will supply 500 cylinders of oxygen per day. The Udaipur-based company has been supplying 5 tonne liquid oxygen to district administration. Additionally, the company will soon commission a bottling plant with a production of 1200 oxygen cylinders a day which will help meet the shortage of oxygen, a statement said. The company will help meet the demand for oxygen at hospitals in not just the areas of Rajsamand and Udaipur but also Jodhpur, it said. Rajsamand district collector Arvind Poswal said, “Hindustan Zinc has set up the oxygen cylinder bottling plant with a capacity of 500 cylinders in a record time of five days.” Hindustan Zinc’s CEO Arun Misra said, “The oxygen bottling plant would directly convert liquid oxygen into usable form in oxygen cylinders for treatment in hospitals. Before this, we had innovated clinical methods through which we provided 150 tonne liquid oxygen in cryogenic tankers through our oxygen plant to the health administration.” Currently, Hindustan Zinc’s Oxygen plant has diverted 100% of its oxygen production for medical use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hindustan-zinc-to-supply-500-cylinders-a-day/articleshow/82335093.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tome fetes legendary artists on Maha’s 61st anniversary||Mumbai: History and the arts blend seamlessly in ‘Visual Art of Maharashtra’ that raises a toast to artists who, over the past two centuries, have brought glory to the state with their deft strokes and nimble fingers. Amidst Covid-19 and the political mayhem, the sturdy, 960-page tome celebrates Maharashtra’s 61st anniversary on Saturday, say art buffs. It offers a wide angle view of the trends and styles that defined Maharashtra’s tryst with canvas and clay. Biographical sketches of artists and extensive notes on art institutions such as the Bombay Art Society, the Art Society of India and the Artists’ Centre have enhanced the book’s shelf value, they added. The preface by editors, noted painter Suhas Bahulkar and art historian Deepak Ghare, is a brilliant account of how visual arts ripened in the rugged terrain of Maharashtra: The rock-cut temples of the Vakataka era; early European influence on young artists; tribal and Tantric art; the Bombay Progressive movement and post-modernism; cartoons and calendars; and realists and revivalists. Veterans said the Sir J J School of Art is the book’s leitmotif: How the fabled school transformed Bombay (as it was then known) from a pastoral, 19th century island to a vibrant centre of commerce, music and the arts. Described as an encyclopaedia, the tome is a cavalcade of artists of every hue and mood—from sage-like Abalal Rahiman of Kolhapur and Vasudeo Gaitonde, the melancholy genius, to Francis Newton Souza, the enfant terrible of the Progressive movement, and many more. Masters of yore such as Raja Ravi Varma, M V Dhurandhar, Walter Langhammer and M F Husain rub shoulders with latter day artists such as Atul Dodiya, John Fernandes and Vasudeo Kamath, to name a few. The book pays tribute to sculptors, cartoonists, calligraphers and cover designers as well. Women artists have a remarkable presence in the tome published by the Pundole Art Gallery. For instance, Ambika Dhurandhar, Lalita Lajmi, Naina Kanodia, Jyotsna Kadam and Kahini Arte-Merchant, among many others. In his brief note, publisher and art connoisseur Dadiba Pundole says he was inspired by Drishyakala, the Marathi encyclopaedia published by Hindusthani Prakashan Sanstha in 2013. Bahulkar and Ghare joined the English project as editors. Artists Sudhir Patwardhan and Dilip Ranade assisted them. Noted litterateur-critic Shanta Gokhale and art historian Pheroza Godrej were only too willing to lend a helping hand to the project, says Pundole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tome-fetes-legendary-artists-on-mahas-61st-anniversary/articleshow/82332751.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Muslim leaders seek campaign to tackle vax pushback||Mumbai: Since a large section of Muslims is reluctant to get vaccinated against the Covid-19 infection, several community leaders have sought a massive awareness campaign to persuade them to get the jabs. Confusion about the vaccine’s capacity to mitigate the impact of the infection, rumours around its side-effects and the ongoing Ramzan are making many Muslims delay their first shot of the vaccine. “There is confusion among some people whether the vaccine works to fight the Covid-19 or not and many buy the rumour that it could cause side-effects. Such confusion and doubts need to be removed,” said Sohail Khandwani, treasurer, World Memon Organisation (WMO). Khandwani, who is also associated with Haji Ali and Mahim Dargahs, said WMO, in association with the two dargahs, could set up vaccination centres, provided the authorities give the necessary help. M Asif Farooqui, general secretary of the city Congress, the chancellor’s nominee to Aligarh Muslim University court and member of the varsity’s executive council, said while touring several slum pockets in the city, he heard reservations about the vaccine among the community members. “The ulema or religious scholars need to come out and tell members to go for vaccination. This is the only way we can save more lives and stop the virus’ spread,” said Farooqui. A section of the community is wary about getting inoculated after the recent death of Maulana Wali Rahmani, general secretary of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, following coronavirus complications. “Many people are hesitant to take vaccine shots as Maulana Wali Rahmani died even after he had got vaccinated. Many are postponing it till the end of Ramzan (May 12) as they may have to skip fasting for a day or two after they take the jab,” said senior cleric Maulana Mahmood Daryabadi. He added the rumour about the vaccine being haram or forbidden is wrong. Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, president, Islamic Centre of India, agreed an awareness campaign was needed to convince people because taking the vaccine is in their own interest. “I am going to come out with a video message where I will urge people to go ahead and get vaccinated as soon as possible,” said Farangi Mahali who had earlier appealed through a viral video against the use of loudspeakers to wake up people for sehri or the pre-dawn light meal in Ramzan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-muslim-leaders-seek-campaign-to-tackle-vax-pushback/articleshow/82332629.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The hospital has 150 normal beds, 25 ICU beds and five ventilators. But poor management, limited oxygen supply and shortage of medical staff has resulted in all the facilities being under-utilized. Various industries in Bharuch produce more than 400 MT oxygen per day. The daily oxygen requirement of the district is estimated at around 45 MT. Still, there is shortage of oxygen at the ESIC Hospital. Incidentally, the 10 MT storage tank installed by Ankleshwar Industries Association isn’t in use since last 10 days due to non-availability of oxygen. Citing lack of facilities, the ESIC staff discourages patients from getting admitted to the hospital. With no options left patients belonging to the low-income group are forced take treatment at private hospitals. Despite of strict orders from the district collector to improve the services, the ESIC staff is not ready mend their way. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/lack-of-oxygen-poor-management-plague-esic-hospital/articleshow/82334063.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||In a 1st, Telangana to deploy drones to drop vaccines in remote areas||HYDERABAD: Next time you see a drone in the sky, it may well be carrying Covid-19 vaccines to remote villages. Telangana happens to be the first state in the country to receive permission from the ministry of civil aviation to use drones for delivering coronavirus vaccines to various primary health centres, authorities said. The one-year conditional exemption for Telangana’s ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project will kick off on a trial mode in early May at the Vikarabad Area Hospital. As part of the project, eight selected start-ups would be divided into four batches of two consortia and each batch would carry out the sorties for 6 days to complete the 24-day trial. A week to conduct an on-ground recce would also be given to all consortia before the start of the programme. Each drone would carry a combination of dummy vials and regular vaccines over the course of the trials and the performance would be recorded in detail and this data shall be used to guide further policies regarding full-scale adoption. The state government has asked the district administration to plan the on-ground operations and has also identified nodal officers to bolster the move. Earlier this month, similar permission was granted to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting a feasibility study of the Covid-19 vaccine using drones in collaboration with IIT Kanpur. “Telangana is determined to leverage emerging technologies in the healthcare industry and the usage of drones ensures that primary healthcare is accessible in even remote areas. The MFTS trials would yield important information on the reliability of drones and their adoption in medical deliveries,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary (industries). “The success of this programme has the potential to save many lives during emergencies and in less accessible geographies,” he added. The trials will also help in assessing the area and population to help the government identify more regions that specifically require drone delivery, for its next phase project will involve delivering medicines in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) in remote areas. This experimental delivery will also be conducted in the Vikarabad district with the Area Hospital as the take-off site and various PHCs and sub-centers as the landing points. While the state is yet to get an exemption to conduct BVLOS experimental delivery, officials from the emerging technologies wing in the information technology, electronics & communications department of the state said they are positive about receiving permission from the Centre soon for conducting trials at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-1st-t-to-deploy-drones-to-drop-vax-in-remote-areas/articleshow/82336100.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

According to police, Goswami appeared before the police with anticipatory bail order following which he was arrested and released by the police. Earlier, Goswami’s associate Gosai was arrested in this case. Gosai along with Goswami, had tried to extract Rs 45,000 from one Jayanti Shisangiya (58), whose niece Urmila was admitted to the Rajkot civil hospital. Urmila’s relatives contacted Gosai to help her in the hospital in getting whatever necessary for her recovery. Urmila got admitted to the hospital on April 10. Gosai then told Jayanti over the phone that Urmila needed to be administered tocilizumab injection and he could get it arranged from one Dr Sanjay Goswami. On April 12, Gosai informed Jayanti that they had administered the injection to Urmila on April 11 and he needed to pay them Rs 45,000 for the injection. However, Jayanti had his doubts and inquired with Urmila about the injection, but she said that she had not been given any.

Police had registered the FIR against former scribe Sanjeev Mahajan and eight others on March 2 and arrested four persons: Mahajan, ex-SHO Rajdeep Singh, Satpal Dagar, who is brother of DSP Ramgopal, and property dealer Manish Gupta.In the challan sheet against all the four arrested, police added four more sections: 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information ) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) of the IPC and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Earlier, the police had registered the FIR under 15 sections, including house-trespass, cheating, kidnapping, forgery and criminal conspiracy. Eight accused in the case are still at large. The police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for providing information about four accused—Arvind Singla, Gurmeet Singh, Saurabh Gupta and Khalendra Singh Kadian—on March 26. Gurmeet Singh had allegedly appeared before the sub-registrar’s office as proxy Rahul Mehta to execute the sale deed of the house.  Shekhar, Ashok Arora and Daljit Singh had helped the accused in grabbing the property by being a witness or offering other assistance. The FIR alleged the accused had confined Mehta in a room for a few days and “tortured” him. “The accused took his signatures on blank cheques and papers. A general power of attorney was executed in favour of Arvind Singla and Khalendra Singh,” the FIR alleged. In July 2017, Surjit Singh allegedly took Mehta to his friend Abdul Karim in Bhuj, Gujarat. He introduced Mehta as his friend and asked Karim to keep him at his farmhouse for a few months as he had some health issues, the FIR alleged. “When Karim called up Surjit to take Mehta back, he did not turn up. Karim then admitted Mehta to an ashram in Maharashtra. Mehta was transferred to ashrams in Delhi and Rajasthan,” the FIR alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-18k-page-chargesheet-in-rs-3cr-property-fraud-case/articleshow/82334160.cms||Pawan Tiwari

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Final-year medical PG exams likely to be pushed to July||MUMBAI: Final-year postgraduate medical exams for resident doctors in the state are likely to be postponed to July. Exams are currently scheduled to commence from June 24.  A circular issued by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) on Friday recommended postponing the exams and utilising the services of these doctors till the first-year PG batch joins college.  The circular is based on an advisory issued a few days ago by the National Medical Commission (NMC), the apex regulatory body for medical education, asking medical colleges to utilise the services of final-year resident doctors to meet the current shortage. As NEET-PG is postponed and the conduct of exams and admission rounds are likely to take at least three months, there is no clarity on when the first-year students will be able to join college. “The term of final-year doctors ends on April 30. We have recommended postponement of exams and extension of their term. We will review the situation towards May end and then decide whether to extend their term by another month,” said DMER director, TP Lahane. He added the state is utilising medical interns and doctors serving bonds, but there may be a shortage in rural areas, if these final-year doctors are relieved. While exam controller of MUHS, Ajit Pathak, said the state’s proposal will be discussed in the board of examinations, the exam dates remain unchanged as of today. The BMC, meanwhile, extended the term of final-year resident doctors in civic hospitals to May 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-final-year-med-pg-exams-likely-to-be-pushed-to-july/articleshow/82336098.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Goa||Goa: Inoculation drive for 18 to 45 year age category delayed||PANAJI: The state’s population in the 18-45 year category will have to wait longer to get inoculated as the government is yet to procure vaccines for the new age group. However, vaccination of those who are 45 years and above will continue with the central government quota. Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday told reporters that they haven’t got the stock yet and that vaccination for the 18-45 age group will not be rolled out from May 1. The vaccination of the new category of beneficiaries, Sawant said, “Will begin as and when the state receives the doses from the manufacturer. Do not rush to the vaccination centres on May 1.” The government has placed an order for 5 lakh doses for the 18-45 age group and will shortly issue standard operating procedures for registration and vaccination. District immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that they have adequate stock to continue vaccination to those who are 45 and above. About one lakh doses are expected to be received on Friday night from the Centre. Sawant on Tuesday said that Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla has promised to supply five lakh vaccines to the state. Small private hospitals will also likely not be able to conduct the vaccination from May 1 as they will now have to procure their own stock from manufacturers. Earlier, private hospitals that had joined the vaccination drive had bought vaccines from the state government. However, with the Centre changing the policy, they will now have to make their own arrangements. The Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Goa has requested the government to help small hospitals that are unable to make vaccine purchases on their own as their requirements are small. Dr Shekhar Salkar of Manipal Hospital said that since the small hospitals may not be able to purchase vaccines from manufacturing companies, it was suggested to the CM earlier this week that the government should make some stock available for its procurement at cost. “Even we (Manipal) will not be able to start vaccination of 18-plus from May 1, but we are expecting to get our stock somewhere next week,” Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inoculation-drive-for-18-to-45-yr-age-category-delayed/articleshow/82335157.cms||---

With 86,361 cases between April 1 and 30, the state reported 46% of total cases — since March last year — in 30 days. Also, 907 deaths were recorded in the state in past 30 days. According to the health department, 24,375 samples tested negative on Friday while among the 5,654 positive cases, a maximum of 1,915 were reported from Dehradun. Haridwar reported 856 new cases followed by 999 in Nainital, 397 in Udham Singh Nagar, 366 in Pauri, 264 in Chamoli, 220 in Almora, 166 in Rudraprayag, 140 in Tehri, 134 in Uttarkashi, 105 in Champawat, 66 in Pithoragarh, and 26 in Bageshwar. As per the health department data, the state had 100,411 cases till March 31. Total deaths of Covid patients were 1,717 till March 31, 2021. “In a span of 30 days, the state reported 86,361 cases which is 46% of total cases reported in the last 13 months. The first case was reported here on March 15, 2020. Also, 907 deaths in a month is 34% of total deaths so far,” said a health department official. Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation said that not just the surge in the cases, but the positivity rate (PR) is a major concern as well, since 12 among 13 districts have "PR above the national average". MHA had recently asked states to implement containment measures in districts where either the test positivity is more than 10% in the last one week or where the bed occupancy is more than 60%. "Nainital’s PR was 25.2% in last week of April followed by 21.6 in Doon, 21 in Tehri, 20.7 in US Nagar, 19.5 in Uttarkashi, 19.2 in Chamoli, 18.6 in Pauri, 17.8 in Champawat, 14.6 in Almora, 13.8 in Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag, 10.1 in Bageshwar,” said Nautiyal, who added that Haridwar district remains an "enigma" for registering PR of only 5.2% despite over 91 lakh people converging for Kumbh. Meanwhile, health secretary Amit Negi said on Friday that health department is “making all possible efforts to ensure smooth treatment for Covid patients.” He added that the state government’s '104' helpline facility is getting at least 2,000 calls daily and the people are being provided all possible support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukand-reported-over-86k-covid-cases-in-one-month/articleshow/82333315.cms||Ishita Mishra

The UT health department had asked private hospitals to keep doses till Friday and return the remaining as they would not hold any jab sessions now. “There are no fresh supplies as the states have to buy directly from the manufacturers. There is no response yet from the Serum Institute of India (SII). The doses will be bought for all age groups above 18 years by the respective states,” said an official in the UT health department. There are almost 8,500 doses of vaccine with the UT health department and these have to be administered to the existing priority groups. “I was asked to check after May 1 for the second dose. I am a senior citizen and want to be fully immunised as I am at greater risk,” said a city resident.In Panchkula too, sessions were not held at government and private healthcare facilities. There are some who went to Chandigarh for the second dose. “I went to a private facility to avoid rush and unhygienic areas in a government hospital, but could not get vaccinated,” said a resident of Panchkula. The government facilities will only run the sessions for the existing priority groups. “Those who want to get the jab and are of 45 years and above, can walk into our facilities. They need not worry even if the first jab was taken at a private centre, as we will register and inoculate them. Now, there are no jab sessions in private hospitals,” said the UT director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kang.Sources said the UT health department was trying to save remaining doses and at least cover those who were given the first jab. “We do not know when SII will supply the stock and how big the consignment will be,” said an official in the UT health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2nd-dose-residents-offer-arm-pvt-hosps-show-empty-hand/articleshow/82334177.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Delhi||Delhi Metro: Finally, missing piece of Pink Line jigsaw falls into place||NEW DELHI: The missing link of Delhi Metro’s longest corridor, the Pink Line, between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar I has finally been bridged after two-and-half years. Without this, the line had been functioning as two separate corridors. Trial runs will be carried very soon. “The civil work on the Trilokpuri section has been completed. Now preparations are on for the next phase of the work, such as track laying and other ancillary components,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. The completion of track laying and installing of electrification and signalling systems will be followed by train trials across the Trilokpuri area. After the trial runs, the newly constructed section will require safety approvals for commercial operations to begin. The 58.6-km Pink Line from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar is one of the most ambitious corridors built by DMRC. It is a ring corridor because it functions as an arc connecting all the existing corridors of the train network. Unavailability of land at Trilokpuri had prevented DMRC from completing the crucial stretch connecting Mayur Vihar Pocket I and Trilokpuri stations. As a result, while one section of the corridor operates from Majlis Park to Mayur Vihar I, with trains reversing at the latter site, trains coming from Shiv Vihar return from Trilokpuri station. Trilokpuri is a densely populated residential area and land needed for the construction of 10 Metro pillars proved scarce. The occupants of 108 plots in Block 15 had to be relocated to make the required land available for putting up the missing viaduct. DMRC was able to relocate most of the occupants to flats it built nearby and had floated tenders for the construction of the missing link in 2019 at a cost of Rs 15.6 crore. The new viaduct has come up across 289 metres. The pillars to support the under-construction viaduct had come up last year. Bridging this gap had proved a huge challenge for DMRC till the last moment. Even as it was completing the work on a war footing, the farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders almost stopped construction material coming from other states from reaching the work site on time. These included fabricated steel girder, which is a major construction material arriving from Punjab. Once train operations start on this viaduct, the Pink Line will finally function as a single corridor and connect large parts of east Delhi with south and west Delhi. In addition, DMRC has started construction work on the 12.58-km Majlis Park–Maujpur corridor, which will turn the arc-like Pink Line into a complete circle. The Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor is part of DMRC’s Phase IV project and will boast the network’s first cantilever bridge across river Yamuna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/finally-missing-piece-of-pink-line-jigsaw-falls-into-place/articleshow/82334181.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Though this is likely to provide some succor to many seriously ill patients and their families waiting outside the hospital with hope against hope of a bed being made available, sources said a mere increase in beds without a corresponding increase in the number ofstaff is likely to stretch the hospital’s manpower resources perilously further. At the ESI hospital, Margao, too, sources said, there is acute shortage of beds.  However, as it is is a step-down hospital, meant for patients with mild symptoms or those on the path to recovery, no patient is admitted without a recommendation from the South Goa district hospital or the Goa Medical College and hospital (GMC). Sources said that many of those admitted in the ESI hospital were asymptomatic ones, but they could develop symptoms, necessitating their transfer to the district hospital. “I was admitted in the ESI hospital for the last six days and my condition has improved a lot. However, though I still feel breathless at times, I was discharged and advised to stay at home . I was told by my doctor that I was being discharged as beds have to be made available for others needing urgent attention,” a patient told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/s-goa-hospital-bed-capacity-up-at-500-80-more-on-anvil/articleshow/82335187.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengal voter turnout swings from 86% to 77%||KOLKATA: Even as voting percentages in Bengal swung from 86.1% in the second phase to the lowest 76.9% in seventh phase, initial reports indicated that the average 81.8% turnout in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls has been a shade lower than 2011 and 2016. In 2019 Lok Sabha, the voter turnout was 81.9%. On Thursday, during Phase eight, there was 78.3% polling — a dipping trend which was visible in the last two phases and whenever polling was held in urban belts hemming Kolkata. The first and third phases had identical figures of 84.6%. The fourth phase also had a low rate of polling as parts of Kolkata — Behala East and Behala West, Kasba, Jadavpur, Tollygunge, Sonarpur East and West along with Metiabruz and Mahestala voters went to the booths. The turnout was around 77.2% in Kolkata and its southern suburbs. Experts said that Covid fears had forced people to stay indoors and with the passing of time and with subsequent phases the turnout in Kolkata and the urban parts had reduced considerably. Polling for Kolkata South was on April 26, there was a turnout rate of 61.7%, with Ballygunge recording 61%. The figure was 63.8% in 2016 assembly polls and in 2019 LS polls it was 66.2%. But it was not the same in rural Bengal as in most districts it was around 80%-plus voting. However, Rashbehari recorded the lowest turnout with 59.8% which was 67.1% in 2016. Even during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls Rashbehari recorded 66.9% polling. Bhowanipore recorded 66.8% both in 2016 and the 2019 LS polls, but this time it was a bit low with 61.3%. Port recorded 64.4% turnout this time which is one per cent rise, as in 2016 it was 63.4%. Though, the figure was 64.2% in 2019 LS polls. Kolkata North recorded a further slide in polling percentage as on Thursday it recorded 59.4%. Jorasanko had the least turnout — 49.8% — which was almost nine per cent higher in 2016. Chowringhee, which is known for low turnout, also had 53.3% polling in comparison to 56.2% polling in 2016. Cossipore-Belgachhia also had a low turnout with 59.5% which was 64.8% in 2016. Shyampukur recorded 57.7% turnout. Even in urban Howrah, the voting rate was low as it recorded 77.2% polling, with Bally recording the lowest — 71.3% polling. Among the north Bengal districts, Cooch Behar had a high turnout with 84.7% in Phase four followed by Alipurduar (82.5%). Jalpaiguri had a high turnout with 84.8% in Phase five. However, Birbhum had a high rate of polling in the Phase eight in all the 11 seats with 84 % followed by Malda where polling was held for six seats and the turnout was 81%. Murshidabad recorded 81% polling as polling was held in 11 seats. Poll analysts felt that due to the on-going violence in the Barrackpore belt the turnout was comparatively low as in Kamarhati it was 72.8% and in Baranagar it was 72.9%. Barrackpore recorded only 68.4% polling. Among the seats with high turnout are Krishnagar South (86.3%) and Maynaguri in Jalpaiguri (88.5%). Even Diamond Harbour recorded 88% turnout. In Cooch Behar, Mekliganj had 87.3% turnout, Tufanganj 88.3% polling and Pingla 89%.

---||Dehradun||Vaccination for 18+ age group not to start in Uttarakhand from May 1||DEHRADUN: The Covid-19 vaccination process for people above 18 years, as earlier announced, will not be possible to start from May 1, the health department said on Friday. A communique by DG health Dr Tripti Bahuguna said that the vaccination for people above 18 will begin only after the health department gets enough vaccines from designated companies. Officials of the department also said that the current vaccine stock which is being deployed for people above 45 years can barely last for two more days. “We will get 122,108 doses of Covishield and 42,370 doses of Covaxin from the Centre for people in the age group of 18 to 44. We will not start the vaccination process until we get the stock. People, however, should keep on registering themselves on the Co-WIN app and they will be informed about their turn as per the availability,” Dr Bahuguna said. Meanwhile, in anticipation of a fresh rush in the vaccination programme for those above 18, queues of elderlies were visible across centres in the state on Friday. Also, owing to scarcity of vaccines, no jabs took place at 50 % community healthcare centres in the state. “People above 45 years of age were worried that no vaccine will be available for them from Saturday as the inoculation for 18 plus age group was expected to start. In many cases, people requested us to administer the second dose before six weeks’ time from the first in anticipation of the rush and scarcity in days to come,” said an official from Government Doon Medical College. Health department sources said the vaccine stock for the inoculation of people above 45 years of age is also very limited in Uttarakhand and will run out by Monday. “We have already informed the government about the current stock status and are waiting for more vaccines now,” said Dr Saroj Naithani, director of National Health Mission. Meanwhile, higher education minister Dham Singh Rawat, during a virtual meeting, said that help from NCC cadets will be taken during the vaccination campaign. “We will ask NCC and other cadets to create awareness for vaccination and we will offer inoculation spaces in colleges and universities if required,” Rawat added.

---||Hyderabad||Staff crunch hits Telangana’s Covid-19 testing drive hard||HYDERABAD: As the state continues to record grave Covid-19 statistics, the drastic fall in the number of tests being conducted has become a major cause for concern. The data put together by the state health department reveals that for the last five days, the state has not been able to cross the one lakh mark in the number of tests conducted. On April 29, only 77,091 tests were conducted compared to 1.08 lakh tests which were conducted five days ago, on April 24. Moreover, going by the current Test Positivity Rate (TPR), which is between 9.5% and 10.36%, for every 10,000 tests that are being conducted, on an average about 978 cases are being missed by the state. Health officials admitted there was a staff crunch to handle the rush along with the vaccination and immunisation drive which has picked up pace in the state. Sources said that the number of people coming for vaccines has also increased ever since the state entered the second wave, making the task to test more people difficult. “Before the vaccination for Covid-19 started, there would be queues for about 100 tests in each centre daily which was not such a big hassle for the existing staff. But now, in a few centres, local staff are seeking additional staff from government officials to manage the situation. Lack of infrastructure and adequate RT-PCR machines is also a reason,” an official source said. This is despite the Telangana high court expressing displeasure at the state government earlier this month for doing fewer RT-PCR tests at a time when the second wave of Covid-19 is sweeping across the country. “Out of the nine lakh Covid-19 tests conducted so far, only one lakh of them are RT-PCR tests. The rest are (RATs) Rapid Antigen Tests. You have to increase the RT-PCR tests to tackle the pandemic effectively,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said during a hearing on April 6. On Friday, the state recorded 7,664 new Covid-19 cases and 53 fatalities, taking the number of deaths to 2,261 and total number of positive cases so far to 4.35 lakh. So far, a total of 1.29 crore Covid-19 tests have been conducted in the state, out of which 4.35 lakh have tested positive and 3.55 lakh persons have recovered. However, addressing the media with updates about Covid-19, Telangana’s director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said that Telangana is in a better position compared to many other states in terms of tests. “Telangana is in the top three position in the country in number of tests being conducted. The testing facility is also only for those who have symptoms of Covid-19. People who don’t have symptoms are thronging the testing centers and thus putting themselves at risk of contracting the virus,” he said, adding that the next three to four weeks are very crucial for Telangana in the battle against Covid. “If people continue to take all precautions at least till May, the state will pull out of the present situation,” said Dr Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/staff-crunch-hits-telanganas-covid-19-testing-drive-hard/articleshow/82335219.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Consider plea of students who have not paid fees: Bombay HC to school||MUMBAI: Bombay high court directed a Malad (E) school to sympathetically consider the individual representation of 203 students who it denied access to online classes for nonpayment of fees. A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang on April 29 heard a petition by students, mostly aged 6-13, that Seth Juggilal Poddar Academy, an ICSE school, was demanding fees which were not reasonable, and as their parents have not been able to pay, access to online classes was discontinued. The academic year began on April 7. Their petition said for 2020-21 in general their parents have paid 50% fees. “The delay is generally due to loss of job or loss of business, or exhausting of all savings during the lockdown period,” it stated, adding that the management was “extremely uncooperative” and unwilling to listen to parents and their challenges during Covid-19. The petition said at an open house on April 3, only those who paid 100% fees were given results. They sought a direction for release of results, promotion to following academic year and access to online classes. School advocate Arvind Kothari said the same fees had continued for three years and many parents have not paid the previous year’s fees. The petitioner’s advocate submitted a Supreme Court February 8, 2021, order in which it observed that where parents are having difficulty in paying fees, it will be open to them to approach the school by an individual representation and its management will consider it on a case-to-case basis sympathetically. The judges noticed that in the petition there are no individual particulars whether the 203 students are able to pay fees or not, what are the reasons and what are the arrears. Informed that the school will close on May 7 and reopen in June, the judges were not inclined to allow the students access to online classes. But they posted the hearing on June 8 and passed a direction on the lines of SC’s order. They directed that if the students/ parents have not made any individual representation, they shall do so immediately, giving particulars. “The respondent institution will consider such representations on caseto-case basis sympathetically and inform the outcome to each student before school reopens.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-consider-plea-of-students-who-have-not-paid-their-fees-in-mumbai/articleshow/82335221.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Delhi||Raw water level hit again, may affect supply: Delhi Jal Board||NEW DELHI: For the third time in the past two weeks, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has issued an advisory on water supply disruption. Many parts of the city are likely to witness water shortage from Saturday due to an alarming fall in raw water supply through the Yamuna, it stated on Friday. Asking Delhiites to store and use water judiciously, DJB said the water levels in the Wazirabad pond, which is fed by the Yamuna, had reached 667.2ft as against the standard level of 674.5ft. Due to this and reduction in the release of raw water by Haryana into the Yamuna, water production has been curtailed at the water treatment plants in Wazirabad and Chandrawal, DJB stated. The problem will continue till the pond level improves to normal, it added. To supply 930-940MGD water, DJB sources 612MGD water from Haryana and 254MGD from Uttar Pradesh while the rest comes from subsurface sources like tubewells and ranney wells. DJB gets around 375MGD water through the Yamuna and the two canals supplying water via Haryana. Additionally, 220MGD is sourced through the Bhakra Nangal storage. There is usually a supply-demand gap of more than 250-260MGD in Delhi, which worsens during the summer season when the demand spikes. A senior DJB official said the Covid-19 pandemic had also led to additional water demand. The Wazirabad and Chandrawal plants are fed directly by the Yamuna. Delhi has been recently facing frequent raw water supply shortage and release of industrial pollutants from both Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the official said. The areas likely to be affected are Civil Lines, Hindu Rao Hospital and adjoining areas, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar and adjoining areas, Karol Bagh, Paharganj and NDMC areas, Old and New Rajendra Nagar, East and West Patel Nagar, Baljeet Nagar, Prem Nagar, and Inderpuri and adjoining areas. In south Delhi, the areas likely to be impacted include Greater Kailash, South Extension, Kalkaji, Govindpuri, Amar Colony, Tughlaqabad, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, and Prahladpur and adjoining area. Ramlila Maidan, Delhi Gate, Subhash Park, Model Town, Gulabi Bagh, Punjabi Bagh, Jahangirpuri, Moolchand, Burari and adjoining areas, and parts of Cantonment areas may also be affected. Water tankers will be available on demand through the emergency helpline, the DJB spokesperson said. The central control room can be contacted at 1916.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-raw-water-level-hit-again-may-affect-supply/articleshow/82334185.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Commercial activity comes to a halt on Day one of lockdown||MARGAO: Contrary to expectations that the lockdown with very few restrictions imposed by the government would facilitate commercial activities to be largely open, traders, merchants, and commercial establishments, including markets, were largely shut across the state on Thursday, the first day of the weekend lockdown. If the main market of Panaji was shut down during the second half of the day, the municipal markets of Margao remained largely closed throughout the day. While the retail fish market at Margao remained open, albeit with sparse customers, fruits and vegetable stalls were closed. Mapusa was almost deserted. Most of the shopkeepers kept their shops closed. After a long time, the weekly market was shut on Friday. In most parts of South Goa, including Curchorem and Quepem, the lockdown was largely total, with none of the shops or commercial units seen open. Very few hotels and eateries that were found open were mostly providing take away services. In the state capital too, the main restaurants remained closed. Traders kept their shops voluntarily closed in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the main towns, though the notifications issued by the district collectors said that while only weekly markets would be shut, other markets in villages and cities could function with proper arrangements for enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour like social distancing, use of masks, etc. “All the traders willingly decided to shut the shops, as the municipal markets of Margao are congested spaces, and there is no way one can enforce social distancing norms. As Covid cases in Margao are rising, we took this decision,” a trader said. Much lesser traffic on otherwise busy roads suggested that people chose to stay indoors, and ventured out only if it was absolutely essential. However, as government offices were open, people were seen visiting the offices, but many were subjected to severe inconvenience as shops in the vicinity selling court fee or revenue stamps, stationery items, photocopying services, etc needed for official work were closed. “I had come all the way from Cuncolim to submit an application in the land survey department. But I couldn’t find a single photocopy shop open to take copies of my documents before inwarding them in the office. I have now to return home without getting any work done,” a Cuncolim resident said. In South Goa's mining belt mining transportation, however, went on unhindered. With lesser amount of general traffic on the mining roads owing to the lockdown, sources said, the mining trucks managed to make more trips on Friday. As mining is considered to be an industry, its activities are exempted from lockdown restrictions, sources in the mining sector claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/commercial-activity-comes-to-a-halt-on-day-1-of-lockdown/articleshow/82335218.cms||---

The situation in Delhi is quite horrible and under the present circumstances it is not possible for the traders to open shops,” declared the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) after holding a videoconference, which was attended by hundreds of representatives from various markets on Friday. “With the deteriorating situation coupled with most inadequate, highly disturbed medical infrastructure, it will not be appropriate to open shops and markets right now. If the markets are opened and traders, their employees or customers get infected, it will be almost impossible to get the required medical facilities. Moreover, such a situation will add burden on the government. Extending the lockdown will certainly help the government to combat the increase in Covid cases,” said CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal. Rakesh Yadav, president of Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, however, stressed that the LG and CM should make public announcement for extending the lockdown so that people take it seriously. “The decision of few associations to shut down their markets will only lead to confusion. We have asked the Centre and state government to issue statements and implement norms strictly to stop unnecessary movement of people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-bodies-call-for-self-lockdown-of-mkts-till-may-10/articleshow/82334195.cms||Vibha Sharma

GCCI president Manoj Caculo said that attacking medical staff cannot be justified and action needs to be taken against those responsible for such violence. He also appealed to the state government to ensure that proper security is provided and the safety of medical professionals and health workers is ensured at all cost. “I am appalled at the instances of physical attacks on medical professionals in Goa,” said Caculo. “One should appreciate that the doctors, nurses and other health workers are working round the clock to fight the pandemic and save lives. Attacking such selfless professionals cannot be justified under any circumstances.” Relatives of a patient abused doctors after the patient’s death at the South Goa District hospital on April 18, and in another incident on April 28, a patient’s relatives abused the doctors and nurses, and then broke a ventilator at Goa Medical College. Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD) has threatened to withdraw their services if the attacks continue. While appealing to the doctors to continue their services, Caculo also urged people to appreciate the risks being taken by the medical fraternity. “Braving the high risk that they are exposed to, staying away from their families and despite of inadequate resources, manpower and infrastructural facilities, they are trying to give their best,” said Caculo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-slams-attacks-on-docs-urges-govt-to-ensure-their-safety/articleshow/82335228.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Drugs case: Retest LSD sans paper, court tells NCB in Mumbai||Mumbai: A special trial court on Friday allowed an accused’s plea to retest the weight of LSD purportedly recovered from him in the drugs case the Narcotics Control Bureau is probing in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The court directed the NCB to send the sample to the Forensic Scientific Laboratory (FSL) to ascertain the weight of the drugs without the blot paper. “The Director, FSL, Gandhinagar, Gujarat to comply with the order and submit its report to this court within 15 days from the date of receipt of the order of this court,” the special judge said. The recovered contraband was reported to weigh 0.62 gm. Accused Anuj Keshwani’s plea said under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, it qualifies as commercial quantity and may prove to be an impediment in his attempts to seek bail. He has been in jail since September 7, 2020. Section 37 of the NDPS Act says a person accused of offences involving commercial quantity cannot be given bail unless the court is satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe he is not guilty and that he is unlikely to commit offence while out on bail. 0.1 gm is the base for commercial quantity. The plea filed through advocate Gayatri Gokhale and argued by advocate Taraq Sayyed sought retesting of the sample of the purported LSD drug sans the paper. The investigating agency had alleged that 31 blot papers were recovered from Keshwani. “The applicant says that the entire chargesheet and forensic report is silent about the weight of the LSD drops and the weight of 0.6200 gm is the weight of the blot paper. Therefore, the weight of the paper cannot be taken into consideration at the time of deciding whether the quantity of the drug allegedly recovered amounts to commercial quantity,” Keshwani’s plea said. Bombay HC held that the weight of the paper containing dried LSD drops cannot be considered while determining the quantity of the contraband seized. It had also observed that the paper only facilitates its consumption and is neither a preparation nor a mixture with a neutral substance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/drugs-case-retest-lsd-sans-paper-court-tells-ncb-in-mumbai/articleshow/82335234.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Delhi||Unfair to hold exams: Students to DU, Jamia||New Delhi: A large section of students at Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia has demanded postponement of exams due to the dismal Covid-19 situation and the resultant mental stress. Following mass letters to the Delhi University and Jamia administrations, DU may “postpone it” while Jamia would decide for the benefit of students. Student groups such as All India Students’ Union started a mass letter campaign claiming conducting online examinations during the “most brutal health crisis in the country” is not correct. “Students have been suffering loss of life, health and loved ones all over the country and several state and private universities have called off examinations,” they said. Calling online exams “highly exclusive and discriminatory”, the letters stated, “The demand for cancellation of exams for the time being remained unanimous in student opinion.” However, not all students are so sure about the “right step”. DU Students’ Union president Akshit Dahiya claimed “we have decided to speak to all stakeholders. Many are not keen on examination postponement as it affects their future plans for higher studies”. On April 29, the DU exam department announced that it would conduct the May-June (final-year) examinations only after discussions with University Grants Commission. Dean of colleges Balaram Pani told TOI, “Many students want exams to happen on time, while some believe it should be postponed. DU will postpone the exams a little but it will conduct the exams as we want to make sure that students get some relief.” Pani added, “Many students need to apply for higher studies or go abroad. We cannot disrupt their academic plans either.” DU may allow the students not keen on taking the exams now to do so in the next semester, he said. Jamia on April 26 announced the summer vacation from May 1 to 30. “The teachers and students will not be present on the campus, but... ongoing online teaching and open book exam will continue at a slow pace over an extended period,” it stated. Mukesh Ranjan, professor in charge of public relation, said, “The administration will take a decision for the benefit of the students.” DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) said, “It is incumbent upon the university administration to be sensitive to the trauma all around... DUTA demands that classes be suspended as students and teachers are not mentally and physically in a state to continue with the teaching-learning process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unfair-to-hold-exams-students-to-du-jamia/articleshow/82334202.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, the polling percentage was much lower compared to last elections. When the elections were held for 58 divisions in March 2016, the polling percentage was 60.38. Eight more wards were added now but the polling percentage was less as people were reluctant to come out due to the Covid-19 situation. The number of voters for 66 wards is 6,53,240, a slight increase from 6,43,196 in 2016. Meanwhile, mild tension prevailed in Shivanagar area when the followers of Warangal East MLA N Narender forced the BJP activists to change their saffron shirts. A mob rushed to the BJP camp and entered into a confrontation with the BJP workers. All these incidents occurred in the presence of TRS MLA and the police personnel.

It has also asked all state chief wildlife wardens to take preventive measures to stop transmission and spread of the virus from humans to animals. TOI had on Friday written about the increasing spread of virus in villages around Tadoba, that may affect wild animals as people here have regular interface with them. Many cases are going unreported in villages around Tadoba as locals are not taking antigen or RT-PCR tests. There is also great reluctance to get vaccinated. The forest staff has also not been vaccinated fully. The crumbling health infrastructure has added fuel to fire. Under the ‘Break the chain’ orders in Maharashtra, Pench and TATR have already issued orders to shut tourism till May 15. “We have advised tourists not to do advance bookings even after May 15. In case parks open for tourism, visitors can be allowed through spot bookings. However, further opening of parks will be as per NTCA orders,” said Pench CCF & field director Ravikiran Govekar. On the advisory on virus transmission threat, Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University (Mafsu) vice-chancellor Ashish Paturkar said, “There are chances of virus spread from humans to animals. The present mutation can occur in animals too if Covid-affected people come in contact with animals. It can also be transmitted through air and droplets. Mafsu has been told to collect data on whether animals have been affected by the virus.” Dr Shirish Upadhye, director, Wildlife Research and Training Centre (WRTC), Gorewada, said, “Covid-19 has been reported to be transmitted from humans to wild fields at Bronx Zoo, New York, and subsequently at other places. Further, the medical authorities have also confirmed now that not only droplet and aerosol, but spread through air is also possible. Although zoonoses are not yet reported in wild animals in our country, the possibility of spread from human interface cannot be ruled out. Therefore, we must take all necessary precautions to protect our precious wildlife.” ANIMALS AT RISK OF CATCHING VIRUS * Close national parks and tiger reserves for tourists * Reduce human-wildlife interface and take steps to prevent transmission and spread of virus * Constitute task force with field managers, veterinary doctors, and frontline staff to manage situation * Enhance disease surveillance and create round-the-clock reporting mechanism with a nodal officer * Set up essential services for emergency treatment of animals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/union-forest-ministry-shuts-all-national-parks-sanctuaries-across-india/articleshow/82335231.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Health and revenue officials in the district said they had directed the large commercial establishments and showrooms with more than 3,000sqft area to shut down, as a Covid precautionary measure. “We received information that a few large establishments were remaining open, despite our warnings. Based on one such tip, we conducted a surprise raid at the Dhamu Chettiar Nagai Maaligai at Kacherimedu in Gobichettipalayam and found the jewellery outlet was letting customers in through alternative passages, while keeping its main door closed to deceive the officials,” an official source told TOI. When the officials entered the showroom, there were more than 150 customers, who were not even wearing face masks. “We immediately sent the customers away and sealed the showroom. We also have warned to seal other showrooms if they attempt to remain open in violation of the orders,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/jewellery-unit-sealed-for-flouting-covid-norms-in-erode-dist/articleshow/82334196.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to start limited vaccination of 18-44 grp with 3L doses from today||Mumbai/Pune: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that Maharashtra will begin the Covid-19 vaccination campaign for the 18-44 age-group from Saturday, May 1, on the occasion of Maharashtra Day. The state on Friday distributed 3 lakh Covishield doses to districts for starting vaccination of this age-group from Saturday. Mumbai, Pune and Thane have each got the largest share of 20,000 doses. Other districts were given anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 doses each. Districts like Hingoli, Wardha, Bhandara, Washim and Sindhudurg received 5,000 doses each on Friday for this group of beneficiaries. Thackeray said the state was starting with very limited doses and appealed to beneficiaries to not crowd the centres as vaccinations will be conducted only on the basis of registrations as per availability of stocks. “We have received a limited stock of just 3 lakh doses, but we will start with it. We are ready to pay the entire amount required to purchase the 12 crore vaccines, but there is no availability. We will expand the drive based on the vaccine stocks,” CM Thackeray said. He also said the two vaccine manufacturers—Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech—had promised a total of 18 lakh doses in May, but the date when these will be provided is not known yet. Five centres in Mumbai will vaccinate people between 18-44 years old. The centres are BYL Nair at Mumbai Central, RN Cooper in Juhu, BKC jumbo centre in Bandra, Rajawadi in Ghatkopar and SevenHills in Andheri. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the vaccinations would be done strictly through online registration and no walk-ins would be allowed. “Recipients have to come for the time slots allotted by Co-Win. We will not have any specific windows for any age-group. The drive on Saturday is only for those between 18-44 years and not for those above 45 years. We will open vaccination for people above 45 years once we receive vaccines from the state,” Kakani said. Speaking to TOI earlier in the day, state health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI the third phase of the drive covering the 18 and above age-group is being started in a symbolic way. Each district is expected to have five sessions catering to vaccinations for seven days. Officials said there is bound to be confusion on the first day as this decision has come two days after it was announced by the state that they will not be able to roll out the drive on May 1 due to unavailability of stocks. To ensure a seamless registration process, Thackeray has written to the Centre demanding de-centralisation of the registration app. This comes a day after the CoWin app crashed due to the rush to register for the new phase of vaccination. Thackeray said the Centre should allow states to develop their own registration apps and link these to CoWin. Meanwhile, state health department officials told TOI on Friday that no new vaccine stocks had come so far from the 50% quota that the Centre was to receive from vaccine manufacturers for the third phase of the drive from May 1. Officials had earlier in the day clarified that the stock received from the Centre will be used in government vaccination centres for the 45+ group, healthcare and frontline workers and will not be disbursed to private hospitals. A public health department official said supplies from the Centre to Maharashtra are likely to drop significantly in the coming days as the state would now get vaccines from the Centre’s 50% quota that it buys from manufacturers. Maharashtra would earlier get an average of 9-12 lakh doses every few days from the Centre, which is now likely to drop further, the official said.

Information of three supervisor-level employees, comprising their names, contact numbers etc., has been put on the MC’s official website http://mcchandigarh.gov.in. The move comes following the orders of municipal commissioner K K Yadav. Though over two dozen twin-bin vehicles are already placed to lift garbage from these houses, this number is being changed on almost daily basis due to increased or decreased containment zones. The MC has tied up with the deputy commissioner office and the health department, and based on their report and information, they go to the isolated houses, containment and micro-containment zones to lift the garbage. “Information regarding lifting of garbage is being updated daily and I am personally supervising the exercise and officers concerned are monitoring the process,” said Sorabh Kumar Arora, joint municipal commissioner, who heads the sanitation department of the MC.

We have held an orientation. Based on our conversations with states, we are expecting that vaccination Phase III will start as per design from Saturday and then gradually the programme will stabilise,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry The Centre said the Covid-19 vaccination programme will open up for all those above 18 years from May 1 as per the plan though it will pick up pace only gradually with increase in supplies of jabs. The government, however, assured that vaccination for the priority population group above 45 years of age will continue as it is as more supplies from the Centre are on its way The comments came in the wake of looming concerns about inadequate vaccines to roll out the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive covering those between 18-44 years of age apart from the priority population groups. “Considering that more vaccines will be available and production is being increased, states have been allowed to start their vaccination drive in addition to the Centre’s programme to cover priority population. These people will continue to be covered by the Centre. With that, as an additionality, jabs will be available for others,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-in-talks-with-vaccine-companies-to-ramp-up-supplies/articleshow/82337198.cms||---

According to health officials, currently there are 500 active cases in Canacona. The staff of the health centre are also finding it tough to handle the increasing number of people coming in for testing. Meanwhile, as an awareness measure, Canacona police have started fining those not wearing face masks or wearing them incorrectly. Over 250 people have already been fined. Canacona PI Tulshidas Naik and his staff visited all seven panchayat areas of Canacona taluka to ask people to stay indoors to break the infection chain of Covid-19. Naik and his team, who spread the word via microphone, told TOI that they got a good response from the public. Barring pharmacies and some takeaway stalls, all shops were closed, Naik said, adding that it meant that people have understood the seriousness of the situation.

The work took 11 days, from April 20-30, and will enhance safety at the airport. During this period, flight movements were suspended from 11am to 5pm every day, except for on April 24. Sources said the maintenance work concluded successfully and flight movement will be restored to normal from Saturday onwards. “Around eight flights were cancelled while the remaining were rescheduled to either before 11am or after 5pm. Due to the current surge in Covid-19 infections, passenger movement has significantly reduced at the city airport,” a source said. Airlines are expected to independently decide on restoring flights which were temporarily cancelled. Footfalls at the city airport have dropped, like due to the steep surge in Covid19 cases. As part of the runway resurfacing work, the touchdown area was repaired. “This is the area where there is the highest friction when an aircraft lands. The repairs will ensure smoother operations of aircraft and better safety,” the source said. The resurfacing of the runway was undertaken and some repairs were carried out along the taxiway as well. The repairs will facilitate safer take-offs, landings and movement of aircraft especially as the monsoon approaches. Airport authorities had moved the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) last month seeking clearance for the resurfacing work. This is the first major maintenance project at SVPI after its operations, maintenance and development was taken over by Adani Airports, in the public private partnership (PPP) model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/runway-resurfacing-work-concludes/articleshow/82335245.cms||---
---||Goa||Alkasir changes goal celebration routine after serving six-month ban||Panaji: Persepolis FC striker Isa Alkasir had two goals in his kitty but didn’t exactly set the AFC Champions League on fire on his return to football after serving a six-month suspension. The Iranian striker struck for the first time in the reverse fixture against FC Goa – his team’s third, early in the second session – and then against Al Rayyan in the concluding league clash when the Qatar Stars League side briefly threatened to stage a comeback. On both occasions, all eyes were firmly on the Iranian striker’s celebration. The last time Alkasir scored in the high-profile competition – against Uzbekistan’s Pakhtakor in the quarter-finals last year – he invited the wrath of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) who banned him from taking part in any football-related activity for six months for violating Article 58.1 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code. According to AFC, Alkasir’s slant-eye celebration after the goal was a “discriminatory gesture”. The Iranian champions protested. Such a gesture, they said, was a tribute to his nephew, while several fans posted videos of similar celebrations in the past. Persepolis even took the fight to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but could not overturn the ban. After serving a six-month ban, the 30-year-old forward returned last month for group E games of the AFC Champions League. As expected, he scored, and the celebratory routine was different. When he struck for the first time against Goa in this year’s ACL, Alkasir took a second to pause, before lifting his hands and circling his ears. After another goal, this time against Al Rayyan, he did the same and extended his arms, waiting for his teammates to join in the celebration. Before being banned just before the semifinal clash in October, Alkasir was in terrific form, scoring four goals in three games, including the winner against Al Sadd. He is coach Yahya Golmohammadi’s trusted weapon upfront, and is expected to be much sharper for the knockout stage of the competition. “He was off the field for six months. He needs time to be back to the player that he was,” said Golmohammadi. “He needs more time, more competition, so that he gets to his best performance. We have to provide him with the chances and wait for him (to perform).” After bringing on Alkasir as a second-half substitute for the first two group games, Golmohammadi used the striker to partner Shahriar Moghanlou for the remaining four matches. He scored twice. “We trust him and believe he will be back to his best soon,” said Golmohammadi. The Iranian champions will need Alkasir to start firing again, scoring goals and celebrating, without catching the unwanted attention of AFC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/alkasir-changes-goal-celebration-routine-after-serving-six-month-ban/articleshow/82347616.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Coimbatore||Two held for murdering two women for gold||Coimbatore: Two people were arrested on Friday for murdering as many women for gold ornaments and dumping their bodies in the branch canal of Amaravathi Reservoir Project (ARP) on Karatholuvu-Nattukkalpalayam Road near Kaniyur at Udumalpet in Tirupur district on Tuesday night. The dead bodies were retrieved from the canal on Wednesday. The Kaniyur police said the bodies, which were floating in the canal, were first spotted by by-passers, who informed Karatholuvu village administrative officer (VAO) Mujibur Rahman, on Wednesday. An investigation officer said, “As soon as the VAO alerted us, we retrieved the bodies and sent them to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem.” According to him, one of the deceased woman had tattooed a name – Nagaraj - on her left hand and suffered cut injuries to her forehead. Another body, he said, had abrasive injuries on the left hand and right leg. Based on the village administrative officer’s complaint, the Kaniyur police registered a case under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and initiated a probe. Police, meanwhile, traced the identity of the deceased as Gokilavani, 45, wife of Nagaraj, of Sridevi Nagar at Udumalpet and her friend Krithika alias Gracy, 35, wife of Muthaiah, of SV Puram at Udumalpet. Preliminary inquiry revealed Krithika had befriended N Kulanthaivel, 42, of Jallipatti near Kurichikottai, who was selling banana leaf at Udumalpet vegetable market, four months ago. “She developed an extra-marital affair with him and used to get money from him. It was Gokilavani who often arranged their secret meetings at her house. Kulanthaivel also became close to Gokilavani, who also started an illicit affair with him.” The officer said Kulanthaivel, who was facing huge losses in business, hatched a plan to rob both the women of their gold ornaments. “He brought his friend R Kumar, 45, from Ottanchatram in Dindigul district to execute the plan. They called up Krithika on Tuesday night and went to Gokilavani’s house in a pickup van. After having sex with them, Kulanthaivel and Kumar strangulated the women and made away with a mangalsutra and Rs1,700 after leaving the bodies in the house.” On their way back, a police team stopped them near Sridevi Nagar and took their photographs and that of the pickup van. “Gripped with fear, the two went back to Gokilavani's house, loaded the bodies to the van and threw them in the canal around 2.30am on Wednesday,” the officer said. The Kaniyur police arrested Kulanthaivel and Kumar on Friday and altered the case, which was brought under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The two were remanded in judicial custody on Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-held-for-murdering-two-women-for-gold/articleshow/82334203.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The decision was taken after they received confirmation on receiving about 5.44 lakh vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the evening. Of this, three lakh vaccines were expected to reach the state by evening. Jaipur, Jodhpur and Ajmer are the three districts selected for the drive that will start on Saturday for the 18 years and above group. According to Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer (vaccination), Jaipur will have 14 vaccination sites while Jodhpur and Ajmer will have 11 sites each for the purpose. Earlier in the day, government officials and even health minister Raghu Sharma kept changing their statements on whether the drive for this age group would start on Saturday. Initially, the government said only beneficiaries in the age bracket of 34-44 years would be vaccinated as they had received confirmation on receiving only three lakh vaccines by 12 midnight on Saturday. But in the evening, the government clarified that they were ready to start vaccinating the 18-44 age group but only in three districts of the state. “We had sought 3.75 crore lakh vaccines from SII and they have agreed to send us only three lakh vaccines. Thus, we have decided to start our May 1 vaccination programme for the 34-44 age group only,” Sharma told TOI initially. “We are ready with our resources to vaccinate about seven lakh people in the age bracket of 18-44 if we get the vaccines. I urge the Government of India to allow other companies to start manufacturing vaccines so that the states have ample supply," he said. However, in the evening, the health department received confirmation that they would receive 5.44 lakh vaccines to start with. “Since only three lakh vaccines will come late in the evening, it has been decided to start the drive at Jaipur, Ajmer and Jodhpur only for the 18-44 age group on May 1,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh. On being asked whether those who registered on April 28 would get to know details of their vaccination sites, Singh added, “This won't be a walk-in vaccination. People who have registered or are going to do so will get to see the vaccination site option from 5am on Saturday. We anticipate some problems on the first day, but these would be rectified as the day progresses.” From May 2, the vaccination drive will be extended to 11 districts. Authorities clearly stated that no walk in vaccination by merely showing Aadhar card would be entertained for the age bracket of 18-44.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-vax-drive-for-18-44-age-grouprestricted-to-three-districts-today/articleshow/82335259.cms||Ashish Mehta

Otherwise, the cases would manifold again. The current caseload is 49,866 as on Friday night. Authorities also expect that the district would witness 300 to 600 Covid deaths between April 29 and May 15 as over 15 deaths are being reported daily. On some days, it comes to around 21. Meanwhile, health officials have submitted details of infrastructure facilities needed for Covid treatment by May 15 to the state government. It said a total of 3,000 oxygen-supported beds, ventilators and ICU beds are needed in Ernakulam by May 15. They also expect that the daily Covid cases will come down by May-end, thanks to the lockdown measures. “We were expecting a decline in daily Covid cases by Thursday due to restrictions. But that did not happen due to more interaction of people in the limited time allowing shops to remain open. As per the new surge plan, we expect that the active caseload will touch 65,000 by May 15 assuming that the restrictions will put a break on the current pace of daily reporting. If the restrictions are not effective, the cases will skyrocket further. However, we feel that the 65,000 caseload will reach by May 7, calling for strengthening the restrictions further,” sources said. Authorities are also wary of election result, which they fear will lead to celebrations by party workers of the winning side. Health authorities demand more restrictions to curb the rise in cases as there is no other option to prevent it and they complain the ongoing containment activities are ineffective. They fear if more doctors and nurses are getting infected along with the rise in cases, issue of human resources will emerge. “Currently, we have nearly 1,000 oxygen-supported beds in the government sector and we will add 500 more. Private hospitals have 1,800 beds. We are looking into where we can increase bed capacity. Of around 1,800 patients under treatment in private hospitals, 800 are in oxygen-supported beds,” said Dr Mathew Numpeli, district programme manager of national health mission. “Since chances of oxygen leakage is there due to high utilization, all private hospitals have been asked to address the leakage issue, if any,” said Numpeli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/active-caseload-to-touch-65k-by-may-15-health-dept/articleshow/82333367.cms||T C Sreemol

However, the polling percentage came down in Greater Warangal, Khammam and Siddipet when compared to previous election which is being attributed to Covid-19 scare among the voters. In sharp contrast, high polling percentage was recorded in Nakrekal and Kothur, which are smaller municipalities. The election was crucial for all the three main parties of TRS, BJP and Congress as this was the last major poll before 2023 assembly elections in the state. Barring stray incidents, the polling was by and large peaceful. On the directions of the Telangana high court, the State Election Commission took various measures to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines during the polling. Voters started thronging the polling booths from 7 am onwards to avoid long queues and summer heat later during the day. As per the final polling numbers released by the election commission, Greater Warangal recorded 54.74 per cent as against over 60 per cent polling in previous election, Khammam registered 59.80 per cent as against over 67 per cent in the last election and Siddipet municipality registered 67.18 per cent when compared to 71 per cent in 2016. However, the municipalities which recorded high turnout of voters were Nakrekal at 86.65 per cent, Kothur 85.42 per cent, Atchampet 68 per cent and Jadcherla 66.60 per cent. Police personnel and election staff ensured that voters strictly followed the gudelines such as wearing of mask, maintaining social distance and using sanitiser during the polling. Sanitisers were made available at the entry point of all polling stations. Sanitisation of polling booths, use of Arogyasethu app by all those involved in elections, distribution of kits containing one mask, sanitiser and face shield to every polling personnel were among the other guidelines that were followed. However, at some polling booths, Covid-19 guidelines were violated due to protest demonstrations by members of opposition Congress and BJP who alleged high-handed behaviour of police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dip-in-municipal-poll-voting-amid-second-wave-fears/articleshow/82334206.cms||Roushan Ali

Hundreds of people, including those for first and second doses, gathered in front of the counter before the scheduled time of 9am to collect the token. Despite repeated requests from the police and security personnel to keep social distancing, people continued to gather in front of the counter. At one point it resulted in altercation between healthcare workers and the public. People complained that despite reaching the centre hours before the scheduled time, they did not get the token for the second dose, for which registration on CoWin app is not required, as the counter opened only at 9am. Repeated chaos during every vaccination day shows lack of effort on the part of officials to streamline inoculating those with second dose. This also causes much inconvenience for the public, especially for the elderly. While health officials said that they run the drive with bare minimum health workers due to shortage. “If we announce that the counter would open at 7am, people will reach hours before that and the same situation will arise. It is not possible for health workers to collect details of those for a second dose and calling them over phone as already our system has stretched to its maximum. The situation came to normal by 11.30am,” said a hospital official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hundreds-gather-in-front-of-vaccine-centre-at-ekm-gh/articleshow/82333374.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Summer rain may bring much-needed respite from heat||Coimbatore: Residents may get a respite from the sweltering heat in the next few days, with the summer rain expected to lash the district in the first week of May.Weather experts said the district was likely to receive light to moderate showers from May 4 to the middle of the month. While the rain might be inadequate to improve the groundwater level, according to them the same would bring down the temperature slightly and help farmers prepare (plough) their farmlands for kharif crops.Weather blogger Santhosh Krishnan said there was an increase in moisture in the area and a clear point, where the easterly and westerly winds would meet.Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather Services, also said moderate rain could be expected from May 5 to 8, and again in the middle of the month. “There might be clouds from May 3 or 4, followed by rain. There are also signs of a probable cyclonic circulation forming from south Karnataka to south Sri Lanka after May 8 and that would cover the entire Tamil Nadu. This will also bring showers.”The rain is expected to bring down the maximum temperatures by 1 degree C to 2 degree C, giving a welcome respite to the people from the sweltering heat that they have been experiencing for the past one week, and help farmers prepare for the kharif crop. S P Ramanathan, director, Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said around 30mm to 40mm rainfall in a short span would wet the soil enough to plough the same. “Ploughing, before kharif crop cultivation, will help control weed growth and water runoff, and reduce chances of disease and pest attack during the summer by destroying all the larvae and pupae during the process.” Farmers said the summer rain was a blessing, especially for banana and coconut farms. “For banana fruit to grow well, temperature below 30 deg C is ideal or they require water. The summer rain will serve both purposes,” said Karthik Krishnakumar, a coconut farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/summer-rain-may-bring-much-needed-respite-from-heat/articleshow/82334209.cms||---

Bhadoria in his complaint said that he was on patrol when they got the call that two persons were sitting on Chimmanbhai Bridge and threatening passersby. One Bharat (full name not known) had filmed a video and given it to the cops on patrol. Bhadoria said when he got the video he looked for the perpetrators’ two-wheeler but could not find it. Based on the registration number, it was found that the vehicle was registered to one Snehal Pandya and he told the cops that he had sold the vehicle to one Kevin Shah. Shah was not found at his residence and when Pandya called him, he said he was in Motera. The cops went to the place in question, they found that Shah and his companions were in a car and the driver was intoxicated. As the cops stopped them, they brandished a knife and ran away.

---||Kochi||Residents collect empty sacks to build temp seawall||KOCHI: With the Chellanam coast expecting to witness heavy rains and resultant sea erosions by mid-May, the residents are now busy collecting empty sacks so that they could fill them with sand and use them as barriers to prevent sea flooding in their houses. “We need your help to save our houses and lives. We request you to collect as many empty plastic sacks as possible and give it to us at the earliest. We need those sacks to make sand bags, which is the only thing that could protect us from the angry sea in the coming months. We don’t have enough sacks now and need them before the rains starts,” said a WhatsApp message by Mariyamma George, chairperson of Chellanam Janakiyavedi, an association of residents seeking a comprehensive solution to the sea erosion and flooding in the coastal panchayat. According to them, authorities are unlikely to install geobags as a temporary protective measure before the rains and if they don’t take precautions by themselves it will be a tough season, especially when Covid-19 pandemic is severe. Residents have started an online campaign requesting people and merchants to contribute sacks as they need thousands of sacks to protect over 400 houses which face severe threat of sea erosion. They said that and bags need to be installed to make a temporary seawall across the coast before the rain begins. The plan is to fill the bags using the heaps of sands along the coast through the voluntary participation of residents. “A strong seawall is the only permanent solution and we don’t support temporary measures. But when the angry waves hit the coast, these sand bags are the only protection that would stand between us and the sea. Each family staying in the seafront is now collecting sacks to make the sand bags. We have received more than 100 bags already from various merchants. It is impossible for most people to buy sand bags and we request people to voluntarily contribute used sacks. If the rains begin it will be difficult to install the bags as waves will easily wash them away,” said V T Sebastian, patron of Janakiyavedi. In July last year, Chellanam had witnessed the worst ever sea flooding since 2017 Ockhi cyclone. Moreover, people faced a double whammy when the sea erosion hit them amid the severe pandemic, which made Chellanam one of the worst Covid containment zones in Ernakulam. Usually the irrigation department would install geobags as emergency measure but this time nothing of the sort has happened so far. So people are relying on sand bags.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/residents-collect-empty-sacks-to-build-temp-seawall/articleshow/82333380.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

He said positivity rate and bed occupancy in the district is higher than the suggested limit, so we are heading towards a lockdown, if will don’t contain our movement.

Polling staff, on their part, stuck to Covid-19 protocols within the polling station with most of them wearing a face shield too in addition to other precautions that were taken.  At some of the polling stations, despite the authorities marking distance between each voter in the queue, this was given a go-by as the voters closed in when there was a big crowd. Police had to use mild force to disperse Congress and TRS cadres in wards 57 and 58 in Khammam Municipal Corporation polls. Workers of both the parties got into a tussle over fake voters being brought to cast their votes in the election. Congress workers staged a demonstration in front of a school where the polling was being held in ward No. 57 alleging that fake voters had been brought by the TRS to cast votes. The Congress workers raised slogans against police and the government. When pleas by police to Congress workers to leave the place did not materialise, police resorted to a lathicharge as Congress and TRS workers entered into fisticuffs. Both the TRS and Congress made allegations against each other saying that they were trying to rig the polls. In Achampet which was among the five municipalities which went to polls, Nagarkurnool district collector L Sharman inspected the arrangements inside the polling booths. A temperature check was done for voters and those who did not wear masks were provided masks. Every voter was made to sanitise his or her hands. Inside the polling stations, Covid-19 precautions were implemented in all places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-at-booths/articleshow/82334214.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Nagpur||Keeping kids busy during vacations a challenge for parents||NAGPUR: As online academic session closes for the year, parents are worried just pondering over how to keep their kids engaged over the summer vacation in which movement will most certainly be restricted due to the pandemic. The easiest option, to which majority of parents succumb, is to let mobile phones take over as babysitters, leaving kids staring at the screen for anywhere between 6-10 hours cumulatively every day. That level of exposure itself poses a threat, according to well-known ophthalmologist and TOI Nagpur Heroes awardee Dr Vinay Nangia. “Increased screen time means there are higher chances of myopia. In a mobile screen, you are not only reading but looking at constantly moving visuals and everything puts pressure on the eye,” said Dr Nangia. Academic Shilpee Ganguly feels parents need to get involved with their children’s daily lives if they want to see concrete changes. “Parents have to take the effort or else it won’t work. They have to go back in time and recollect how they played indoor games, read books etc. It’s not easy to keep children engaged during vacations. Hence, I stress that parents will have to commit substantial time,” said Ganguly, who’s also the principal of Centre Point School (Katol Road). Principal of SFS High School Fr Prashant said, “These vacations must be used for constructive engagement online. Children can learn a new language, drawing etc through free online videos. Because screen time can’t be avoided completely, why not use that in a productive manner.” Psychiatrist Dr Suleiman Virani said parents have to act as role models during these tough times. “Children rely mostly on parents about how they will pass the time. Kids have high frustration levels, depression, anxiety, feelings of boredom, uncertainties. Give quality time to kids and be a role model for them. If parents follow an ideal timetable for all household chores, kids will copy it,” said Dr Virani. He added that the more parents interact with children, the more open the young ones will be in their communication. Dr Virani said, “Ask them to write a diary as it’s a wonderful habit which will help them engage and communicate with themselves. There must be strict no-screen time slots as well.” Dr Rajiv Mohta, adolescent counselor and MD (paediatrics), said parents must engage children on four levels. “The WHO says health and well-being require engagement of kids physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. So, parents must make sure that they don’t end up focusing only on one aspect while ignoring others. Give small responsibilities to children like putting clothes in washing machine or ordering groceries online etc. This gives them a sense of responsibility and they too feel like adults, something which is a very important part of their growing up phase,” said Dr Mohta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/keeping-kids-busy-during-vacations-a-challenge-for-parents/articleshow/82334217.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He did not file the petition seeking publicity and there were valid reasons for the plea, he told reporters here on Friday. “In the assembly elections that were held on April 6, there was large-scale distribution of bribe to voters. I sent a plea to the Election Commission of India to defer the counting. A panel of Supreme Court judges should probe the issue and till then, presidential rule should be imposed in TN, I had requested. When there was no response, I filed a petition in the high court. But the court rejected my plea. I deny that the petition was frivolous or that I had filed it for publicity. I approached the court as a party leader and not as an individual, to uphold democracy,” he said. “I will take it to the Supreme Court, because this was not done in the interests of me or my party, but in the larger interest of democracy,” Krishnaswamy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pt-leader-disappointed-by-hc-dismissal-of-his-plea/articleshow/82334233.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

And if the allottees voluntarily surrender their land to the government, it would save time.” Eatala claims the land was not being used for farming and that the farmers voluntarily surrendered the land to the mandal revenue officer (MRO) after being convinced with his explanation. The land is yet to be transferred on the poultry farm’s name. “I am a six-time MLA and the people know my honesty. They are already feeling bad over the way I am being targeted. Some news channels ran the land grabbing story against me without even taking my version, which makes it clear that they are trying to malign my image and name,” he said. “There are several people who used to roam on a scooter and are now owners of businesses and properties worth hundreds of crores of rupees. They became crorepatis overnight. Conduct an inquiry against all such people to bring out truth,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/had-informed-cm-of-hatchery-expansion-plan-says-eatala/articleshow/82334236.cms||---

The two victims were a 33-year-old man and a 26-year-old man who died after hospitalization in Coimbatore Medical College due to acute respiratory distress and bilateral bronchopneumonia. Both had no comorbidities. Meanwhile, with fresh stock of vaccines yet to arrive in Tamil Nadu, the health department suspended the plan to vaccinate people from 18 to 45 years temporarily. “The plan has been suspended temporarily until further orders. The vaccination programme for those above 45 years will continue as usual,” a statement issued by deputy director of health services Ramesh Kumar said. Meanwhile, it was utter chaos at the vaccination centre set up at Government Arts College on Friday by Coimbatore Medical College authorities. Authorities had set up a centre in the college opposite the hospital to decongest CMCH and reduce general public’s exposure to the virus. However, close to 800 people, including senior citizens, turned up. “We received only 500 doses of the vaccine and administered every dose. However, they got over by 12pm,” said a senior CMCH doctor. While they managed to administer the first dose to 375 beneficiaries, the second dose was administered to 125 people. The vaccination staff ended up giving tokens to hundreds of people, who they had to refuse. With people desperate to get tokens, many of them formed huge groups outside the closed shutters and started questioning the police personnel stationed there. “The rapid increase in cases, combined with constant reports of vaccine shortage, is making people nervous and desperate for the vaccine. While we have given tokens to hundreds of people, we don’t know how many doses we will receive and can vaccinate on Saturday,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vaccination-drive-for-18-suspended/articleshow/82334238.cms||---

C Palanisamy of Murugaraja Nagar in Kothandaramapuram panchayat is undergoing treatment at Pudukottaigovernment medical college hospital for multiple injuries. According to his complaint with Annavasal police, the incident happened on Thursday when over 15 people, most of them women family members of panchayat president Veerayi, assaulted him when he was making door-to-door visits selling soaps. Palanisamy has given several complaints against Veerayi’s sons V Selvaraj, 45, and V Perumal, 42 for illegally mining sand from south Vellaru river near the village. As his complaints were not taken up by the police, he went on to file a public interest litigation before the Madras high court. Palanisamy told TOI that he was waylaid by Veerayi’s family members who picked up a quarrel with him for repeatedly lodging complaints against the two men. “I asked them to stop illegal sand mining, but they started attacking me with wooden logs,” he said adding that sand mining has been banned in the water body. He alleged that the local officials and police were hand in glove with them. This is not the first time that Palanisamy was beaten up. He said he was manhandled by a group two months ago after he approached the district collector and superintendent of police against the illegal sand mining. “All my complaints are being ignored by the authorities. There is threat to my life, but I will not give up the cause,” he said. Illupur DSP J Arulmozhi Arasu said a case has been booked against both the sides as both have lodged a complaint against each other at the Annavasal police station. Asked on the charges of illegal sand mining, the DSP said that police are carrying out investigation with both the sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/activist-beaten-up-for-opposing-sand-mining/articleshow/82334235.cms||Sampath Kumar

While it is a season activity, milkweed butterflies, which have a single plant or tree as their food source, have congregated in large numbers on the TBCT campus. TBCT has recorded over 125 butterfly species and 116 bird species so far. Milkweed butterflies like common crow, blue tigers, plain tiger and striped tiger butterfly species are a common sight at TBTC in April, which is the butterfly congregation month. Thousands of stripped tiger butterfly species have been spotted in the TBCT, which proves that it provides optimum environment for the butterfly congregation, said V Muthu Krishnan, junior research fellow at TBCT. While the butterflies mostly migrate from Pachamalai hills near TBCT, upper Anaicut reserve forest, Cauvery and Kollidam rivers provides the suitable path for butterfly migration.

---||Hyderabad||Chargesheet filed against corporator||Hyderabad: Three weeks after the second additional metropolitan magistrate at Nampally directed the Abids police to submit a status report in the case against BJP Jambagh corporator Rakesh Jaiswal, the investigators have filed a chargesheet. Counsel for AIMIM candidate Khaja Aijazuddin has filed a petition with court seeking direction to the Abids police to expedite the investigation which is pending since 70 days. The case is regarding an alleged false affidavit by Jaiswal, who got elected as Jambagh corporator in the GHMC elections held in December. Petitioner’s counsel said that the investigation didn’t conclude even after 70 days, compelling his client J Ravindra to file a petition before magistrate as per the Supreme Court ruling to seek a status report, monitor and direct the SHO, Abids to file a chargesheet against Jaiswal. Complying with the court's direction the Abids police have filed a chargesheet against the BJP Jambagh coporator. However, Jaiswal approached the Telangana High Court to quash the proceedings against him. It may be recalled that the MIM candidate claimed in his complaint the that Jaiswal had supressed the facts. Though he has three children he claimed in his affidavit that he is having only two . As per the law, having three kids makes on e ineligible to contest in GHMC elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chargesheet-filed-against-corporator/articleshow/82334252.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Mental well-being necessary to beat Covid gloom: Experts||Ludhiana: The Covid-19 pandemic has severely affected the psychology of the people with health experts witnessing a rise sharp in the number of people seeking mental healthcare since the outbreak. Doctors and psychologists are of the view that mental well being is of utmost importance to beat the Covid-19 stress. Psychologist Dr Vinay Sangal said, “Taking breaks from watching, listening, reading news stories including those on social media is necessary. It will be best if people can disconnect from phone, TV and computer screens for a while.” City-based therapist Ibrahim said, “Try to do some activities that you enjoy, connect with others, talk with people about your concerns and how you are feeling, connect with community or faith-based organisations. Keep ‘physical’ not social distance from others. While social distancing measures are in place, try connecting online or through social media, phone or mail. In difficult times, it is normal for children to have strong reactions such as sadness, irritability or confusion.” Psychologist Tejpreet Kaur said, “Children are experiencing different type of emotions in pandemic such as sadness, irritation, feeling lonely. So, I would advice parents that they should promote regular routines and schedules or create new ones in new environment, encourage children to actively listen and develop an understanding attitude, create opportunities for children to play, to be physically active and to relax.” Rashmi Arora, another psychiatrist, said, “Taking care of yourself can better equip you to take care of others. During times of social distancing, it is especially important to stay connected with your friends and family. Helping others cope with stress through video calls, chats and mails can help you and your loved ones feel less isolated or lonely.” Dr Avneet Kaur, PhD in human development and family studies, is of the view that one should take care of his/her body by taking deep breaths. Besides, people should try to eat healthy and well balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep and avoid excessive alcohol, tobacco and substance use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mental-well-being-necessary-to-beat-covid-gloom-experts/articleshow/82332813.cms||---

The delay was attributed to the hesitation shown by Southern Railway in closing the existing level crossing, cited as a mandatory by NHAI to commission the project that was completed after 11 years.Aimed at preventing the vehicles from getting piled up while crossing the railway tracks near Kalamavur, the RoB was proposed in 2010 to ensure seamless movement on the Pudukkottai highway that connects Karaikudi and Rameshwaram. However, work resumed in September 2019. The 1.6km long RoB was revived as part of the Rs Rs 122 crore fund received by NHAI to complete the pending projects. After 14 months, although the RoB including the approach roads were completed in February, the facility remains closed. Commuters and locals who frequent the road had been urging the NHAI to open the RoB without any further delay. “We are willing to open the RoB for traffic but railways has to close the existing level crossing. Opening the RoB with a functioning level crossing may lead to violation of the MoU signed between us and the railways,” a source in the NHAI said. Meanwhile, a source said that the demand by a section of locals for a limited use subway to get across the railway tracks, is technically not feasible. A source in Southern Railway said that a discussion involving senior officials is underway to commission the RoB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/keeranur-rob-ready-but-open-rly-crossing-delays-its-commissioning/articleshow/82334255.cms||Deepak Karthik

The final polling percentage was a dismal 27.62 as against 48.83 per cent in the elections held in December 2020. Though there were five candidates in electoral fray from this ward including three independents and it is a straight contest between BJP and Congress in this ward as TRS did not contest. On the request of BJP leaders, TRS working president KT Rama Rao had announced that the ruling party will not field its candidate. The bypoll was necessitated due to the death of BJP sitting corporator Akula Ramesh Goud due to Covid-19. He died before taking oath was the corporator. The saffron party fielded his son Mandugula Akhil Goud. Though BJP leaders along with the family members of Ramesh Gioud also requested the Congress to make the bypoll unanimous in favour of BJP candidate, the Congress fielded Daripally Rajashekhar Reddy, who had finished in third place in 2020 polls. TRS was runners-up from Lingojiguda in December 2020 polls. While BJP leaders exuded confidence of retaining the ward, Congress LB Nagar in-charge Malreddy Ram Reddy told TOI that the Congress will wrest the seat from the saffron party as secular vote would not be divided due to absence of TRS from the electoral fray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lingojiguda-sees-only-27-voting/articleshow/82334265.cms||Roushan Ali

The decision, jointly taken by all the housing associations under the Dehradun Residents Welfare Front (DRWF), has been taken to contain further spread of Covid-19 infections. "We have asked the people to grant leaves to their domestic workers but not cut their salaries. This way they won't be affected financially. Also, this reduces the risk of transmission of the virus," said Mahesh Bhandari, president, DRWF. The RWA officials in the Race Course area have made it mandatory for residents to wear masks while moving around in the society premises. Those who own houses in these societies have been urged to not host any guests till the situation gets better. Further, all delivery transactions take place at the society gate and the commodities are collected only after proper sanitisation. Further, several residents are coming forward to help their Covid-infected neighbours and their families with medicines and home-cooked meals. “The prevailing situation is grim and there is a shortage of medical oxygen and beds at several facilities. In such conditions, self-regulation is crucial. Besides, we keep a tab on people who test positive for Covid-19 and make an attempt to ensure that others don't catch the virus from them," added Bhandari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residential-societies-in-self-isolation-mode-in-doon/articleshow/82333439.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Besides, a high number of migrants is likely to come to the Himalayan state by May 15, according to the Uttarakhand migration commission. Starting May 15, the Uttarakhand migration commission will start compiling the data of returning migrant workers. “We are confident that the government schemes will encourage the migrants to stay back in the state and search for earning opportunities here itself,” said SS Negi, vice-chairperson of Uttarakhand Migration and Rural Development. According to the data released on September 30, 2020, around 3.27 lakh migrant workers had returned to the state since the outbreak of Covid-19. However, more than a lakh people returned to other states when the situation improved in the last couple of months of 2020. According to rough estimates, Dehradun hosted the maximum number of returning migrant workers, followed by Haridwar, Almora, Pauri, Udham Singh Nagar, Nainital, Tehri, Pithoragarh, Champawat, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Bageshwar and Uttarkashi. “Around 5,000 people, who returned to the hill state in 2020, have started their work here,” added Negi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-migration-commission-to-compile-data-of-returnees-from-may-15/articleshow/82333435.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Trichy||Road widened, but electricity poles still remain in the middle||Trichy: The road widening work near Keelakurichi hamlet bordering the city has been taken up without shifting the electricity poles as some are right in the middle of the widened road. Locals say that commuters accessing the widened stretch may end up colliding with the poles as the street does not have street lamps. The road linking Keelakurichi with Keela Kalkandarkottai is a crucial link for residents of Thiruverumbur to access the city and reach the Ponmalai railway workshop. As the road was narrow for vehicles, the state highways had launched work on widening the road from 3.75m to 7m. A few layers has already been laid. “The ongoing road work without shifting the EB poles look completely unsafe. There are at least three lampposts in the middle of the road,” said M V Tamilselvan, a railway employee from Keelakurichi said. A few poles are not upright either and any impact to may cause the live wires to hang lose or fall, the locals said. State highways department officials said that an estimate was prepared and submitted to Tangedco for paying the labour cost involved in shifting the poles. “Since the shifting of EB poles is a long process, we initiated the road work. The poles will be shifted to the boundaries and the cavities will be filled and levelled once the model code of conduct is over,” an official with the state highways said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/road-widened-but-electricity-poles-still-remain-in-the-middle/articleshow/82334266.cms||Deepak Karthik

The police station will receive and resolve grievances of the public with a separate police team. Tamil Nadu government earlier in 2019 had said that 46 cybercrime police stations will be established across the state. As the cyber offences are increasing gradually, the Ariyalur district police unit established a special unit on the third floor of the superintendent of the police office. The station will have an inspector, two sub-inspectors (law and orders, technical) and two constables to act on the complaints. If any complaints pertaining to cybercrime are received in other police stations of the district, the respective units will direct such complaints to the cybercrime unit. Complaints pertaining to online bank fraud, deception with false online promises, online sexual offences and threats issued through online platforms will be investigated by the special unit. Even complaints against derogatory remarks passed on social media can be lodged at the police station. Superintendent of police, V Baskaran, had opened the facility and urged the special team to fasten the investigation for the complaints received. “On inauguration day itself we received a complaint. A man had lost Rs 1.8 lakh in a fake advertisement scam,” a police source said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cybercrime-police-station-opened-in-ariyalur-dist/articleshow/82334256.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Urban cases peaked in April, rural spike starting now: Experts||NAGPUR: April has been the worst ever Covid-19 month for Vidarbha so far. With record 3.83 lakh cases and 5,670 deaths reported; April saw almost 12,800 cases and 190 deaths per day. This might appear to have been the peak of the second wave for the region, but it’s not. According to experts who have been following the Covid-19 pattern in Vidarbha since the beginning, April may have witnessed Covid-19 peak in urban Vidarbha only. So, cases in cities like Nagpur, Amravati, Akola and Chandrapur are showing a plateau like development. However, cases are now coming from rural parts of the region, which has led to the total number of daily cases remaining unchanged at around 15,000+ since last 10-12 days. Nagpur used to account for more than 50% of total Vidarbha cases in the first two weeks of April. On April 30, Nagpur accounts for 41% of the total cases. This shows decline in cases from the city. In the same way, Amravati, Akola, and Chandrapur used to account for more than 50% cases in their respective districts till April 20. In last one week, cases from district headquarters have gone down to 30% and on an average 70% cases are coming from rural parts of the respective districts. “Rural spread of Covid-19 is well known in Vidarbha and more cases coming from periphery are sharp indicators of the same. The state government has continued the restrictions for more than two weeks taking the rural spread into consideration,” said a senior pulmonologist, who is also member of Covid-19 task force. He said that proper containment of Covid-19 in rural Vidarbha will be achieved only by the end of May 2021, provided the restrictions continue till then. “The state Covid-19 task force has suggested to the government to restrict inter-district travel till May 31. We will see sharp decline in state figures after that,” the doctor said. Comparison shows some good signs even in April. September 2020 was the peak of first wave of Covid-19 in which 90,204 cases and 2,428 deaths were reported. April 2021 reported over four times more new cases than September peak and slightly more than double the deaths. This indicates that the virus is more infectious in this wave but less fatal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/urban-cases-peaked-in-april-rural-spike-starting-now-experts/articleshow/82334259.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Trichy||High cost cotton yarn affect Karur home textile units||Trichy: The more than 60% increase in cotton yarn price for the last two months has affected home textile exporters in Karur district. With an annual turnover of Rs Rs 5,000 crore, these textile units have asked the government to regulate yarn export and relax import duty on cotton to stabilise the cost of yarn.While 50% of the yarn produced in the country is from Tamil Nadu, home textile units procure it from mills in Coimbatore and Dindigul districts. Though the lockdown enforced in March 2020 had adversely affected the home textile business, things started looking up five months later in August. “It was the same time when the requirement for cotton yarn too increased, which subsequently encouraged its export,” said Atlas M Nachimuthu, president, Karur Textile Exporters Association. The cost of yarn gradually started increasing from November 2020. “Since we had already accepted orders on a price for home textile export material, we could not increase the price. This has been affecting our profit margin,” he said. We urge the government to relax the import duty on cotton and check on export of yarn to stabilise its price, said Nachimuthu. On the other hand, small and medium units blame it on the large units for hoarding cotton yarn and selling it in the black market, adding to the cost. Executive committee member of Karur Textile Exporters Association R Stiffen Babu said prices are also increasing because of the unethical practices of big home textile units. Major exporters are blocking yarn supply by making bulk bookings and preventing small players from getting it, he said. S Jagadesh Chandran, vice-president of South India Spinners Association, put the onus of the increased cost of yarn on Cotton Corporation of India (CCI). The cost of a kilogram of cotton now is fixed at Rs Rs 140 by CCI, which is Rs Rs 20 higher than the cost before the Covid-19 outbreak. Unless the central government brings down the cost of raw cotton, the cost of yarn is unlikely to come down, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/high-cost-cotton-yarn-affect-karur-home-textile-units/articleshow/82334269.cms||Sampath Kumar

The institute is also carrying out sequencing of the virus to get more data about its variants. In September last year, TOI reported the Centre appointed Neeri as the hub for all Covid-19 testing centres in the city. Apart from being the designated regional hub, the institute is also serving as the spoke model for the Centre for Covid-19 testing. According to director S Chandrashekhar, Neeri on April 26 crossed 1 million-test mark, highest in the country so far. As a hub, the institute also provided training to 40 personnel from various labs in and out of the city. Of the 1 million tests, over 50,000 were carried out using the dry swab technology. As reported by TOI on Friday, Neeri is the only laboratory in the country using this method. Using this technology, the institute has been able to complete tests in record time of less than three hours. Unlike the conventional RT-PCR testing being carried out across the country, the dry swab method eliminates the need of viral transport medium – a liquid which has specific ingredients to keep the virus viable and safe. Neeri scientists are working on other major researches too. After carrying out study of double mutant strain of Covid-19 virus along with Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), they are now conducting sequencing of the virus for identifying its variations and understanding phylogenetics. “We are looking at mutations in the region, how different are they or how closely related and other properties. This study will make a huge societal impact in combating the pandemic,” said Krishna Khairnar, scientist and head of environmental virology cell at Neeri. He is also the coordinator of Department of Biotechnology’s Covid-19 testing regional hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeri-lab-completes-1mn-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/82334274.cms||Manka Behl
---||Pune||Covid-19: Vaccine shortage in Pune limits prompts rush in rural areas||PUNE: Many citizens from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic areas are flocking to adjoining rural areas of Khed, Haveli, Shirur and Maval talukas to get vaccine shots in view of the shortage of doses in urban centres. Rural health officials have observed this pattern in the last couple of weeks. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, told TOI on Friday, “The reason why people are travelling to rural areas to receive the shots could be because the availability of doses is much higher in rural Pune than in city areas.” Rural Pune has 405 vaccination centres across 13 tehsils and usually gets 50,000 to 55,000 doses of vaccines, he said. Dr Jayshree Mahajan, in-charge of PHC, Karanjvihare village in Khed tehsil, said, “Over 1,000 people from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas like Navi Sangvi, Pimple Gurav, Pimple Nilkah have come to our centre to get themselves vaccinated. Also, employees working in Chakan MIDC areas got themselves vaccinated at our centre.” Similar trend was observed by Dr Harish Lohar, head of Perne village PHC in Shirur tehsil. He said, “Citizens from Wagholi, Kharadi, Chandanagar, Wadgaonsheri and other areas received jabs at our centre. They received both doses in time.” A senior official from the ZP’s health department said. “In Pune and PCMC areas, the beneficiaries have to wait at vaccination centres for long time due to poor planning. However in villages, the local leaders are actively involved in the drive. They bring people from hamlets as per the availability of doses and there is no crowding.” Dr Sachin Kharat, health officer, Haveli tehsil, said, “After we noticed that many citizens from city areas were coming to our centres, we allocated extra doses to make the process hassle-free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-shortage-in-city-limits-prompts-rush-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82334287.cms||Sandip Dighe

Hospitals have been left alone to fight on all these fronts. No help is coming from anyone,” said Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer of Ruby Hall Clinic and president of Association of Hospitals, an umbrella body of big hospitals in Pune. “Dealing with a large number of patients is certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Besides, there is a potential risk of getting infected while providing care. At the same time, there’s the burden of telephonic communications with home quarantined patients and relatives of people hospitalized. All these factors take a toll on doctors and the support staff. Society in general needs to understand this and stand by them,” said infectious diseases expert Sanay Pujari who is also a member of the national task force. Sanjeev Wavare, nodal officer (Covid-19) of the Pune Municipal Corporation, said, “We help private hospitals in arranging oxygen cylinders through our buffer stock or with drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab. But all these resources are in short supply. There is no denying that their distressed calls are on the rise.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “The healthcare system is doing everything possible with the avaiable resources. The local administration is enforcing regulations set by the state and Centre without even considering the situation on the ground.” He said, “The local health department is overburdened and has become over-dependent on the administration. At the state level, the task force and top officials are changing guidelines almost every day according to the medicines and oxygen availability. Ensuring enough supplies of vaccines, medicines and oxygen is the state government and district administration’s responsibility.” Physician Aniket Joshi has been dispensing duties at Covid patients’ ICUs ever since the pandemic broke out in March last year. “I have worked in government, charitable and private sectors. I have never felt so helpless as now,” he said. Joshi, who is also president of the Association of Physicians of India’s Pune chapter, “I helplessly watch people suffering in Pune. The city should have got major attention in terms of support systems. Unfortunately, we haven’t got that attention in terms of the necessary resources. I sincerely request the government to restore the supply and help us serve the Covid-19 patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/medical-fraternity-feels-let-down-in-fight-against-ncov/articleshow/82334272.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid daily case count rises 21 times from poll start to now||KOLKATA: The elections are now over and political parties are waiting with bated breath for the D-day. But whoever wins this election, one thing seems certain: Bengal, which stands on the cusp of one of the biggest health crises, has lost out big time. When elections were announced on February 26, Bengal recorded just over 200 new cases daily with the active case count around 3,300. There were three deaths that day. As political parties began to hit the streets in the first week of March, the cases had dipped below 200 while the active case count hovered around the 3,000-mark. Between the time Bengal went to poll on March 27 and the eighth phase on April 29, new daily Covid case count had increased 21 times; active case count 16 times and deaths three-and-a-half times. TimesViewBengal and Kolkata have had to endure an eight-phase vote in the middle of Covid. Hopefully, we will draw lessons from all the mistakes made over the last few months and avoid repeating them.“Bengal had been hit by natural disasters like two successive famines. But this is a man-made disaster, politically imposed suffering on people by provoking the virus. Look at the extent of damage it has done – every second person is testing positive to the infection. From Darjeeling to the Sunderbans, no region — be it urban or rural — has been spared. The healthcare system is so overwhelmed. As a doctor, I have never seen such a helpless situation,” said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar. Midway through the elections, parties undertook a frenzied campaign during the seven-day break. Repeated warnings from doctors were lost in the din. From 4,000-odd new cases, 21,000 active cases and 12 deaths on April 10, when the fourth phase of elections was held, the case count had crossed the 7,500 mark on April 17, active case count spiralled beyond 45,000 and 43 deaths were recorded on April 17 when the fifth phase of election was held. The bed crunch was beginning to be felt. Bengal, it was now certain, was heading for a health emergency. But electioneering went on as did poll violence. “The mass gatherings during election rallies, meetings have proved to be super spreaders, leaving Bengal bleeding. The 21-time higher cases that we are seeing today could have been prevented if EC had put a curb on all political gatherings right when doctors had started sounding the alarm after the first phase,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui attached with Swasthya Bhawan. By the time the Election Commission reacted to the avalanche of criticism that it wasn’t doing enough to contain crowding at rallies and roadshows and announced more stringent measures, Bengal was in ICU. The Left Front announced it would not hold any big rallies. But the two primary rivals — Trinamool Congress and BJP — did not indicate any concessions. Trinamool though demanded the remaining three election phases be clubbed. But the EC refused to change the schedule. When the elections finally drew to a close on April 29 and party workers fought pitched battles on the streets while doctors and nurses fought to save lives in hospitals, the daily case count was over 17,000, the active case count was 1.1 lakh and deaths 89. “This election has proved to be an ugly and violent fight for the throne. We might not have been able to keep the second wave at bay. But we would have been able to avoid this sharp curve and handle the situation much better had it not been for the long-drawn election battle. Covid has engulfed the entire state now, not even sparing rural Bengal that had remained mostly immune to the first wave,” said SSKM hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, mentor to the Covid Care Network.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-daily-case-count-rises-21-times-from-poll-start-to-now/articleshow/82333510.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||Farmers hold tractor march in Patiala, remove barricades||Patiala: Intensifying their protest against the land acquisition for Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway and other national highways in Punjab, a large number of farmers took out a tractor march in Patiala on Friday. They blocked various roads and chowks after removing several police barricades while trying to gherao the chief minister’s residence in the heart of city. The farmers are protesting against the lesser compensation being offered to them than the prevailing market rate for their land being acquired for the expressway. They had announced to hold a tractor march in Patiala over a week ago. Police said there were around 3,000 farmers and around 300 tractors in the protest. Delhi-Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharsh Committee (DKEKSC) coordinator Harmanpreet Singh Jeji said, “We had blocked the YPS Chowk and Officer Colony road, Sular Chowk, Moti Bagh Gurdwara, Fountain Chowk and Thikriwala Chowk by sitting in protest for an indefinite period. Farmers coming from Sirhind have been stopped by police near Dukhniwaran Sahib Gurdwara. There are more than 10,000 farmers and 1,000 tractors. We cancelled the tractor march as police failed to provide us route for a protest march.” However, police claimed that farm leaders hoodwinked them by claiming that they wanted to discuss the road map for tractor march before its start at 11.30am but they march towards the CM’s residence before 9am. Officials claimed that two cops on duty were injured after farmers broke barricades with tractors. A senior cop said that Civil Lines SHO Gurpreet Singh had to lie down on the road to stop the protesters from proceeding towards the CM’s residence. SDM Patiala Charanjit Singh said, “We have arranged a meeting of farmers with a panel of state government under FCR and cabinet minister for Tuesday. We also appealed to them against holding a road blockade as it could harm Covid patients and hit supply of oxygen. Two cops were injured and have been hospitalised. No case has been registered so far.” The protesting farmers other demands include that state government halt the land acquisition process till the issue of three central farm laws is resolved and farmers agitating at Delhi borders are back. Around two months back, DKEKSC members had joined hands with a farm front protesting near Tikri border of Delhi under the banner of Bharat Bhumi Bachao Sangharsh Committee (BBBSC). BBBSC president Ramesh Dalal joined the protest here on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-hold-tractor-march-in-patiala-remove-barricades/articleshow/82334279.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the city, a group of experts have come together to save the life of a four-year-old camel from Rajasthan, which was found injured at a farm near Amravati. Around 15 days back, farmers spotted the injured animal in a rural area, around 40km from Amravati. They said the camel, which belonged to the ‘banjaras’, had met with a road accident and was in immense pain, unable to get up. Wanting to save his life, the locals along with members of Help Foundation started contacting animal welfare organizations in various cities. Through some activists based in Mumbai, they got connected to Nagpur-based animal welfare activist Karishma Galani. She contacted Ajay Maheshwari, an animal lover and also founder of Maheshwari Animal Welfare Foundation, who immediately arranged for a truck and crane to transport the animal. At the spot, volunteers of Help Foundation ensured the animal was lifted safely and then transported nearly 200km to Nagpur. After reaching here, Galani admitted the animal to the government veterinary polyclinic at Alankar Talkies Square. For 15 days, doctors and activists took care of the animal, ensuring proper treatment and food. After undergoing the required treatment, doctors finally performed a surgery on Friday to amputate the animal’s injured leg. The surgery, which went on for nearly six hours, was performed by Dr Shirish Upadhyay and Dr Mayur Kate. Guidance was also taken from doctors based in Rajasthan, where doctors have more experience of operating on camels. Activists have assured to arrange for an artificial leg for the animal so that it would be able to walk. “Camels are brought here by the banjaras, who at times fail to treat them well. We are in touch with a NGO which is running an animal shelter in Rajasthan. Once the animal is completely healed, we will consider sending it to the shelter. Living in its habitat will be better for it,” said Galani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heroes-bring-injured-camel-from-200km-doctors-amputate-leg/articleshow/82335292.cms||Manka Behl
---||Nagpur||Anti-cancer drugs in the forefront to fight Covid-19||Nagpur: The repurposed cancer immunotherapeutic agents or the anti-cancer drugs like Tocilizumab, Bevacizumab, Infliximab, Itilozumab and others seems to have become potent weapons for the medical fraternity treating SARS-CoV-2 patients, despite the risk factor associated with them. Though the immuno-suppressant properties have triggered high concern, the medical fraternity still feels that taking calculated risk is better than losing a battle without a fight.Apart from life-saving Tocilizumab, Infliximab, Bevacizumab, Itilozumab, drugs like Baricitinib and Tofacitinib are among the ones that too are the lesser-known experimental therapies in the gamut of the anti-Covid treatments.As per the experts, the use of Tofacitinib with steroids has yielded a higher degree of success so far in many cases. Baricitinib, which was earlier approved to treat Rheumatoid arthritis, has shown reduced inflammation effects by blocking SARS-CoV-2 and saving the cells from its damages. Dr Rajesh Atal, senior physician and attached to Orange City Hospital, said the anti-cancer drugs are basically monoclonal antibodies that acts on the inflammation cascade. “These anti-cancer drugs have a mechanism by which they act on a specific antigen,” he said. Dr Atal said he had been using relatively newer drugs like Tofacitinib. “The extrapolated data of cancer treatment are being used to apply in Covid. These drugs are helping many patients from proceeding to severity from moderate level,” he said.Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease expert, said these anti-cancer drugs are the repurposed ones that have been used with some success. The doctors said the Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a life-threatening inflammatory response, is common in cancer patients. Similar pattern of inflammatory response has been observed in Covid patients. The worldwide studies are being done to ascertain whether the anti-cancer immunotherapies can be extrapolated in Covid treatment too. The doctors also stated that monoclonal antibodies of these drugs are formulated in such a way that they get attached to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 at different locations creating a barrier for it to enter the patient’s cell. Dr Sanjay Jain, director of the Shanti Mohan Hospital, said the anti-cancer drugs are immunomodulators that release cytokine suppressants paving way for their control which in turn helps the Covid patients to overcome the disease. “Using these immuno-suppressants should be done with great caution as they tend to push up the fungal and bacterial infections,” said Dr Jain. According to an experienced pharmacist, doctors have started prescribing Barricitinib and Tofacitinib that are now available in the markets and are in demands. “Doctors are using these new drugs to see their effects. The demand has increased,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anti-cancer-drugs-in-the-forefront-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/82333467.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Pimpri Chinchwad municipal authorities will vaccinate 200 beneficiaries from the group at their three centres.In the PMC limits, the drive for 18-44 age group will be held at Kamala Nehru Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi hospital. “Only those who have registered for vaccination via CoWin app or portal and have selected the designated hospitals will get the shot,” said Ashish Bharati, head of the PMC health department. He added that citizens should not rush to the vaccination centres as walk-ins were not allowed for the 18-44 age group. The other vaccination centres will be kept close due to non-availability of the vaccines for beneficiaries above 45 years. If the stock is available before Monday, the vaccination for this category will be restarted.PCMC officials said citizens would be able to get vaccinated at New Bhosari Hospital, New Jijamata Hospital and Premlok from 11am and 5pm.The PMC is contemplating reorganizing the number of municipal vaccination centres. As per the proposal, only two vaccination centres will be allotted per ward. A total of 88 centres in civic areas (two each per 44 wards), including 11 merged villages, will be available from the end of next week. The PCMC will do the final micro-planning on Saturday.Besides, as many as 23,714 beneficiaries got the jab at the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Friday.

The industries department got in touch with a few re-fillers in Satara for certain modifications and maintenance. One of the units was started recently.” He said the per day oxygen generation capacity of the unit was seven metric tonnes (210 metric tonnes a month ). “This can cater to nearby re-fillers, who can then supply to hospitals. The system can refill 60 jumbo cylinders (of 7 cubic metre), which are normally used in hospitals. We have made a provision that 30 such cylinders can be refilled in an hour’s time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/defunct-o2-production-unit-revived-after-3-years/articleshow/82334293.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Month ends with the highest Covid case addition in 30-day period||MUMBAI: April ended on a worrying note for Maharashtra with 17.8 lakh new Covid-19 cases and 13,835 deaths, highest monthly addition so far. Mumbai alone accounted for 2.3 lakh cases and 1,479 deaths. Though infections recorded in April were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, the city's deadliest month continues to be June and July 2020 when 3,277 and 1,797 fatalities were registered respectively. The state reported a dip in daily detections on Friday adding 62,919 cases, taking total caseload to 46 lakh. Deaths reported were 828, taking total tally to 68,813. Daily Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has been more than 1% for the last six days. Monthly CFR for April was 0.7% against 0.3% in March. Even in Mumbai, death rate in the last week of April crossed 1% and may continue to remain high for a longer time. Civic officials said some unreported deaths could be added to the city's tally. In terms of cases, there has been a 158% jump in the city in April (2.3 lakh) compared to March (88,856). The silver lining though has been the drop in positivity rate to 10% and daily burden of cases. Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist and member of the Covid taskforce, said Mumbai is very much still in the centre of the second wave. “Let’s not start self-congratulating ourselves yet. We may have plateaued, but we must continue testing, tracing and treating. In addition, we have to start preparing for the third wave in terms of ensuring availability of oxygen and medicines,” he said. Globally, the third wave appear to be smaller than the second one, but one really can’t predict, he said. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray too said the state was preparing for a possible third wave and while strict lockdown-like restrictions have been imposed the state is continuously working towards adding more beds, ramping up oxygen supply and even adding more testing capacity. "Experts have cited a possibility of a third wave and we should prepare for it. We want to ensure that if we have to shut down again during the third wave, we want to ensure that there is least economic impact," said Thackeray. Meanwhile, at the state level, Pune circle added 15,260 cases and 220 deaths, the highest in the state. With cases continuing to rise in the MMR region, Mira-Bhayander issued fresh lockdown orders: All shops, vegetable and fruits markets are to be shut on the weekends starting Saturday till further orders. All civic markets and sale of vegetables/fruit in housing societies will be barred for five days starting Saturday.

---||Nagpur||Centralise all Covid-19 drugs under DMA Act: HC to government||NAGPUR: Running out of patience after the Maharashtra government failed to act on shortage of drugs, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday ordered it to centralize all purchases of Covid-19 medicines and essentials, including Remdesivir, under the Disaster Management Act.“We direct it to exercise powers for centralizing these essential drugs and facilitating their immediate supply to patients. It should also do away with the tender procedure of procuring Covid medicines and centralize their purchase as per prices permissible under the MRP. In our view, such a response is the need of the hour and call of duty of the state under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. If we don’t rise to the occasion now, disaster would be unavoidable in the future,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said. The directives came after amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Nidhi Dayani along with Tushar Mandlekar, Bhanudas Kulkarni, M Anil Kumar and others pointed out to the court that allowing private purchase of drugs was only adding to the confusion and also leading to pilferage and black marketing. Adding that if the private purchase of Remdesivir is allowed to continue, the bench said it would give way to pilferage and also lead to black marketing. “In this situation, patients and their relatives are exploited. The government would have to take effective steps to stop black marketing. It needs to place supply orders with companies at a price agreed by them which is near or equivalent to the MRP. Such powers are available with the state under the Disaster Management Act,” noted the bench. Stressing that due to the outbreak of the pandemic, ordinary provisions of law are insufficient to deal with crisis situations, the judges said the government should immediately stop private purchase of Remdesivir and other Covid medicines by pharmacies and hospitals at their individual level. Supply 38k Rem vials to Ngp, Bhn & Akola by Saturday evening: HC Upset over not supplying even a single Remdesivir vial to Nagpur, Bhandara and Akola districts, despite the high number of Covid patients, the judges directed the government to supply nearly 38,000 vials to these places by Saturday evening. “The number of deaths is increasing every day for various reasons and one of them could be the unavailability of Remdesivir. While we understand the state’s difficulty to immediately fill up the backlog, it can always provide interim relief by transporting a certain number of drugs to these districts,” they said. Quoting government pleader Ketki Joshi, the bench pointed out that Nagpur district is reeling under the backlog of 25,479 Remdesivir vials (April 29 to 30), due to non-supply and short supply from the state till 5.30pm on Friday. However, Joshi informed that Nagpur would receive 3,500 by evening, which would be distributed to all the hospitals by night. Citing Akola’s case, the judges noted that there’s a short supply of this drug there considering 5,244 active cases and deficit ranges from 300-500 vials per day. “Akola badly needs Remdesivir and immediate relief should be provided. Same is true about Bhandara which requires 1,110 vials per day, but only getting 200, thus having a shortage of 900. Thus, if 10 days of backlog of Nagpur, Bhandara and Akola has to be removed, they require 25,000, 4000 and 8,000-9,000 vials respectively. This number of medicines must be supplied by the government,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centralise-all-covid-19-drugs-under-dma-act-hc-to-govt/articleshow/82334291.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Doctors feel hallucinations more common in ICU patients||NAGPUR: From imagining people around their ICU bed to hearing non-existent noise, hallucinations have long been a part of what doctors call “ICU psychosis”. But it has been hitting Covid-19 patients much earlier and more in numbers as compared to other patients. While it’s a myriad of reasons which lead to such hallucinations in Covid-19 ICU patients, the common theme among all is ‘being cut off’ from the outside world. Dr Virendra Belekar, an intensivist at Kingsway Hospital said, “It’s usually after the fourth day that this (hallucination) starts. By this time the patient has been cut off from the outside world and has no idea whether it’s day or night. They haven’t seen a human face, as every medical staff is wearing PPE kit, and no chance of physically meeting relatives either. All these things start playing with their mind giving rise to hallucinations.” A Covid-19 patient headed for the ICU already comes with a set notion about the disease, and that makes him/her prime candidate for “ICU psychosis”. Dr Sameer Arbat, leading interventional pulmonologist at KRIMS Hospital, said, “The patients have already heard and read about high Covid causalities before entering the ICU. So during admission to hospital itself they have preconceived notion about the prognosis. While ICU psychosis affects all patients, it’s true that Covid-19 patients are more vulnerable.” The most common hallucination is imagining people, either known or strangers, around their bed. Patients’ reaction after such hallucinations, also varies. Dr Prashant Jagtap, senior interventional cardiologist at Viveka Hospital, said, “If the patient is an alcoholic then there’s a chance of him getting physically agitated, whereas others may be delusional and start mumbling words.” He further said the treatment of such hallucinations require going right down to the root of the problem. “First, we have to look into natural causes like sodium level and how that’s affecting the patient’s behaviour,” Dr Jagtap said. Dr Belekar said medical intervention includes use of sedative, but that too has certain limitations. “It’s given after checking multiple medical parameters and also with a special focus on not disturbing the biological sleep pattern,” Belekar said. Non-medical approach to deal with “ICU psychosis” includes moving the patient out to the rehabilitation bay, or to a window from where sunlight seeps. But this again, is not always possible for Covid patients. “For Corona patients, there’s high level of movement restriction so we arrange for video calls with their relatives to help them cheer up,” Dr Belekar said. Apart from doctors, the second level of support comes from other patients. Dr Sandeep Mogre, director of Mogre Child Hospital, said, “These patients form strong friendships and constantly talk and guide each other. Nowadays, we are getting lot of related patients in ICU, and that also provides a psychological boost.” For those who recover from the physical problem, the bigger danger still lurks ahead. Dr Arbat said, “In my experience in dealing with Covid, I can say that 50% of those who have recovered will require psychological counselling. And such counselling should only be done by qualified experts, not on social media through acquaintances and friends.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/docs-feel-hallucinations-more-common-in-icu-patients/articleshow/82333481.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Chandigarh||Prohibition of Child Marriage Law does not differentiate on basis of religion: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has clarified that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Law does not differentiate on the basis of religion. HC has made these observations while hearing a plea filed by muslim runaway couple, seeking protection to their life from their families. The petitioner girl is 18, and boy little less than 21. “Petitioner No. 2, Azim Khan, is admittedly below the legally marriageable age in terms of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. It is to be noticed that even though as per the Muslim Personal Law a valid marriage can be contracted between the parties upon attaining the age of puberty. However, it is to be further noticed that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, does not differentiate on the basis of religion, as regards the commission of any offences punishable under the provisions of that Act,” observed Justice Amol Rattan Singh. However, the court granted protection to the couple, observing that a male between 18 to 21 years though is a child and his marriage with a female adult will be treated as a child marriage he cannot be subjected to punishment for contracting child marriage. HC relied upon the Supreme Court judgment in Hardev Singh versus Harpreet Kaur case, in which it was held that if a girl/woman is above marriageable age in terms of that Act (above 18 years), no offence punishable under the provisions of that Act would be made out. The matter had reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Jaspreet Kaur alias Jaspreet Begum and Azim Khan, residents of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, seeking protection of life and liberty after marrying each other against the wishes of their parents on April 18. On a specific query from the court, the counsel for the petitioners stated that neither were they in any prohibited relationship to each other, nor married earlier. HCowever, HC was informed that the girl had converted to marry the muslim boy. HC observed that since protection of life and liberty is a fundamental right of every citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution, this petition is disposed of with a direction to the SSP Fatehgarh Sahib to ensure that the lives and liberty of the petitioners are not put to any harm or threat at the hands of their families. The HC also made it clear that if upon verification, the age of girl is found to be actually below 18, this order shall not prohibit the authorities to initiate proceedings under the provisions of the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act of 2006.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/prohibition-of-child-marriage-law-does-not-differentiate-on-basis-of-religion-hc/articleshow/82334303.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Nagpur||Baby ‘Angel’ has 3 protective cops mothering her||NAGPUR: A six-month-old ‘Angel’ was left to die in a bush near a water tank in Saoner shortly after her birth with the umbilical chord still attached. The newly born baby was rescued in the early hours of October 4 last year in precarious condition with a bleak chance of her surviving. She was later nursed and looked after by three cops — constables Manisha Bandiwar, Supriya Patil and Ranjana Nagmote — who had toiled in shifts beside her bed for almost a month until she was stable at Mayo hospital. Later, the cops went on to shower their affection on the girl, whom they had named Angel, at an orphanage where she was shifted. Police naik constable Bandiwar, 42, of Saoner police station was the first to pick the baby up in her arms when she was smeared in blood and other bodily fluid. Shivering in the winter morning, it was her meek cries which had attracted the attention of the passers-by who had alerted the cops. Bandiwar and others had rushed the baby to Saoner rural hospital from where she was referred to Mayo hospital. The baby, whose parents could not be traced, was healthy but weak as she had developed infection. The three cops ensured they remained present beside her bed at Mayo hospital’s neo-natal ward playing the role of a mother. They looked after her needs and also ensured medication was not affected until she had been declared fit and fine. “I had named her Angel as she had to be a God-sent girl who had least chance of surviving but still she managed to pull on with the divine support,’ said Bandiwar. “I could not see my own daughter growing up as I had to go for training. It gives me immense pleasure seeing Angel grow up now although at the orphanage,” she said. The three cops visit her regularly with delicacies and toys for her and other children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/baby-angel-has-3-protective-cops-mothering-her/articleshow/82333838.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Dehradun||'Oxygen crisis' continue in Dehradun, new list of suppliers released by administration after high court's rap||DEHRADUN: A new list of oxygen suppliers has been released by Doon district administration after Uttarakhand high court's rap. However, calls by the TOI team on most of the numbers went unanswered on Friday. Out of 10 numbers provided, six for Doon and remaining four for Rishikesh, only two oxygen gas refilling agencies replied. One of them said that they can refill the oxygen cylinder for Rs 500 and there was too much pressure on them to fulfill the demand given the large volume of calls from people. And the other agency informed, that they had already given out sufficient medical oxygen and would take time to arrange more. Meanwhile, on the orders of Dehradun district magistrate (DM) Ashish Srivastava, sub-divisional magistrate of Sadar and Mussoorie checked the medical stores in their areas under their jurisdiction. The officials checked the stock of necessary medicines and equipment required for the treatment of Covid patients and warned them against black marketing. The individuals and groups working to provide free oxygen to people are also struggling for empty oxygen cylinders which are not coming back in rotation. Harpal Singh Sethi, a businessman who has been running a voluntary service in the Race Course area, said, “We are urging people who have taken oxygen cylinders from us to return it once their patient stabilises as it can save many other lives. If the administration can intervene to impose the arrangement strictly, we can help more people.” Another crisis is the shortage of oxygen flow meters which are not available in the market. The device is crucial for refilling the cylinders. It was earlier available at a cost of about Rs 1,000. But now, it is rare to find.Besides, oximeters for measuring oxygen saturation are being sold at exorbitant prices. On Thursday, following directions of the high court, the Dehradun district administration had issued the updated list of oxygen suppliers in the district. The HC has issued directions to the DM to issue the updated list after complaints that the numbers in the list were not working. The Doon district administration thereafter released a revised list of 10 oxygen suppliers in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/oxygen-crisis-continue-in-doon-new-list-of-suppliers-released-by-admin-after-hcs-rap/articleshow/82333482.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Chandigarh||Sacrilege cases: Slogans for justice ring out in Kotkapura||Bathinda: After over five years, the light point intersection of Kotkapura town of district Faridkot again reverberated with religious slogans. Representatives of various organisations and senior leaders of political parties, led by former Akal Takht jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh, protested against the Punjab and Haryana high court order quashing investigations into the Kotkapura police firing case. Terming the judgment as “political” and “flawed,” protesters burned copies of the court order. On October 14, 2015, a large number of protesters, including noted preachers, assembled at the same place to condemn the act of sacrilege and to demand justice from the state government. Copies of the court order were burned outside Bathinda bus stand and several other places. Police opened fire at Kotkapura in the early hours of October 14, 2015. After a few hours, another round of firing was reported at Behbal Kalan village, in which two protesters, Krishan Bhagwan Singh and Gurjit Singh, were killed. Jathedar Ranjit Singh said people were still waiting for justice even after five and a half years. “We had high hopes from the court but here too, justice has not been done. We lodged a protest by burning copies and many others did this at different places,” he said. MLAs Sukhpal Singh Khaira, Parminder Singh Dhindsa, Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Balwinder Singh Bains and Pirmal Singh Khalsa accused the state government led by Captain Amarinder Singh of failing to contest the case in court properly, ensuring that senior leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal, including party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, went scot free. The MLAs said that by burning copies of the court order, they expressed their anger against the “flawed” judgement. Dal Khalsa spokesman Kanwar Pal Singh, deceased Krishan Bhagwan Singh’s son Sukhraj Singh and deceased Gurjit Singh’s farther Sadhu Singh also raised their voice against the court order. They warned that denial of justice in sacrilege cases could push the state back to “black days.” In Amritsar, Paramjit Singh Mand-led Sikh Youth of Punjab also burned the copies of court orders of quashing of the SIT report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sacrilege-cases-slogans-for-justice-ring-out-in-kotkapura/articleshow/82334362.cms||Neel Kamal

The four-year-old pregnant tigress was brutally killed in a cave in Mangurla and her two front paws were chopped. The incident came to light on April 25. As the crime was complicated, Yavatmal CCF SV Ramarao sought help from SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal. Even as the forest department registered offences under Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, the police played a key role in nabbing the accused. Bhujbal and Ramarao had visited the spot on April 28 along with other police officials. The SP constituted four teams. Police informers found links of the case to Pandharwani (Dubhati) village. According to Ramarao, the accused were nabbed after decoy customers were sent to them to buy nails and paws. The accused have been identified as father-son duo Ashok Letu Atram (20) and Letu Rama Atram (45), both Pandharwani. Bhujbal said, “It was a complicated case as the tigress was killed somewhere on April 20 and there was evidence on the spot. Our officers used their experience to nab the accused. We have to seize nine more nails and another paw. More accused are involved and teams are on the job to nab them,” said Ramarao. The SP said more details about the case will only be revealed during the interrogation of the accused who will be produced in the court on Saturday for forest custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-held-in-tigress-killing-nail-paw-seized/articleshow/82334345.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Vaccination of 18-44yrs at 55 centres in Vidarbha today||NAGPUR: To mark Maharashtra Day, the state government has decided to start Covid-19 vaccination of 18-44 years age group from five centres in each district. There will thus be 55 centres in 11 districts of Vidarbha on Saturday. The region has received 1,34,500 doses of Covishield. After announcement of roll out of inoculation for 18-plus from May 1, state had first delayed starting that citing shortage of doses and lack of preparations. The state’s family welfare bureau on Friday issued a letter to all districts directing them to start inoculation of 18-44 years at five centres. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “There will be three centres in city at Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR), Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital and Isolation Hospital. Vaccination will be done of those who are registered and scheduled online. There will be no walk-ins, so people should not crowd the centres,” he said. Remaining two centres will be in rural areas. Activist Shashank Gattewar told TOI, “I happened to do registration on website of Co-Win after a few attempts. All centres are showing they are reserved for only 45-plus. When proceeded for scheduling at given three centres, it is not happening. How will NMC select beneficiaries?” As per government’s letter, centre for 18-44 years age group and 45-plus will be separate. “Within available vaccine stock, sessions should be planned in such a way that vaccination goes on for seven days,” the government said. Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh said, “Five centres in each of five districts of Amravati division will begin vaccination of 18-44 years age group. We don’t have any fixed target for each centre. We are planning upto 200 per day at each. Five districts have received 5,000-7,000 doses each which we have to use in next seven days.” Similarly, six districts of Nagpur division are likely to vaccinate 100-200 persons per centre per day. Vaccination was again hit in Chandrapur following shortage of doses on Friday. Only eight of 164 centres were able to carry out inoculation of 45-plus. For fifth consecutive day, many centres in Nagpur were closed after vaccination in first half for want of doses. In the district, 19,147 took the jab on Friday. Of 1,34,500 doses of Covishield, six districts of Nagpur division got 57,500 and while 77,000 went to five districts of Amravati division. Nagpur district was allocated only 10,000 doses which are not enough for even one day. The district is also facing shortage of Covaxin doses. The government did not send any Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccination-of-18-44yrs-at-55-centres-in-vidarbha-today/articleshow/82333494.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

After the high court quashed the SIT even after it presented chargesheets in Faridkot court, Punjab government failed to defend the case in high court due to malafide intention of the chief minister, he alleged. “Even General J J Singh’s tweets have pointed a finger at Capt Amarinder, that he is playing a friendly match with Badals and wanted to save them. The SIT had questioned the role of Sukhbir, then deputy chief minister and home minister besides Parkash Singh Badal, then CM in Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing cases, besides some senior police officers. As very influential persons were involved in those cases, it was scuttled,” alleged Brahmpura. Brahmpura said the case had cheated people of Punjab and had shaken the Sikh community. “It was the responsibility of the chief minister to keep the SIT integrated and ensure team work among those besides defending the case in courts, but here the chief minister, who also holds the home portfolio, failed to shoulder his responsibility,” he said. He also questioned how many SITs could be formed to borrow time and help the state government evade responsibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-colluded-with-badals-to-scuttle-justice-brahmpura/articleshow/82334333.cms||---

They have been admitted to the intensive care unit at SSKM hospital and are critical. Locals said the couple was part of a joint family that lived in a century-old house on Harish Chatterjee Street, around 500m from the CM’s residence. It was Subhonjit Bhattacharyya, a youth living next door, who first noticed the members of the family quietly slipping out of the house with a bag as though headed for a vacation. “The family members left the house over five days. Among the family members is a youth known to me. He told me his uncle and aunt had Covid symptoms for almost a week. He had been giving them paracetamol, food and drinking water till April 26, after which they had stopped eating and were completely bed ridden,” Bhattacharyya recounted. He then contacted his friend Arka Dutta, a mechanical engineer and decided they needed to do something. Dutta tried to first arrange for oxygen but when he could not get cylinders, he contacted Kalighat PS and local councillor Ratan Malakar. Malakar, in turn, informed health officials. When the medical team arrived, they found them gasping for breath. They were groaning and disoriented. Without food or water for three days, they were in a senseless condition. The councillor tried to contact their family members but they refused help. Finally, when police threatened them to book them for negligence, one of them arrived but refused to authorize their hospitalization. Finally, on Thursday afternoon with the help of Kalighat PS and local councillor, an ambulance transported them to SSKM hospital where they are now in intensive care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-rescue-cov-infected-couple/articleshow/82334364.cms||---

Alleging bias by media houses, saying they were paid for compliance, he said he would tackle this problem by establishing government-owned Punjab Television Network. “Let them say whatever they are saying, it’s just a matter of six to eight months. All these television networks will be government networks,” he said while interacting with media persons here. “We will initiate a struggle, we will make Punjab progressive. Fight for justice has begun from today. I didn’t tender my resignation in an emotional bout, but upon receiving an order from the Guru. My 22 years of job were full of struggle. I take pride in leaving it, and have no regrets,” he said. He also claimed that when he had begun investigations in sacrilege and other cases, he knew he could lose his job. “The real culprits are very influential, very powerful and very rich. They can purchase anything,” he claimed. He also said he was of the view that the justice couldn’t be delivered in sacrilege case under the existing rule.

No money will be charged from the patient for the facility including doctors’ fees.The Covid facility also includes five beds with ventilator support, while another five with non-invasive ventilator support, making it one of the largest private facility in the Marathwada region. He has also installed oxygen generation plant.Bamb said, “We are not going to charge a single rupee for the facilities including doctors’ fees. However, the patients will have to get medicines and lab tests on their own.” A team of 14 doctors apart from a trained medical and paramedical team has been roped in to cater at this facility, which has been constructed by spending over Rs 1.5 crores. The facility, which will also provide free food to the patients, will have a recurring expense of Rs 60 lakh. All these expenses are being taken care by Bamb and his close associates. The facility started operations on Friday. This is the first of its kind of facility set up by a people’s representative in the region. Bamb said it is difficult for people from his constituency to travel to Aurangabad for hospitals with all the facilities. “Another concern is that not everyone can afford to get treated at super speciality private hospitals.

Despite hospitalization and treatment for Covid-19, Gupta’s husband is yet to maintain oxygen saturation on his own. “The doctor has advised me to keep an oxygen concentrator at home for at least a month,” she told TOI, “But I am unable to purchase one due to non-availability of stock and high cost.” A branded OC, which was earlier available for Rs60,000, is now being sold for Rs1.05 lakh, said Mahesh Meshram, who too is looking for an OC for his elderly Covid-19 positive parents. “Doctor has suggested that I keep an OC at home for any medical emergency,” he said. With the requirement of medical oxygen exceeding its supply owing to rise in Covid-19 cases in the city, even hospitals are choosing to go for OCs. This has led to increase in their prices. “Even the prices of Chinese make OCs, which were available for Rs28,000, is now over Rs60,000,” said Mohit Jaiprakash Parekh, who deals in OCs. Another factor that led to increase in prices is China stopped direct cargo flights to India, he says. Now, OCs from China are coming to India through other countries like Taiwan, Japan etc. Sanjay Wazirani, who runs a surgical instruments business, said OCs are primarily manufactured in China from where the supply has stopped for various reasons. “We have heard the company which supplied the machine to India had halted exports over some quality issues,” said Wazirani. “The shipments from China have been discontinued due to Covid too. I have cancelled an order for 45 machines,” he said. “Some people may be selling it at high prices but those may even be second hand machines,” he said. Wazirani said it would be at least mid-May before OCs start to arrive. “We have also heard that some quantity has arrived in Delhi but the government has taken them for use. There are various versions doing the rounds,” he said. Even the monthly rental of OCs has increased manifold. Earlier, the monthly rent for an OC hovered between Rs3,000 and Rs4,000. “Now, we are charging Rs15,000 per month from a customer,” said one of the dealers requesting anonymity. District collector Ravindra Thakare said OCs are in short supply but such machines cannot be rationed or their prices be capped. “Only the state government can take a decision to cap the prices,” he said. “Nagpur district will receive 1,000 concentrators by the first or second week of May,” he said. During a meeting related to Covid, Union minister Nitin Gadkari and district guardian minister Nitin Raut also discussed the availability of OCs. It’s learnt some OCs would be sent to Gadchiroli too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-demand-spikes-cost-of-oxygen-concentrators-jumps-45/articleshow/82334367.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Aurangabad||Dairy owner showsthe way to helpingneedy in Covid times||Aurangabad: Sagar Doodh Dairy, owned by Hafiz Azhar Qureshi and situated in Chelipura area, has set an example by selling milk and products at subsidised rates and also giving milk for free to the needy in view of the economic downturn due to Covid-related restrictions. The dairy owner, who owns several buffaloes, has not only installed a board at his shop announcing the subsidised rates and free distribution of milk, but also issues advertisements in vernacular newspapers about the facility being offered. “I have been distributing 150 to 200 litres of milk for free to the needy. Although it the quantity may look small, the satisfaction cannot be described in words,” Qureshi told TOI. He said this is his way of serving people during the second wave of the pandemic, when many have lost jobs and livelihood and are struggling to make ends meet. “We did it during the first lockdown and we are doing it since the strict restrictions imposed over a fortnight ago. We will continue till the time these restrictions continue,” said Qureshi. The dairy owner said despite giving several litres of milk for free to people, he has never incurred any losses and that the sales have only increased, though at subsidised rates. Qureshi, who is offering the products at almost 70% of the market price, said there are many customers who forego the subsidy while saying that they will do it as long as they can afford. “Children are particulary suffering these days as many parents cannot afford to buy milk for them. I also find solace in the fact that people unable to afford food can at least prepare tea for themselves and serve milk to their children,” he said. Qureshi said the decision to distribute milk to the needy for free was taken after he found that during the lockdown, many dairy owners were exploiting the farmers by purchasing milk at throwaway prices and selling it at exorbitant rates by creating a false shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dairy-owner-showsthe-way-to-helpingneedy-in-covid-times/articleshow/82332235.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Chandigarh||BKU faction says Haryana gave wrong data on procurement to evade MSP||Ambala: Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) on Friday claimed that the state government was releasing “false data” on wheat procurement to evade procurement and minimum support price (MSP). No procurement of wheat was done by agencies and no gate passes were issued to farmers in Ambala on Friday, following an instruction from the office of directorate of Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs (HFCS) department. HFCS deputy director (procurement) Megha Kanwar on Thursday issued instructions to principal consultant Munish Chandan of state e-governance mission team (SeMT), e-Kharid, to stop issuing gate passes to farmers in the districts, including Ambala, Charkhi Dadri, Gurugram, Mahendergarh, Nuh, Palwal, Panchkula and Rewari. The reason mentioned in the instructions to stop the gate passes reads: “The wheat procurement in (above-mentioned) districts during Rabi procurement season of 2021-22 up to April 28, 2021, has been 125% as compared to Rabi season of 2020-21. Therefore, the government has decided to stop wheat procurement from these districts. It is requested to stop issuing gate passes for wheat procurement.” Ambala district food and civil supplies controller (DFSC) Rajeshwar Mudgil said up to April 28, a total of 3,18,069 metric ton (MT) wheat had been procured by agencies in Ambala district this year, as compared to2,38,109 MT last year. However, the BKU factioned claimed that the data was false.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bku-faction-says-haryana-gave-wrong-data-on-procurement-to-evade-msp/articleshow/82334374.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘RAYDAY’ RAMBLINGS||NAGPUR: A fellow member of Cine Montage (Central India’s premier film society, where most Nagpurians cut our teeth on world cinema) remarked the other day, only half in jest, that Bengalis were so obsessed with Satyajit Ray that even their paradigm-shifting assembly election results are being announced on his birth anniversary! In fact, it cannot be mere coincidence that in our language, the noun ‘Ray’ does duty for both a surname as well as an opinion/verdict! Raydibas could therefore prove be a double-barrelled, loaded term which could signify both ‘the day of Ray’ or ‘the day of judgment’! Wordplay apart, what is left to say about Satyajit Ray that has not been said in the three decades after his passing? The death of his protégé, the actor Soumitra Chatterji, once again saw a prodigious, if occasionally stale, output of analyses of their unique chemistry and collaboration. In the face of such redundancy, might it not prove worthwhile to conjecture about what the artistic response of this incredibly intelligent and sensitive man could have been to the two most defining events of recent times – viz., the vicious and violent electoral process in his native state, and of course, the global pandemic? The second is the easier to answer. It is a safe bet that Ray would have come up with a dystopian sci-fi featuring his eccentric scientist, Prof Trilokeshwar Shonku to counter the life-threat that humanity faces today. For, although Ray made a number of pictures from his own ideas and short stories (Kanchanjungha, Shakha Prashakha, Agantuk) and created two adaptations of his immensely popular private investigator Feluda (Sonar Kella, Joy Baba Felunath), he somehow never got around to transferring Shonku from page to screen, possibly because he did not trust the technology of his time (his son, Sandip Ray, did direct a somewhat yawn-inducing Prof Shonku o El Dorado with tacky CGI in 2019). So, we may have been fortunate enough to have the old inventor go on a crusade against the coronavirus with his Annihilin gun and cure humanity with his Miracurall pills! Ray’s response to the conflict scenario in Bengal today is not so easy to predict. After all, here is an auteur who had been sensitized enough to his own backdrop to helm masterpieces on political themes as diverse as the callous brutality of the establishment (the Calcutta Trilogy – Jana Aranya, Seemabaddha, Pratidwandi), the blind fury of nationalism (Ghare Baire), endemic corruption (Shakha Prashakha), religious superstition (Debi, Ganashatru), manufactured calamities (Ashani Sanket), and all consuming pursuit of materialistic objectives (Agantuk, his swansong). But surprisingly, his most overt political statement on the collective brain-washing of the masses, the perversion of knowledge and the need to topple the icons of dishonesty (“Dori dhore maaro taan, Raja hawbe khan khan”) came in a children’s movie, Hirak Rajar Deshe, the sequel to his classic, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. It gives one great notional pleasure to imagine the master crafting a fourth installment featuring the madcap duo, Goopy and Bagha, who arrive at a land fraught with hostility and suspicion and use music and magic to heal broken hearts and sow the seeds of universal humanism (a primum mobile Ray had inherited from his mentor, Tagore). And, having done so, return dancing gleefully once again to Shundi! Irrespective of the channel of expression Ray might have chosen, one thing is certain. His all-seeing eyes would have ripped through the all-pervasive veneer of duplicity and hypocrisy, and exposed his viewers to the heart of reality, just as he had done throughout his cinematic career. Satya, after all, can not but be followed by jit! (The writer teaches English at Hislop College)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rayday-ramblings/articleshow/82334382.cms||---

Gurdwara Yahiyaganj, believed to be the place where the guru visited Lucknow in the 17th century, will celebrate the day with ‘Sukhamani Sahib paath’ (prayer of peace) at 5am, followed by shabad kirtan and petal shower on the Guru Granth Sahib. Members of the gurdwara have appealed the devotees to stay at home and pray for all. “The entire paath and kirtan will be live-streamed on our social media pages. It is my appeal to citizens to stay at home and pray for the well-being of their family and those who are fighting the pandemic,” said Dr Gurmeet Singh of Gurdwara Yahiyaganj. Gurdwara Naka Hindola will also mark the day with paath and kirtan, followed by langar, where packed food will be distributed. Gurdwara Mansoravar will also observe the day with necessary rituals of reciting of Sikh hymns. Since Gurdwara Sadar is closed till May 5 due to five of its sewadars (volunteers) testing Covid positive, a small paath will be live-streamed for devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/subdued-celebrations-planned-on-guru-tegh-bahadurs-birth-anniversary-today/articleshow/82335487.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Struggle to get RT-PCR tests done still continues in Dehradun||Dehradun: Despite assurances by the Uttarakhand government that testing facilities have been streamlined, residents of Dehradun are struggling to get RT-PCR test done. “People are forced to wait in long queues to get their tests done. Unless people get to know if they are Covid-infected or not, how can they start the treatment,” said a resident. He addedthat the private labs in Dehradun are claiming to provide door-step RT-PCR test services but they are unable to book a slot as the number of tests conducted by private labs per day cannot meet the demand. In fact, several private labs — that advertise on social media platforms regarding the facility of Covid-19 collecting samples at the doorstep — were contacted by TOI but calls remained unanswered in most cases. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 testing facility available at the Government Doon Medical College and Hospital (GDMCH) is witnessing a huge rush. Unlike private labs which send the reports on mobile phones, people have to collect their respective test reports physically from GDMCH. An individual can get the RT-PCR test done at the hospital for Rs 17. On the other hand, the private labs which offer door-to-door service are charging up to Rs 900 for an RT-PCR test. Officials of the state health department told TOI that they are trying to increase the testing capacity and are taking utmost precautions regarding Covid-19 suspects. Pradeep Kukreti, a resident, told TOI, “In my conversations with staff members of several hospitals, I got to know that one of the reasons behind the sluggish pace of Covid-19 testing in the district is lab technicians contracting the virus. Even as the work has increased, several hospitals are forced to work without their 100% staff strength." He further said that people displaying serious symptoms should not be asked to come to the lab for Covid-19 testing. "The state government should ensure that critically ill patients are given the facility of Covid-19 testing at their doorsteps. Also, medicine kits should be delivered to the people under home isolation," added Kukreti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/struggle-to-get-rt-pcr-tests-done-still-continues-in-doon/articleshow/82333509.cms||Mohammad Anab

Talking to media here on Friday, Sidhu said it was unfortunate that the Centre did not understand the seriousness of the agitation . “The government neither tried to understand the significance of the farmers agitation nor analyzed it correctly,” he said, adding that the three new farm laws had posed a question on the existence of farmers and the farming profession. “Farmers across the nation are scared and worried over their existence, but the Centre did not even engage in genuine talks with them,” he said. He was of the view that the government should extend a hand to resolve the present stalemate. Talking about getting bail from court, he said he was lucky to have been granted bail by the court in a few day’s time . “I am an advocate also. As a legal professional, I had thought I’d remain in jail for seven-eight months,” he added. Sidhu, who had helped actor-turned-politician Sunny Deol during his election campaign in Pathankot, said the Gurdaspur MP should have stood by him as a family member. He added Punjab needed a regional political party to take up its real issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-neither-understood-stir-nor-held-talks-sincerely/articleshow/82334385.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Covid +ve cases in April equal no. tests in September||NAGPUR: The number of Covid positive cases in April were as good as the number of tests done in September last year. Considering the numbers and views of experts, April was probably the peak of the second wave and highly contagious and virulent compared with the first wave’s peak which was in September last year. “It seems that April was the peak of the second wave as the weekly test positivity rate (TPR) and growth rate of cases are on the decline in the last week after recording new highs. The TPR of the first week of May can give the exact picture, whether the peak is over or not. Probably cases may decline in May,” infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI. The district registered 1,81,749 cases for a daily average (DA) of 6,058 in April. the number of tests were 1,96,722 for a DA of 6,557 in September 2020. Cases in April were 3.75 times higher than those recorded in September last year (48,457 for DA of 1,615). Tests were 1,96,722 (DA-6,557) in September last year whereas the April count was 6,51,638 (DA-21,721). The number of cases in September last year was the highest in the pandemic till the beginning of the second wave in the third week of February this year. Cases were 76,250 in March, surpassing the ones registered in September last year. Compared with March, cases in April were 2.38 times higher. Despite a spike in tests, TPR of April was high at 27.89%, it was 24.63% in September last year. The figures indicate that Covid was highly contagious in April. Similarly, deaths were 1.56 times higher in April compared with those registered in September last year. Fatalities were 2,290 (DA- 76) whereas in September 2020, the figure was 1,465 (DA-49). The disease was virulent in April. Thus, cases, tests and deaths were highest in April compared with all the 13 months in the pandemic. But the case fatality rate (CFR) in April was less compared with from August to October last year due to a high number of cases in April. CFR in April was 1.26% whereas it was 3.80% in August followed by 3.02% in September and 3.55% in October last year. With cases at a new high, recoveries in April were also the highest. Nealy 1,42,084 patients recovered in April which was 3.29 times higher than September last year (43,223). As far as active cases are concerned, the highest-ever in a day were 77,556 on April 25. The highest single day active cases were 21,746 in September last year. This led to the district facing a huge shortage of beds. Due to the high number of cases in April, the tally of the district surged to 4,07,787 on April 30. Similarly, tests swelled to 22,75,915. The total toll the district also increased to 7,388 and recoveries to 3,23,693. The district registered 6,461 cases on April 30, 1,035 cases less compared with the 7,496 recorded on April 29. Cases have declined below 6,500 in three out of the last five days. The district had recorded a new high of daily cases between April 21 and 25. Cases were 37,828 in these five days for a daily average of 7,566. As per the data of the state’s public health department, the district’s weekly TPR was 35.02% on April 19. It declined to 32.65% on April 27. The weekly growth rate of cases was 2.24% on April 19 which too declined to 2.03% on April 27. All these parameters endorse the projection of Dr Shinde that April was the peak with chances of decline in cases, TPR etc in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-ve-cases-in-april-equal-no-tests-in-sept/articleshow/82335492.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

While the Centre had assured 4.3 lakh vials for the last 10 days (April 21-30), the state received only 2.6 lakh vials. “The state continues to reel due to a shortfall of injection since the allotted supply has not been given. There is a shortfall of 1.7 lakh vials from assured supply. We are demanding 7 lakh vials for 10 days for the state to meet demand and supply,” the minister told TOI. He said that the Centre should give the shortfall as well as 7 lakh doses, as demanded, as the state has nearly 7 lakh active cases, and there should be enough stock, if required. The minister also said seven companies have been listed by the Centre to allocate doses but only one was catering to requirements, which was causing a shortfall. He requested the Centre to ensure that all companies supply required allotments in time. Meanwhile, around 100 persons admitted to Covid hospitals in Pen and Panvel in Raigad developed side effects after being administered Covifor (a remdesivir injection). A batch of 601 injections had arrived from a licensed manufacturer, of Hetero Healthcare, in Navsari, Gujarat. The firm has told hospitals, institutions and stockists to withhold use of that batch till further instructions. Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhary said, “We informed the government. Use of Covifor (remdesivir) batch has been stopped.” Nisha Nambiar & Umesh K Parida||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-seeks-7l-vials-for-next-10-days/articleshow/82336270.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Patna||Bettiah hospital gasps for O2 as demand shoots up||BETTIAH: Within a week of claiming that the brand new oxygen generating plant has been pumped into in-house production, Bettiah’s Government Medical College is panting with inadequate supplies with the number of Covid patients rising. “The demand (for oxygen) has shot up. We are augmenting our supplies from Harsiddhi and Gopalganj,” Hospital Superintendent Pramod K Tiwary said on Thursday even as kin of admitted Covid patients were horrified with hearsay reports of depleting oxygen stocks. Lal Babu, attendant of a Covid patient Vijay Kumar told reporters early Thursday morning, “Last night, we panicked when a nurse said that the hospital’s oxygen supply was rapidly depleting. Another patient’s kin shared his fright on hearing that the hospital, with 107 Covid patients in the isolation ward, had just three hours of oxygen supply left." With a large pile of empty oxygen cylinders lying without refill, a technician told reporters that the new plant is having hiccups in generating oxygen. Just a few days back, the hospital administration had claimed that the plant had been made operational and would help avert any crisis. While the technician felt the need for a dedicated power line to prevent voltage fluctuations, hospital manager Shanawaz felt the urgent need to augment transport with a dedicated fleet of vehicles to ferry oxygen from Harsiddhi and Gopaganj. Officials, including the civil surgeon, hospital superintendent, the Bettiah SDM and senior deputy collector Madan Kumar went into a huddle on Thursday afternoon to overcome the looming crisis. “We already have in place a green corridor to maintain the oxygen supply. We are working overtime to prevent any crisis,” SDM Vidya Nand Paswan told this reporter. While the SDM claimed that the plant would go on steam by Thursday night, hospital administration bemoaned the plant’s limited production capacity. “The OGP is fettered with teething problems as the required pressure is not being built up,” superintendent Tiwary said, adding that an engineer from the commissioning company has arrived to solve the problem. “On full steam, it can produce up to 40 cylinder fills,” he added. A greenfield project, the Bettiah GMCH, it may be mentioned, is still not fully ready. When fully built and furnished, it will have 850 beds. “At present, we have a total of 450 beds and we are expanding the number of beds for Covid patients," he further said. Asked about the wisdom of installing the oxygen plant with limited production capacity, he said the capacity was insufficient for the Covid crisis. The plant was installed by the Bihar Medical Supplies & Infrastructure Corporation, a State government enterprise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bettiah-hospital-gasps-for-o2-as-demand-shoots-up/articleshow/82315358.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha
---||Lucknow||No beds, no doctor nod for oxygen: Patients’ kin on tenterhooks||LUCKNOW: People’s struggle for a bed in a Covid hospital and oxygen refill continued on Friday while healthcare resources remained under tremendous stress due to exponential surge in cases. It took two days for Sujit Kumar to arrange oxygen for his colleague’s mother who was suffering from Covid-19. It took him entire Thursday to arrange an empty cylinder while the better part of Friday was spent standing in a queue outside an oxygen plant in Talkatora. Despite this, when his turn came, the staff refused to refill because Sujit had no prescription from a doctor, a mandatory provision introduced by the administration to check panic buying and hoarding. “I was standing in the queue since morning, hoping to get a refill at the earliest because my friend’s mother is critical with blood oxygen levels around 80-85%. I was not aware that a doctor’s prescription is mandatory for oxygen. I felt so helpless when the staff rejected my pleas that they should allow refill so that a life can be saved and I will provide a prescription later,” said Sujit, an engineer in a private company. He then called his friend to contact a doctor for prescription and send its photograph on WhatsApp. It consumed another hour but the staff then said that digital copy was not being accepted. “I called another friend who through his contacts sought intervention from a district administration officials. Finally, I got the refill at 5pm,” he added. Like Sujit, many families, which have not been able to get a Covid hospital for their patients, are managing the situation by arranging oxygen at home. However, they have to run from pillar to post, first for a doctor’s prescription, then an empty cylinder and finally for the refill. The refill has to be done daily and one person of the family is constantly engaged in the endeavour. The Lucknow Covid Hospitals Bed Dashboard (https://beds.dgmhup-covid19.in/EN/covid19bedtrack) only has details of only 44 Covid hospitals out of 72 as on 10pm on Friday. The families of patients are also searching for an oxygen-supported bed in a hospital. Sandeep Saxena (44) of Indiranagar, a Covid-19 patient with blood oxygen level of 84-85%, has been advised hospitalisation. “We contacted several hospitals but oxygen-supported bed is not available,” said Pradeep, elder brother of Sandeep. The family of Rajnish Kar (82), a resident of Vrindavan Yojana, managed a hospital bed on Thursday but had a harrowing time arranging for an ambulance. “We called covid control room several times but got only assurance. Even a friend who knows senior administrative officers had to plead for hours when we got the ambulance in the wee hours on Friday,” a family member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-beds-no-doc-nod-for-o2-patients-kin-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/82335503.cms||---

He was sixth city doctor to die of Covid in the past two weeks. Dr Saxena had been admitted to Balrampur hospital where he had served as an orthopaedic surgeon and administrator for several years. He had also completed both doses of his vaccination against Covid-19. “He was brought to the hospital in the early stage of the infection and we gave him the best treatment. But his oxygen level continued to fall. He was on ventilator support. Dr Saxena was a patient of hypertension,” said Balrampur hospital CMS Dr RK Gupta. Tributes on social media started pouring as soon as the news about his demise was known. Head of KGMU’s pediatric orthopaedic department Dr Ajai Singh wrote, “He was an extremely humble person. Always good to everyone. It is a great loss to the medical fraternity. We can only pray for his noble soul to rest in peace.” Last week, endocrinologist Dr KD Verma, pathologist Dr Raj Mehrotra and dean of KGMU’s dental department Dr Anil Chandra lost their lives. Prior to that, resident doctor at KGMU’s neurology department, Dr Zubair Ali, had died of covid-19.

Going a step ahead, arrangements are also being made to ensure home delivery of the articles, mostly grocery and daily need, ordered online from these canteens. The move is aimed at bringing down the possibility of police families getting infected, as they will not have to step out for purchasing daily needs and grocery articles during the current pandemic situation. When contacted, Beed superintendent of police R Raja, “Presently, police staff come and collect necessary items from the welfare canteen. The move will not only save time of police personnel, but will also come as a relief in terms of getting articles at subsidised rates.” The initiative is the brainchild of Aurangabad range’s special inspector general of police Prasanna Mallikarjun, who has personally sketched the idea as well as supervising the execution of the project. Under this initiative, alike armymen, police families will also get all the grocery and daily need articles in subsidied rates. The officer said that due to professional responsibilities, many a times, policemen set aside their personal duties. “The move is all set to come as a huge relief even for the police families residing in rural areas and had to travel kilometres for purchasing their daily need articles and groceries,” said Osmanabad superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan. To ensure maximum benefit for the police families, instructions have been given to the welfare branch’s inspectors in all the four units to reach out to wholesalers as well as super stockists of grocery articles for ensuring seamless supply of articles at subsidised rates. An application is also being developed for exclusive log-in to place orders. Once the order gets completed, the person will receive total bill, which can be paid online or at the time of delivery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-range-to-get-subsidised-canteens-like-army/articleshow/82332242.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Thus, the DM should issue clear directions in this regard. Also, the administration should waive off the surcharge imposed on us as coronavirus-induced curbs have hit our business badly,” said Bhanu Karanwal, a liquor shop owner. He added that liquor shops in Dehradun give a collective of Rs 20 crore of surcharge to the state government per day. Narender Kumar Sethi, another liquor vendor told that all liquor shops in Dehradun and Mussoorie were closed since several days. “There is no clarity in the order by the district magistrate whether liquor shops are allowed to open during the curfew and hence all vendors have kept their shops closed resulting in huge financial losses,” he added. A number of liquor shop owners from Mussoorie and Dehradun have written to the district magistrate asking him to issue orders for closure of liquor shops and for waiver of fixed surcharge during the period the shops are closed. “Either we must be given orders to close our shops or we must be charge surcharge based on the volume of sales otherwise we will not be able to survive this financial crisis,” Karanwal told. “It has been brought to my notice that there is some ambiguity with regards to opening of liquor shops during the curfew but I am not authorised to comment on this,” said Ramesh Bangwal, district excise officer. Meanwhile, district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava could not be reached despite several attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/either-order-shutdown-of-liquor-stores-or-waive-off-surcharge-vendors-to-dm/articleshow/82333529.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Hyderabad||Record test samples, backlogs delay reports||Hyderabad: At a time when Telangana is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, laboratories are experiencing backlogs as hundreds of test samples are landing at their doors, leaving anxious patients waiting for three to four days to know about their status. Several people TOI spoke to in the city, some of them with severe Covid-19 symptoms, are desperately awaiting their reports, since they cannot get hospital admission without a positive report. M Surender, a resident of Habsiguda said, “I ordered for a home sample collection on Wednesday morning and still haven’t received the test reports. I have severe cough and breathlessness. I cannot even consult a doctor who can put me on some medication or get admission in a hospital if the symptoms get worse because I do not know if I have the infection.” Another 62-year-old patient from Moosapet said he is yet to receive his test report even after submitting samples to a private lab on April 27. “The person who collected my samples for RT-PCR tests keeps telling us that it will take some more time. This is only increasing our anxiety and causing delays in treatment. I wonder how many people are positive but are out on the streets while waiting for their results,” said Surya Prakash, whose oxygen levels dropped below 94 on Friday. While the state government has 19 designated centers for RT-PCR testing, as many as 56 private labs have been approved for testing according to data from the health ministry. The possible reason for the delay, according to P Vishwanath, who is a swab collector at one of the private diagnostic centers in the city is the increase in test samples being received by the labs that do not have enough manpower to meet the testing capacity. “At a time, we can only put 40 samples in one RT-PCR test machine. Most labs do not have enough machines to test hundreds of samples we are collecting every single day. Most of them have stopped home collections for the same reason. We also need more data operators to speed up the testing process,” said Vishwanath. Experts said that the long wait for getting the test results will not just make people anxious but is also leading to late hospitalisation, extended treatment and exacerbating the ICU bed crisis. Telangana’s director of public health Dr G Srinivas Rao said that the testing facilities are only for those who have symptoms of Covid-19. “People who don’t have symptoms are thronging the testing centres and thus putting themselves at risk of contracting the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/record-test-samples-backlogs-delay-reports/articleshow/82334444.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 24k lose jobs as school buses stay off the roads||Mumbai: More than 24,000 people have been rendered jobless in the city due to school buses going off the roads in 2020-21. “In Mumbai, 8,000 school buses have been hit in the past one year. As a result, the driver, conductor and woman attendant in each bus were rendered jobless,” said Anil Garg of School Bus Owners’ Association (SBOA). Across Maharashtra, nearly 50,000 buses were inoperational, impacting 1.5 lakh jobs, according to data compiled by Bus & Car Operators Confederation of India. Garg has demanded BEST allow them to operate school buses for public transport and ferry office-goers during peak hours. This will help the transport undertaking increase its fleet nearly three times and the smaller buses will ensure faster commute due to their easy access to lanes and bylanes. The BEST, which has a fleet of around 4,300 buses, has already taken buses from MSRTC on lease and is running 700 such buses to ferry office-goers daily. School bus operators are willing to negotiate and offer low lease rent, SBOA sources said. “With classes going online, many schools have refused to pay bus owners saying parents are not paying bus fees. This has led to thousands of operators being jobless as there is nothing that we can do to retain our staff. Many have taken loans to purchase these buses and haven’t been able to pay EMIs. If the authorities don’t act immediately, this sector will be on the brink of closure and create further stress on the state economy,” said Garg. “We expect relief in taxes and interest waiver on vehicle loans taken by operators. Also, we do not want harassment from cops for parking buses across the city,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-24k-lose-jobs-as-school-buses-stay-off-the-roads/articleshow/82335524.cms||Somit Sen

---||Hyderabad||Night curfew has little impact on construction activity||Hyderabad: Night curfew across the state seems to have had little impact on the movement of lorries carrying raw material for construction work, which continues unabated in many parts of the city. Residents in the western corridor are spending sleepless nights due to late night blasting and construction activities by builders. With several real estate projects under construction in areas such as Narsingi and Nallagandla, getting uninterrupted sleep in the night has become a struggle for residents. The Telangana government’s night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am to curb spread of Covid-19 has given little relief to the residents who have raised an alarm over blasting activities, loading and unloading of construction material and movement of heavy machinery during night time. A resident of Narsingi reached out to the local police on Twitter complaining of construction work and blasting activities being taken up by a builder during night curfew hours. “Construction is definitely non-essential activity! Wonder why night curfew not applicable to them? They still continue to work!,” tweeted Sai Praveen, the resident. Residents rue that these builders use sandblasting method to blast boulders, which is creating a nuisance during evening hours. “The movement of trucks loading and unloading goes on till almost 4 am. Are these trucks even allowed to move around during a curfew? Have they got any special permission? The builders have become inconsiderate towards the Covid-19 guidelines,” said Vishnu Sagar, a resident of Nallagandla. Following a complaint from a Narsingi resident on April 29, the police verified the spot and found that loading and unloading of materials as well as RMC unloading by the trucks was going on. “As per government orders, there is no restriction on movement/transportation of essential and non-essential goods. This includes lorries carrying raw material. However, we have warned builders not to violate Covid-19 rules in view of night curfew by taking up any construction work,” said Gangadhar, inspector, Narsingi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/night-curfew-has-little-impact-on-construction-activity/articleshow/82334452.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to start limited vaccination of 18-44 group with 3L doses from today||MUMBAI/PUNE: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that Maharashtra will begin the Covid-19 vaccination campaign for the 18-44 age-group from Saturday, May 1, on the occasion of Maharashtra Day. The state on Friday distributed 3 lakh Covishield doses to districts for starting vaccination of this age-group from Saturday. Mumbai, Pune and Thane have each got the largest share of 20,000 doses. Other districts were given anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 doses each. Districts like Hingoli, Wardha, Bhandara, Washim and Sindhudurg received 5,000 doses each on Friday for this group of beneficiaries. Thackeray said the state was starting with very limited doses and appealed to beneficiaries to not crowd the centres as vaccinations will be conducted only on the basis of registrations as per availability of stocks. “We have received a limited stock of just 3 lakh doses, but we will start with it. We are ready to pay the entire amount required to purchase the 12 crore vaccines, but there is no availability. We will expand the drive based on the vaccine stocks,” CM Thackeray said. State’s share of shots from Centre may dropCM Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday that the two vaccine manufacturers—Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech—had promised a total of 18 lakh doses in May, but the date when these will be provided is not known yet. Five centres in Mumbai will vaccinate people between 18-44 years old. The centres are BYL Nair at Mumbai Central, RN Cooper in Juhu, BKC jumbo centre in Bandra, Rajawadi in Ghatkopar and SevenHills in Andheri. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the vaccinations would be done strictly through online registration and no walk-ins would be allowed. “Recipients have to come for the time slots allotted by Co-Win. We will not have any specific windows for any age-group. The drive on Saturday is only for those between18-44 years and not for those above 45 years. We will open vaccination for people above 45 years once we receive vaccines from the state,” Kakani said. Speaking to TOI earlier in the day, state health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI the third phase of the drive covering the 18 and above age-group is being started in a symbolic way. Each district is expected to have five sessions catering to vaccinations for seven days. Officials said there is bound to be confusion on the first day as this decision has come two days after it was announced by the state that they will not be able to roll out the drive on May 1 due to unavailability of stocks. To ensure a seamless registration process, Thackeray has written to the Centre demanding de-centralisation of the registration app. This comes a day after the CoWin app crashed due to the rush to register for the new phase of vaccination. Thackeray said the Centre should allow states to develop their own registration apps and link these to CoWin. Meanwhile, state health department officials told TOI on Friday that no new vaccine stocks had come so far from the 50% quota that the Centre was to receive from vaccine manufacturers for the third phase of the drive from May 1. Officials had earlier in the day clarified that the stock received from the Centre will be used in government vaccination centres for the 45+ group, healthcare and frontline workers and will not be disbursed to private hospitals. A public health department official said supplies from the Centre to Maharashtra are likely to drop significantly in the coming days as the state would now get vaccines from the Centre’s 50% quota that it buys from manufacturers.  Maharashtra would earlier get an average of 9-12 lakh doses every few days from the Centre, which is now likely to drop further, the official said. - Inputs by Sumitra Deb Roy||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-states-share-of-shots-from-centre-may-drop-sharply/articleshow/82336324.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The CM announced that his funeral will take place with full state honours. Arun was reported to have developed complications on April 15 and was under treatment first at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Patna and then at a noted private hospital where he breathed his last.

Whatever post he held, he performed with excellence, the CM said, adding that he was deeply aggrieved by his death. He also prayed that his family would be able to bear the loss with strength. Among others, former CMs Rabri Devi and Jitan Ram Manjhi, state assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, leader of opposition in the assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, Union minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan also mourned Arun. While Tarkishore said in his tweet that the state had lost an able administrator, the Speaker described Arun’s death untimely and very shocking. Tejashwi said he and his party were deeply aggrieved and would stand by the family of the deceased in their most grief-ridden hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-chief-secretary-arun-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82333106.cms||---

The helpline is active on all days from 10 am to 12 pm and 4 pm to 6 pm. Hemant Sonanis, Nashik IMA president, said the helpline gets 70 to 80 calls every day and the doctors who have volunteered are more than happy to guide the callers regarding different queries. Many people also send their queries to the doctors on WhatsApp.“Most of the people make enquiries about the symptoms they are experiencing — regarding their temperature and oxygen saturation level — and ask if they need to get admitted to a hospital. People also ask about the diet and exercise they can follow while staying at home,” Sonanis said. “The response is good and the helpline was started in time as large number of people are getting infected and there are number of questions in their minds about their health and that of their family members,” he added.Umesh Marathe, one of the volunteering doctors, said people often ask how can they keep themselves in isolation in a small house along with concerns regarding infection among small children or elderly people in the house.“People are also sending messages to the doctors thanking them for their support. We are planning to increase the team so that the load of calls can be reduced to some extent,” Sonasis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ima-nashik-to-increase-number-of-doctors-for-counselling-covid-patients-relatives/articleshow/82332257.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Delhi||Gang giving fake Covid reports busted, five lab employees held||New Delhi: A gang providing forged Covid diagnosis reports has been busted and five people, including a doctor of a laboratory in Malviya Nagar, have been arrested. “On April 29, the police control room received a call regarding fake Covid reports being given at a lab. A team was sent and the statements of the victims were recorded,” DCP (south) Atul Thakur said. The caller, Vipul Saini, said that in April, he, along with at least 45 relatives, had given samples to lab technicians Himanshu and Pragyanand Sharma for Covid testing. On April 25, a friend, Rishab Shukla, also gave his sample and was reported as positive the next day. But as he didn’t have any symptom, Shukla went to another lab and his sample turned out to be negative. On April 29, some of the victims went to Genestrings Lab and, on cross-checking with its officials, found that Shukla’s report was not in its records. One of the accused, Himanshu, told police that he and his cousin, Pragyanand, used to collect home samples and give it to Dr Manish, an application scientist at Genestrings Lab, without making any official entry. “Dr Manish used to share the result with Pragyanand through an Excel sheet and he would print the results on the fake letterhead of Genestrings Lab,” the DCP said. These samples were never processed and positive or negative remarks were given randomly, said a source. “Dr Manish, with the help of his colleagues Satender and Nikhil, used to send the report to Himanshu and Pragyanand, who used to prepare the reports on their laptop. The letterhead was provided to them by Dr Manish,” Thakur added. Genestrings Lab said in a statement that it was approached by a few people to authenticate Covid reports bearing the lab’s name and it was found that these were neither issued by the facility nor the samples were tested at the lab. “We immediately called the local police station in charge for the investigation of what seemed to be a fake report issue. On police investigations requested by us, five of our employees were identified to be party to this crime without the knowledge of the lab management or the lab head,” Chetan Kohli, COO of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, said. “We are not just disappointed but disgusted by this act of malice for a few rupees, putting the lives of patients at risk. We are in full compliance with the investigating authorities and support any and every action taken against them,” Kohli added. The COO further pointed out that the lab’s reports have QR code, which could be easily used to distinguish their authenticity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-giving-fake-covid-reports-busted-five-lab-employees-held/articleshow/82335530.cms||---

Following the criticism, the state government has asked the health department to streamline the system. Relatives of patients complained that with a time lag of 24 hours (at 11.30 am on Friday, the bed status portal showed the last update had been done around noon on Thursday), none of the bed vacancy status matched. Many patients went down to hospitals on the basis of bed vacancy were told there was no vacant bed. At some private hospitals, empty beds were shown but they said they had none for over 24 hours. Sources said the status reflected beds that the government was to requisition but that they had not received any intimation on it from the government yet. “We thought our hospitalization nightmare ended with the introduction of the system, but it did not work, at least on the first day after its introduction,” said Amit Kedia, a New Alipore resident, who was frantically looking for a bed for his friend. Also, the phone numbers of hospitals mentioned on the portal were either incorrect or not attended to. So, a lot of people, who frantically checked out the system to get near and dear ones admitted, were left frustrated. The health department officials admitted that real-time update wasn’t happening. “Right now, it is being updated twice a day — at noon and at 6pm. Though hospitals can update the bed status anytime, they have left it to the central team. We are asking hospitals to update it on a real-time basis. Some hospitals have resource and manpower problems. We are looking into it,” the official said. In the afternoon, the health department held a meeting with private hospitals and stressed on the need to do so on a real-time basis. Hospitals said it would be very important to update such status on a real-time basis as manpower resources have already been stretched. But the health department made it clear that the real-time update is the most important for seamless admission to hospitals to avoid any untoward circumstances. The health department sources said that efforts were on to have points men at every hospital to assess and update bed status. “We hope to overcome the teething issues shortly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/glitches-spoil-first-day-of-real-time-bed-portal/articleshow/82333572.cms||---

Many aggrieved passengers have taken to social media seeking refunds and alternate travel plans. “I have booked a ticket for May 1 from Lucknow to Hyderabad. It has a stop in Mumbai. But it is showing that Mumbai to Hyderabad flight has been cancelled,” tweeted a passenger. Restrictions imposed by the state government has prompted many travellers, particularly families, to either prefer a different mode of travel or cancel their travel. “@IndiGo6E was traveling Ahmedabad to Hyderabad which had stopover in Mumbai and had to change plane.

Seven forest ranges were declared CRs in December last year.Forest officials said the sighting of a tiger is of major significance as it highlights the purpose for which the forest ranges were declared CRs. A few days ago, a cattle kill was reported to the forest department following which over half-a-dozen cameras were installed at the site.On Wednesday, one of the cameras recorded a male tiger with its kill. Clement Ben, chief forest conservator of Kolhapur, said, “Before declaration of the CR, we too had heard about the presence of a tiger in the region and had tried several times to get evidence. This time, we succeeded in getting photographic evidence. The CRs serves as a migration corridor for many wild animals and need to be protected to ensure their population increases.”In December last year, the state wildlife board headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had given the CR tag to the seven ranges — Amboli-Dodamarg, Chandgad, Ajara-Bhudargad, Gaganbawda, Panhalagad, Vishalgad and Jor-Jambhali — along the Western Ghats. These CRs now connect the protected forest areas such as Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Tillari Wildlife Sanctuary that are already protected. “We are installing cameras at several places. We expect the tiger to move up to the Chandoli forest range. We have issued alerts to local people to immediately contact us in case of any conflict with the tiger,” Ben said, adding that disclosing the location where the animal was spotted was not ethical as it could invite poachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tiger-seen-on-camera-in-w-ghats-conservation-reserve-for-first-time/articleshow/82332264.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Frontline workers still show vaccine hesitancy||Hyderabad: The vaccination drive against Covid-19 among health and frontline workers lags behind due to vaccine hesitancy. Several workers of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and other government departments come in contact with people during their official duties, but have hesitated in taking the vaccine shot. Officials say that only 40% to 60% workers in each department have been vaccinated. “During a recent vaccination drive, a few frontline workers hesitated to take the vaccine as they feared its side-effects. However, we managed to convince them to take the vaccine through counselling, following which 1,300 workers out of 2,000 workers took the vaccine dose,” chief general manager, HMWS&SB (personal and administration), Mohammad Abdul Khader, told TOI. The state postal department, another major public utility department, organised a vaccination drive for its staff at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS). “We have appealed to all the staff members to get vaccinated. However, a few have chosen to stay away due to lack of awareness and fear of falling ill. As a result, the vaccination drive received a lukewarm response,” said a senior postal department official. Meanwhile, health and sanitation staff of the SCB have shown unwillingness to take the second dose of vaccine. “We are convincing the workers to take the second dose too to help them stay safe. A few of them have come forward to take the vaccine while others are citing health problems as reasons for not taking the second dose,” said SCB senior superintendent (SWM), M Devender. “Covid vaccine boosts immunity, therefore, we are appealing to the frontline workers as well as the general public to make good use of the vaccination drive and keep themselves safe,” a health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/frontline-workers-still-show-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/82334507.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||City-based inventors develop oxygen generating machine||Hyderabad: City-based inventors have developed an oxygen generating machine called Vayuputra, in which oxygen is produced from hydrogen peroxide. “To reduce the dependence of Covid-19 patients on commercial supply of medical oxygen, which is under severe supply-chain stress, the Phi Factory has developed an in-situ O2 manufacturing micro-reactor. The kit is a simple packed-bed catalytic micro-reactor capable of cleaving the oxygen molecules from various commercially available molecules . Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is chosen as a primary candidate for the reaction, as it is widely available in the market (extensively being used as a component in sanitisers), and comparatively inexpensive,” said Praveen Gorakavi, a scientist who developed the machine along with PM Sai Prasad, an entrepreneur. “With focus on tackling shortage of oxygen supply on a war-footing, we approached Gorakavi, who came up with the idea and developed Project Vayuputra oxygenerating machine. This is an efficient, cost-effective and scalable solution. We have taken it up as a non-profit initiative.” said Sai Prasad. This device is highly portable, fits into a box and has the potential to serve 2 people with 10 litre per minute of oxygen. The primary offering comes at Rs 2,500 along with a consumable liquid of 20 litres. This is sufficient enough to serve a person for 12 hours with medical grade oxygen. Once exhausted, the consumables can be replaced with refill cans of 20 litres that come at Rs 1,500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-based-inventors-develop-oxygen-generating-machine/articleshow/82334500.cms||---

ITC is rendering support to set up a 200- to 300-bed facility by Medica Superspecialty Hospital for treatment of Covid patients and administering vaccines. The state has permitted the use of Kishore Bharati Stadium for the set up. The diversified conglomerate RPSG Group, which has presence in power, engineering, retail, FMCG, IT and entertainment, has undertaken a multi-pronged initiative and donated 50 new oxygen concentrators to various Covid centres and hospitals in coordination with the state health department. The group has also taken the responsibility of delivering the concentrators to the centres, an executive said. Shashwat Goenka, sector head, retail and FMCG, said, “At RPSG Group, we stand by our conviction to extend all possible help in trying times like these.” An ITC executive said, “ITC will extend financial support to Medica for setting up this facility which will encompass the cost of creating the facility, including arrangement for beds, monitors, oxygen, furniture, ACs and initial medical supply. The hospital will be set up and managed entirely by Medica Superspecialty Hospitals and will be a temporary facility for treatment of Covid patients.” Medica chairman Aloke Roy said, “It is in the best interest of the citizens that we took up the task of setting up this satellite unit within just 72 hours. We thank the state and ITC Limited, who have come forward and sought our expertise and help to save as many lives as possible. These 200 beds will additionally address the need for HDU and ward patients with full support from our doctors and trained staff.” An RPSG Group executive said the retail arm of the group has ramped up phone delivery across stores and a curated list of essentials and non-food items are being circulated to customers. It is also in discussion with food vendors to start “direct store delivery”.

The hospital, to be named after former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is expected to be functional by early next week. During his visit, Yogi reviewed progress of work and gave directions to complete the project at the earliest. The 500-bed facility will have 300 ICU beds. The hospital was initiated by home minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh about two weeks ago to meet the shortage of beds for Covid patients. Meanwhile, Yogi said that a special panel of medical experts should be constituted to create awareness about the use of oxygen and injections like Remdesivir. This, he said, was necessary to curb hoarding of the lifesaving drugs and remove any shortage from the market. “Hoarding of oxygen and essential drugs like Remdesivir in homes is creating panic and leading to their shortage. There is a need to spread awareness and inform people about their correct usage amid the Covid scare,” the CM said. He also asked officials to ensure that medical experts explain the correct procedure of administering medical oxygen to patients, especially those in home isolation. In an appeal to doctors, Yogi said that they should follow protocols for recommending Remdesivir as “rampant recommendation has led to a shortage across the whole country and has increased its sale in the black market”. To address the shortage of health workers, the CM has said that retired doctors, para-medical staff and medical students in their final years can be deployed by hospitals to increase manpower in hospitals. “Many of those who had emerged victorious in the battle against Covid-19 are willing to serve patients. In this context, in order to increase the manpower at hospitals, experiences of retired doctors, lab technicians and paramedical staff along with retired personnel of the armed forces can be availed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/back-in-action-yogi-reviews-work-at-drdos-covid-hosp/articleshow/82335537.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Madurai||Need govt permission to hold prayers in buildings with huge crowds: HC||Madurai: If prayer meetings are organised with huge gatherings, then the nature of the building should be construed as a prayer hall entertaining public worship and the same would require permission from the authorities under relevant rules, the Madras high court has said.“The fulcrum of any religious faith is ‘the truth’, and no religion tolerates any act which takes a person away from the truth. In the present case, the petitioner who claims himself to be a devout Christian has travelled far away from the truth,” observed justice N Anand Venkatesh, while dismissing a petition filed by T Wilson.Wilson had sought to forbear the authorities from interfering with his right to practice his religion by conducting prayer meetings at his residence at Aruvikarai Village at Kalkulam taluk in Kanyakumari district.The grievance of the petitioner is that people with communal feelings have given a false complaint to prevent him from conducting the meetings. According to the petitioner, the authorities are acting upon those frivolous complaints and interfering with his right to practice his religion.However, the Kanyakumari district collector who conducted an inquiry had stated in his report that prayer was conducted at the petitioner’s residence on all days with microphones and speakers from 9am to 12pm and sometimes in the night, causing a lot of disturbance to neighbours.The judge observed that on perusal of the materials placed before the court, it finds the petitioner, under the guise of conducting prayer meetings, is actually having a full-fledged prayer hall intended for religious purposes where huge congregations take place. The photographs that have been produced by the petitioner before the district collector at the time of inquiry, substantiate the fact that the premises is actually used as a place of public worship without obtaining the necessary permission under the relevant rules.The judge said that the New Testament speaks volumes about how the early church engaged in congregational prayer and why it did so. Referring to verses in the sixth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible, the judge observed that it can be evidently understood that it does not profess a prayer to be done or conducted in a manner that would warrant gathering of people and usage of amplifiers of any sort in the process.“In fact, prayer, across religions and beliefs is considered to be a profound and private bond between the person praying and the divine. It can certainly not be thrown out on stage for public display, and one done that way cannot be construed as prayer in its purest forms,” he observed.The judge observed that the rights enjoyed by the citizens, including the fundamental rights, must coexist in harmony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/need-govt-permission-to-hold-prayers-in-buildings-with-huge-crowds-hc/articleshow/82336953.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The man died at his Baguiati home and the body remained there till Friday morning, when the former councillor intervened and made arrangements to take it away. The couple’s son works in Pune and couldn’t fly home in time. According to neighbours, the couple had been suffering from fever since last week and got tested on April 26. The positive reports arrived on April 27 and they stopped coming out of the house. “They were under remote treatment of a local doctor. But on Thursday, the man’s condition deteriorated and the doctor advised he be put on oxygen support and immediately hospitalized,” said a neighbour. The woman, however, didn’t inform any of the neighbours and hired an ambulance in the evening to look for a hospital. The couple had visited multiple hospitals in north and south Kolkata over three-and-a-half hours, following which, the man apparently stopped responding and the woman brought him home. The ambulance operators brought him out and left him on a bed on the ground floor of their two-storey house in Raghunathpur. “The woman had possibly realized that the man had died after reaching home. However, she didn’t inform the neighbours, local civic officials or us. On Friday morning, we learnt from some neighbours that the man had died and that the woman was struggling with the body at home. We intervened and helped arrange for a death certificate and cremation, maintaining Covid protocols,” said an officer of Baguiati police station. Following his death, local civic officials sanitized the exterior of the house and the neighbourhood on Friday afternoon. “I wasn’t informed about the death in time, or else I would have stepped in earlier. The woman’s son has been informed. We have promised all help and doorstep delivery of essentials for the woman, who is suffering from Covid,” said Manish Mukherjee, former councillor-cum-coordinator of Ward 9 in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-dies-of-covid-after-failed-search-for-hosp-bed/articleshow/82333587.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Government committed to farmers’ welfare: UP CM||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday reiterated that the state government was committed to the farmers’ welfare, essentially cane growers, despite the novel coronavirus pandemic, impacting economic activities. The CM made the statement during a virtual interaction with the cane growers, hours after he tested negative for the corona infection. The CM assured the farmers that sugar mills would continue to operate till the time cane was in the fields of farmers. He said that the state government was having a continuous dialogue with sugar mills owners for keeping the mills operational and ensuring early payment of farmers’ dues. He said that the payment Rs 1.35 lakh crore made to the cane growers in the last four years was a big achievement on the part of the state government He said that in the ongoing cane crushing season a payment of Rs 18,230 crore was made, which was 63% of the total dues. This, he said, was significant given the low sugar consumption because of the corona pandemic. He also appreciated the sugar development department for making cent-per-cent payment of farmers’ dues for 2019-20. The CM said that the state was leading in manufacturing of ethanol directly from sugarcane juice which is also helping the state government in paying dues to farmers. The CM said that the biggest challenge in the present time was to arrest the chances of infection in rural areas. “The farmers can play a big role in that,” he said, citing how the state government has constituted a nigrani samiti in every gram panchayat. The CM further said that the state was also keeping a close tab on procurement of wheat from farmers and ensuring that they get their payment within 72 hours. He said that the state government would help mitigate all problems faced by the farmers during the pandemic. The CM, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction over the quantity of sanitizer produced by sugar mills, which could be supplied to other states along with UP. The mills also played an important role in sanitization of places in the first as well as the second wave of corona pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-committed-to-farmers-welfare-cm/articleshow/82335568.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Once homeless, now cooks at Indira Rasoi||JAIPUR: At a time when the entire city is busy in dealing with pandemic, people who were beggars and homeless, now come forward to help the administration in providing food to the patients. Around 40 such people have been trained under a programme run by Rajasthan Skill and Livelihood Development Corporation (RSLDC) in which they were imparted skill development training. The beggars, who were living on the street and involved in various drug abuse cases, are now helping as a cook in Indira Rasoi run by Akshay Patra in Jaipur city. They work in a shift of 10 people at a time in various centres of Akshay Patra in morning and evening. Someone is in charge of kneading or cutting vegetables or packing food. The slow progress that they have made personally in the last three months is now being utilised in the time of crisis. This programme started in January 2021 by RSLDC after getting suggestions from Jaipur police. SOPAN Institute started Bhikshuk orientation and rehabilitation (BHOR) which is funded by RSLDC. Under this programme, 40 beggars from the streets were chosen who in the last three months have been given training in machine and cooking so that they will be able to start working as street vendors. Jitendra Pratap Singh, director of SOPAN, said, “Initially, it was difficult for us to made them understand the importance of this programme. With time, the haircut they received, hygienic clothes and workshops of skill development gave them confidence. We wanted them to start running their food stalls but with second wave of Covid, we are now using their skills in cooking for patients.” The pandemic forced the department to shut down the training programme for a while, but they still remain in a shelter home run by SOPAN. Chairman of RSLDC, Niraj Kumar Pawan, said that once the situation becomes normal, the skill development will again start. “People, who were on the street, are given a second chance to change their lives. We have tried our best to give them enough support so that they can get trained to earn a livelihood. This programme will be expanded further.” The programme will continue till June this year after which new group of beggars and homeless people will be chosen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/once-homeless-now-cooks-at-indira-rasoi/articleshow/82334508.cms||---

The NMC started pre-audit of Covid patients in August last year. Since then, the civic body appointed auditors have saved a total excess bill of Rs 4.90 crore of around 19,000 Covid patients taking treatment in private hospitals. The NMC has made pre-audit of bills mandatory for private hospitals through the auditors before handing it over to Covid-19 patients at the time of discharge. So far, the auditors have inspected around 47,000 bills and have found discrepancies in over 19,000 bills. “Since January we have saved excess bills of around Rs 1.25 crore of Covid patients undergoing treatment in private hospitals,” an NMC official said. “We are also conducting random inspections at private hospitals. Recently, we had served notices to five hospitals for not following the government guidelines. It is mandatory for the private hospitals to display rate chart for Covid treatment at the entrance of their hospitals along with the contact numbers of the NMC auditors,” he added. The private hospitals are expected to submit the bills to auditors for inspection and get their approvals before handing over them to the patients. There are over 150 private Covid hospitals across the city providing treatment to the Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-auditors-save-rs-60l-excess-bills-of-patients/articleshow/82332270.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Playing With Lives: Gang Selling Fake Remdesivir Busted, 7 Held. Filled With Antibiotics, Vials Sold For Up to Rs 40,000||New Delhi: Delhi Police's Crime Branch busted a gang manufacturing and selling fake Remdesivir injections and arrested seven people on Thursday. The gang filled vials with antibiotics like Azithromycin and then packaged them as Remdesivir under the brand name of Covipri. Police commissioner S N Shrivastava said in a tweet that the cops had unearthed their manufacturing unit in Uttarakhand’s Kotdwar and seized the machines and raw material used in making the injections. He said the complete chain, comprising an accountant-turned-pharmacy owner, pharmacist, interior designer, mask and gloves suppliers, medical aid dealer and medicine trader, had been busted. Police recovered 198 vials of fake Remdesivir, 3,000 empty vials and other materials, including Azithromycin. The gang is believed to have already sold around 2,500 vials of the fake medicine. Special commissioner (crime) Praveer Ranjan said that each vial was being sold for Rs 25,000-40,000 to desperate patients. “The accused are being interrogated about the identity of the people they sold the fake injections to. A special team has been formed to investigate the racket,” said Ranjan. The inter-state cell first apprehended two men, Shoaib Khan and Mohan Jha from Sangam Vihar, found indulging in the black-marketing of Remdesivir and recovered 10 vials of the medicine. During interrogation, they gave information on a gang operating in major cities supplying “Remdesivir Injections” at exorbitant rates. Shibesh Singh, joint commissioner (crime), said the subsequent raids led to the arrest of five others, namely Manish Goel, Pushkar Pakhale, Sadhna Sharma, Vatan Kumar Saini and the mastermind, Aditya Gautam. Several teams of the Crime Branch are conducting raids in various parts of Uttarakhand to nab the rest of the gang. Gautam was arrested from Roorkee. He had purchased around 2,000 antibiotic injection vials and changed their labels at Kotdwar. The computer on which he prepared the labels was also seized. Singh said, “They had set up a network to supply the injections on demand. Some individuals were involved in the black-market operations of the fake injections.” Khan and Jha worked as embroiders and began to deal in masks and gloves after the pandemic broke out and later joined the gang. Goel is a graduate who dealt in renting medical equipment. Pakhale is an MBA dropout who sold Ayurveda products and supplied masks. Sharma is an interior designer who had contracted Covid last year. She came in contact with a gang member when trying to procure Remdesivir for herself. She later joined them. Saini was doing BPharma and MBA degree courses and also ran a pharmaceutical company with Gautam, who also operates a couple of other pharma companies in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/playing-with-lives-gang-selling-fake-remdesivir-busted-7-held-filled-with-antibiotics-vials-sold-for-up-to-rs-40000/articleshow/82335622.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government’s mishandling of Covid has brought disrepute: Akhilesh||LUCKNOW: Accusing the BJP of gross mismanagement of Covid-19 crisis, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Friday that the pathetic performance of the government has brought disrepute to the state at the international level. He said though 706 teachers, shiksha mitras and government employees engaged in poll duty have died of Covid, the government has still deployed another 10,000 of them for counting of votes for pachayat elections. “The irony is that of the 10,000 people deputed for counting of votes, many are already infected and undergoing treatment. But there are complaints that they are not being exempted from duty,” Akhilesh said. The former CM said the government may have failed to provide proper medical attention, medicine, oxygen and beds in hospitals to the Covid-19 infected people but it has offered free cremation of the dead. He said the government must immediately release an ex gratia relief of Rs 50 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased . If the government refuses to pay financial assistance to the victims’ families, then the government employees will be compelled not to participate in counting of votes, he said. Earlier this week, the Allahabad high court also took cognizance of a report which said that 135 teachers, shiksha mitras and other government employees, who were assigned election duty in the ongoing panchayat polls had turned positive and died. The court asked the UP State Election Commission to explain why it failed to check the non-compliance of Covid-19 guidelines during the panchayat polls. The tall claims of the government that there is no shortage of medicine, oxygen and beds in hospitals have been refuted by SOS messages of the family members and attendants of patients who are begging for help as their loved once battle for life, Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govts-mishandling-of-covid-has-brought-disrepute-akhilesh/articleshow/82335603.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

There are 40 beds at the cafeteria, of which 35 are occupied. The facility is not, however, equipped to handle critical patients. It has basic medical infrastructure to help patients with mild infection recuperate in case they can’t get a hospital bed. It has been operational since April 24. A Tech Mahindra spokesperson said, “Initially, we created this facility to help our employees and their family members, but we did not restrict ourselves and have accommodated anyone who reached out to us as information spread. We have a basic setup in place, to help people isolate and recuperate. Fortis doctors are on call and there is manageable oxygen support. It is a very small number, but we wanted to do something for emergency support.” SEZ members said they have urged the Noida administration to allow any company with the resources to set up such facilities because of the dire need for beds. “The time has come when companies should be allowed to do their bit in creating hyper local facilities for emergencies. We want to come forward and help create more such facilities. For that, we want permission. We have requested the administration,” said Ajay Goel, president of the Noida Special Economic Zone Welfare Association. Indira Pathak, region head (North India), HR, at Tech Mahindra, who is involved in the initiative, told TOI, “We are actively partnering with the government, local administration and private enterprises to ensure we minimise the impact of this situation. With each one of us coming forward to help, I am hopeful that the situation will start to improve soon.” The SEZ has around 40,000 workers, many of whom are working from home. A section of the workforce that was attending office has gone back home over the past couple of weeks, when cases began to rise. A spokesperson for Fortis told TOI, “The facility at the NSEZ is the first and only one of its kind that we have come up with in Noida currently. With all resources now stretched, we are doing our best to help it remain operational.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/it-firms-cafeteria-turns-40-bed-covid-facility/articleshow/82335567.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

While it is not an issue for two-wheelers, heavy vehicles find it difficult with the limited space available to make the turn.“Small cars can take a U-turn in one go. Whereas bigger cars, vans and buses have to back it up and turn again. Vehicles are parked on both sides of the road at the junction leaving less space for vehicles to take turns,” said S Sakthivel, a motorist.An auto rickshaw driver, who do not want to be identified, said although many of the openings have been closed, the one in front of the Anna Nagar police station is still open. A barricade has also been set up on the road to slow down vehicles, causing further inconvenience to commuters. Pedestrians say that the barricades could have been placed in such a way that it would have allowed them to pass through, while blocking only vehicles.A traffic police official said the openings were closed as accidents were being frequently reported due to it. “Vehicles suddenly entering the main road takes fast moving motorists by surprise.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Maha Kumbh ends, over 91L attended mela since Jan 14, over 50L in April alone||HARIDWAR: The Maha Kumbh mela officially ended on Friday. Around 91.5 lakh pilgrims converged at Haridwar since the mela ritualistically began on Jan 14 on Makar Sankranti, as per data provided by the mela officials. Of these, over 50 lakh pilgrims were recorded in the month of April alone — the official duration of the mela as announced by the state government —- when three shahi snans were held amidst the raging Covid-19 pandemic. During the shahi snans -- on April 12, April 14 and April 27 -- there was a cumulative turnout of over 48 lakh pilgrims as per officials. Local residents alleged that Kumbh mela and district authorities did not implement the Covid-19 guidelines properly and allowed seers and pilgrims to visit the mela without a negative RT-PCR report and valid registration due to which the pandemic situation worsened in Haridwar where more than 10,000 positive cases and more than 50 deaths have been reported in the last 10 days. Sachin Dabral, a social activist who has filed a PIL in the Uttarakhand high court over mismanagement in the Kumbh mela, told TOI, “Mela and district administration failed completely to implement the Covid -19 SOPs for the Kumbh mela and now people of Uttarakhand are suffering due to this as the Covid-19 situation has become out of control here and people are dying due to lack of basic health facilities. Mela administration must show the data of pilgrims who reached Haridwar with proper registration along with RT-PCR report.” When queried, mela administration officials claimed that all possible efforts were done to implement the SOPs. Additional mela officer Harbeer Singh told TOI, “Pilgrims were not allowed to visit without a negative report and registration. Since many pilgrims used the Kumbh mela website to register themselves, this data is being compiled.” Kumbh mela police meanwhile claimed that lakhs of vehicles and pilgrims were returned from the borders sine they did not have valid registration and Covid-19-negative report. Sanjay Gunjyal, IG Kumbh, told TOI, “Both mela and district police were deployed on all the borders of the district to check the pilgrims. Around two lakh pilgrims were returned during the mela period from the borders since they did not have Covid-19-negative reports or valid documents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/maha-kumbh-ends-over-91l-attended-mela-since-jan-14-over-50l-in-april-alone/articleshow/82332959.cms||MS Nawaz

While many are helping to dispel misinformation by verifying facts related to availability of beds, oxygen, medicines etc, others are amplifying the distress messages seeking help on social media. Class XI and XII students of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya (MSMSV) in Jaipur have started a campaign, ‘Jaipur Fights Covid’ for collecting plasma donators through Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and other websites. “The idea is to utilise the network of students and the school for the good of the society. We have chosen plasma since it is the only life-saving thing that rests with people. The campaign is getting a good response and once the bank will have a good number of leads, we will connect them with those in need,” said Zohaib Abbas Abbasi, a class IX student. CyberVeer foundation has launched a campaign #covidsupportrajasthan and have come up with a web portal — Covidsupportrajasthan.org providing all information related to Covid on a common platform. The information contains control room numbers, government orders, link to government web portals, along with the independently sourced and verified information like a list of oxygen suppliers, plasma donors, free food suppliers etc. The campaign has 35 volunteers from St Xavier’s College, IIS University in Jaipur, Christ College in Bangalore, Sophia College in Ajmer, Al Ameen Medical College, and Banasthali University. “Our team is divided into four sub-teams — Team Beds, Team Plasma, Team Oxygen, Team Fact Check and Team Translator (Translating government orders into English),” said Prem Pal, one of the volunteers at the campaign. The team picks up distress messages from social media, verifies them and floats them on social media in a designed format. Sara Sarafat, an MBBS student from University-Kyrgyz state medical university, arrived in India in a Vande Bharat Mission special flight and is fighting misinformation on social media. “During the first wave, I chose to be a mute spectator but now I couldn’t stop myself from cross-checking the fake contact details of oxygen providers, plasma donors and availability of hospital beds,” said Sarafat. Vinayak Das (25), a lawyer, is running a free food service for Covid patients, especially elders serving home quarantine from the past 15 days in limited areas of the city. “I am serving 50-60 persons every day. I have realised that elderly people due to the impact of the medicines, cannot cook nor order food online. So, I started this service,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civil-society-campaigns-help-people-in-distress/articleshow/82334519.cms||Shoeb Khan

Shops having more than 3,000sqft floor space have been classified as ‘big’ and ordered to remain closed as part of the restrictions to curb Covid-19 spread. The traders said that they should be allowed to do business especially for the marriage and Ramzan festive seasons.The Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association in Madurai said that classifying shops with an area of 3000sq feet as big and not permitting them to operate was affecting 20,000 traders and three lakh employees.In a communication to the state chief secretary, secretary of the association Ashruf Tayub said that they were trying to adhere to all the SOPs of Covid-check.He said that the traders of the textile industry employ people from the uneducated and underprivileged sections of the society and their salaries help their families. If three lakh people lose do not get their salaries, it will cause chaos in their families.Also, since this is the marriage and Ramzan season, for which traders have obtained loans, the sudden announcement would affect these shops badly, and those stocks that are not sold would be dead stocks till next year. Hence, the bigger shops should be allowed to operate following all SOPs.A citizens’ forum in Trichy also urged the government to allow textile outlets, irrespective of their floor space, to resume business temporarily. “If big and spacious showrooms were given permission to operate for a stipulated time, we can ensure social distancing and intense screening measures to operate without any threats. Now, people are visiting small shops to purchase which shall only increase the possibility to spread the infection,” said M Sekaran, chairman, citizens forum. As most of the outlets on commercial streets including NSB road, Thillai Nagar, Sastri road and Mainguard gate have more than 3,000sqft floor space, the outlets have been closed. The forum said that allowing the large shops through relaxations to operate with screening measures will eliminate the need to throng the small shops in an unsafe manner. “At least till Eid celebration is over, the state government should give relaxation,” Sekaran added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-allow-all-textile-shops-to-open/articleshow/82336957.cms||---

Jai Maa Kali Trust of the main crematorium (Ghat) at Chas Bridge in the district has started facing a shortage of logs. More than 35 bodies are being cremated daily at the ghat. Record keepers at the ghat said 446 corpses were cremated in the past 30 days. Before the spike in cases, a maximum of seven corpses were cremated in a day. Chas SDO Shashi Prakash Singh said the circle officer has been tasked to ensure the availability of logs. Crematoriums in Bokaro are entirely dependent on logs as there are no electric or gas-powered human incinerators at present. The trustees have requested Chas Nagar Nigam and companies like Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL), among others, till a month ago to install the facility, but in vain. Gopal Murarka, a social worker and a trustee of the Chas Ghat, said: “Increase in the number of cremations has led to a shortage of woods. A pyre usually requires up to 600 kg of timber.” Record keepers at the ghat said 198 corpses were cremated in the past five days. “Of the total, 59 were Covid-19 patients,” said Lakhan Mahatha, a record keeper at the Ghat. However, the administration has put the death toll due to Covid-19 at 19. Staff at the ghat said the body count included many people who died in home isolation. Sources said, “There are lakhs of tons of logs stocked at the school ground of BSL. These are the logs of the trees which were felled during the expansion of Bokaro airstrip. But the forest department, which is the custodian of the logs, is not permitting its use for cremation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-burning-ghats-cremate-198-bodies-in-5-days-run-short-of-timber/articleshow/82333531.cms||Divy Khare

The IMA has empanelled 30 doctors to attend to the patients over the phone. The service has been launched at the request of East Singhbhum administration. The IMA said they are receiving nearly 600 calls each day from Covid-19 patients and their family members. The IMA has made public the phone numbers of the doctors and their schedule for taking calls. “I receive calls at regular intervals all through the day and even late in the evening but I have no complaints. The severity of the pandemic is such that people driven by the concern for their nar ones call on the doctor to get timely advice,” Dr Harprit Singh, a city-based urologist, said. The secretary of the IMA Jamshedpur chapter, Dr Mrityunjay Singh, said: “Some callers also ask about the status of the beds of their preferred hospitals. They also seek our help in arranging oxygen cylinders and so on.” A 57-year-old Covid-19 infected man from Sitaramdera said: “Since I am mildly infected, I wanted to know from the doctor which medicines to take for early recovery. The doctor also advised me about the diet for the isolation period.” Following the IMA’s footsteps, the Tata Main Hospital management also started telephone consultancy for patients from Friday onwards. As many as 85 people rang up to seek medical advice. The hospital management said the patients will have to register themselves on Vishwas App. Non-Tata Steel employees will have to pay Rs 250 for each consultation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/ima-tmh-launch-telephone-service-for-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82333492.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It may be stated here that the state government has extended the restrictions on commercial and other activities till May 6 to bring the Covid-19 pandemic under control. Earlier, the health safety week was held till April 29. The Mahatma Gandhi Road and other important commercial centres wore a deserted look in the afternoon as almost all the shops remained closed. At Lalpur, the police announced on mike that shops have to be closed at 2pm. Subsequently, a massive vehicle checking drive was undertaken at the important crossings of the city. The general secretary of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), Rahul Maroo, said, “Traders are observing government restrictions as they know it will help check the pandemic. We are hopeful of improvement in the situation. In any case the FJCCI would stand by the decisions taken by the government in future in this regard.” Meanwhile, police have made elaborate arrangements to enforce the new rules. As many as 96 points where the possibility of people congregating is high have been identified for deployment of forces. The senior officers were also patrolling the streets to take stock of the situation. It may be mentioned here that the district administration on Thursday evening staged a march in the city appealing to people to observe the new measures. “We are keeping a vigil but the citizens are also observing the government order by themselves,” City DSP Amit Singh said. Additional director general of police R K Mallick said, “The police headquarters have instructed that the field personnel must use persuasion to make people obey rules. They would book the violators under relevant laws if the latter fail to comply. We do not want the attention to be on the police for use of force.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/janta-stays-indoors-amid-new-curbs/articleshow/82333546.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dhanbad deputy commissioner Uma Shankar Singh said 21 private hospitals in the district have been given permission for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Since the number of patients is increasing each day, the private hospitals have been asked to share details of their beds and other infrastructural facilities with the Covid control room by Saturday evening and reserve 70% of their beds so that Covid patients can be referred to them from Sunday onwards,” Singh said. While all the ICU beds in government and private hospitals were already filled up, Covid patients are finding it difficult to get even non-oxygen supported beds in hospitals of Dhanbad. Meanwhile, addressing a meeting of District Mineral Foundation Trust (DMFT), the DC informed the public representatives that the administration was working to start a 60-bed ICU and 40-bed non-ICU ward at the Dhanbad sadar hospital, and an additional 30-bed ICU ward in PMCH’s CATH lab. This apart, there are plans to purchase D-type jumbo cylinders for meeting the oxygen requirement of patients, PCR machines for the microbiology lab of SNMMCH, antibody-testing kits, plasma kits and plasma apheresis kits. Dhanbad MP P N Singh, Giridih MP Chandra Prakash Choudhary, MLA Dhullu Mahto, Purnima Singh, Aparna Sengupta, Mathura Prasad Mahto drew the attention of the district administration towards alleged extortion of patients by private hospitals and pathological labs and demanded action against such centres. They also requested the administration to ramp up testing to check the spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dhanbad-pvt-hosps-asked-to-reserve-70-beds-for-cov-patients/articleshow/82333508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||JMM blames Centre for 2nd wave, seeks SC intervention||RANCHI: JMM on Friday criticised the Centre for failing to tackle the second wave of Covid-19 in the country and sought Supreme Court’s intervention in the management of the pandemic. “The PM violated disaster management laws and held massive rallies in poll-bound states. Foreign countries were sold crores of vaccine doses, 93,000 tonne oxygen and anti-viral drugs worth crores of rupees. The Centre did not allow Pfizer and Sputnik vaccines for clinical trials and now, the PM has imposed the Centre’s decision which forces the states to buy vaccines,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. Since the Centre has failed completely, the Supreme Court should take the country’s health management in its wings and manage the pandemic, Bhattacharya demanded. JMM picked up from where state health minister Banna Gupta left on Friday. “We have five lakh doses left and the situation is such that only 25% of the targeted beneficiaries between 45 and 59 years (82 lakh) have received their first doses. Only 7% of the beneficiaries got their second dose. Around 43% of the senior citizens are yet to get their second doses in the state,” Bhattacharya added. JMM also blamed it on the Centre for the state’s inability to start the vaccination drive for adults between 18-57 years from May 1. The makers of Covishield and Covaxin have informed the Jharkhand government that they cannot supply vaccines before May 15. The BJP, however, blamed it on the incumbent state government. “There are over 6.46 lakh doses of vaccine available in the state and 32 lakh have taken their vaccines in the state. Instead of blaming it on the Centre, the government must utilise the stocks to carry out the drive,” state BJP president Deepak Prakash said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-blames-centre-for-2nd-wave-seeks-sc-intervention/articleshow/82333518.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||In pandemic, HCs must refrain from off-the-cuff remarks: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday advised the High Courts to exercise judicial restraint and not pass off-the-cuff comments on the efficiency of officials managing the pandemic situation as such remarks could be very damaging to the morale of the bureaucracy, which the Centre said was working round the clock despite key officials testing positive for Covid. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta cited the example of the oxygen procurement and supply management chain committee headed by Sumit Dawra, who despite being Covid positive is putting in 16 hours a day to ensure that the oxygen supply chain is kept to meet the surging demands in hospitals in 12 high case load states. "When off-the-cuff comments are made on the efficiency of such hardworking officials, who have put the nation over personal safety, it has a demoralising effect on the entire workforce," Meht said. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Bihar government, also made similar complaints to a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat. The bench said, "The remarks made by the High Courts, which have a free hand in dealing with the situation in the state, are mostly meant to test the hypothesis or arguments advanced by lawyers. But, such off the cuff remarks, in today's world of social media and internet driven dissemination of news, gets reported without highlighting the context in which the remarks are made." However, the bench agreed that such off-the-cuff remarks by Judges could have serious ramification for individual officers in the "new time that we are living in because of the pandemic". "All we can say is that Judges are trained enough to exercise judicial restraint before making any off-the-cuff remark," the bench said. However, Justice Bhat recalled the criticism that the SC got when it suo motu took up the issues arising at the national level, like supply of oxygen, medicines and vaccines, on an equitable basis to states. "If the Judges give vent to the citizens' concern, the officers must not be fragile and take them in the right spirit". Justice Rao suggested to the SG to consider engaging around 25,000 MBBS graduates who have passed out fresh this year in Covid duties along with around fresh-pass out two lakh nursing students. "The present lot of health workers, doctors along with nursing staff have been working without rest for more than a year. Unless extra hands are pressed into service, the existing medical personnel would be fatigued and lead to collapse of the healthcare system," he said. Justice Bhat said the governments must consider giving extra remuneration to doctors and other healthcare workers. "We must ensure that they get paid extra for the tireless work they have put in for more than a year, be they in government or in the private sector. That will be fitting tribute to their contribution apart from reverentially acknowledging their tireless work," Justice Bhat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-chides-hcs-for-off-the-cuff-remarks/articleshow/82337216.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Vijayawada||AP high court dismisses pleas challenging Tirupati bypoll validity||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Friday dismissed the petitions moved by BJP and TDP challenging the validity of by-election to Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency. BJP contestant K Ratna Prabha and TDP contestant Panabaka Lakshmi had moved separate petitions alleging large-scale fraud voting with fake voter identity cards. The court, however, said the petitions are not maintainable as the petitioners have not followed the prescribed procedure in raising objections over the alleged voting fraud akin to booth capturing. Both Ratna Prabha and Lakshmi alleged that people from outside Tirupati constituency were brought in vehicles and were given fake voter ID cards to cast votes impersonating genuine voters. Due to the fake votes cast by impersonators, genuine voters were denied their right to vote, they alleged in their petitions, and also challenged the decision of the Election Commission which turned down their representations. Arguing on behalf of Ratna Prabha, senior counsel B Adinaryana Rao said free and fair election is the foundation of democracy and the extent of fraud voting done in the Tirupati by-election was a mockery of democracy. Though ample evidence was submitted to the Election Commission, no action was initiated, and their request for repolling was turned down, he added. Arguing for Lakshmi, senior counsel Devadatt Kamat said the high court can invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction if the monstrosity of the situation so compels, which is permitted by the Supreme Court. In the present case, the situation fits into the SC judgement as the EC chose not to act even after submission of plethora of evidence about how the fraud was committed on polling day. The HC bench comprising Justice Joy Malya Bagchi and Justice M Ganga Rao asked as to why polling agents did not raise any objections when fake voters were casting their votes. The bench further said that the petitioners cannot hold the EC accountable without registering their complaints in the first place, and cannot ask for high court’s intervention for countermanding the election by not following the due procedure. However, the high court kept all issues open keeping in view the severity of the allegations and after giving liberty to the petitioners to file an election petition, dismissed both pleas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-dismisses-pleas-challenging-tirupati-bypoll-validity/articleshow/82333161.cms||Srikanth Aluri

But the surge in Covid infections is likely to hurt industrial recovery as more states impose local lockdowns. Data released by the department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on Friday showed the core sector — covering coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity — grew 6.8% in March compared with a contraction of 3.8% in the previous month and an 8.6% decline in the year-ago period. The first wave of Covid, which led to a strict lockdown in March last year, had hurt the sector sharply. For FY21, core sector output contracted 7% compared to 0.4% growth in the previous year. The havoc unleashed by the second wave of Covid has already prompted several industries to halt production temporarily and the lockdowns imposed by states are also likely to weigh on factory activity. The core sector accounts for nearly 41% of the index of industrial production (IIP), data for which will be released later in the month. “The low base of the lockdown would push up the yearon-year expansion of the index of eight core industries to a sharp 50-70% in April 2021, with exceptionally high growth expected in cement and steel,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/core-sector-output-rises-6-8-in-march/articleshow/82337243.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy: Exams being held with future of students in mind||AMARAVATI: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday asserted that the state government has taken the conduct of the SSC and Intermediate examinations as a challenge to protect the interests of students. Stating that cancellation of the exams will not benefit students, he said the government will take all possible measures to protect the health of teachers and students attending the exams. Jagan, who reviewed the progress of public schools modernisation works taken up under Nadu-Nedu, said the issue has been turned into an unnecessary controversy by opposition parties with vested interests. “We have a duty towards the children and their future. We can give them a better future only when their academics are strong. I strongly believe that quality education is the only asset that we can give to future generations,” he said. He further said that the government has taken the conduct of the examinations as a challenge as it would help the bright students build their future. “It would be easier for us to cancel and issue pass certificates to all instead of taking the pains to conduct the examinations. We, however, have decided to take the toughest route keeping in view the long future of students,” Jagan said, and promised that the government would take utmost care to conduct the exams despite the challenging situation. The chief minister directed officials not to give scope for any slip-ups in the conduct of the Intermediate examinations which commence on May 5. “I hope the teachers are playing a big role in the smooth conduct of the examinations. They should explain the parents the motive of the government behind the conduct of the exams,” he said, and cited the example of Kerala, which he said recently conducted the SSC examinations successfully. Many other states are also planning to conduct the exams, he added. Jagan asked officials to complete all pending works under phase I of Nadu-Nedu by May. “Senior officials should inspect the schools to take up audit in June. Works related to painting, fixation of smart televisions should be completed by the end of next month. A system to maintain the toilets should also be ready by June-end,” he said. Education minister Adimulapu Suresh, senior officials Budithi Rajasekhar, Vadrevu China Veera Bhadrudu and Vetri Selvi were also present at the review meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-exams-being-held-with-future-of-students-in-mind/articleshow/82333183.cms||Samdani MN
---||Visakhapatnam||AP: Parents, students worry as govt stands firm on Inter, SSC exams||VISAKHAPATNAM: The government’s firm stand on holding SSC and intermediate exams amid the raging second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has evoked strong reactions from various stakeholders. The government has said that promoting students without conducting the exams would harm their careers and hurt their chances of making it to premier national educational institutions. While the intermediate exams are slated to start on May 5, class X exams would be conducted in June. However, several parents, students and opposition parties argue that conducting exams at this stage will place the students’ mental and physical health at risk. They have questioned the rationale behind the government’s ‘exam emergency’ at a time when Covid-19 cases are surging with each passing day and point out that students are struggling to concentrate due to the prevailing pandemic situation. Several people have also moved the court seeking postponement of the exams, if not cancellation. Education minister A Suresh said they took the decision after a lot of deliberation. “The safety and well-being of students would be given top priority. Students who test positive for Covid-19 during this time can sit in supplementary exams. They will be issued regular certificates,” he said. TDP general secretary and former minister Nara Lokesh said the government is putting the lives of lakhs of students at risk by conducting the exams. “They should at least postpone the exams,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/parents-students-worry-as-govt-stands-firm-on-inter-ssc-exams/articleshow/82333194.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Court grants 4-day custody of Dhullipala Narendra||VIJAYAWADA: The special judge for ACB cases in Vijayawada on Friday granted a four-day custody of TDP leader Dhullipala Narendra to the ACB for interrogation in the alleged irregularities in the Sangam dairy. The custody comes into effect from Saturday as ACB officials will be shifting the former chairman of Guntur District Milk Producers’ Cooperative Union Limited from Rajahmundry Central Jail to Vijayawada. The ACB court said that the interrogation of Narendra should take place in the presence of his counsel. During the hearing of ACB’s custody petition, defence counsel Gottipati Rama Krishna Prasad argued against the need to interrogate Narendra citing the recent government order taking over Sangam dairy under its control. He also claimed that the land transfers are also on the record and said there were no personal benefits earned by him. The advocate representing the ACB argued that there are many unknown aspects to the case that needs to be interrogated. Eventually, the ACB court postponed Narendra’s bail petition hearing to Monday. Narendra along with P Gopala Krishnan, former MD, and M Gurunadham, former district cooperative officer, was arrested on April 23 after ACB conducted a series of raids at the Sangam dairy headquarters in Guntur. Based on a complaint, the ACB probed into the functioning of Sangam dairy that allegedly revealed various financial and administrative irregularities under Narendra’s chairmanship in connivance with others. Eventually, Narendra was booked under Sections 13 (1), C and D of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and IPC Sections 408, 409, 418, 420, 465, 471 and 120-B read with 34.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-grants-4-day-custody-of-narendra/articleshow/82333199.cms||---

According to Two-Town police, the incident took place on Thursday and came to light on Friday after cops booked the accused, 35-year-old Raja, an employee at a medicine shop. andht Police said that Raja and his wife Yugandhari had frequent quarrels over financial problems. “For the last three months, Raja stopped going to work. This led to financial distress within the family. On April 28, a heated argument broke out between the couple. They finally decided to hold a discussion between both families on Sunday,” said a police official. On Thursday afternoon, Yugandhari went to her mother’s place nearby along with her daughter. A little later, Raja called Yugandhari and asked her to send their daughter home. Yugandhari dropped off her child, an upper kindergarten student, and returned to her mother’s place. While the seven-year-old was playing games on a mobile phone, her father pinned her to the bed and held a pillow over her mouth and nose causing her to asphyxiate. When Yugandhari returned home, she found her daughter unconscious and rushed her to a hospital. Raja accompanied her all the while pretending that he had nothing to do with the incident. Upon admitting her at Vijayawada government hospital, doctors declared her ‘brought dead’.

However, the leak was arrested within 45 minutes. Oxygen supply restored to patients through alternative mechanisms. Joint collector Himanshu Shukla said that all patients in the hospital are safe. Shukla said the leak occurred as the pressure on the safety valve increased. Hospital authorities are monitoring the situation. Speaking to TOI, hospital superintendent Dr AVR Mohan said that the leak took place from the liquid oxygen tank through the safety valve. The superintendent said that an alternative mechanism of manifold gas cylinders was given to patients immediately to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply. The leak was plugged within 45 minutes by changing the valve, he said.

---||Business||RIL’s Q4 net increases over 2X to near Rs 15k crore||MUMBAI: Fourth quarter profit of Reliance Industries (RIL), India’s largest company in terms of market value, more than doubled after growing 129% to Rs 14,995 crore, benefiting from higher price realisations in its digital services (Jio) and retail businesses. Profit also included a one-time gain of Rs 797 crore, which it made from the sale of US shale assets. RIL had posted a one-time loss of Rs 4,267 crore in Q4FY20. Revenue edged up 11% to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, it said on Friday. Operating profit marginally improved to Rs 26,602 crore in the January through March months despite the O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business clocking weak earnings. The company had combined its refining and petrochemicals units to form O2C. “To me, the contributions (RIL’s help in Covid fight) are far more satisfying than our company’s strong, overall operational and financial performance for the year,” said its chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani. For the whole year of the pandemic hit 2020-21, RIL’s profit rose 35% to Rs 53,739 crore. “While Covid-19 has disrupted livelihoods, we have added nearly 75,000 jobs to the economy (during fiscal 2021),” Ambani said. The jobs were added by RIL’s consumer business (Jio and retail), which accounted for 47% of its operating profit. In the year-ago period, Jio and retail together accounted for 36% of the company’s operating profit. Operating profit of O2C dropped 5% to Rs 11,407 crore due to lower product sales and price realisations. But operating profit of digital services climbed 31% to Rs 8,945 crore due to an improved average revenue per user (ARPU) and higher data usage by people, while remaining sheltered at homes due to Covid. ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Jio’s ARPU was Rs 138 in the March quarter, up from Rs 130 a year ago. Launched in 2016, Jio has 426 million customers and saw data and voice traffic growth of 27% and 18%, respectively, on its network. Operating profit of retail increased 41% to Rs 3,623 crore, despite restricted normative operating conditions. This growth was enabled by doubling of consumer electronics profits, cost-management initiatives and a boost from investment income of Rs 534 crore, RIL said. Operating profit of financial services, which the company recently started to report separately, plunged 59% to Rs 144 crore. Oil & gas, however, turned around, with revival in KG-D6 gas production. It made an operating profit of Rs 480 crore as against an operational loss of Rs 46 crore in the year-ago period. RIL’s debt at the end of the quarter was Rs 2.51 lakh crore, but it had Rs 2.54 lakh crore in cash and cash equivalents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rils-q4-net-increases-over-2x-to-near-rs-15k-crore/articleshow/82337246.cms||---

But 20-year-old second-year MBBS student Apeksha Maradiya has already infused herself with the essence of the Hippocratic oath — serving others notwithstanding her own personal twin tragedies. Life suddenly threw the PDU student of Rajkot into the deep sea when Covid-19 snatched away her parents, one after the other, in matter of five days only. Her father lost the battle on April 6, while her mother too succumbed to the infection on April 10. Left alone with a 15-year-old brother only, the wannabe medico didn’t bow to the pressures of the unforeseen, but decided to battle the virus her way. She rejoined her duties in Samras hostel fighting to save the loved ones of others. There was no pressure on Apeksha to join duty so soon, looking at her unfortunate circumstances, but along with the other medical students she too donned the PPE suit once again on April 27. “I lost my parents but I decided to do whatever I could do as a medical student to save the lives of loved ones of others that would be the real tribute to my parents,” Maradiya told TOI. She further said that while she is frightened that her younger brother may get infected, there was nothing that she could do to help people by being at home. “I, therefore, decided to help people. It’s also my duty to help people because I am on the path to becoming a doctor,” the young warrior asserted. At Samras hostel, Covid patients needing oxygen support are treated. A 30-year-old female patient became critical and was required to be shifted on a ventilator on April 28. “I took her (the patient) in an ambulance to the civil hospital because here we don’t have ventilator beds. I am happy that I could save her life by timely shifting her to the ventilator,” Apeksha, who treats each patient as her family members, said. “I feel so happy when I do something to save their lives from this deadly virus,” she added. Charansinh Gohil deputy collector and head of Samras hospital said, “Apeksha could have been spared from this duty by the administration if she so wished. But she gave priority to her duty and instead of drowning in grief, she stood up to fight and heal other people’s pain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-orphaned-medical-student-rejoins-duty-within-20-days/articleshow/82334032.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Sardesai has also called on the government to convene an all-party meeting to discuss Goa’s Covid-19 strategy and the plans to enhance Goa’s medical infrastructure. He also said that an all-party meeting could not only provide ideas for the state government but will also create political unity. “The government and health authorities need to be vigilant and avoid diversion of oxygen supply to the Sindhudurg hospital run by BJP MP Narayan Rane,” he said. “Ever since the first wave of infections hit the state we have been calling for urgent measures to ramp up our health infrastructure,” said Sardesai, adding, “Goa being a tourist hub, the government should’ve anticipated the surge and worked proactively from the beginning to avoid the mess we are in now.” Sardesai also met Salcete deputy collector Jyoti Kumari and conveyed the need for immediate action to stop the rapid spread of infections.  He demanded an immediate stop to all unnecessary expenditure towards tourism promotion and that the amount of over Rs28 crore budgeted for promoting tourism should be used to augment medical infrastructure. GFP also asked the government to clearly define the current lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-see-to-goas-needs-dont-divert-o2-to-sindhudurg/articleshow/82335237.cms||---

The existing programme of vaccinating citizens above 45 will, however, continue across the state. “We will start vaccinations only after we get more information about the number of vaccines allotted to us by the Centre and a delivery schedule from vaccine manufacturers,” said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan. The state has authorised Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation to buy 1.5 crore doses, but SII and Bharat Biotech, the manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin, have not responded with an offer letter or delivery schedule yet. Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash, too, said the city will not start the drive on May 1. The immunisation wing of the directorate of public health on Friday morning said the state had 6.69 lakh doses of vaccine — 5.20 lakh doses of Covishield and 1.49 lakh doses of Covaxin. The registry also showed there were 31.80 lakh people waiting for their second dose. So far, 12.94 lakh people in Tamil Nadu have received both doses of vaccine. ‘Covaxin kept for people who need second dose’ Joint director immunisation Dr K Vinay Kumar said, “We are asking people to take the second dose of the vaccine when it is time. In most centres, Covaxin is reserved only for people who need it for the second dose. Many people in this group have higher risk either because they had comorbidities or because of age.” Some private hospitals, including Apollo Hospitals Group, however, announced that they would begin vaccinating individuals between the ages of 18 to 44 years. Apollo said it “has taken the initiative and arrangements to procure the vaccines directly from the manufacturers as per government directive”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/vax-shortage-jab-drive-for-18-wont-start-in-tamil-nadu-today/articleshow/82337263.cms||Pushpa Narayan

AAP convener Rahul Mhambre reiterated the party’s demand for a statewide dashboard to provide real-time data about the availability of beds and medical facilities. Mhambre accused health minister Vishwajit Rane of trying to blame the high death toll on the patients themselves and said that a major cause of delay in admission is due to shortage of beds in most Covid hospitals and lack of awareness among patients about where to go to in case their health deteriorates. “In such a situation, a portal or app dashboard with real-time availability of beds would help save precious lives. The government should discuss this delay with doctors involved in tele-consultation of Covid-positive patients under home isolation and find out the reasons why such patients are not seeking hospitalisation faster,” Mhambre said. He also questioned the motive behind revealing comorbidities of the deceased Citizens have begun hunting for oxygen cylinders and concentrators in the open market, AAP also demanded to know what happened to the 200 ventilators that the health department had ordered through emergency procurement last June at a cost of Rs 16.3 crore. “It was shocking to see BJP’s own central government cap Goa’s oxygen supply to 11 tonne in Covid times, when Goa’s purchase was 40 tonne in normal, non-Covid times,” said Mhambre. Citing the deluge of distress calls that AAP volunteers are receiving with requests for bed, oxygen and ventilators, Mhambre urged Rane and chief minister Pramod Sawant to focus on rapidly expanding Goa’s medical infrastructure, particularly advanced treatment facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/provide-data-on-available-medical-facilities-aap/articleshow/82335246.cms||---

---||Business||After US, EU policy faces criticism on export curbs||NEW DELHI: The European Union’s policy to restrict vaccine exports has come under attack from World Trade Organization (WTO) members led by Australia with India, Pakistan and the trading bloc’s traditional allies such as the UK and Switzerland too slamming the curbs. During a committee meeting at the WTO headquarters in Geneva, Australia led the assault, saying export restrictions and trade restrictions were making the health crisis worse and warned that this could be counter-productive. The discussion coincided with the US too easing some of the export restrictions it had imposed, which were restricting supplies, including critical inputs for vaccine production, prompting the Indian government to take up the issue in the wake of rising infections in the country. As Australia was joined by Switzerland and the UK, which demanded that the restrictions imposed by the EU and others be lifted, India said the regulation on shipments leaving a territory was part of a legitimate trade policy but depended on how they were being deployed. “Last year, India had shown that it used this tool for ensuring equitable distribution of critical medicines, diagnostic kits, ventilators and PPEs to more than 150 countries based on mutually assessed needs — also to provide more than 60 million vaccine doses to more than 80 countries, ensuring their equitable distribution. Others have chosen to do the opposite and used export restrictions as a tool to prevent cross-border shipments of vaccines from its territory, India concluded,” a source said. Sources familiar with the deliberations said that EU defended its position and refused to call it an export ban. In fact, supporters of the India South-Africa proposal to waive certain provisions of the TRIPS Agreement in response to the pandemic, used the deliberations to underline that the EU exports restrictions are evidence that the current approach to vaccine sharing and supply across the globe is not working, and a new approach is needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/after-us-eu-policy-faces-criticism-on-export-curbs/articleshow/82337273.cms||Sidhartha

After the state government introduced the restrictions, Goa University had issued a circular stating that all teaching and non-teaching employees at the university and its affiliated colleges can work from home until further notice. The circular was issued on April 26. However, within three days, GU issued a corrigendum to the circular stating that its April 26 work from home directives only apply to the varsity campus staffers. As the directorate of higher education had already also issued a circular on April 26 allowing work from home for general stream colleges, institutes offering BA, BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA, programmes can continue with their plans to work online from home. And they remain unaffected by the GU corrigendum circular. Technical education institutes have been left in the lurch, as the GU circular doesn’t apply to them anymore, and they do not come under the purview of the directorate of higher education in such administrative matters. Given previous GU directives, the directorate of technical education had not issued any separate instructions on work from home. A couple of them have already directed their employees to report to work on Monday, even though orders from both district magistrates have directed all schools and colleges to remain shut. “There are five engineering colleges, six polytechnics, two pharmacy colleges, one architecture college and one fine arts college, with around 2,000 employees. As there are no separate orders from the directorate of technical education until Friday evening, institute heads are confused, and some are summoning employees to work from Monday,” said an employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/varsitys-wfh-notice-leaves-technical-colleges-confused/articleshow/82335264.cms||---
---||Goa||Cong workers told to focus on Covid relief||Panaji: Congress desk in charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao has asked the party workers in Goa to help Covid affected people by keeping political differences aside. Addressing Congress members via video conferencing, Rao said that with the country facing an onslaught from the second wave of the pandemic, the focus should be on saving people’s lives. Ironically, Congress workers were summoned and questioned by Goa police while supplying oxygen tanks to patients at Goa Medical College (GMC). State Congress president Girish Chodankar accused chief minister Pramod Sawant of stooping to a new low during the ongoing health crisis. “Try to save as many lives as possible. We need to keep politics aside as advised by our leader Rahul Gandhi and all of us need to focus on fighting Covid,” said Rao during the video conference with local office bearers. Rao asked the Congress team to work out other alternatives to reach out to the people in distress Chairperson of Congress’ Covid control room Dr Pramod Salgaonkar and Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar, who has set up a Covid-19 helpline, have been asked to coordinate and combine their efforts. Congress youth workers have found that in many government hospitals Covid-19 patients are made to sleep on floors, chairs and stretchers. Mardolkar mentioned the sheer number of distressed calls that the helpline has been receiving and also cited the lack of response from government helplines. Chodankar has warned Goa police and the BJP government not to harass Congress volunteers who are providing oxygen to patients. “Stooping so low is cheap and inhuman politics. Like Congress, many NGOs are also providing life support to hundreds of patients. It’s our duty when the government of the day fails,” Chodankar said. He also challenged Sawant to join GMC doctors in treating patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-workers-told-to-focus-on-covid-relief/articleshow/82335279.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police suspect the baby’s mother might have died a couple of days ago. Their neighbours realised she had died when a foul smell started emanating from the house. Fearing Covid, they did not dare to help the boy, who starved for at least two days. The two women police constables — Sushila Gabhale and Rekha Vaje — took charge of the baby. They fed him milk and biscuits. After the boy regained his senses, he was taken to a hospital. “The boy tested negative for Covid-19. According to the directives of the Child Welfare Committee, we have shifted him to a childcare home,” senior inspector Mohan Shinde of the Dighi police said. “The reason behind the death of the baby’s mother is not known,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/baby-found-lying-next-to-dead-mom/articleshow/82337277.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa loses two of its cultural ambassadors to Covid-19||PANAJI: Over the last two days, Thursday and Friday, Goa lost two of its well-known cultural ambassadors to Covid-19, with the demise of Konkani Sahitya Akademi award winning poet Prakash Padgaonkar and musician Yogiraj Naik Borkar. Padgaonkar was known for his distinct style of Konkani poetry in a writing career spanning over four decades and had won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1986 for his publication ‘Hanv Monis Ashwatthamo’. In 2007, the Goa government presented him with ‘Rajya Sanman’ for his contribution in the field of literature at the national level. This was followed by the State Cultural Award for Cultural Excellence in 2009-10. Padgaonkar’s poetry was also the subject of doctoral research at the Goa University. He also won the Konkani Bhasha Mandal award twice for his work ‘Uzvaddachim Pavlam’ and ‘Vascoyan’. The poet also won the Best Book Award (2005) of the Dr TMA Pai Foundation, Manipal, for ‘Vhaunti Nhai Kallachi’. On the other hand, Yogiraj Naik Borkar was an accomplished sitar player and represented the young generation of Indian classical musicians in Goa. He trained initially under guru Kareem Khan in the ‘Itawa Gharana’, a style that lays strong emphasis on rhythm along with melody. His grandmother Pirozbai was the disciple of legendary maestro of Agra Gharana Ustad Nanhe Khan and she initiated Borkar in to Hindustani Classical Music. Borkar had been performing professionally from the age of 15 at prestigious national level classical music festivals. He had composed more than 50 songs in Marathi and Konkani, winning many accolades for them. He has successfully conducted many programs of fusion music, blending pure Hindustani Classical music with Jazz, pop and rock music. “Goa has lost renowned sitar player Yogiraj Naik. It’s a great loss to the world of music. Heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family. May his atma attain sadgati,” tweeted AAP’s Rahul Mhambre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-loses-2-of-its-cultural-ambassadors-to-covid-19/articleshow/82335309.cms||---
---||Business||Tech companies set up biz continuity plans||BENGALURU: Tech companies’ Covid war rooms are working around the clock as the number of distress calls from employees seeking help — many of whom have been infected by the coronavirus — have increased. Companies have increased insurance cover, set up Covid helplines, home quarantine facilities and mental wellness programmes for employees and their families. They have activated shadow IT teams and business continuity plans (BCPs) to ensure work does not get disrupted. Goldman Sachs’s technology and business services centre said it has been focused on potential disruption risks and maintained a map of critical functions and related business continuity plans, which were adapted to the Covid situation in 2020. Accenture said it has the agility to transfer work across its network to help its people in India while continuing to meet the needs of its clients. An Accenture employee, who requested that he not be named, said the company has had a backup plan since last year. Wipro has formed a Covid global crisis management task force comprising members from cross-functional teams, which focuses on governance, people safety and wellbeing, customer delivery, facility readiness and business continuity. “For employees engaged in critical projects, we have arranged accommodation either at our guest houses or in hotels close to our facilities,” the company said. Kishor Patil, co-founder and CEO of KPIT, said 3% of its people globally have been affected over the past year. “We have allocated more people for projects so that we are able to manage client deliverables,” he said. The company has over 6,000 employees. Persistent Systems CEO Sandeep Kalra said the active number of cases may be in the range of 200-250 now. “Many people who have gone through it have recovered from it,” he said. Sindhu Gangadharan, MD of SAP Labs India, said the company’s crisis management team is working around the clock to answer employees’ questions and clarifications. IBM said it was covering medical treatment of its employees and their dependents under Corona Care Insurance for up to Rs 5 lakh. Accenture has launched a Home Care Service for employees and their family members experiencing symptoms and are under quarantine or are awaiting hospitalization. The assistance package includes medical care and advisory services for the 14-day quarantine period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tech-companies-set-up-biz-continuity-plans/articleshow/82337282.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

It has also asked them not to follow their usual practice of partially freezing accounts up to May 31, if KYC is not updated. In its letter, SBI said that in cases where KYC is due, the bank can update records based on documents received from customers through post or registered email ID. The communication by the country’s largest bank followed a tweet from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who had flagged her ministry’s departments on the issue raised by a journalist. Banks usually ask customers to update their KYC once every 10 years for low-risk customers, once every eight years for medium-risk and every two years for high-risk customers. The categorisation according to risk depends on the value and frequency of transactions. Salary accounts are usually safe. The move will benefit thousands of customers who have found their accounts frozen for want of KYC amid the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-will-not-freeze-accounts-if-kyc-is-not-updated/articleshow/82337287.cms||---

In absolute numbers, fatalities have increased nearly 200%—from 166 in the first week of April to 490 in the last week. Compared to March (215), there is a near seven-fold rise in April (1479). BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told TOI, “We are looking deep into that with state task force experts.” The rise was also seen in case fatality rate (CFR), which means deaths in confirmed cases. From 0.24% in the first week of April, it rose to 0.46% in the second, 0.63% in the third and 1.27% by the fourth week. Read AlsoMore global records fall: Daily Covid cases hit 4 lakh, April count 69 lakhCovid's cruellest month yet in India ended with another global record, as daily cases crossed an unprecedented 4 lakh on Friday, while a staggering 69 lakh new infections were detected in the country during April, the highest tally for any month so far. The death toll from the pandemic in AprilFormer KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee, confirmed that the CFR has risen and may continue to remain high for a while. “As we see a gradual decline in active cases over the next few weeks, the death rate too will come down but after a little more time,” he said. A high number of deaths were expected in the third and fourth week of April since the first and second weeks saw a huge surge in cases, 68,165 and 62,153 respectively. Epidemiologist Giridhara Babu said there is always a lag time between a surge and casualties. “A patient usually stays in ICU for 14 days before he recovers or dies. Hence, a surge in deaths is seen weeks after cases start declining,” he said, adding that the fatality rate in the second wave is higher than the first one. Dr Supe said about 10% fatalities are of those under 45 years. Read AlsoMaharashtra: Month ends with the highest Covid case addition in 30-day periodApril ended on a worrying note for Maharashtra with 17.8 lakh new Covid-19 cases and 13,835 deaths, highest monthly addition so far.Deaths could further rise as numbers get reconciled. Ward officials said they are being informed about a greater number of mortalities from their ward in the recent past. "We were informed of almost 25 deaths that were previously unreported in the past 3-4 days," said one officer. Another said this was expected. "When the cases were at its peak earlier this month, getting ICU and ventilator beds was difficult. Treatment in severe cases may have got delayed," he said. The incharge of a Covid hospital said many may have died at home, directly or indirectly due to Covid, and the April toll would be much higher. Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, however, said 60% of deaths in his hospital were citizens of the wider MMR region. “At least 40% of our admissions are MMR residents and 60% deaths have been among them. Deaths in KEM rose from 13 in January, 8 in February, to 32 in March to 59 in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-april-deaths-raise-an-alarm-trend-may-persist-for-a-while/articleshow/82337305.cms||Richa Pinto

While the state has performed better than several states in terms of vaccine wastage, it had received only around 46 lakh doses till April 28. Maharashtra leads the charts for vaccines supplied to states with 1.63 crore vaccine doses received, followed by Uttar Pradesh with 1.37 crore doses. Apart from Maharashtra and UP, Rajasthan (1.36 crore); Gujarat (1.29 crore); and West Bengal (1.13 crore) are the only states to have received over one crore doses so far. Karnataka is close with 98.47 lakh doses received so far. Andhra Pradesh has received over 65 lakh doses while Tamil Nadu too has received a similar amount. Telangana is far behind compared to its southern counterparts. Delhi — one of the epicentres for Covid-19 — has only received 38 lakh doses so far, has a vaccine wastage of around 3.5 per cent. Except 10 states, of which one is Telangana, other states are not likely to receive supplies in coming days. Currently, UP has the highest number of doses in stock with 11 lakh, followed by Bihar with eight lakh doses and Maharashtra with seven lakh doses. Barring these states, none of them have stocks over 1.5 lakh doses. Going by current stock figures, it is unlikely that states will be able to complete their free vaccination drives for persons over 45 in next one month.

Though he has recovered now, his sufferings are far from over. Since Wednesday Tiwari has been running pillar to post in search of his father Maharanidin (65), who is missing from the Covid hospital at New Civil Hospital (NCH). No one at the hospital has a clue about Maharanidin whereabouts. Maharanidin, a security guard in one of the high-rises in Bhatar, was admitted to NCH after he tested positive for Covid-19 on April 9. Till April 12, Tiwari personally visited the hospital and inquired about his father at the helpdesk. “They told me that his condition is stable. On April 12, I too tested positive and was home quarantined,” Tiwari told TOI. Tiwari lives with his father in Godadara while his other family members are in native Prayagraj of Uttar Pradesh. “I used to inquire about my father over the phone at the helpdesk and they told me that his oxygen level is normal. They earlier informed me that he was recovering but since April 17 they have no updates,” said Tiwari. After recovering from Covid-19 and as his quarantine period got over Tiwari came to the hospital on Wednesday. The hospital officials told him that they don’t know where his father is. The helpdesk even informed Tiwari to contact police. Tiwari visited offices of the medical superintendent and other officials in NCH but he did not get any answer. He also went to Khatodara police station where cops told him to search and come back if his father was still untraceable. Despite several attempts Dr Ragini Verma, medical superintendent, was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/65-yr-old-positive-patient-goes-missing-from-surat-hospital/articleshow/82334127.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

At the two crematoriums in Jamshedpur — Subarnarekha and Parvati ghats — at least 80 bodies are being brought in on a daily basis. Officials at Parvati Ghat said although bodies can be brought in till 2pm on a certain day and thereafter one has to wait for a slot the day next, the burning ghat is seeing cremations till midnight. The management at both the places said although there is enough wood for cremation, if the number of deaths swell, the situation may go out of control. They also said one electric furnace each at the two burning ghats is out of order, leading to long queues of dead bodies. Vinod Tiwari of Parvati Ghat said they have ordered 60 tonne wood as everyday 15 tonne wood is required to burn the dead bodies. The capacity of each electric furnace is 15 to 20 bodies per day but now the numbers have multiplied to a great extent, so people have no option but to opt for wood furnaces leading to a greater demand for wood. Mohan Aich, a family member of a deceased person, said he had to wait for more than 12 hours to perform the last rites as the queue of bodies was huge at the burning ghat. Notably, last year after the outbreak of the pandemic, people living in the city and outskirts had demanded for another crematorium. “Although assurances were given even by the health minister, till date nothing has materialised,” said Ramesh Singh a family member of a deceased patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/steel-city-crematoriums-overflow-with-bodies-as-cov-deaths-rise/articleshow/82333875.cms||---

Chakkan Bhuiyan, a resident of Karma Basariyan village, was returning home from Chouparan on his motorcycle with his wife when he was allegedly intercepted by policemen around 8pm on Thursday. “The policemen asked my husband why he was out on the streets and violating lockdown rules. But before he could answer, the cops started beating him. Owing to the thrashing, he died on the spot,” the deceased’s wife said. Bhuiyan’s widow said they were returning from a Chouparan community health centre (CHC) after visiting a doctor as she was having a few health issues. The Chouparan CHC is five kilometres from Karma Basariyan village. The incident occurred near the village, the deceased’s wife said. Notably, during the ongoing lockdown, which has been termed health safety week, citizens are allowed to step out of their homes to purchase groceries, vegetables, interstate movement, getting themselves vaccinated for Covid-19 and seeking medical consultations for other ailments. Bhuiyan’s body was taken to the Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital (HMCH) for autopsy on Friday. After Bhuiyan’s death, angry locals blocked the road till late in the night and demanded punishment for the guilty police personnel. Hazaribag SP Karthik S said on Friday, “A magistrate-level inquiry committee has been set up this morning to probe Bhuiyan’s death. I have spoken to Barhi SDO Kumar Tara Chand about the incident. If it is proved that Bhuiyan died due to the beatings of the police personnel, then stern action will be taken against the guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hbag-farmer-out-to-get-wife-treated-beaten-by-cops-dies/articleshow/82333768.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Stick to posts till last vote is counted: Mamata Banerjee to TMC||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday met all Trinamool Congress candidates and poll agents online and urged them not to leave counting centres till the last vote was counted. Saying the party would “return with a comfortable majority”, Banerjee told leaders in an internal meeting not to be swayed by initial trends and not to leave their posts before the counting process was completed. Indicating that BJP might try to play “mind games” and provoke them to leave counting centres early, she reportedly urged Trinamool leaders and workers to insulate themselves from the barrage of information on trends and “focus” on counting till the last vote was counted. In the meeting, which included senior Trinamool leaders, Banerjee did not refer to exit poll indications. It was MP Abhishek Banerjee who broached the subject, saying almost all exit polls had given a clear edge to Trinamool but the party, he reportedly said, would do better and be able to undo the reverses of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in north Bengal and south Bengal’s Jangalmahal districts. The CM at one point reportedly said she wasn’t even looking at a simple majority but hoped the party would inch close to two-thirds majority or 196-seat mark. She was quoted by party candidates as saying that “this is the final leg of the battle. And we cannot for a moment let our guard down. We cannot afford any lapses”. From the beginning of the meeting, Banerjee repeatedly underscored the importance of the counting day ritual — report to counting centres at least one hour before counting begins at 8am, and sign form 17C only after checking all details. She told party candidates that initial counting of postal ballots might throw up misleading trends. She further said seats where Trinamool trailed in 2019 might show the party trailing again but it would pick up pace in later rounds. She repeatedly asserted she was confident the party had performed much better than in 2019, pointing out that even then the party had a clear lead and a majority. CM Banerjee also announced two party helpline numbers for counting day that would be monitored by senior leaders, including her. Banerjee, who contested from Nandigram, is likely to remain in Kolkata while her chief election agent, Abu Sufiyan, will be heading a team of counting agents in Haldia. He was not available for comment. Banerjee told party leaders that if need be, they should go to counting centres with paper and pencils to tabulate votes separately.
