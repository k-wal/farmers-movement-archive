---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Two Guntur GGH staff dismissed, 1 suspended||GUNTUR: Two employees of Guntur GGH were dismissed from service by hospital superintendent Dr N Prabhavathi on Tuesday after they were found demanding bribes from family members of Covid-19 patients for securing them admission in the hospital. The orders were issued as per the instructions of joint collector P Prasanthi. According to information, B Srinivasa Rao, working as male nursing orderly, was found demanding bribes to secure admission to Covid-19 patients. He was initially placed under suspension on Monday, and was dismissed from service after the GGH superintendent went through the visual evidence provided by the victims. A security guard, identified as Srihari, was also dismissed for demanding bribe from patients. A junior assistant, identified as Nagaraju, has been put under suspension. “There is no question of sparing anyone if he or she is found to be indulged in corrupt practices. It is inhumane to harass patients and their kin when people are struggling with the pandemic,” Dr Prabhavathi said. Meanwhile, hospital assistant director Nageswara Rao has been relieved from his duties as per the instructions of the joint collector. Rao was shifted from the GGH for showing negligence during preparation of merit lists for recruitment of nurses during the first wave of Covid-19 last year. Though the government had transferred him from the GGH, he continued in service after securing a stay from the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/two-guntur-ggh-staff-dismissed-1-suspended/articleshow/82557591.cms||MN Samdani

The government on Tuesday deputed special chief secretary Karikal Valaven to Tamil Nadu, special chief secretary Anantha Ramu to Karnataka and retired IAS officer and Pollution Control Board (PCB) chairman AK Parida to Odisha. They have been asked to stay in the states allocated to them until further instructions. Interestingly, the three officers are natives of the states allocated to them. “The Centre has allocated Liquid Medical Oxygen(LMO) to the state from eight manufacturing plants in the neighbouring states. The most critical issue in LMO management is the turnaround time of the tankers carrying LMO and providing a green corridor to those tankers up to the hospitals. For ensuring the above, it is important to have constant coordination with the respective neighbouring state governments. Keeping above in mind, the government decided to appoint special officers to achieve better coordination,” said chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das. Director General of Police Gautham Sawang has been asked to deploy a team of police personnel at the eight LMO manufacturing plants in the neighbouring states so that the turnaround time is minimised. The DGP was also asked to create green corridor passage for the oxygen tankers from the LMO plant locations to the state border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-special-officers-to-handle-oxygen-transportation-from-neighbouring-states/articleshow/82558650.cms||MN Samdani

Besides, he also offered a financial assistance of Rs 1,000 for two months to each daily wage earner. In a series of tweets, the LG office said, “Senior citizens who have lost only earning member of the family will be provided special pension for life… Instalments of social welfare schemes like old-age pension and PMAY, MGNREGA and other welfare schemes will be released immediately.” Another tweet said: “At a time when this global pandemic has rendered daily workers jobless, the Government has decided to provide Rs 1,000 per month to all registered construction workers, ponywalas, palkiwalas, pithuwalas for the next two months.” “Our biggest priority is to defeat this pandemic. I urge all of you to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated. We will soon prevail together over this pandemic,” the LG said in yet another tweet. In these challenging times, old-age homes and orphanages will be extended all possible support from the government, including rations, etc., the LG said. The J&K government has also decided to reach out to every family, who have suffered due to the pandemic, to provided them with financial assistance for self-employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-lg-offers-special-aid-to-covid-hit-families/articleshow/82559514.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Villagers caught in the crossfire were safely evacuated after the joint team of the police, Army and CRPF paused the operation for some time to ensure there were no civilian casualties. The 4am encounter took place after security forces zeroed in on a house at Sheikhpora village in the Vailoo area of Kokernag, based on intelligence inputs about the presence of three Lashkar terrorists there. "The trio had been given the opportunity to surrender, but they chose to retaliate. All three were killed in the ensuing encounter," a police spokesperson said. The slain terrorists were identified as Ilyas Ahmad Dar alias Sameer of Kokernag, Ubaid Shafi alias Abdullah of Batamaloo in Srinagar and Aqib Ahmad Lone alias Sahil of Khandaypora in Kulgam. "As per police records, they were all part of various attacks on security forces and security establishments." IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar tweeted that Ubaid Shafi was involved in the terror attack on the house of a BJP functionary at Aari Bagh in Srinagar's Nowgam on April 1. A cop identified as Rameez Raja was killed in that attack. An AK-47 rifle, two pistols and other incriminating materials were found at the site of Tuesday's encounter. The police said family members of the slain militants would be allowed to attend their funeral after the completion of medico-legal formalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-trio-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/82560354.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The minister asked the Bombay high court to probe goings-on at GMC. “Due to interrupted supply of oxygen, we feel that between 2am and 6am many people are dying in GMC. There is a need for an inquiry directly by the high court. There are petitions pending before it. The HC can appoint an expert committee to find out why deaths are happening between 2am and 6am and come out with a white paper," he said. For days, TOI has reported a nightly drop of oxygen that often leaves patients gasping for breath. With no help forthcoming, doctors and nurses have been forced to improvise, sometimes hooking up to three patients to a single oxygen cylinder. Rane’s statement came on a day that Goa recorded 75 Covid deaths, its highest-ever single-day tally, of which 48 patients died at GMC. "On Monday, our requirement was about 1,200 cylinders, but we received 400 cylinders. The hospital has been facing a shortage of oxygen supply," the health minister said. But chief minister Pramod Sawant, who visited the GMC’s Covid wards earlier in the day, claimed there was enough oxygen and said the crisis was due to "mismanagement". "It looks like the oxygen doesn’t reach the patients. I will fix responsibility and streamline it," he said. Sawant said that there was a delay in the allocation of cylinders. "To solve this problem, 600 oxygen cylinders (up from 400) will be made available to GMC, and we will make this available within 24 hours," he said. He said GMC requires 55 oxygen trolleys (each trolley provides 336 cubic litres of oxygen). "To fast-track the movement of oxygen trolleys, we have called experts and drivers on Wednesday to clear this bottleneck. This will stop oxygen pressure drops and the issue will be solved," he said. Sawant, who met government doctors late Tuesday night, said the state government has also decided to install a 20MT liquid oxygen tank at GMC within eight days. "I will personally monitor the installation," Sawant said, even as he asked GMC to transfer 150 patients to the new super-specialty block to reduce the load on the state’s premier hospital. "Once the oxygen tank is full and another 200 Covid patients are shifted to the super-specialty block, there will be less demand for oxygen at GMC," he said. Earlier in the day, after visiting the Covid wards, Sawant blamed Scoop Industries, the company contracted by the government to supply oxygen to the state’s public hospitals, for the delay in supplying oxygen. "If he (Scoop Industries owner) is bound by a 10-year contract to supply oxygen, how can he now dump responsibility on the state government? I will not tolerate such acts which will lead to deaths of Covid patients due to oxygen shortage," Sawant said. Oxygen supply through GMC’s central line has been erratic for weeks, putting the lives of patients who are on non-invasive ventilation, those with severe Covid pneumonia and those with acute respiratory distress, at risk. Among the slew of measures taken by the government last month for Covid management was the appointment of three IAS officers as nodal officers to maintain the supply of medical oxygen to hospitals. "It is their responsibility to find out what the problem is and inform the CM about it. I will also talk to the CM to learn where the mismanagement is happening. As health minister, I want to know about it," Rane said. The health minister said the chief minister was "misinformed" but did not elaborate. Sawant said there should be a ward-wise in-charge to look after oxygen supply to patients as nurses were unable to handle it. "I have understood all the problems and I will come out with a 100% solution to the problem within one day," Sawant claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/26-die-due-to-oxygen-shortage-at-goas-premier-government-hospital/articleshow/82562505.cms||Bindiya Chari

However, deaths from the virus surged again on Tuesday to 4,205, the highest daily toll recorded in the country till date. The previous highest was 4,187 reported on Friday. The total death toll from the pandemic in India crossed 2.5 lakh, with the country recording nearly 50,000 deaths in the last 14 days at a daily average of more than 3,528. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe daily case count remained below 3.5 lakh for the second day running, with 3,48,371 fresh infections recorded in the country. Active cases too dipped marginally by 4,000 to settle at 3.71 lakh. While the daily toll in Maharashtra rose to 793 after staying below 600 for two days, at least nine states and Union territories recorded their highest ever deaths in a single day. These included Tamil Nadu, where fatalities rose sharply to 298 from a previous peak of 241. The government said the overall trend of new cases was looking better, citing data from May 6 when India recorded 4,14,188 new cases, to May 7, when it came down to 4,01,078 cases, and May 8 when it touched 4,03,738 and then on May 9 when cases dropped to 3,66,161 and on May 10 when 3,29,942 cases were recorded. On the other hand, states like Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Punjab and Goa are reporting an increase in daily cases. Around 26 states still have over 15% positivity, of which nine are in the 25% plus positivity, indicating the need to persist with containment and various forms of lockdowns. The Centre said it was in constant discussion with these states to take strict measures. The government said there was a need to monitor the trends at the level of districts because even in states showing overall plateauing, there were districts showing a continuous surge. The national positivity rate is around 21% and about 42% (310/734) of the districts are reporting a positivity rate more than the national average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-active-cases-drop-for-3rd-day-but-deaths-touch-record-4-2k/articleshow/82562592.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Pune||Don’t fret if second dose delayed, no need to restart vaccine schedule, say experts||PUNE/ MUMBAI: First-dose recipients of Covaxin don't need to restart their vaccination schedule if the gap between doses goes beyond the recommended 4-6 week interval, a top public health official has said. Experts also stressed that delay in taking a second dose of Covishield or Covaxin does not render the first shot ineffective. An estimated 5lakh in Maharashtra are waiting for the second shot of Covaxin alone. Dr NK Arora, member of the National Committee on Adverse Events Following Immunisation, said recipients should not worry if the second dose is delayed. “We know there are many single-dosers whose second shots have been delayed. They need not be worried. Even if gap between two doses increases to 8-10 weeks, in case of any of the two vaccines, beneficiaries can take the second shot and it will still be effective. There is no need to repeat the vaccine schedule due to a delayed second dose,” he said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Counselling recipients to not panic, immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune said the first dose has already triggered an immune response which does not disappear because of the delay, only that it’s not optimum, and hence the second dose is needed. “A booster (second) dose essentially increases the quality and quantity of the first dose response,” she said, adding that it may be advisable for senior citizens to avoid crowded vaccination centres since there is a real possibility of catching the infection there. Read AlsoAll-time high: India's daily Covid-19 deaths rise to a record 4,205In another grim milestone, India on Wednesday recorded its highest single-day death toll with more than 4,000 deaths in the last 24 hours. The count of daily cases, on the other hand, reported a minor decrease. Deaths from Covid-19 swelled by 4,205 pushing the country's total fatalities to 2,54,197.The first dose remains in the body but also has its own limited half-life. All antibodies produced are proteins that get degraded within the body whether used or not used. “So, the immune response generated by the first dose may possibly start tapering off after 4-5 months,” Bal added. The duration between two Covishield doses was increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks primarily based on data from international trials where after a first dose the immune response was measured until the second dose was given. “In some cases, due to trial related issues, the second dose was given as late as 12 weeks and still the effect of the first dose was pretty much okay,” she added. For Covaxin, such a variation in the duration between first and second dose was not tested in human beings though. “The makers had uniformly tested at the end of four weeks. That's why everybody is recommending booster for Covaxin at the end of 28 days. Theoretically, if there is enough response that lasted for four weeks, maybe it will last up to the fifth week too. But we don’t know that since there is no data,” Bal added. In the UK, recommended gap between two doses of Covishield is 12 weeks, while in Canada, authorities have opted for up to 16 weeks. Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at CMC, Vellore, had told TOI that a recent study by Public Health England (pertaining to the UK variant) has shown 65% protection against symptomatic Covid-19 and 80% against a severe form of the disease after a single dose of Covishield. Dr Arora also reiterated that even if a person contracts Covid after the first dose and takes 6-10 weeks to recover, he/she must complete the vaccination schedule by taking the second dose after the recovery period. Dr Naveen Thacker, executive director of the International Pediatric Association (IPA) and a member of the Gujarat Covid task force, said it is from an immunology perspective that experts suggest a 'minimum' interval, instead of 'maximum', between doses. He said, "irrespective of the vaccine, it is always better to have a slightly longer gap in most cases. In case of Covaxin, the data published so far suggests a minimum interval of four to six weeks, but perhaps a longer gap could be more effective. Either way, those due for their second shots must take it even if it's delayed.” Dr Thacker too said people don't need to get their first shot again if the follow-up is delayed. "For children’s vaccination too, the dictum 'pick up from where one left off' is followed. If repeating a schedule (in case of a delayed second dose) is not done in children - who have a weaker immune response - then it is not recommended for Covid vaccination in adults too," he said. Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state on Covid control, also said the second dose, even if delayed, is effective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dont-fret-if-second-dose-delayed-no-need-to-restart-vaccine-schedule-say-experts/articleshow/82562802.cms||Neha Madaan

In 13 of the 24 states where districts can be split into rural and urban, there are more cases in villages and small towns than in big cities. In the other 11 states, cases are growing faster in rural areas. The data also suggests that as the Covid wave shifts from cities to towns, the underreporting of cases increases. This is because the smaller centres don't do enough tests. Coronavirus: Live updatesWhile one positive result in every 20 tests is considered acceptable, there are many districts where every second test is positive.  Data from Maharashtra shows how the Covid wave has shifted to rural areas. The state averaged roughly 54,000 cases on both April 9 and May 9. But while rural areas had only 32% of the cases on April 9, a month later their share increased to 56%. In UP, rural areas now have 65% of the cases, and in Chhattisgarh their share is 89%. In Karnataka, where cities still have more cases, the share of rural areas has risen from 25% to 44% over a month. Most districts with the highest test positivity rates are also rural. Last week, 17 districts reported positivity rates over 48%. Many of these, such as Nuh, Kalahandi and Rajsamand, are among the least urbanised.

I would never have written such a letter. But looking at the confusion being created by members of Congress, including CMs belonging to the party, I am compelled to pen my thoughts,” Nadda said. “One would wish that while India is fighting Covid-19 with utmost courage, top echelons of Congress would stop misleading people, creating false panic and even contradicting their stands just based on political considerations,” he added. Nadda said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government was putting all efforts in the fight against Covid-19. “Throughout the pandemic, the PM has had consultations with all CMs. Even ex-PM Deve Gowda has acknowledged that,” he added. Referring to CWC resolution that the Modi government was “abdicating” its responsibility on vaccination, Nadda said, “Is there so much of a communication gap between Congress and states it shares power in? In April itself, topmost Congress leaders were calling for ‘decentralisation’ of vaccination.” He said the Covid-19 vaccine made in India didn’t belong to any party or leader, it belongs to the nation, and yet, Congress chose wrong politics rather than doing the right thing. “Your party is doing no favours to itself by opposing lockdowns and then demanding the same, ignoring the Centre’s advisories on the second wave of Covid and saying they didn’t get any information,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-misleading-people-on-covid-jp-nadda-writes-to-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/82563162.cms||---

The Army, for instance, is now finalizing the lease of four advanced Heron Mark-II medium-altitude long-endurance UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) from Israel, while the upgrade of its existing drone fleet takes place, say sources. The Navy is already extensively using two MQ-9B Sea Guardian drones, variants of the iconic armed Predator drones, for long-range surveillance missions over the Indian Ocean after leasing them from a US firm last November. The maritime force also recently issued a request for information (RFI) to foreign companies for the lease of 24 twin-engine armed light utility helicopters, with all maintenance support, for a period of five years. The move has come due to the continuing delay in even launching the long-delayed Rs 21,000 crore ‘Make in India’ project for 111 naval utility helicopters with foreign collaboration to replace the existing fleet of obsolete single-engine Chetak choppers that operate from warships. “The aim is to mitigate short-term capability gaps. Leasing was introduced as a separate provision in the Defence Acquisition Procedure last October. It will cut time delays and initial capital costs,” said an officer. IAF, in turn, is now finalizing the “wet lease” of one A-330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft from France for training purposes. This comes after the force’s repeated attempts to buy six new flight refuelling aircraft (FRA), to extend the strategic reach of its fighter jets, have come to naught. Though IAF overall needs 18 such “force-multipliers”, it is currently making do with just six IL-78 aircraft inducted in 2003-2004. “By leasing at least one FRA, we can save the flying hours of the IL-78s for operational purposes,” said an officer. IAF has also issued a RFI to foreign companies for leasing around 20 basic trainer aircraft for rookie pilots since the long-delayed indigenous HTT-40 aircraft is yet to enter full-scale production. In August last year, the defence ministry had given the initial nod for the Rs 7,600 crore procurement of 106 HTT-40 aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics. The Navy is also looking to lease operational and auxiliary support vessels, ranging from desperately-needed minesweepers to tankers, barges and tugs. It is bereft of advanced mine counter-measure vessels (MCMVs), with its 16-year-old project to indigenously build 8-12 such vessels to detect and destroy underwater enemy mines yet to take off till now. Leasing of “offensive” platforms like fighters or missile systems is, however, not considered to be feasible at present. “Some countries do lease such platforms but they are part of a military alliance like NATO. Though we currently have a nuclear-powered attack submarine (INS Chakra) on lease from Russia, and will get another to replace it soon, India has a strategic autonomy policy,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cash-crunch-forces-military-to-take-equipment-on-lease/articleshow/82563292.cms||Rajat Pandit

Once formed, the cyclone will be named ‘Tauktae’, meaning highly vocal lizard gecko, a name given by Myanmar. The IMD said a low-pressure area was very likely to form over southeast Arabian Sea around the morning on May 14. “It is very likely to move north north-westward across southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area and intensify gradually,” it said, underlining the possibility of rains and squally weather in Lakshadweep and coastal areas of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra. Based on its numerical models, the IMD predicted that the low-pressure area may intensify into a “cyclonic storm” over east central Arabian Sea around May 16 and continue to move north and north-westwards. Some of the numerical models, however, show the possibility of its course towards Kutch areas in Gujarat and south Pakistan while others indicate its movement towards south Oman. “It will be clearer in a day or two,” Sunitha Devi, head of cyclone warning division in IMD told TOI. Issuing its warning, IMD said tidal waves of about one meter height above the astronomical tide was very likely to inundate low lying areas of Lakshadweep Islands on May 15-16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cyclone-may-hit-west-coast-this-weekend/articleshow/82563318.cms||---

The Bihar government said 71 bodies had been retrieved and cremated after autopsies that failed to confirm if the deaths were caused by Covid-19. Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat termed the dumping of bodies in the Ganga “unfortunate” and a matter that must be investigated. Tagging Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath in a tweet on Tuesday, he said, “The Modi government is committed to the cleanliness of ‘mother’ Ganga. This incident is unexpected. The states concerned should take immediate cognisance.” In a series of tweets, Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said the bodies retrieved at Chausa’s Mahadev Ghat on Monday were four to five days old, based on postmortem reports. “The last rites of 71 bodies were performed as per Covid protocol. A net has been placed in the river at Ranighat, bordering UP and Bihar. We’ve advised the UP administration to be vigilant; our district admin is keeping vigil too.” Jha wrote that CM Nitish was “pained” by the tragedy as well as the harm caused to the “purity” of the Ganga. In Buxar, DM Aman Samir maintained that the bodies had been dumped in neighbouring Ghazipur district of UP, a charge vehemently denied by the district administration there. “As the bodies were found there (Buxar), they would know better about their origin,” Ghazipur DM Mangla Prasad Singh said. A search revealed more bodies in UP’s Ballia. There was no official statement till Tuesday evening on the number of bodies found.

In his message, he also said they should all pray in their houses without gathering at one place, and follow all government guidelines on coronavirus. “The spread of infection is taking a horrific turn and people are losing their loved ones due to Covid-19,” he said, adding that at such a time of crisis, every one should come forward to help each other, setting aside all their differences. “When shrouds are being sold more than new clothes, how can we go for festivities? Our Eid will be celebrated in a true sense, when we defeat coronavirus and make our country and the world free from it,’ Khan said.

Presenting a case study of Pune, it said night curfew alone with no restrictions on gatherings has shown less significance in terms of controlling the growth trajectory of daily new cases. The issue of effective restrictions to contain the spread of the infection was discussed by the cabinet secretary in a meeting with states and UTs to review the status of Covid-19. The Centre encouraged states to prioritise on local containment of any specific and well-defined geographical units such as cities, towns, district headquarters, semi-urban localities, municipal wards etc which has been identified for local containment based on cluster of cases. “Local containment is aimed primarily on restricting intermingling of people for a period of 14 days. It was suggested to identifydistricts of concern wherein case positivity is 10% or more in the last one week and bed occupancy is more than 60%. States are asked to appoint a state-level nodal officer to be stationed in these districts for 14 days,” the health ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/curbs-on-mass-gatherings-key-to-checking-spread-government/articleshow/82563510.cms||---

At the outset of the hearing, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for an NGO, pleaded for adjournment as he could not get the relevant documents from his client because of lockdown and some of his staff also got contracted Covid-19 infection. A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari, however, said the case needed to be adjudicated at the earliest and posted it for Friday, asking the petitioner as well as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to place on record all previous orders passed by the court in the case. The SC had in September last year given its final seal of approval to the Char Dham National Highway project to provide all weather connectivity to four holy towns of Uttarakhand, but restrained the Centre from widening roads in the hills beyond five and a half metres, by citing a 2018 circular of the road transport and highways ministry. As the apex court's order affected widening of roads in border areas particularly near China border, the Centre amended the 2018 circular and issued fresh notification in December which will be examined by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/border-roads-case-must-be-decided-at-earliest-sc/articleshow/82564275.cms||---

Besides Deshmukh and other accused, including dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, the agency is likely to summon Singh and record his statement. Waze, according to the CBI’s preliminary enquiry, was reinstated in service after 15 years with the “knowledge” of Deshmukh and was given important and sensitive cases to probe in the city’s crime branch. Sources said Singh’s conduct as police commissioner was also under the scanner as he had full knowledge of Waze’s activities and was instrumental in the latter’s posting as the virtual head of the city’s criminal investigation unit. NCP and Congress, the two allies in Maharashtra’s ruling alliance led by Shiv Sena, called the ED’s move vendetta politics meant to cover up the failures of the Modi government. “Right from Singh’s allegations to the filing of the case by the ED, it is all politically motivated and aimed at defaming him (Deshmukh) by misusing power. It is clear that BJP is playing politics using the CBI, ED and other central agencies,” NCP minister Nawab Malik said. In a letter to the Maharashtra governor and CM Uddhav Thackeray in the last week of March, which coincided with the revelation about Waze’s alleged role in planting explosives in front of industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s Mumbai residence, Singh alleged that the then home minister had set a Rs 100 crore target for Waze and other Mumbai cops, to be raised from owners of dance bars and restaurants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/enforcement-directorate-launches-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-in-extortion-case/articleshow/82564271.cms||---
---||India||In first 11 days, less than 25 lakh aged 18-44 got the jab||MUMBAI: Eleven days since the Centre allowed states to vaccinate their 18-44-year-old population, fewer than 25 lakh have got the shot across the country. Grappling with a vaccine shortage, some states like Kerala haven’t started the drive, while others have been forced to improvise. Maharashtra, the worst-affected state, has opened phase III for its younger population with limited doses and restricted them to those who can book a slot on CoWin. Till May 9, the state has given 4.4 lakh shots. A few other states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, which are towards the top of the leader board, have adopted a more conservative approach by first vaccinating high burden districts. Karnataka started phase III on a small scale from Tuesday. Gujarat is prioritising the 18-44 drive in seven municipal corporation areas of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar and Gandhinagar, and the three districts of Mehsana, Kutch, and Bharuch. CM Vijay Rupani said the selection was based on high Covid incidence at these places. The state has vaccinated 3.09 lakh persons in the last 10 days. Rajasthan, too, initially restricted the drive to 16 of its 33 districts, including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Ajmer, Udaipur, among others. R K Saran, a district official, said this was the modus operandi for the first seven days as doses were limited; they opened it to the entire state from May 8. To ensure equity, they have allowed 50% walk-ins at rural areas. The state has vaccinated over 4.2 lakh till May 10. Vaccination expert Dr Naveen Thacker, who was India’s representative to Gavi (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation), said Gujarat and Rajasthan’s approach seemed more practical in the light of rising cases and vaccine shortage. “Spreading the doses thin across the state may yield little in terms of reducing deaths or severity,” he said. The abrupt decentralisation of vaccine procurement that left states and private centres high and dry has been widely criticised, but Thacker said at least, the states were free to try their own strategies now. Karnataka, which had planned to begin phase III from Monday, could start only from Tuesday for want of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-first-11-days-less-than-25-lakh-aged-18-44-got-the-jab/articleshow/82564298.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Ahmedabad||Trains carried 1,700MT of oxygen from Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat has in the last fortnight dispatched 1,700 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen to various parts of the country on 18 trains, from the Ahmedabad and Rajkot divisions. Four were sent from Ahmedabad and 14 from Rajkot division. Railway officials said that the four trains from Ahmedabad had left for Haryana. One train had gone to Fort Tuglaqabad. Of the four trains from Ahmedabad, two left with eight containers carrying 133MT of medical oxygen while two trains had left with tankers and carried 160MT. The officials said of the 14 trains from Rajkot, some had carried oxygen from Mundra. Railway officials said this was a different experience for the loco pilots. “Usually good trains are given last priority and have to stop at every crossing for passengers trains, but these oxygen trains had got top priority, running before trains of Rajdhani status.” A loco pilot, Sharvesh Sharma, in a note said that in his 21 years of service covering 372km in 6.45 hours was the best speed he could every get for a double-stack container train. Officials said in the coming days they are ready to take up the challenge of supplying oxygen even if it means running such trains at more regular intervals. Officials said while passengers trains have been halted, good trains are still serving the people. Between April 1 and May 10 last year, 5.22 million tonnes of goods were transported. This has increased to eight million tonnes this year. Of the 98 trains run during this period, 23 carried 4,600 tonnes of Covid-19 materials and medicines, while 20 were milk specials trains and 14,000 tonnes of milk was sent from the state. Also 38 Kisan Rail trains were run during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/trains-carried-1700mt-of-o2-from-state/articleshow/82559966.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Raj and eight of his associates were arrested by the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police from different parts of Patna on Monday for allegedly extorting a US-based NRI and at least 40 others in India. An aerospace engineer in New York was forced to pay Rs 1 lakh for one oxygen cylinder and Rs 15,000 for a regulator on May 6 by Raj for supplying the items to the NRI's Covid-19 positive parents in Patna.As per EOU sources privy to Raj's bank statement, several hefty deposits mostly through UPI were made into his bank account with the help of his cellphone number linked to it. “Raj had less than 90 paise in his bank account at the start of April. But at the time he was arrested on Monday evening, more than Rs 8 lakh was lying in it,” the source said on Tuesday, adding, more than Rs 13 lakh was withdrawn within the same period by Raj. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said on Tuesday the call detail records of the nine arrested youths shows that they were receiving and making at least 200 calls per day after the crisis started. He said Raj and others had negotiated with at least 40 to 50 people hailing from several locations across the country and a few even from abroad who were in dire need of oxygen cylinders for their loved ones suffering from Covid-19 in Patna. “Of these, around 10 to 15 people transacted money, including the NY engineer. Rs 21 lakh deposited in his account in the last few days is strongly suspected to be the same money he duped from these people. Raj used to start his negotiation of an oxygen cylinder from Rs 1 lakh,” he said. ADG said after interrogation of the nine arrested youths, it surfaced that Raj was the kingpin of the gang that started operating after the second wave of pandemic hit capitalising on the oxygen crisis. “He was the only person who was receiving money in his bank account. Some of his relatives are in the business of selling hospital items due to which he had contacts with those supplying oxygen cylinders to hospitals,” he said. Khan said using these contacts, he was managing to get large oxygen cylinders periodically for those who were paying him. ADG said EOU is working on gathering further details of the transactions made in Raj’s bank account and is also investigating accounts of the eight other arrested youths associated with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youth-extorted-rs-21l-from-desperate-kin-of-covid-patients-seeking-oxygen/articleshow/82557247.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||AP CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directs collectors to inspect oxygen supply in hospitals||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday directed all district collectors to visit government and private hospitals that are treating Covid-19 patients. Speaking from his Tadepalli camp office, in the backdrop of the oxygen failure in Ruia hospital in Tirupati that claimed 11 lives, the chief minister instructed collectors to inspect the oxygen supply system in hospitals. The chief minister spoke to the collectors through video conference and directed them to have a regular check on the oxygen supply to the hospitals in the state. He also told the police officials to provide green channel for oxygen cylinders in the state from the place of origin to the destination. The officials told the chief minister that a green channel was provided for the oxygen cylinders coming from Odisha and the same would be followed in case of cylinders from other places. The chief minister told the officials that the government had airlifted six oxygen cylinders to Odisha on Monday to avoid transit time. He wanted the police to keep an eye on those cylinders coming from Odisha. The chief minister also told the collectors to keep monitoring the oxygen availability, the supply systems and the transport to every hospital. Meanwhile, the state government is anticipating that oxygen requirement will shoot up by at least 40 per cent by next week. “We can’t imagine what will happen if the tankers arrive a little late. We are tracking the tanker movement to manage uninterrupted supply,” said a senior official. The state is presently pooling around 560 metric tonnes of medical oxygen from different sources while the demand has already touched 550 metric tonnes. “We have already requested the Centre to increase the allocation to 1,000 metric tonnes from the existing 590 metric tonnes. We have urged the Centre to spare more oxygen from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu instead of Odisha in view of logistical troubles,” said Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary (health). The state government is of the view that allocation of oxygen by the Centre is illogical with respect to the distance of the plants and quantities. “RINL wouldn’t be able to supply beyond 100 MT per day after May 15. Hence, we need to ensure additional sources in lieu of RINL up to 100MT,” said a senior official. The official said transporting oxygen from Angul/Rourkela (Odisha) is becoming difficult as it requires a several tankers to be diverted from the existing system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-directs-collectors-to-inspect-o2-supply-in-hospitals/articleshow/82557425.cms||Gopi Dara

Sources said the move was initiated upon request of the state industries department. Uttam Kumar Singh, chief public relations officer of the plant, said in addition to 10 tonnes for hospitals, 20 tonnes of liquid oxygen would be made available to the state government. “The plant has suspended production to save liquid oxygen and also avoid crowding of employees at the plant,” Singh said. He added, “Our production depends on utilisation of liquid oxygen. The plant has 20 storage tanks and we have offered to the state government to utilise them as buffer stock on our premises." Meanwhile, emphasising on the need for expediting vaccination in the age group of 18-44 years, Maharajganj MP Janardan Singh Sigriwal on Monday said the population in this group in the country has been about 59 crore and the responsibility of the country rests on their shoulders. “The country will remain safe only if youths are healthy,” he said, Sigriwal said while reviewing immunisation drive at referral hospital in Banaipur in the district. Saran DM Dr Nilesh Ramchandra Deore people in 18+ age group in Saran district would not be able to get slots on Wednesday due to “technical reasons”. BJP district president Ram Dayal Sharma also visited some immunisation centres on Monday. He said only 50 people at Maker and 48 at Amnour in 18-44 age group were vaccinated on Sunday and Monday. He appealed to the BJP workers to encourage youths to take vaccine shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bela-rail-wheel-plant-offers-10-tonnes-of-oxygen-to-govt/articleshow/82556992.cms||H K Verma
---||Patna||Bodies in river a public health hazard, but won’t spread Covid infection: Experts||PATNA: Even as the disposal of dead bodies of suspected covid victims in the Ganga has rung an alarm bell among the public, health experts and environmentalists do not foresee any remarkable impact on human health. They observe that the Covid-19 virus does not remain in the blood of the infected patients and, hence, it would hardly infect animals and birds feeding on the dead bodies. Noted environmentalist and an expert on Ganga, Ravindra Kumar Sinha, told TOI on Tuesday that the disposal of dead bodies into the river would adversely affect the health of the river ecology by increasing the bacterial load. Even otherwise, cremation of dead bodies, including those of Covid victims, at various Ganga ghats has increased lately, adding to the bacterial load. "The river is already polluted and the recent addition of bacterial load will only add to its pollution level," he said. Sinha, however, asserted that it would not create an adverse impact on the health of the people who have not come in physical contact with the dead bodies. "Even animals and birds feeding on dead bodies are unlikely to be infected with Covid," he added. The Patna Medical College Hospital former superintendent, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, said the disposal of dead bodies of suspected Covid patients in the river is certainly a public health hazard. "Dead bodies are highly contagious and are likely to adversely affect the health of the people directly using river water. But animals and birds feeding on those dead bodies will not be infected with the virus as so far only man to man transfer of the virus has been reported. Covid virus can’t even be transferred through water bodies," he said. Zoological Survey of India’s regional incharge and senior scientist Gopal Sharma admitted that the entire ecosystem would be disturbed. He also apprehended that aquatic animals feeding on these bodies may also be infected with the virus even though not much research has been done so far on this issue. Paediatrician and general physician Arun Shah said water is not the route of transmission of Covid virus. Besides, there is no concrete evidence of transmission of the Covid virus from man to animal or vice-versa. Only droplets and aerosols have so far been found to carry the viral load and infecting people. However, polluted water may cause bacterial infection and affect human health, Dr Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bodies-in-river-a-public-health-hazard-but-wont-spread-covid-infection-experts/articleshow/82557022.cms||B K Mishra

The month’s inflow through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route also remained at an elevated level at Rs 8,591 crore. This compares with the all-time high Rs 9,182 crore in March, and Rs 7,528 crore in February, data from industry trade body Amfi showed. The net inflow for the month was about Rs 92,900 crore. This was also the second consecutive month of net inflows through equity funds, indicating renewed retail investor interest, industry players said. “The flows during April 2021 were driven by liquid, overnight and money market schemes on the fixed income (debt) side, thematic/sectoral schemes in the equity segment, while arbitrage and dynamic asset allocation schemes ruled in the hybrid segments” of the fund industry, Amfi chief executive N S Venkatesh said. According to data released by Amfi, among the debt schemes, liquid funds recorded a net inflow of about Rs 41,500 crore, overnight funds nearly Rs 18,500 crore and money market schemes close to Rs 20,300 crore. On the equity side, thematic/sectoral schemes pulled in about Rs 1,700 crore at the net level, while among the hybrid schemes, arbitrage funds saw net inflows of Rs 7,245 crore. Continuing its strong run, monthly flows through the SIP route remained above Rs 8,500 crore in April. Although the month’s figure was lower than the all-time high recorded in March, which was boosted by spillover of SIP flows from February. Since February was a 28-day month, the SIPs which were to be credited to customer accounts on 29th, 30th and 31th of each month came in to the fund houses in March, industry players explained. According to Union MF CEO G Pradeepkumar, the SIP numbers have remained robust and the addition of SIP folios also have been very healthy. However, he also expects some slowdown in fund flows till the Covid’s second wave recedes. “We expect the flows to pick up pace once the pandemic is brought under control through increased levels of vaccination and other measures.” April’s net inflow data by mutual funds was in line with the current trend of net buying in the Indian market by domestic funds, while foreign funds have turned net sellers. “This trend is quite interesting that domestic investors are showing faith in Indian equities in such times and would benefit from allocations at attractive valuations,” said Motilal Oswal MF head (sales and distribution) Akhil Chaturvedi. Equity funds have witnessed lower redemptions and stable gross flows, “resulting in positive net sales of (about) Rs 3,400 crore…this is a very healthy sign being second month of positive net sales and probably bottoming of negative sales cycle”, Chaturvedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mf-assets-hit-record-level-of-over-rs-32l-cr-in-april/articleshow/82558764.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Saving GIB: Rs 300 crore extra to bury power lines||Gandhinagar: The state government is likely to incur an additional expenditure of about Rs 300 crore for diverting electricity lines to save the habitat of the critically endangered Great Indian Bustards in Kutch district. The Supreme Court had recently directed the Gujarat government to ensure the protection of the birds’ habitat in Kutch, where the world’s largest hybrid (solar and wind) renewable energy (RE) park is coming up. A key source aware of the development said, “We will have to change the execution plan of the hybrid RE park, which will cost about Rs 300 crore.” The source added: “The impact on the consumer will be about 1 paisa per unit only against the claimed 10-15% hike in the project cost due to underground piping.” Hybrid renewable park developers of Gujarat and Rajasthan have recently given an estimate of additional Rs 22,000 crore and have requested tariff hike by 10-15%. “The government will now have underground power lines instead the earlier plan of on-ground poles,” the source said. The companies developing projects in Kutch are Adani Green, ReNew Power, SB Energy, Greenko and the state-run NTPC. The regions that house the projects are also the habitats of the Great Indian Bustards, tall and heavy birds with a wingspan of more than 2 metres. The Gujarat government is yet to carry out the latest census of the birds. However, according to the last available data, there were only six female bustards and no male bustard in Gujarat, reducing the chances of natural breeding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saving-gib-rs-300-crore-extra-to-bury-power-lines/articleshow/82563606.cms||Kapil Dave

Nisaba Godrej, who had taken on the additional role of MD mid-last year after Vivek Gambhir quit, will continue as executive chairperson of GCPL. GCPL said the leadership change will be effective October 18, 2021. The company said Sitapati’s appointment will enable GCPL to leverage his significant experience in building sustainable and profitable businesses to guide the growth strategy in future. Nisaba, daughter of Godrej Group patriarch Adi Godrej, said: “Sudhir’s values-based leadership style also makes him a great fit with the Godrej culture. I look forward to his partnership in unlocking the amazing potential of our company and leading its next phase of growth.” As executive director (foods & refreshments) at HUL, Sitapati is credited to have built the company’s foods and refreshment business as one of the largest in India. He played a pivotal role in the $5-billion merger of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare with HUL. Sitapati has also led popular campaigns like ‘Daag Acche Hain’ for Surf Excel. In his 22-year stint at HUL, Sitapati has led teams across several categories and functions in India, Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa to create significant value for the business. His book ‘The CEO Factory: Management lessons from Hindustan Unilever’ is already in its sixth edition and was recommended by the Harvard Business Review as one of the best reads of 2020. Sitapati was appointed to the HUL management committee as an executive director in 2016, making him one of its youngest members ever. GCPL is part of the over 124-year old Godrej Group, but is less than one-third the size of HUL. The two firms compete in the soaps and hygiene categories. Sitapati said, “I am very inspired by the legacy of the Godrej Group, and GCPL’s purpose of bringing the goodness of health and beauty to consumers across emerging markets. I am excited about working closely with the talented GCPL team to build on the incredible work they are doing and create sustainable, long-term value for our company.” Industry analysts believe the leadership succession at GCPL will have a positive effect on the company with a “professional CEO” back at the top. “We have met Sudhir in HUL Analyst meet and were very impressed with his thought process, marketing acumen and leadership skills. This is a brilliant step in our view as it addresses questions on professionalisation at top at GCPL. HUL’s systems and processes are gold standard for the sector and it will be a very positive development for GCPL,” said Abneesh Roy of Edelweiss Securities. “GCPL stock has hugely underperformed many other consumer names in the past few years and we expect this to potentially reverse. CEO change/Professionalisation can be a game changer in consumer companies,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hul-veteran-sitapati-to-head-godrej-consumer/articleshow/82558982.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Bad bank chief: Government again taps SBI’s talent||MUMBAI: The proposed ‘bad bank’, which will help public sector lenders clean up their loan books, has got its first senior executive — Padmakumar Madhavan Nair. According to sources, Nair, who is chief general manager in charge of stressed assets in the country’s largest bank SBI, will be heading the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC). The appointment comes even as there are indications that public sector banks (PSBs) have a large stressed portfolio. Punjab National Bank’s offer document for a qualified institutional placement shows that stressed loans are around 20%. “The two largest PSU banks after SBI have reported close to 20% overdue loans (not classified as non-performing). If this is the state with large PSU banks, the situation with many other smaller PSU banks could equally be alarming. This clearly shows that PSU banks have borne the brunt of Covid-related disruptions on their borrower segment,” said Macquarie Capital associate director Suresh Ganapathy. The government has been repeatedly tapping into SBI’s talent pool for key appointments in the public sector. Last year, in the aftermath of the Yes Bank failure, SBI’s chief financial officer Prashant Kumar was chosen to head the reconstructed bank. Earlier, the government had appointed ‘State Bankers’ Sanjiv Chadha and Padmaja Chunduru to head two of the larger PSBs — Bank of Baroda and Indian Bank, respectively. In the private sector, Dhanlaxmi Bank is headed by J K Shivan, who was also with SBI. Ahead of last year’s mega-merger of PSBs, the government had appointed senior executives from SBI to head the merging banks to ensure a smooth process. Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, J Packirisamy and Karnam Sekar were appointed to Syndicate Bank, Andhra Bank and Dena Bank respectively. Even among asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), senior positions are held by former SBI officials, including Pallav Mohapatra as CEO of ARCIL, which was the first ARC in India. The NARC is seen as crucial to cleaning up the books of PSBs, which hold a large number of loans that turned bad in the last decade. They also have a large number of loans that are stressed and had to be restructured under the Covid-resolution plan. Experience indicates that a significant portion of restructured loans tends to go into default.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bad-bank-chief-govt-again-taps-sbis-talent/articleshow/82558790.cms||---

Sinha said the lockdown has yielded discernible positive results in the last one week, as not only the transmission chain seems to have been somewhat broken, but also the number of infected persons has also been coming down. The death rate, too, has come down. “The government, in the situation, should not become complacent and lift the lockdown. The situation has been improving, but it has not vastly improved,” Sinha said, and accordingly, favoured its continuance. Noting that the second wave of the coronavirus has been virulent, he said it is “impossible for any government to reach the healthcare to every village, street and house”. Besides, the vulnerability of the state to coronavirus transmission is highly probable, because Bihar has a very high population density, Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/speaker-bats-for-extension-of-lockdown/articleshow/82557181.cms||---
---||Business||Covid lesson: Cos realise no one is well until everyone is||By Sujaya BanerjeeBusiness houses across industries have set up task forces and crisis management teams, especially after employees began reporting sick as the second Covid wave intensified. However, what is incredible to notice is the indomitable spirit of unison, solidarity and collaboration to fight the situation together. The first Covid wave may have overwhelmed many tentative and underprepared organisations. But this time, the resolve and fortitude to stand together and support people & families is unmistakable. In addition to accelerating changes on the business front, the pandemic is also manifesting compassion for all — not only employees but communities too that need help. Colleagues, who may not have asked about each other’s families in the past, are now doing that with sincerity. Many are getting to know the filial and personal challenges their colleagues struggle with — like ageing parents, terminally ill members of family, specially-abled children and schooling from home. The pandemic is making leaders show empathy, de-prioritise or re-arrange tasks in many cases to deploy resources to resolve the crisis. Internal communication has intensified — one-to-many and one-on-one. What we are watching unfold is an incredible social phenomenon of manifesting the spirit of Ubuntu — the acknowledgment of inter-dependence and the spirit of compassion & kindness never witnessed before. The human connectedness is unmistakably apparent even in the most hard-nosed and mercenary. The pandemic continues to be an incredible teacher — this time evoking the spirit of Ubuntu. This is a Zulu phrase that means: “I am because you are”. It underlines the ethic of inter-dependence and the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. The human inter-connectedness is underlined in these times by the fact that no one can feel well when the community is unwell and suffering in a pandemic. Connecting with this universal truth can change our perception of the pandemic and how our inter-connected lives and actions can impact each other. The pandemic is also compelling many business enterprises to seriously invest resources in health, health facilities and mental health support for the first time. Here are some inspiring compassionate actions taken by various organisations during these times: * Companies set up Covid war rooms as they scrambled to source oxygen, medicines and hospital beds for infected employees * Chairmen and CEOs have taken to addressing large town halls, assuring people of no salary cuts during these trying times and urging employees to undertake prevention measures to avoid getting infected * Many companies are offering dial-in counselling and psychiatric help to employees overwhelmed with changes in workplaces and homes that have impacted motivation and morale adversely * Task forces are working on a range of issues, including the work-from-home policy, availability of connectivity, health & well-being across the country, providing PPE kits to employees, masks & sanitisers to family, and coordinating internal communication & collaboration between employees * CEOs have been urging staff to put their health and that of their families above everything else and urging them not to leave homes without masks and maintain safety protocols, while avoiding crowds * Some CEOs have been urging teams to stay alert and continue safety measures to stop the spread, and some others have been role-modelling the right leadership in these times by remaining directly accessible to staff should they need help during this health crisis * With the situation in some parts reeling out of control, leading companies have also started tapping private healthcare providers to conduct on-site and off-campus Covid vaccination drives for the entire workforce, at company cost * It has not been uncommon to offer company-wide paid holidays to prioritise crisis situations or simply to catch one’s breath for those who have stepped in and taken on additional tasks to support colleagues and their families reeling under the new Covid wave. Many are experiencing fatigue and burnout and, given the grim situation, companies are reacting to this by giving people conscious breaks to refresh and rejuvenate * It is not uncommon to have planned cooler conversations and coffee breaks to exchange notes and offer help to each other where possible * Internal communication has been intensified, like it must in a crisis. Many organisations, though, are also following a ‘No Radio’ day once a week to reduce the burden of video & phone calls, and work in the quiet instead, to allow employees to slow down, especially those who are overwhelmed This commitment, solidarity and attempts for creating security are new and much-needed actions to truly integrate the ‘human side of enterprise’ with business. There is an old African saying: “When the beat of the drumbeat changes, the dance steps must adapt”. We are not only seeing new dance steps, we are seeing leaders, teams, customers and the community adapt. On the flip side, we know stress can alter behaviour. It is increasingly not uncommon to see high-performing and high-functioning employees show burnout and confusion during these times. Many organisations are also experiencing a parallel pandemic of short tempers, increased sensitivities and emergence of avoidable conflicts. Kindness and compassion are muscles that can be built and are contagious for de-escalating panic. Kindness is also teachable and an important behaviour to role model as teams face unprecedented obstacles every day. Compassion is not a soft skill — it is a business skill and organisations & leaders are now learning how to integrate compassion with business decisions every day. The American author Henry James had said, “Three things in human life are important: The first is to be kind, the second is to be kind, and the third is to be kind.” The pandemic continues to be a live classroom...

April recorded $7.3 billion in funding across 75 deals compared to $3.8 billion in March 2021 and $1.2 billion in the same month last year, as per data from research firm Venture Intelligence. Rather than a single large deal aiding the surge, a variety of large ticket deals contributed to the rise as global liquidity drove capital towards risky asset classes including startups.At 16 deals, the number of transactions over $100 million in value was at an all-time high, and the month saw eight startups turn unicorns (businesses valued over $1 billion). Blackstone’s investment of $2.8 billion in Mphasis was the biggest deal followed by Swiggy’s $800 million raise from a slew of global investors, and Sharechat’s $500 million funding from Tiger Global and others. However, investors and entrepreneurs TOI spoke to said that though investor optimism remains unchanged by the current Covid spread, deal activity has taken a pause in May due to operational bottlenecks in closing transactions. The second wave, with more virality, has taken a physical and mental toll on startup teams, causing more productivity and operational disruptions than last year. With small teams, most startups are seeing almost 50% of staff directly or indirectly affected by Covid. With stakeholders such as law firms, accountants, investment banks etc. too engaged in the well-being of teams, deal closures have taken a backseat. “The growth in venture capital fund flows continues though it has slowed down a bit in the last 2-3 weeks due to reduced talent attendance and focus by startups on managing employee well-being and safety” Madhur Singhal, managing partner and CEO, Praxis Global Alliance, said. However, there is more capital chasing high 0potential businesses, he said. Ashish Sharma, CEO of venture debt firm InnoVen Capital said that negatively impacted sectors that were just starting to see some demand recovery such as mobility, travel etc. have been hit, but the current wave will further accelerate digital adoption. “There has indeed been a slow down in deal closures past few weeks but that is largely on account of Covid related execution delays and investors continue to remain bullish on the venture asset class,” he said. Arun Natarajan, founder and managing director (MD) Venture Intelligence said the current wave may impact the various tech IPOs announced or being planned if the appetite of local retail and institutional investors takes a hit. “How Zomato’s IPO fares could give an indication to the overall direction of the impact in the coming months,” he said. LetsVenture Plus, a HNI and family offices-focused curated deals platform, used to launch a couple of new deals every week but has not kicked off any new deal in the past three weeks. “Structurally nothing has changed but with the investors’ mindshare not at a point to look at new deals, there has been a slow down,” Nimesh Kampani, president of LetsVenture Plus, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-deals-slow-down-in-may-after-record-apr/articleshow/82558262.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The company informed the BSE that its board will meet on May 19 to consider the “strategic investment” by Mark AB Capital. “A meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled for May 19 to discuss and consider issuance and allotment of equity shares by way of preferential issue to a prospective investor, and NCDs to the lenders,” the notification said. The acquisition is subject to approvals from lenders and other agencies. Shriram group has been finding it tough to manoeuvre the EPC and it has been tottering. For the fiscal ended March 2020, its revenues were Rs 681 crore and incurred a net loss of Rs 81 crore. “EPC business requires patience and long term investment commitment. Mark AB has investments across the globe in EPC companies and we thought its a right fit. They will take over the management and become the new promoters and we will do some hand holding till they get completely rooted in,” said T Shivaraman, MD & CEO of Shriram EPC. EPC businesses in India are in for better times. “Strong order books and better operational preparedness in the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic will swell the top-lines of mid-sized engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies by 15% this fiscal, compared with a nearly 10% fall last fiscal,” Crisil said in a note on Tuesday. EPC companies into construction of roads, commercial and industrial buildings, irrigation, and allied activities indicate as much. The aggregate top-line of these players were Rs 70,000 crore last fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mark-ab-capital-to-take-over-shriram-epc-by-investing-rs-350-cr/articleshow/82558373.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

The plant, with a capacity of 2.6 metric tonnes, has remained closed for the last seven years. Now, in a bid to overcome oxygen shortage in the district, repair works have been initiated to make it functional in the next three days. Once ready, the plant can produce 300 cylinders per day which are sufficient to treat about 200 Covid-19 patients. Arja Srikant, state nodal officer for Covid-19, inspected ongoing repair works on Tuesday. The plant will consume 9,000 units of electricity and 50 kilolitres of water per month.

Officials expect that this may lead to the smooth continuation of the drive for at least recipients of the first dose. In terms of absolute numbers, the state has to give the second dose to nearly 13 lakh people during the first fortnight of May. But the Union government has allocated only 9.17 lakh doses for this period free of cost. To tide over the situation, the state would use its quota of doses procured through ‘other than the Government of India channel’ channel also for inoculating the 45+ age group. As per the quota devised by the Union government, the state can purchase 16.85 lakh doses from manufacturers in May. Meanwhile, cumulative vaccine wastage has come down to negligible numbers. Andhra Pradesh had witnessed about 11% Covid-19 vaccine wastage in the initial days of the vaccine rollout in March, leading vaccine wastage in the country. In fact, when it comes to Covishield, the state administered it to 60.87 lakh people against the 60.6 lakh received doses as of Monday. In all, the state has given the vaccine to 73 lakh people against the 73.49 lakh doses it received from the two manufacturers. However, with the country-wide mass inoculation drive being coordinated through the CoWin platform, certain technical modifications are needed to link the purchased doses and give the jabs from these stocks to those aged above 45. But due to limited stocks from the Union government, vaccine centres running out of supplies has become a common occurrence in AP. As the state wrestles the issue of vaccine shortage, lakhs are scrambling from one site to another to get the second dose. The acute shortage is particularly evident in the case of those who are due for their second dose of Covaxin. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said the Centre gave its approval to use the purchased doses to continue the ongoing drive for people aged 45 and above. “The health department has focused on covering the recipients who are due for their second dose. The changes in the CoWin platform would be completed soon,” said Singhal. With limited production of vaccines being the major hurdle, that too from only two manufacturers, the AP government has decided to float a global tender to explore options to import vaccines from global players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-requests-centre-to-make-changes-to-cowin-for-using-purchased-doses/articleshow/82557407.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Patna||Non-Covid patients suffer as 60% of private clinics keep shutters down||PATNA: The second wave of coronavirus has brought general healthcare facilities to a standstill as many people are either unable to see their doctors or visit their clinics for non-Covid problems. Kusum Mishra, a resident of Kadamkuan, could not consult her physician for thyroid problem for about two weeks. Vijay Kumar of Saguna Mor is waiting for about ten days to get an appointment with his dentist for root canal treatment. He is pulling on with pain killers. There are several such cases of non-Covid patients waiting for the decline in Covid cases as people, particularly those dependent on treatment in private clinics, are among the worst sufferers. “About 60% of the private clinics, especially of ENT, eye and dental care, in Patna are closed,” Indian Medical Association (Bihar) acting president Dr Ajay Kumar said on Tuesday. He said, as many of the doctors, their family members or clinic staff became infected, they had no option but to down their shutters. Another reason of closure was the fear of getting infection from patients reaching them without Covid test reports. That is why even those continuing their practice have restricted it only for emergency patients, he said. Indian Dental Association (Bihar) president Dr Mohit Kumar said over 90% of dental clinics in Patna are shut, mainly because their doctors or staff tested positive. Dr Sushma Singh, a gynaecologist, said the OPD service was closed and only normal or caesarean deliveries of non-Covid patients were being done in her clinic. “In case of the expecting woman testing Covid positive, we refer them to PMCH or AIIMS-Patna for delivery purpose,” she said. Dr Vivek Kumar, who runs an ENT clinic, said he entertained only emergency patients like for removing a coin or a large grain stuck in the throat of children or acute ear infection. He said patients were also avoiding clinics if there is no emergency. Dr V K Pandey, a paediatrician, has kept his childcare clinic closed for the past 20 days after he got infected and went in home isolation. He said even the clinic staff were hesitant to work, fearing infection from the guardians accompanying their children to clinics. Dr Mukesh Kumar, a physician, said his clinic was open, but most of the patients were suspected Covid patients with fever, cough and headache. Similar is the situation for eye clinics. “We have suspended routine eye check-up and elective surgeries for the time being,” said Dr Satya Praksh Tiwari. “The more concerning symptoms were of black fungus infection spreading to eye region with signs of ptosis and loss of vision. I examined four patients with similar symptoms from different districts. They had recovered from Covid recently,” said Tiwari. Another ophthalmologist, Dr Shalini Sinha, said her clinic was closed for two weeks and patients were seeking advice over the phone. The clinic of Dr Shivam Anand has also been closed for two weeks as the doctor himself went in home isolation after being tested positive. However, there was a long queue of suspected Covid patients in the clinics of radiologists, mainly for HRCT test. A radiologist, Dr Kumar Rahul, said 95% patients reaching the diagnostic centre were for HRCT test to know the level of lungs infection. “We had never seen so many people reaching here from far places for HRCT test,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/non-covid-patients-suffer-as-60-of-pvt-clinics-keep-shutters-down/articleshow/82557147.cms||VK Tripathi

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Singhal said that the Union government has recently increased the daily oxygen quota for Andhra Pradesh to 590 metric tonnes. “But we are currently drawing all the 590 metric tonnes a day. On the other hand, the demand is only increasing with each passing day. Any delay in transportation or time wastage at the plants would make things complicated for the Covid-19 patients on oxygen at hospitals. We want to make sure of an efficient supply system and fast turnaround time to see no interruptions in oxygen supply at the hospitals. These three senior officers would monitor things from the oxygen originating states and negotiate for quick delivery with the local officials, if there are any logistical or technical challenges. These officers would stay there for the next two weeks,” said Singhal. Singhal added that the state health department is closely monitoring the oxygen supply, transportation, distribution and consumption. “Andhra Pradesh is witnessing a tight position in terms of oxygen supply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/officials-to-track-oxygen-supply-from-other-states/articleshow/82557453.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Nuggets on optimism from spiritual gurus||LUCKNOW: To keep people motivated during the pandemic, the Covid Response Team (CRT) has started a five-day lecture series, ‘Positivity unlimited’. It began on Tuesday, with spiritual guru Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev and Jain Munishree Pramansagar urging people to stay positive in Covid times. On Wednesday, spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar, philanthropist Azim Premji and social worker Nivedita Bhide will be the main speakers. The CRT, an initiative of the civil society with multiple stakeholders, including religious, spiritual, business, philanthropic and social organizations, has been set up to spread positivity. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and other organizations, too, are part of the lecture series which will be available at over 100 media platforms every day from 4:30pm till May 15. RSS is also organizing online sessions with doctors for the benefit of Covid patients. People can log on to the RSS Facebook page to seek the expert’s advice. RSS functionary Prashant Shukla said, “Anyone can click on the link and listen to doctors and other speakers live.” In villages, where seeking consultation with doctors is a big challenge, online sessions can be of immense help. RSS workers are also collecting medicines from government hospitals and other sources and distributing it among the needy. To keep a vigil on the Covid situation in villages, Sangh has directed its volunteers and office-bearers to remain connected with villagers in every mandal through WhatsApp groups. With the help of such groups RSS volunteers are forwarding vital information regarding availability of doctors, ambulance service, etc, to villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nuggets-on-optimism-from-spiritual-gurus/articleshow/82562115.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Patna||Many experience Covid aftereffects||PATNA: Many coronavirus survivors are experiencing complications such as respiratory and cardiac issues, chest pressure and fungal infections, forcing them to return to hospitals for further treatment. Experts at different health facilities claimed that more than 85% people are returning to hospitals with post-Covid pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissues) and hypoxia (lack of oxygen in the blood). Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, told this newspaper that hypoxia can be caused by pneumonia, which destructs alveoli of the lung and hampers the gases exchange. “Carbon dioxide accumulates and less oxygen available in the blood causes hypoxia, which damage lungs and other tissues in the body. We are witnessing these symptoms in 90% patients. This was not the case in the first wave of pandemic and it is also a challenge for the hospital where to keep these patients facing respiratory problems,” he said. Pneumonitis and hypoxia apart, people are also coming with symptoms like myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle, reducing heart’s ability to pump) and tachycardia (fast heart rate), said Dr Sanjeev. “If a person experienced any of these symptoms after recovery, s/he should contact the doctor immediately. As far as the fungal infection known as mucormycosis is concerned, it was seen in two recovered patients at AIIMS-P,” he said. NMCH medical nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, said many recovered patients are coming with severe shortness of breath and hypoxia. “Most of the recovered patients are those who suffered moderate to severe symptoms of Covid-19. There are also some patients having post-Covid symptoms like fainting, loose motion, psychological issues, cold and cough,” he said. NMCH has also detected the rare fungal infection in a few patients, who suffered from severe Covid-19 symptoms. Dr Sinha believes that the cause of rare fungal infection is likely to be the use of high doses of cortisone and antibiotics for prolonged period, non-sterilised humidifier and ventilators (with BiPAP). “These infection was seen only in such patients who were severely-ill with Covid,” he added. Dr Ajay Arun, PMCH nodal officer for Covid-19, said 5 to 10% of those recovered from Covid faced such complications. “Hypoxia is common in most of the cases, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including asthma, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These patients require oxygen support even after getting cured. There were also few cases of mucormycosis,” he said. Dr Sunil Kumar, secretary of India Medical Association (Bihar) opined that those who recovered from Covid infection should take extra precaution for 2-3 weeks. “Steam inhalation should be taken thrice a day and proper diet should be maintained by these people. Breathing exercise and proning is also important while bronchodilator on doctor’s prescription can be used by them to avoid post-Covid complications,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-people-experience-post-cov-complications/articleshow/82557420.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||India Inc adapts to avert labour woes||NEW DELHI/ MUMBAI: The rampaging second wave of the Covid pandemic has dented the manufacturing sector, with some industries facing a labour shortage. But a majority of them are adapting to the new situation by ensuring that existing workers are looked after and the production cycle does not get affected significantly. Most industries and experts agree that the impact on labour mobility is less severe in the second wave compared to the first one when everyone was caught unawares. “This time it’s different because the lockdown is not pan-India and people haven’t panicked as much. They also know that now the virus is spread across the country. It’s there in the villages and small towns as well. Last year, all the workers who had migrated back to their homes lost out on livelihoods. This year, they are staying back,” said CIEL HR Services CEO Aditya Mishra. “In real estate, however, while commercial work is going on, residential projects are on hold due to subdued consumer sentiment and this is also where there is a labour issue,” said Mishra. Data also shows that the manufacturing sector is holding up despite the localised lockdowns. The largely tracked PMI manufacturing survey showed it was 55.5 in April — largely unchanged from the previous month although orders and production rose at their slowest pace in eight months. Economists and agencies have shaved a few percentage points off their optimistic GDP growth estimates made earlier. But the country is still projected to grow in double digits with the localised lockdowns having a muted impact so far. Experts said that, compared to the first wave, the interstate mobility of labour has not led to any major crisis-like situation currently. “Most of the internal migrants stayed back in the states of destination due to their experience during the long national lockdown in the first wave. In any case, we have only state-wise lockdowns now compared to the national lockdown last year,” said Irudaya Rajan, chairman of the Kerala-based International Institute of Migration and Development (IIMAD). The March 2020 lockdown was dominated by the migrant crisis, which prompted the government to unveil measures to ensure free food and other assistance. The focus of the authorities in the second wave has been on saving lives and meeting the huge challenge to the health sector posed by the coronavirus. Companies too are rolling out vaccination drives and making sure their workforce are comfortable to keep the factories running, and are adapting to new realities. “Last year was a different situation. There was a national lockdown, fear and panic due to a scenario that humanity had not experienced ever. As of now, there is no such problem. We are taking care of the workers and we have also had a vaccination drive, systems & processes for Covid management, etc, and full salaries are ensured. Such measures are reassuring for the workers as well,” said an RPG Group spokesperson. But the MD of ArcelorMittal/Nippon Steel India, Dilip Oommen, admitted that the company was facing a shortage of labour due to migration of workers. “However, our facilities are running at 100% capacity,” he said. Automobile giants such as Hero and Maruti have shut down production at some of their units for now. There are other sectors that are grappling with labour shortages. “There’s a shortage of workers in logistics (dispatch & delivery), medical professionals and in diagnostics. There’s also a supply constraint for tech talent (AI, data engineers, cyber security). There’s, however, no unusual shortage of workers at factories. We see normal hiring taking place in factories. Since there’s accommodation at some manufacturing sites, workers have adapted to the situation,” said Randstad India head (strategic account management) Sanjay Shetty. B Thiagarajan, MD of leading cooling products maker Blue Star, said migration of labour has not been a major issue as only 20% of workers have gone away. “In any case, we are restricting the number of people at factories as well as at project sites, in accordance with safety protocols. Production shortfall is also not an issue as enough inventory exists and will be made available in June/July after normalcy is restored,” Thiagarajan claimed. Some experts say manufacturing may be witnessing addition of new capacities as demand for health products grows. “With regards to the manufacturing sector, the second wave did not impact it as much compared to the first wave. In addition, the tremendous demand and marketing of medical and health-related products led to creation of additional jobs and investment in the short run,” said IIMAD’s Rajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-adapts-to-avert-labour-woes/articleshow/82559256.cms||---

The researchers’ team head and the institute’s director, Arvind Choubey, and his fellow assistant professor Sandip Raj, told this newspaper on Tuesday that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Union ministry of health and family welfare were looking into this unique research to test run and validate the new technology through which precious time and money of patients in diagnosing Covid-19 infection will be saved. "The Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technology, which has been christened as ‘COVIZN’ and developed in 2020, can read scanned chest x-ray film or plate as well as high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) or CT scan uploaded to the computer in less than one second,” Prof Choubey said. “The ICMR has formed a high-level advisory committee headed by Dr Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and other medical sciences experts from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to explore the possibility of using ‘COVIZN’ software and suggest the modalities as soon as possible,” he added. Choubey also said the sample testing of the technology was done recently in the presence of a team of doctors and experts at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH) in Bhagalpur, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical sciences, Patna, and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Delhi. The result was 94 to 98% successful. “The data exhibited 98-100% result in diagnosing cases correctly,” he said. He claimed that the cost of diagnosis of Covid would be less than Rs100 through ‘COVIZN’ software in comparison to conventional microbiological swab test at present. “It will also save precious time of two to three days or even more in getting the test results. The technology is safe and aims at serving the humanity. Hopefully, the ICMR, the Ministry of Health and others will take early action on it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iiit-bhagalpurs-technology-to-detect-covid-awaits-icmr-nod/articleshow/82557001.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Fatalities remained a worry in the city too, with 51 deaths recorded on Tuesday. However, cases stayed under 2,000 (1,717) for consecutive days, taking the total to 6.8 lakh. In the 11 days of May, nearly 800 people have lost their lives to Covid, taking the total fatalities in Mumbai to 13,906. Of the 51 deaths on Tuesday, six were among those below 40, and 20 were between 40 and 60 years. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there has been a detailed discussion with the state task force about the deaths. “We anticipate that deaths will remain high for another few weeks. While our regular isolation beds and even oxygen support beds are emptying, the ICU occupancy continues to be as high as 92%,” he said. A senior doctor from Nair echoed him. Of the 2,996 ICU beds, 2,761 were occupied as of Tuesday. KEM hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said despite the dip in cases, they would maintain the Covid wards. Of the 480 Covid beds in the Parel hospital, around 190 are currently occupied. “We are in a better position bed-wise because the admissions have majorly declined,” he said. The city’s case doubling rate has jumped to 170 days now, and the daily positivity rate has dropped to 6% on Tuesday from 9% on April 30. The state’s positivity rate stood at 18.8% on Tuesday, down from nearly 22% till last week. The total cases are at 51.7 lakh and fatalities rose to 77,191. The state cabinet will discuss the extension of the lockdown-like restrictions in the state on Wednesday. “Ine thing I can say is that there will not be a complete relaxation soon. Whenever it is decided to open up sectors, it will be done gradually,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. The state on Tuesday discharged 72,000 people, taking the overall count of recoveries to 45.4 lakh. This has also led to a dip in active cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/corona-deaths-jump-44-in-maharashtra-a-worry-in-city-too/articleshow/82559959.cms||Bhavika Jain

District collector Vivek Yadav said oxygen beds with round-the-clock treatment facility will help handle more cases. Yadav inaugurated the centre at Rail Mahal on Tuesday. The centre is being managed by the SC Railway. Speaking on the occasion, the collector said they are trying to set up oxygen beds in as many Covid care centres as possible in the district. He said that they have already set up 12 Covid care centres across the district with a total bed capacity of 4000. The collector said those with mild symptoms could avail of facilities at Covid care centres for better medical care. He said that only people in critical condition will be moved to Covid-19 treatment hospitals. The collector complimented divisional railway authorities for setting up the centre. He said that a step-down centre and Covid care would be managed at the Railway Covid care centre. “Patients who recovered from chronic condition and still need to be under doctor’s observation will be shifted to the step-down centre. This centre will also act as Covid care centre for those with mild symptoms,” said the collector. Divisional railway manager (DRM) Mohan Raja said oxygen facility will be provided to 12 of the 70 beds in the Covid care centre. The DRM said the district administration has spared doctors and paramedical staff for the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-guntur-covid-care-centre-with-oxygen-beds-set-up-at-rail-mahal/articleshow/82557553.cms||---
---||Patna||Manjhi, Sahani flay Pappu’s arrest, wife fears for his life||PATNA: The arrest of former MP and Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav here on Tuesday stirred up a controversy. While the opposition parties flayed it, the two NDA constituents — Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and minister cum Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani — made a muffled noise against the arrest. On the other hand, Pappu’s wife and former MP Ranjeet Ranjan claimed that her husband had been arrested “under a conspiracy” and apprehended a “danger to his life”. She said, “If anything happens to him, and I fear there is a threat to his life as he has been arrested under a conspiracy, then state CM (Nitish Kumar) and the NDA government will be solely responsible for that.” Ranjit said everyone knows that when the second wave of coronavirus pandemic broke in the state, he virtually abandoned his home and family and dedicated himself to providing assistance to the people caught in distress. Ranjit said she had heard that he has been arrested in an old case and would be behind bars, but this was not the occasion to do it and, therefore, she was “justified in apprehending that he had been arrested under a conspiracy and there is threat to his life”. However, the immediate reactions of Manjhi and Sahani have surprised the concerned. “If a public representative remains busy day and night doing public service, and if he is arrested for it, then it is dangerous to humanity. First it should have been investigated and only then the arrest should have been made. In such a situation, if it generates popular anger, then it will be justified,” Manjhi tweeted. “Doing public service is like performing religious duty. The government should motivate public representatives to do social service and encourage them to come out to help people. Public representatives should also obey Covid guidelines. The arrest of Pappu Yadav, in such a situation, is insensitive,” Sahani said. RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari, without taking the name of Pappu Yadav, said the opposition party leaders, including Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, were slapped with cases when they came out in the open to criticize and draw public attention to the collapse of the system. Similarly, CPI(ML) also criticized the arrest of Pappu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-sahani-flay-pappus-arrest-wife-fears-for-his-life/articleshow/82556979.cms||Abhay Singh

For the second consecutive year, there will be no Eid namaz at Gandhi Maidan or any Eidgah in the state capital. Clerics and scholars have also made an appeal to people to follow the Covid guidelines on Eid and carry out the rituals at home.Eid will be celebrated either on Thursday or Friday in India, depending on the sighting of the moon. However, namaaz will not be held in congregation in open public places. Qazi Mansoor Alam of Patna-based Imarat Sharia on Monday appealed to people to prefer Namaze-Eid at home and follow guidelines issued by the government in this regard.Eidan committee president Mahmood Alam said like previous year, this year, too, Eid namaz will not be held at Gandhi Maidan. “Eid namaz has had been organised at Gandhi Maidan since 1925. But we are not organizing such congregation keeping in mind the guidelines issued for Covid-19 and safety of people,” said Mahmood, adding, “No doubt people will miss offering Eid namaz at Gandhi Maidan because that place has a different aura and even chief minister Nitish Kumar used to be present and greet people there. But we advise everyone to follow the government guidelines.”Apart from missing namaz in congregation, this year Eid celebration will be a low-key affair. Dariyapur resident Sofiya Anwar said the last week of Ramzan used to be hectic because apart from fasting, she used to be busy changing her home décor and shopping for Eid.“A night before Eid, called as chaand raat, we used to start the basic cooking as food was prepared for a large number of people, including friends, relatives and neighbours. This year, I will be cooking only for my family members,” Sofiya said, as she will neither visit any friend or relative this year nor will anyone visit her. “I will chat with my loved ones through video call,” she said.Raja Bazar resident Hasrat Imam said how can there be fun when so many people are suffering at the moment. “Throughout Ramzan, we prayed for everyone suffering from Covid-19. Hope this phase gets over,” said Hasrat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-effect-no-eid-namaz-at-gandhi-maidan-or-any-eidgah/articleshow/82556962.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Apart from its key advantage of mobility, teleconsultation reduces the risk of infection transmission among doctors and patients. The raging second wave coupled with restrictions on movement is driving up the trend to seek virtual care. This is happening at a time when many doctors have stopped outpatient services and switched completely to the virtual mode. In Visakhapatnam, several doctors are advising both Covid-19 and other patients over the phone. Around 3,500 doctors are registered with the 104 call-centre of the state health department. Principal secretary of health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said there are around 600 specialists among these 3,500 doctors. “Apart from receiving calls from the public, these doctors dial up Covid-19 patients who opt for home isolation and guide them on various aspects of disease management. The team called around 9,800 patients on Tuesday. We want to take it to 15,000 a day. Outgoing call lines are also being increased,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/more-patients-opt-for-virtual-consultation-in-second-wave/articleshow/82557516.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Business||OPPI warns against vaccine patent waiver||MUMBAI: Waiving of intellectual property (IP) rights will neither lead to higher production of vaccines or their increased deployment to fight Covid, since that is not the barrier to ensure availability of vaccines in India, according to the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers (OPPI), a body representing pharma MNCs. It warned that a waiver of patents could impact patient safety by opening doors for counterfeit vaccines to enter the supply chain. The statement follows a drastic turnaround of the US recently supporting a waiver of IP on Covid vaccines. India and South Africa are engaged jointly at the World Trade Organization for a patient waiver submitted in October last year for all Covid medical tools. Recently, faced with crucial vaccines shortages and key Covid drugs, there has been demand from patent and health activists to suspend patents on them, to improve their accessibility and affordability. “We are cognisant that with the rising Covid cases in India and in other developing nations, there is an urgency to rapidly produce greater quantities of the Covid vaccine. Vaccine manufacturing is a complex process and scaling up capacities involves the transfer of critical knowhow. We believe this can only be optimally achieved when vaccine manufacturers are able to scale up capacities at their production sites and/or through licensing agreements with other manufacturers, along with supply agreements with governments to make required quantities deployed rapidly and reliably,” it said in a statement. Further, there is also a risk of diverting precious raw materials and ingredients necessary to produce the vaccines from high-quality manufacturers to inexperienced ones, further disrupting the existing manufacturing capacity. It may also stifle further investment in R&D that are instrumental in delivering new vaccines and treatments against new virus variants, it added. OPPI said it is fully committed to developing newer and improved treatment options to help respond to the pandemic, ensuring that innovative therapies are available equitably and expeditiously. OPPI said it has “engaged in technology transfers in a series of vaccines and therapies”, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer and J&J.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oppi-warns-against-vaccine-patent-waiver/articleshow/82559231.cms||---

Promoters of Adani Ports, Asian Paints, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, JSW Steel and Sun Pharma reduced their pledged stakes in the companies on the back of aggressive deleveraging efforts. The combined value of pledged holdings in BSE 500 stocks declined to 1.6% (Rs 1.6 lakh crore) in the March quarter of fiscal 2021 — the lowest in the last nine quarters — from about 2.1% in the preceding quarter, according to a Kotak Securities report. The report highlighted that there were no listed companies where controlling shareholders pledged more than 90% of their stakes. In some companies like Dhanuka Agritech, promoters released their entire pledged holdings. “The trend of reduction in promoter pledged shares is secular and likely to witness continued decline,” said RippleWave Equity Advisors partner Mehul Savla. “Investors have fretted over pledged holdings as, in many instances, these were an indicator of promoters raising funds to invest in other ventures. Lack of transparency of such investments and the uncertainty of their financial outcome led to investors exiting such stocks. Promoters now realise the pitfalls of such actions and are taking steps towards rebuilding the trust by reducing the pledged holding in a progressive manner,” added Savla. Risks related to pledged shares by promoters came to the fore in the recent past following the financial woes at Essel and Anil Ambani’s Reliance groups. To protect retail shareholders, India’s securities markets regulator Sebi mandated companies to disclose the reasons for encumbrances if the shares pledged by controlling shareholders exceed 50% of the total promoter holding or 20% of the companies’ equity capital. Promoters of Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Adani Enterprises and Adani Green Energy reduced their pledged holdings in these companies to 16%, 12%, 6% and 0.8%, from 38%, 28%, 17% and 5% in the December quarter of the previous fiscal 2021. Sajjan Jindal lowered his pledged holdings in JSW Energy and JSW Steel to 25% and 18% from 36% and 22%. On the other hand, promoters of IndusInd Bank, Ashok Leyland, Aurobindo Pharma and Wockhardt increased their pledged holdings in the firms, according to the Kotak Securities report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pledged-bse-500-stocks-value-shrinks-to-rs-1-6l-cr/articleshow/82558774.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Prices of seasonal veggies have declined by at least 30-40% at different mandis due to fall in demand and market disruption. Sikander, a vegetable seller at Anta Ghat, said the daily footfall of customers has dropped to 25% since May 5. “As residents find it difficult to reach the vegetable markets owing to restrictions, we are facing losses,” he added. Punam Devi, another veggie vendor at Anta Ghat, said she earns only up to Rs 400-500 per day against Rs 3,000 before the imposition of the lockdown. “Even though I have reduced the prices of tomato and cucumber from Rs 30 to Rs 10 per kg and started selling brinjal, ladyfinger and ‘palak’ at Rs 20 per kg against Rs 30 earlier, there are few takers,” she said, adding the state government should extend the time limit for sale of vegetables and other essential commodities. The falling price trend was also seen in other vegetable markets like Mussallahpur Haat, Gardanibagh, Phulwarisharf and Bazaar Samiti. Some vendors were seen dumping the remaining veggies on road after the start of curfew hours at 11am. Shankar Mahto, a vendor at Phulwarisharif, said he dumps 50-60% vegetables on road every day after the police personnel start making announcements to leave the market at 11am. “There is no point in taking the perishable vegetables to home,” he said. Ramakant, a vendor at Bazaar Samiti, said lack of demand from bulk users like hotels and restaurants has also led to fall in prices. “The prices of sponge gourd (nenua) have slipped from Rs 30 to Rs 10 per kg. Prices of pointed gourd (parwal) and bottle gourd have dropped to Rs 20 per 1.5kg and Rs 10 per piece, respectively,” he added. Even prices of fruits at wholesale markets have come down by 10-15%. Guava was being sold at Rs 30 instead Rs 45 per kg, pineapple at Rs 39 instead of Rs 60 per piece and sweet lime (mosambi) at Rs 90 instead of Rs 120 per kg on Tuesday. “The usual rush in markets is missing due to lockdown,” said apple vendor Munna Choudhary at Mussallahpur Haat. Meanwhile, the retailers and hawkers are selling vegetables and fruits at high rates in different localities and retail markets. “Hawkers are exploiting people taking advantage of lockdown. We have no other option but to buy vegetables and fruits from them as visiting markets is risky these days,” said a local. Binay Kumar, a resident of Boring Canal Road, said, “I bought two lemons at Rs 20 and oranges at Rs 80 per kg. Pineapple is being sold at Rs 75 for pineapple by hawkers,” he said. Ashfaque Ahmed, a resident of Sabzibagh, too said the hawkers are minting money from people. “They know people mostly buy fruits and vegetables during Ramzan. Hence, they are seizing the opportunity to make money,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vendors-resort-to-distress-sale-of-veggies-at-wholesale-markets/articleshow/82557404.cms||Faryal Rumi

During this difficult times of the pandemic, when Covid patients are consistently losing battle with the deadly virus, the ordeal of their families does not appear to cease there only. When these families are handed over the bodies of their near and dear ones by hospitals for the last rites, a major difficulty they face is arrangement of a vehicle for transportation of the deceased to the cremation ground. This in itself is no mean task but, again, even after securing it, they must pay through their nose to avail this service. Pained at this behavior of the vehicle drivers and the helplessness of agonized families, a scrap dealer of Jodhpur, Suresh Acharya, converted his one-month old SUV into a "moksha vaahan", offering free services to the needy ones to take the deceased to the crematoriums. “With death, we tend to do whatever possible, selflessly, for the departed and here are people, who found opportunity to make quick bucks without being empathetic with people who lost their relatives to the pandemic, especially poor villagers. This hurt me to the core and I decided to convert my newly purchased Scorpio into a ‘moksha vaahan’”, Acharya said. Though it was difficult for him to convince his family and friends, he was determined. Without giving a second thought, he made the necessary changes to his SUV and rolled it out for free transportation of corpses to cremation grounds on May 7. Acharya made his mobile number public and rushes to hospitals on receiving a call. He drives the vehicle himself. Acharya has transported 40 bodies to the local cremation ground, and even into villages in the hinterland. He has travelled to other districts like Nokha in Bikaner, Pokhran in Jaisalmer, and Jaitaran in Pali since he began this service 3 days ago. “Many a time there are hardly 1-2 people with the deceased. I then help them place the body in the vehicle,” Acharya says. Asked about fear of getting infected, he said he takes all precautions and uses a mask, sanitizer, and gloves. He is determined to continue this service as long as the situation persists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/scrap-dealer-uses-his-new-suv-to-carry-covid-victims/articleshow/82559979.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Conduct dept inquiry against 2 fire officials, says Sunrise report||MUMBAI: The investigation report on the fire at Sunrise Hospital inside Dreams Mall in Bhandup recommends a full-fledged departmental inquiry against assistant divisional fire officer Rajendra Ghadge and the then chief fire officer S A Kale for not following rules in November. The report recommends water mist systems in all ICU wards and deployment of two firefighters from licensed agencies at all times at ICU wards. The report, approved by municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Tuesday, blames Sunrise and the mall management for the fire and lapses in complying with fire safety rules. The report, prepared by deputy municipal commissioner Prabhat Rahangdale, said Pona Corporation, the licensed agency tasked with ensuring the mall’s fire safety compliance, had submitted a report that the fire-fighting equipment of the mall was working from July 1 to December 31. It stated that on the day of the fire, no fire-fighting equipment was working and recommended Pona’s licence be cancelled by the director of the Maharashtra Fire Services and asked the chief fire officer to file a criminal case against it. The report said the BMC had asked for an audit of all malls after the fire in the City Central mall in South Mumbai in October 2020. “As per the circular issued by the BMC, based on the footprint of the mall, the deputy chief fire officer was supposed to carry out the site inspection. But in reality assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO) Rajendra Ghadge carried out the inspection on oral instructions from the then CFO S A Kale. This was in violation of rules. S A Kale was the deputy CFO of that region and holding charge of CFO,” the report said. The report blamed the mall and hospital management for ignoring warnings from the fire brigade and the BMC and not taking any corrective action. “It is recommended to cut off the water and electric supply of the mall and file a criminal case against the owners and directors of Dreams Mall and Sunrise Hospital’s owners Ms Privilege Healthcare since they are to be blamed for the fire incident,” Rahangdale said in his report. The report suggested the existing SOP be tweaked to adjust to the Covid-19 situation. The report recommended that a new fire hazard response and mitigation plan be created for the city. A Sunrise statement said: “The hospital is delinked from the mall and had all compliance in place. The report clearly states that the fire was due to faulty electric circuit in the shop No. 140 on the upper ground floor of the mall. The spread of the fire is attributed to the lack of functioning sprinkler system of the entire mall, combustible material on the ground floor and encroached passages on the upper ground floor and other floors of the mall premises, except the 3rd Floor of the Dreams Mall, where Sunrise Hospital is situated. In fact, all the lapses indicated as reasons for the spread of the fire concern the basement, upper ground floor, 1st floor, and 2nd floor of the mall premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-conduct-dept-inquiry-against-2-fire-officials-says-sunrise-report/articleshow/82560006.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

This will be the second multilateral event that Modi has had to give up in a month. “While appreciating the invitation to the Prime Minister by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to attend the G7 summit as a special invitee, given the prevailing Covid-19 situation, it has been decided that the Prime Minister will not attend the G7 summit in person,” the MEA spokesperson said on Tuesday. Modi will say his bit in a virtual address, but will miss out on the most important in-person international meeting. This comes after foreign minister S Jaishankar’s recent visit to London for the G7 ministers’ meeting was clouded by the suggestion that two of his team members had tested positive for Covid-19. They subsequently tested negative but it showed the perils of Indians travelling overseas at this point, when the Indian variant is labelled as being “of concern.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-cancels-travel-to-uk-for-g7-as-india-sees-covid-19-surge/articleshow/82564310.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Police begins probe into concentrator case||New Delhi: Delhi Police is learnt to have started a probe into the complaints made by people who bought the oxygen concentrators from absconding restaurateur Navneet Kalra after they alleged that the machines sold to them were non-functional and of no help to their patients. The concentrators seized from Kalra were sent for testing at Shriram Institute for Industrial Research to ascertain if they were of any use to Covid patients. Two types of machines were sent for testing by the Crime Branch. Sources said that in its initial report, the lab has apparently stated that the oxygen purity of one was around 38% and 32.7 for the other one. Delhi Police will now seek assistance of medical experts to ascertain if machines with these values would provide any relief to Covid patients. Cops have submitted the findings before a court. Cops will now start recording the statements of people who have alleged that they were duped by Kalra who neither refunded their money nor replaced the machine even after they complained that the machines were useless. Police have collected several messages from people in this connection, a cop from Lodhi Colony police station privy to the developments said. Kalra has remained untraced for about a week now. Police have even issued a lookout notice against him. Kalra, who runs Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants in Khan Market and Lodhi Colony, has claimed that he was being unfairly accused of wrongdoings when every transaction is on record. Apart from recovering the hoarded machines in these places, cops had also recovered a lot of concentrators from a farmhouse in south Delhi. Soon after police raided his premises last week, Kalra went underground with his family. A senior police officer said that there were apprehension that Kalra might try to flee the country after which the LOC was issued. The raids are still on to arrest him, he added. Through a lookout notice, cops alert all immigration and sea ports to detain an individual if he tries to flee. An FIR has been filed under IPC sections pertaining to cheating, violating public order and criminal conspiracy apart from sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Essential Commodities Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-police-begins-probe-into-concentrator-case/articleshow/82587846.cms||Raj Shekhar

However, Kumar, added, one constable at Government Railway Police died of Covid-19 too. “These fully functional care centres have not only reduced the burden on district hospitals but have also led to swifter recovery of cops as the latter have been able to get a favourable environment and care without any delay,” added Kumar. The officer also said that currently as many as 4,256 policemen are under the grip of the deadly coronavirus in the state, while as many as 15,409 cops have recovered since last one year. The ADG also highlighted the efforts of the Kanpur and Lucknow police commissionerates in starting the facilities of ‘oxygen bank’ for both the families of cops as well as people. Meanwhile, ADG, Kanpur Zone, Bhanu Bhaskar, who is the brainchild behind these Covid-care centres in Police Lines, said that soon they would volunteer to set up plasma and blood banks in every district. Corona Control Center will also have a list of police volunteers who are willing to contribute their blood and plasma in case of requirement.

Unflinching in our efforts, we will continue the steady supply of our vaccine,” Bharat Biotech tweeted on Tuesday. The company has added Karnataka, Haryana, Tripura and Bihar to the list of 14 states it kicked off supplies to after the Centre opened up vaccinations to all over the age of 18 years from May 1. However, the company did not specify the quantum of doses supplied so far or the total number of orders that the company has received so far. The company had started off with supplies to 14 states, including Telangana, Maharashtra, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha and Chhattisgarh based on allocations by the Centre, about which the company’s joint managing director Suchitra Ella had tweeted about over the weekend. Ella had also said that governments of other states too are in touch with the company for procuring Covaxin and requests would be processed 24/7 based on availability of stocks. The company has fixed the price of Covaxin for state governments at Rs 400 per dose after initially declaring a higher price that was eventually brought down by Rs 200.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-biotech-ramps-up-covaxin-supply-to-18-states/articleshow/82560034.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

However, the number of daily deaths stood at 169, the highest single-day fatality reported in the state so far. Active cases continued to rise as it stood at 2,05,730. Though 13,198 people were discharged from various hospitals in the state, bed and ICU availability remained chaotic. At hospitals like RUHS, many patients in their oxygen enabled ambulances and vehicles kept waiting. Likewise, in the rural areas, locals kept taking patients from one hospital to another for admissions. TOI on Tuesday visited RUHS and found that at least 100 ambulances were waiting outside for admissions. “We have been working on full capacity. Based on discharges, we take new admissions,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, RUHS superintendent. Such is the panic in other parts of the state now that in Kota, government hospitals have started refusing admissions of patients coming from bordering Madhya Pradesh. Also in the border districts like Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh, locals are in touch with their relatives in Punjab and Chandigarh to get admission in hospitals. A day after 2,918 fresh cases in Jaipur, the city recorded 3,613 cases on Tuesday. The city also witnessed 57 Covid deaths, which took its toll to 1,294. The number of active cases also increased to 49,884. Majority of private and government hospitals are full and have stopped taking fresh admissions. Seeing the growing number of cases in the past fortnight, hospitals have been discharging patients within seven days to make room for patients with severe or very severe symptoms. Still, majority of the hospitals remained packed with patients and the crisis of oxygen supply remained troubling them and the attendants of the patients. Jaipur was followed by Jodhpur where 18 deaths were reported which took its total death count to 863. Udaipur saw 14 deaths which took its fatality count to 455. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (3,613) and was followed by Udaipur (1,506), Jodhpur (1,303), Jaisalmer (860), Kota (740), Alwar (705), Bharatpur (688), Sriganganagar (508) and Ajmer (505).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/daily-cases-drop-for-2nd-day-in-state-fatalities-rise-to-169/articleshow/82565141.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat again tops new wind power capacity||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat continues to be the preferred destination for setting up wind power projects in India. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Gujarat witnessed the highest addition of wind power generation capacity in the country in 2020-21. Wind power projects with the cumulative generation capacity of 1,020.3MW were installed and commissioned in Gujarat from April 2020 to March 21. That was the highest capacity addition by any state in India during the period, shows data compiled by Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association (IWTMA). Gujarat was followed by Tamil Nadu (303.7MW) and Karnataka (148MW). In fact, Gujarat grabbed the lion’s share of 68% in the new wind power capacity addition across the country in 2020-21. About 1,503.3MW of new wind power generation capacity was installed in India in fiscal 2021, IWTMA data shows. With these new installations, Gujarat’s current operational capacity for generation of power from wind energy sources stands at 8,561.8MW as against 7541.5MW in 2019-20. At 1,468.4MW, Gujarat created the highest wind power capacity in the previous fiscal as well. “The majority of the projects — with the capacity of 700MW — that came up in Gujarat during the last financial year were projects auctioned by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) before the outbreak of the pandemic,” said a market player, who wished to remain anonymous. “About 200MW capacity was added via tenders floated by state-run power utilities.” Renewable energy companies such as Adani Green and ReNew Power were among the prominent players that commissioned their power projects. Adani Green and ReNew Power commissioned 100MW and 300MW wind power projects in Kutch in March 2021. The state government sources, however, pegged the capacity of new wind projects commissioned in Gujarat at 890MW for the fiscal 2021. Gujarat currently stands second after Tamil Nadu in terms of the total installed wind power generation capacity in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-again-tops-new-wind-power-capacity/articleshow/82563709.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The kingpin is a man from Gurgaon, who had visited Jamtara for a training course to learn cheating techniques and returned to form a gang. They were charging Rs 45,000-50,000 for one cylinder from people whose contact they obtained from SOS posts on social media. With the arrests, six recent cases where the crooks had duped people to the tune of 2.5 lakh have been worked out and 16 beneficiary bank accounts frozen. A majority of the victims of this gang was based in Hauz Khas, Kalkaji and other areas. An initial probe suggested that 20 people from Delhi-NCR were duped by this gang in the first week of May. Four smartphones, 16 SIM cards, two feature phones, a laptop with incriminating data and three bikes have been seized from the accused — Ritik Singh (19) from Farrukhabad, Yogesh Singh (27) and Ravish (24) and Arzoo (23) from Gurgaon. “SHO Maninder Singh’s team also recovered multiple ATM and credit cards, along with Aadhaar and PAN cards,” said DCP (Central) Jasmeet Singh. A team under additional DCP Rohit Meena and ACP Vidushi Kaushik began to track the gang after receiving a complaint from Kshitij Mehra from Karol Bagh. He was asked for Rs 47,500, and the cylinder was never delivered despite payment. The team investigated the trail of money, fake accounts and SIMs used to zero in on Ritik, who was nabbed on May 7. He led the cops to others. Ravish knew all the tricks of the trade as he had learnt them from the gangs in Jamtara. The gang used to lure people into renting them their bank accounts and paid them money every month in return. In north Delhi, cops busted a gang indulging in black marketing of oxygen flowmeters and arrested three people. As many as 36 flowmeters were seized. One of the accused, Arun Gupta, was pursuing a bachelor’s degree in architecture from an institute in Gurgaon. Gupta came in touch with Karanjeet Singh and Bhanu on social media and took to crime to make quick money. They were selling these flowmeters for Rs 5,000 a piece. The cops arrested them by posing as a decoy customer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cybercrooks-dupe-scores-by-promising-o2-cylinders/articleshow/82587913.cms||---

The husband of the deceased patient alleged he was asked to arrange for an oxygen cylinder in the wee hours of Tuesday and had gone hunting for one all the way to Salt Lake. On his return, he was told his wife had expired. The hospital as well as the health department has denied the allegation. No formal complaint has been lodged by the family. Jamuna Nath, a resident of Parnasree in Behala, was admitted to the hospital around 6am on Monday with Covid symptoms including difficulty in breathing. According to sources, the hospital’s stock of flow meters had exhausted and the family was asked to get one. The family insisted Jamuna’s husband Arup had received calls from the hospital at 2am and was asking to arrange for a cylinder citing rush of patients. The call allegedly came at 2am on Tuesday. The family also claimed Jamuna was forced to share oxygen with other patients. The hospital administration and health department denied the charges. “We had administered oxygen.

---||Mumbai||Indian Covid variant can duck antibodies, but vaccine blunts sting: Study||MUMBAI: Covid-19’s so-called ‘Indian variant’ has a “modest” ability to “escape” the antibodies developed by vaccines, but it can, at best, cause moderate illness among those who have got the shots, scientists from India and the UK have found, establishing that “vaccination is still protective for the majority of people”. The B.1.617 mutant, first isolated in Vidarbha three months ago, is now detected across India and 40 other countries. It was initially called the ‘double mutant’ variant for possessing mutations E484Q and L452R that are known to evade the protective layer of antibodies caused by vaccination. The B.1.617 was recently named a variant of concern because of its high transmissibility by WHO. Read AlsoIndian Covid-19 variant found in 44 countries: WHOThe World Health Organization said Wednesday that a variant of Covid-19 behind the acceleration of India's explosive outbreak has been found in dozens of countries all over the world. The UN health agency said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, first found in India in October, had been detected inScientists from India’s INSACOG — the consortium of 10 elite national laboratories — and UK’s Cambridge University wrote in a research paper, ‘SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 — emergence and sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies’, that there is a possibility some people could get infected with the variant despite vaccination, but the infection would be mild. Read AlsoWHO designates India variant as being of global concernThe World Health Organziation said on Monday that the B.1.617 variant first identified in India was being classified as a variant of global concern.The paper, in pre-print stage, holds the B.1.617’s modest ability to dodge antibodies responsible for its high infectivity and transmissibility that fuelled the second wave in India. “The data go some way in explaining the dominance of this variant in a partially immune population, but highlights that vaccination is still protective for the majority of people,” said Gupta Lab, the Twitter handle of Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge’s department of medicine and author of the new study. Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and a co-author of the paper, told TOI the most important point is that “vaccines protect against B.1.617”. “There is an immune escape, but not of a high degree,” he added. Late on Monday, another scientist, Vinod Scaria, from the institute tweeted B.1.617 is unlikely to be a major immune escape variant. A month ago, US scientist Anthony Fauci had said Covaxin was effective against the new variants. On Tuesday, Agrawal said vaccine efficacy against the variants has been established. “Our CSIR labs have shown Covishield’s effectiveness, while NIV Pune has shown that Covaxin is effective,” he said. The latest paper studied the Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness against B.1.617. The Indian government was for months hesitant to label B.1.617 as the cause of the “ferocious” second wave, but it is now established that the Maharashtra variant has played a role. European scientists have said the variant was at least six times as infective as the UK variant B.1.1.7. The UK health authority has named B.1.617.2, which is closely linked to B.1.617, as a variant of concern.

---||Lucknow||Active cases dip by 30% in Uttar Pradesh since April 30 peak||LUCKNOW: The number of active infections in the state has declined by over 30% since the peak on April 30. As on Tuesday, there were 2.16 lakh active cases of novel coronavirus in UP. This is over 94,000 less than the peak of 3.10 lakh. As per an official bulletin, 1.61 lakh of the total active cases are under home isolation. The bulletin further stated that the daily case positivity rate too has fallen below 10% mark. “The case positivity rate had reached 16.84% on April 24, but it has now come down to 8.76% which speaks for the control over the pandemic situation,” an official statement said. Officials in the state government told TOI that new cases continued to decline, while the rise in recoveries was sustained for the 12 day in a row. But deaths continue to remain a cause of concern. As many as 303 deaths in the past 24 hours, the total casualties reached 16043. A total of 20,463 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, whereas the number of recoveries was 29,358, which is about 9,000 more than the new cases. As a result of the trend, the total number of recoveries in the state reached 13.13 lakh which is reflecting on the overall recovery rate. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that the improvement is directly linked to the state’s strategy of track, test and treat to break the transmission chain. “After bringing the situation in high burden cities, the health teams are moving to villages to bring out the hidden cases,” he said, adding that over four lakh symptomatic persons have been screened by these teams and provided with the required preventive medication. Officials also said that UP continues to conduct the maximum number of Covid tests across the country. The state has successfully been able to test 4,34,04,184 samples for COVID so far. As many as 2,33,605 tests were done in the past 24 hours in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/active-cases-dip-by-30-in-state-since-apr-30-peak/articleshow/82562210.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The protesters claimed that the AAP government failed to provide free ration to 72 lakh beneficiaries attached to over 17 lakh ration cardholders. They later submitted a memorandum addressed to the chief minister on the issue as well. Through the memorandum the BJP functionaries drew the CM’s attention to the problems faced by the ration cardholders, especially due to the Covid-induced lockdown, and demanded the supply be ensured without further delay. Gupta said it was shocking that lakhs of people were being deprived of free ration announced by the Centre for May and June. “Under the Food Security Act, the Centre has been providing 8kg wheat and 2kg rice. Two weeks of May have passed, but ration distribution has not taken place due to the failure of Delhi government to issue formal orders to the fair price shops,” he claimed, adding that under the law, these orders should have been issued by May1. “We wanted to meet the CM and hand over the memorandum, but our request was denied.” Bidhuri said the free ration was not distributed because the AAP government feared the credit for the same would go to the Centre. “We do not want the credit, but Delhi government should not delay the formal orders for distribution of these ration. The Centre is spending Rs 250 crore per month on free rations for the poor,’’ he added. TOI attempted to get Delhi government’s reaction on the issue but failed to get a response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-dharna-outside-cm-house-over-ration-delay/articleshow/82588003.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the last week, a total of 350 calls have been received out of which 93 calls were for welfare of children whose parents have died due to the virus. Among these, four calls were from Rajasthan in which the children have either lost both or one parent to Covid. Overall, there have been 10 calls from Rajasthan on the child helpline number 18001027222. Dhananjay Tingal, executive director, Bachpan Bachao Andolan told TOI, “A week ago when the number was shared on social media, we started getting calls about children whose parents died due to Covid. From Rajasthan, there were 10 calls out of which there was a case in which the child had lost both parents and was being looked after by the extended family. In this case, they are looking for financial aid as the girl requires treatment which is very expensive.” Once the helpline receives the calls for help, they get in touch with the local child welfare committees to process the requests. Apart from the above mentioned cases, they are also getting calls for help for education and health aid for children. The office bearers claimed that it has only been a week since they started getting calls for help for children whose parents are either suffering from Covid or succumbed to it but the organisation has started the process of rehabilitation for the same. Meanwhile, with the death toll rising alarmingly during the second wave of the pandemic, many messages of child adoption have started doing the rounds on social media. These messages claim that parents of the children have died due to Covid and the orphaned minors can be adopted. This has raised concern among the government authorities who have appealed to people to inform them about such messages on the child helpline as well as on the WhatsApp numbers. The authorities claimed that these messages not only encourage illegal adoptions but can also result in child trafficking. Organisations claimed that while action should be taken against persons who are sending these messages, the ones who are showing interest in such illegal adoptions should also be investigated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nobel-laureates-child-helpline-gets-350-distress-calls/articleshow/82560085.cms||---

Three of these were found false, while eight marriages were averted by the timely intervention of the authorities. Of these eight weddings, six were of minor brides and two under-aged grooms. Bhojraj Singh, director of the child line at Chittorgarh, said the pandemic is being used in conducting child marriages despite strict lockdown and movement restrictions. Since the schools have been shut, no mid-day meals and jobs being lost, several parents from a weaker economic background, opt to marry off their girl child. “On April 22, two minor girls were being married off in Dungla block. The girls were of 12 and 15 years but the child line and police teams managed to timely intervene and thus avert the event,” Singh said. “On April 25, in a village under Badi Sadri police station, a 20-year-old boy was being married off but the programme was cancelled and his parents were warned by the officials,” he added. In Bhadesar, a 15-year-old girl's marriage was called off while a 17-year-old girl whose marriage was fixed for May 7, was averted when the officials reached the spot on time and warned the host. District Legal Service Authorities across Rajasthan too are getting stricter and keeping keen watch on such incidents. Helplines are working 24x7 where informers can report incidents of child marriages that come to their knowledge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/strict-vigil-fails-to-stop-child-marriages/articleshow/82560114.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government for shifting of wheat to depots before monsoon||LUCKNOW: Amid unprecedented procurement of wheat in the ongoing season, the UP government is now facing the problem of plenty, with the department of food and civil supplies upping the ante over inadequate transfer of food grain to the depots of Food Corporation of India (FCI) to save it from rain in view of monsoon season. In a missive sent to a host of wheat procurement agencies, including Mandi Parishad, UP food and essential commodities corporation and UP Cooperative Sangh, the department said that it was a matter of “grave concern” that maximum amount of wheat stored at procurement centres had not been “dispatched” to FCI depots. “This has raised the possibility of the stored wheat getting wet during the rainy season,” the letter said. According to an estimate, the state government has procured over 18 lakh metric tonnes of wheat since May 1, which is almost the double of what it did last year. The massive procurement exercise in the midst of the second coronavirus wave, is seen as being essentially driven by higher minimum support price (MSP) – which was raised from Rs 1,925 to Rs 1,975 per quintal – and increasing the number of purchase centres from last year’s 5,000 to 6,000 this time. The department has asked the procurement agencies to send the wheat stored in purchase centres to FCI depots and submit a report to the state government at the earliest. Food commissioner Manish Chauhan said the procured wheat needs to be sent to FCI depots to prevent it from damage. He maintained that the in charge of the centres have been asked to transfer wheat to requisite depots on a regular basis. “Some of the samitis engaged in wheat procurement also have go-downs which can be of use,” Chauhan said. A senior official in the department said the procurement shelters had temporary arrangements like plastic sheets, which were not enough to protect the food grain. “The amount of wheat procured is enormous and requires suitable storage,” he said, adding that the high quantum of wheat could force the in charge of procurement centres to stop wheat purchase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-for-shifting-of-wheat-to-depots-before-monsoon/articleshow/82562249.cms||Pankaj Shah

As of now, global tenders could be called for Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik. Though the Centre has recently eased the regulatory pathway for approval of foreign-approved Covid-19 vaccines, there were no foreign vaccine companies in India except Sputnik. According to the existing rule, states can only buy DGCI-approved vaccines. “Having more vaccines in the market will ensure everyone gets the jabs. The two Indian vaccine companies can also participate, a competitive price can emerge out of it,” sources said. The government would also evaluate how many free vaccines the state would get from Centre and how much it has to spend to buy the doses. “Clarity will come in a few days after the final assessments are made,” sources said. Andhra Pradesh too has made an announcement that it would invite global tenders for vaccines. Meanwhile, the Centre on Tuesday released statistics of the vaccine drive in states and how many first and second doses were given between May 1 and May 10. According to the data, Telangana has given 55% of vaccine for people due for their second dose. The Centre, in a statement, said that those states giving more second doses would be given priority in vaccine allotment this month. The Centre also said states could focus on completing vaccination of those due for second doses before proceeding to the first dose of 18+ citizens. According to the data, West Bengal tops the list of states giving second doses (over 90%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-may-ask-centre-to-allow-more-vaccines-in-country/articleshow/82560154.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The phone calls, around 20 of them in a short span of an hour, went unanswered even as patients convulsed, gasped and died at GMC. While the government repeatedly insisted that the state had enough oxygen, documents in possession with TOI show how calls were made every night to Scoop Industries, the company contracted by the government to supply oxygen to the state’s public hospitals, the CMO and other authorities asking for oxygen to be restored immediately. On Tuesday, the oxygen supply dipped at 4:41am and doctors immediately sent an SOS asking for the supply to be replenished. Ten attempts were made to reach the supplier, but the phone was switched off. The proprietor of Scoop Oxygen was called five times and finally with no response coming, a call was made to the CMO at 5.17am. “During this time (36 minutes) one patient desaturated to 80 SPO2 and was ventilated with the oxygen cylinder,” the document said. TOI has itself received and reported about SOS calls from patients and their relatives every night pleading for oxygen. The records show that on Tuesday, the oxygen supply dipped at 5.42am and then again 6.34am, 8.45am and 10.20am in wards and in the operation theatre. “The supply of the central oxygen has remained interrupted till date, leading to a critical fall in the oxygen saturation of the comorbid, physiologically compromised patients with severe Covid pneumonia. This has increased the mortality and morbidity of these critical hospitalised patients,” said an urgent note moved by some of the doctors at GMC. On an average, GMC has around 400 patients who require oxygen support to survive. Each patient requires two to three oxygen cylinders per day based on the severity of the infection. So, while GMC required anywhere between 860 and 930 cylinders, to sustain patients, it received just 330 to 630 oxygen cylinders over the past five days. “There are frequent interruptions on a daily basis. The uninterrupted supply of central oxygen at adequate pressure as well as cylinder oxygen is vital for the management of Covid patients,” said the note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-patients-on-brink-gmcs-sos-calls-to-cmo-unanswered/articleshow/82562290.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Hyderabad||CAG: 12,000 acres of assigned land in Telangana in squatters’ possession||HYDERABAD: About 12,000 acres of assigned land has fallen into the clutches of land sharks in eight districts of Telangana. The comptroller and auditor general (CAG), in its latest report, said the land worth Rs 1,096 crore (as per the market value) is in the possession of unauthorised persons in 322 villages encompassing eight districts. The CAG (report No. 2 of 2020) said the chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA) had failed to monitor resumption of the assigned land from these unauthorised persons and also found fault with revenue officials on land management and allocation. Interestingly, as per the board of revenue’s standing orders, the land should have been classified as assignable and non-assignable by the government but the CCLA does not have data on the land. “While the CCLA did not offer specific remarks, tahsildars of the mandals said land classification was done 60 years ago (1954-55) as per khasra pahani (revenue records),” the CAG report said. The state government had recently launched a probe into the alleged encroachment of assigned land by former minister Eatala Rajender in Atchampet and Hakimpet villages of Medak district. The district collector submitted a report to the government that Jamuna Hatcheries owned by family members of Eatala had encroached upon 66 acres, which was denied by the company later. The CAG said it sought replies from the tahsildars on the alleged encroachment and resumption of assigned land from land grabbers or those who purchased the land from farmers illegally. The tahsildars informed the CAG that they had sent proposals to the government for reassignment of resumed land to the present occupier and orders are awaited. The CCLA is supposed to monitor utilisation of land by allottees, see if the land is used for its intended purposes and take action for resumption of land in case of violation of terms of land alienation. “But our audit reveals the CCLA did not maintain a comprehensive record of land alienations and assignment proposals viz., applications received, processed and submitted to Telangana State Land Management Authority (TSLMA) and further submission to the government for approval,” the CAG said. A land bank or database was not established as envisaged in the land allotment policy in the absence of which audit could only review land alienation or assignment records based on the government orders available in the website and files produced by the office of CCLA, the CAG said. The CAG claimed that the CCLA accepted their observations and promised that all procedures would be followed scrupulously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cag-12k-acres-of-assigned-land-in-t-in-squatters-possession/articleshow/82562286.cms||Koride Mahesh

The eight districts together reported 6,088 cases, down from 6,551 on Monday. They also accounted for 21% of the total active cases in the state. With 19 and 18 deaths, respectively, Coimbatore and Salem were among the top four districts with Covid fatalities in the state.The swift spike in cases has added to the pressure of health infrastructure, with patients made to wait for hours for beds. A few days ago, three Covid patients had died in ambulances in Salem as they were made to move from hospital to hospital in search of beds. On Monday, a similar situation had occurred in Tirupur, where three patients died waiting for beds in ambulances. There was a near similar situation in Coimbatore on Tuesday, when at least seven patients had to wait for hours at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), most of them old and in need of immediate medical attention.The patients’ relatives were desperately trying to get a bed, which took several hours. They complained that they were not given proper reply on availability of beds. On the other hand, CMCH employees, understaffed and overworked, said they were working as fast as possible to accommodate the patients.According to the district health bulletin, 58 of the 950 oxygen beds at the government hospitals were vacant, while in private hospitals 325 of the 2,586 oxygen beds were available. However, the ground reality was entirely different with every hospital turning away patients, citing unavailability of O2 beds.In Salem and Tirupur too, the situation was more or less similar, with ambulances carrying Covid patients shuttling from one hospital to another in search of beds with O2 or ventilators. “The hospital management has been taking steps to set up an additional 200 beds with oxygen facilities,” Dr R Murugesan, dean, Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital (SGMKMCH) told TOI.SGMKMCH has 800 beds, of which 550 are equipped with oxygen. Salem district administration has decided to upgrade oxygen equipped beds in the Omalur government hospital, which is close to the Salem city. The authorities are also planning to set up 40 beds in the upgraded primary health centre at Pethanaickenpalayam with the oxygen facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/western-region-accounts-for-every-fifth-ve-case-in-state/articleshow/82560153.cms||Mayilvaganan

Pointing out that 700 railway employees were already tested positive for the virus as they could not follow all precautions, he warned that the second wave was deadlier than the first one. “Only 50% attendance is allowed in offices.

Like last year, this year also, the pandemic-ravaged city will abstain from fun and frolic to celebrate the day. Jodhpur, founded by Rao Jodha on May 12, 1459 is observing its 563rd foundation day. But like always, there will not be any illuminated circles or decked up heritage buildings to mark the celebrations. Mehrangarh Fort Assistant Director (R&A) Mahendra Singh Tanwar said that there would not be any event or activity this time again due to the Covid lockdown. “It begins with floral tributes to Rao Jodha’s statue at Jaswant Thada and other martyrs and prayers at ‘Rao Jodhaji ka Falsa’ in the fort,” he said adding that none of such activities would be taking place this time also. With this pandemic lives being lost in droves, Jodhpur also recalls its tryst with similar pandemic in 1918, when the city was badly hit by plague and flu consecutively. “It is not new to Jodhpur. Similar arrangements like isolation centres, medication and ration supplies for affected families had been employed by the then ruler Sumer Singh in March 1918 when plague had spread during rain,” said Tanwar. The Marwar Residency then had discussed the formulae of “Swadeshi Quinine,” popular medicine prevalent for fever and flu then and had distributed it among the people affected with the infection. The pandemic lasted for about 9 months as plague was followed by an attack of flu (influenza) and Jodhpur lost maharaja Sumer Singh losing his life at a young age of 21 years while making arrangements in Marwar to protect the people of Marwar from this invisible enemy. “Hoarding and over-charging was punishable and cavalry marched across the town to keep watch on these shops and the houses,” said Tanwar. The government buildings had been turned into isolation centres then and only shops with food and ration items were allowed to open for designated time with fixed prices so that no one dies of hunger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/jodhpur-to-skip-foundation-day-functions/articleshow/82560194.cms||---

They say permission to operate businesses only between 5am and noon won’t help them and there are certain trades, like food business, that did not register any sale on the first day (Monday) of the new rule. They want the authorities to change the timings and allow them to open shops till at least 5pm.Gurdeep Singh Gosha, president of Business Bachao Morcha, says, “After our protest against the lockdown, the government allowed opening of shops. But the district administration took a weird decision and fixed time till 12pm for shops to function. How can shopkeepers do business when in majority of the markets it picks up after 11am? Customers also come in the afternoon and evening. On Monday, only shops dealing in essentials, like grocery, vegetables, fruits, among others, saw footfall. The non-essential shops did not do any business as people prefer doing important work first than go shopping when they have limited time.”“As there is a weekend lockdown, too, shopkeepers have only five days to operate. With these additional restrictions, how can they make profits to manage their expenses, pay their staff, taxes and power bills. Therefore, the timings should be revised to 5pm at least and we be allowed to operate on Saturday as well,” he adds.Manpreet Singh Bunty, president of Akalgarh Market, says, “Allowing shops to open till noon will only give partial relief that too to those who deal in essential goods. In our market, traders will suffer huge losses as majority of our sales are to retailers and shopkeepers of other cities in Punjab who visit in evenings or on weekends, both of which are impossible now. The administration must change the timings to 11am to 5pm.”Amarveer Singh, president of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana, says, “The new timings are a blow to the hospitality industry. On the first day, almost all restaurants, fast-food joints and cafes registered nil sales. How can food outlets do sale at 5am or 6am when even in routine 90% of their sales are in the evening and night. Their business starts only after 5pm. This permission will only cause losses.”Some shopkeepers are providing different services, like home delivery and exchange facility, in an attempt to make sales during the new timings.Shalini, sales executive of a garments shop in Model Town, says, “As the closing time of shops is noon, there will be very less footfall in outlets like ours. These timings will not suit our customers, who are women, as they have to meet several household responsibilities during early morning hours. Therefore, we have started some services like digital catalogue that can be accessed by customers on their cellphones. We will deliver the order free of cost and also with exchange facility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/allow-shops-to-open-till-5pm-businessmen/articleshow/82556822.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Dehradun||Post-Kumbh, Haridwar doing just 3000 Covid tests per day as cases rise||HARIDWAR: Testing for Covid-19 in Haridwar, the site of the recently concluded Maha Kumbh, has fallen sharply -- from an average of 20,000 tests daily in mid-April to just about 3000 now. On May 10, 2,830 samples were collected from Haridwar. According to the health department, around 6 lakh tests were done in Haridwar in April; 57,876 have been done so far in May. Of course, the thousands of pilgrims who had converged in the city for the Kumbh have mostly left, but sources in the local administration said that a figure of 3000 for the entire district was way too low., especially when cases were witnessing a sharp spike. Haridwar, as of Tuesday, had 12,457 active cases, up from 10,399 active cases on May 1 (a day after the Kumbh concluded). Of all 13 districts in Uttarakhand, it has the second highest case count after Dehradun, which is the worst affected. A senior health department official, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI that during Kumbh, the many temporary labs that were set up shut after the festival. “After Kumbh ended, testing stopped at the district's borders as well. This led to a decline in testing,” the official said. Both the Uttarakhand high court and the Centre had then asked for at least 50,000 tests to be done daily in Haridwar during the Kumbh, but that target was never achieved. It consistently fell short by almost 70%. Social activist Sunil Aroda, who arranges for critical supplies for Covid-affected families, said Haridwar has descended into chaos. “We receive numerous calls daily for ICU and ventilator beds but manage to find only a few. There are limited ICU and ventilator beds in the three private hospitals here. Patients, wanting to avoid hospitals at all costs, are also dying at home. I do not understand why the health department is not increasing testing and staff in the government hospitals,” he said. No government lab offers RT-PCR tests in Haridwar district but the administration has tasked two private labs in Haridwar and Roorkee to conduct these tests. The health department can also send 1,400 samples from Haridwar daily to Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) and AIIMS-Rishikesh for testing. Haridwar chief medical officer Dr. SK Jha said, “Testing was reduced after the Kumbh concluded. We have limited capacity now. We are focusing on contact tracing. However, we have been doing more tests compared to the other districts.” Secretary (health) Amit Negi said that the district has been asked to increase the testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/post-kumbh-haridwar-doing-just-3k-covid-tests/day-as-cases-rise/articleshow/82556817.cms||MS Nawaz

On the first day of the protest, they tied black bands and staged a protest in JLN Hospital. The association of resident doctors said for two days they will continue working with black bands and from third day they will boycott work for an hour and go on complete strike from May 17. The association said they were working with full responsibility during the pandemic but the state government was not fulfilling their demands. Other demands of the resident doctors are those doing Covid duty should be given hard duty allowance. The Rs 5,000 incentive declared by state government last year for resident doctors working in Covid centres be given immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/resident-docs-threaten-strike-in-ajmer/articleshow/82560224.cms||---
---||Goa||As Covid mortalities rise, hawkish hearses rake in the moolah||PANAJI: For the family of a Covid-19 patient, death is not the end. A struggle of another kind begins when it’s time to plan for the victim’s final rites. Long waiting hours are par for the course, as many times, the state’s 108 ambulances aren’t free to transport a body. Unless, of course, the family is willing to hire a private hearse — but that could cost them Rs 15-18k. For a while now, the private hearse vans parked outside Goa Medical College (GMC) have seen their profits shoot up as Covid-19 mortalities have spiked sharply. The hospital's morgue is the biggest in the state, and receives 30-35 bodies a day, while 20-25 are disbursed. “Four to five hearse (108) vans are not adequate for the speedy transportation of bodies, and poor relatives of the deceased are forced to pay hefty sums unless they are willing to wait the whole day or more for a government hearse van is available,” an official said. There’s usually a lone body-handler posted at the morgue, and the waiting time for family to get possession of a body is long. “More hands are required in the morgue to handle bodies, so that relatives of the deceased don’t have to wait long, but the request is yet to be met,” said a doctor from the department of forensic medicine and toxicology. And as the many bodies wait in queue to be taken for their final rites, private hearse van operators — about five of them — call the shots and charge anything they deem fit, a source said. To make matters worse, at any given time, one or two official hearse vans are not available due to breakdowns, he said. After the government increased the number of hearse vans more than a year and a half ago, the source said that people’s reliance on private hearse vans had reduced considerably, but with the pandemic, they (private operators) have got an edge, and are exploiting the situation to the fullest. “Some can’t afford to pay Rs 15,000-18,000 for a hearse van, but they borrow the money to see that their departed family member gets a decent farewell,” he said. Of late, private operators have expanded their business. For Christian deceased persons, they offer a coffin with extra charges. “For funerary box plus four people to handle the body, they charge anything between Rs 18,000-20,000 in addition to transportation charges. The body is taken directly to the cemetery,” a source said. Many oblige and pay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-covid-mortalities-rise-hawkish-hearses-rake-in-the-moolah/articleshow/82562311.cms||Bindiya Chari

A bench of Justices Prasanna Varale and Nitin Borkar heard a petition by advocate Amritpal Singh Khalsa, who made reference to the US while seeking to declare “that for protection of one’s life and limb, the right to possess and keep firearm in self-defense is an integral part of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.” Khalsa’s petition said that since he handles sensitive matters, there are chances that some clients may harm him. Khalsa had applied for a firearm to the Thane police commissioner, who is the licensing authority, on January 6, 2020. But his application kept pending for a “total 407 days”. The judges noted that a letter of DCP (HQ1), Thane, said Singh’s application was submitted under the old format and the delay was due to pandemic. Disposing of the petition, the judges directed Khalsa to apply in the new format and the CP will decide his application “as early as possible and not later than 6 weeks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-right-to-firearms-a-regulated-right-in-mumbai-in-india/articleshow/82562369.cms||Rosy Sequeira

According to them, the situation has cost them several hundred crores as payments of previous deliveries made by them were unpaid and to add to their woes huge stocks of finished goods were lying unsold as there was no demand due to the lockdown. Sewing machine industrialists claimed they were now struggling to pay the expenses, like power bills and wages, among others.Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of the Sewing Machine Development Club (SMDC), said, “More than 95% of our customers are in other states, like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Rajasthan. With all these states currently under lockdown, sales of sewing machines have been reduced to zero. On one hand, there is no demand for goods and on the other, we are forced to carry on with production so that our workers do not go back to home states like last year when factories were closed. Sewing machine industry’s capital worth Rs 200 crore to Rs 300 crore has been stuck due to various reasons, including pending payments from our customers, finished goods not delivered and raw materials purchased for goods that are being manufactured.”Sokhi added, “If our sales do not start soon, we will not be able to pay taxes, power bills and salaries, and not even manage our personal expenses. We request the state and Central governments to take immediate steps to save our industry that is heading towards bankruptcy.”Kulwant Singh, general secretary of SMDC, said, “Sewing machine industry is in a very miserable condition, be it factory owners, shopkeepers or traders, everyone is slowly running out of funds. Both sales and payments from our customers have stopped. We are feeling helpless and need relief in recurring expenses, like electricity charges, taxes and bank interests.”According to Amarjit Singh Swan, president of Ludhiana Sewing Machine Industries’ Association, “Due to the lockdown, we have been impacted with multiple problems. Besides a steep fall in sales and blockage of pending payments, our industry is now facing another problem. A sewing machine is assembled using about a hundred parts, which are sold by the shopkeepers and traders whose shops and establishments are now allowed to open only for a few hours due to restrictions. So, if any factory or assembler wants to manufacture sewing machines and give work to the labourers, he cannot as he has no availability of parts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sewing-machine-inc-on-pins-and-needles-says-facing-huge-losses/articleshow/82556859.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Hyderabad||Pilgrim flow drops to record low in Tirumala, revenue dips||Tirupati: Pilgrim footfall at Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirumala on Monday reported an all-time low of 2,400. This is perhaps the lowest ever in the history of the temple. With the surging Covid-19 cases leading to full and partial lockdowns in many parts of the country, including in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the flow of devotees to the hill temple has dried up considerably over the last few weeks. While the temple was closed during the lockdown in the first wave of Covid-19 during March-June 2020, soon after its reopening the temple recorded an average footfall of 8,000 pilgrims. Tirumala temple is known for its large turnout of pilgrims round the year, the numbers often touching 1.25 lakh on weekends and festivals. Never in its history, the temple had witnessed a pilgrim turnout of less than 8,000 a day. Now, though the TTD is allowing devotees with darshan tickets to enter Tirumala even after 12 noon, when the 18-hour partial curfew announced by the state government comes into force, people have been reluctant to visit the temple during these pandemic times. While just 2,400 devotees visited the temple on Monday, about 1,375 devotees got their heads tonsured as part of fulfilment of their vows as the hill town wore a deserted look. The low pilgrim footfall also saw the temple’s hundi collections dip to an all-time low of Rs 24 lakh. The hundi collection on normal days hovers between Rs 3 crore to Rs 5 crore daily. Even during the first wave Covid-19 restrictions, the hundi collection never dropped below Rs 1 crore a day. Officials expect a further dip in the pilgrim footfall as Telangana government on Tuesday announced near-lockdown restricting public movement. The temple witnesses huge rush during summers particularly during April and May. But this time with the rush coming down considerably, the TTD has also cut down the production of laddu prasadam from a daily 3.5 lakh to five lakhs to a mere 10,000 laddus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pilgrim-flow-drops-to-record-low-in-tirumala-revenue-dips/articleshow/82562340.cms||---

According to forest staff, the leopard reached the village, located around 7km away from Bholi range of RNP in search of food, and attacked Sivraj Ram Mali when he entered his cattle shed to milch buffaloes. Mali had a narrow escape as the leopard ran away after he shouted. Forest staff said he was rushed to the district hospital from where he was discharged after treatment. The leopard then attacked Ramji Lal Mali and Pink Mali before it finally hid in a haystack. Bhupendra Singh, who was involved in the rescue operation said, “It took atleast 90 minutes to dart the animal as it hid in a haystack. The staff also had to remove many logs, which were obstructing vision.” The villagers living under fear finally heaved a sigh of relief after the operation was successful around 9.45 am. After the operation, the leopard was released in Masalpur region of Karauli. Singh said, “The decision was taken by our seniors to release the leopard in that block to pair up with female leopard, which was released a few days ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/six-year-old-leopard-rescued-by-rnp-employees/articleshow/82560195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Today, Shirsat, who heads the volunteer group ‘United As One’, and his fellow warriors are sought by relatives of Covid patients needing plasma, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines not just in Mumbai, but also from cities like Delhi, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. “When my mother and I recovered from the coronavirus infection, I thought god had saved me to do something for society,” said Shirsat, 41, a real estate developer and general secretary, city Congress (Mumbai north west district committee). “I am a seven-time plasma donor. Several people have been approaching me and we have so far arranged plasma for 70 people.” Seeing the increasing demand for plasma, he began the Mumbai Plasma Drive on May 2. “Similar drives will be started in Delhi and Bengaluru too,” he said. What began as a small WhatsApp group with a handful of volunteers now has around 300 members working round the clock to help those in need. He says he recently received a call from a man, requesting him to get a hospital bed for his father. The same night, he got a distress call for an ICU bed as the hospital didn’t have it. “We began a hunt for an ICU bed and in two hours the patient was admitted to the NESCO centre. His condition is improving,” he said. “Requests come at all hours. Nobody in our group charges a single paisa. It is our way of paying back to society.” He said he started by initially distributing face shields free among police constables and must have handed out around 500 face shields so far. When people desperately needed medical oxygen, his group swung into action. They have provided 1,100 oxygen cylinders till now. “We get the cylinders filled at Khopoli and have them delivered to wherever the request comes from,” he explained. He says Covid care centres, Tata Memorial Hospital, other hospitals and individuals, all dial him and his volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-41-yr-old-who-beat-covid-starts-volunteer-group-to-help-patients/articleshow/82560230.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The Kovilpalayam police identified the accused as K Vinothkumar, a resident of Molapalayam village near Annur. An investigation officer said Vinothkumar had visited his 35-year-old friend Puviyarasan’s estranged wife Monisha, 32, who was living with her 61-year-old mother Prema Theophlus at a rental house at Textool Nagar, two weeks ago. “Monisha, who is working as a human resource manager with a private school at Saravanampatti, had separated from her husband, a resident of Attadi near Coonoor in the Nilgiris, because of differences of opinion two months ago. When Vinothkumar visited her, he realized that her mother would be alone at home during the day, when Monisha leaves for work,” the officer said. When Monisha returned from work in the evening of April 30, the officer said, she found her mother dead with gold ornaments missing from her body. She alerted the Kovilpalayam police, who registered a case and initiated probe. Postmortem revealed that Prema was strangulated to death. During the inquiry, her neighbours told police that a man had visited her house in the afternoon on the fateful day. Further investigation revealed that it was Vinothkumar who visited Prema and he had gone into hiding after committing the crime. “He was arrested during a vehicle check at Vilankurichi on Tuesday morning. We have recovered the stolen gold ornaments from him. He was produced before a judicial magistrate court, which remanded him in judicial custody,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-held-for-killing-woman-61-for-gold/articleshow/82560219.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party neta, 2 more booked for defaming BJP MP Sanjay Seth in Lucknow||Lucknow: The Lucknow police on Tuesday lodged an FIR against Samajwadi Party spokesman IP Singh and two others for allegedly defaming BJP MP Sanjay Seth and his family on social media. The SP leader and two others, Ramdutt Tiwari and Mahendra Kudiya, had allegedly dragged the name of the MP’s family in a case related to the death of a 41-year-old Thai woman in the city earlier this month. The FIR was lodged at Gautampalli police station under Section 500 (defamation) of the IPC and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act on the basis of the complaint lodged by the MP’s officer on special duty (OSD) Anup Kumar Pandey. Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur said the probe into the case had already begun. “One of them, Kudiya, has already apologized to the BJP MP on Twitter and has tagged Lucknow police in the tweet,” said Thakur. Kudiya’s Twitter profile says he is a journalist. In his complaint, Pandey said: “I was told by my friends that some fake posts defaming Sanjay Seth and his family are being circulated on social media. A person IP Singh posted something on Twitter and it was retweeted by Ramdutt Tiwari with a photograph. There is a need to probe this and find the source of the post. The content of the post was bizarre and false. One Mahendra Kudiya also shared the post. Similar posts were also circulated on WhatsApp.” He demanded a probe into the identity and details of the woman, details of her stay in Lucknow and her contacts. “Some people are using social media to disturb peace in the country and are ruining the image of people in the society,” the complaint said. Alleging that the FIR was lodged against him under “political pressure”, Singh tweeted, “I have been told through friends in the media that a case has been registered against me. The woman died without treatment and the name of a prominent businessman appeared in media reports. There was no question asked on police laxity and no action against those responsible. My crime: To demand an investigation.” Kudiya tweeted, “Sanjay Seth ji, I would like to apologise for not verifying the fake news and tweeting it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-neta-2-more-booked-for-defaming-bjp-mp/articleshow/82562336.cms||---

The accused, who is a student, had claimed through his counsel Pradeep Khatri that he only tried to procure Remdesivir through social media for his friend’s grandmother who was suffering from Covid-19. “Considering the fact that the accused is of very young age, is a student, has no previous involvement, is in custody since April 27, 2021, is a known case of bronchial asthma and the current pandemic situation, he is released on bail....," said additional sessions judge Kiran Gupta. The applicant, Harshit Bansal, was arrested in a case filed under IPC Sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and relevant provisions of Epidemic Diseases Act and Essential Commodities Act. Bansal was arrested based on the alleged disclosure statement of the main accused named Sudhir Dahiya, who was arrested for black-marketing of Remdesivir injections at a price of Rs 58,000 for a single injection.

Eid is likely to be celebrated in the city either on Thursday or Friday, depending on appearance of the crescent. “We have already asked the people to celebrate the festival in a simple manner and avoid unnecessary expenditure. Also, we have asked them to help Covid patients in these testing times and provide monetary support to them. We have also told them to ensure that they support the poor as many don’t have work,” said Shahi Imam, Punjab, Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi. Naib Shahi Imam Maulana Usman Ludhianvi said they had asked the deputy commissioner to change timing for lock down from 5am to noon as the present timing is not suitable for Eid shopping. He added that though they would have Eid prayers, but the same would be with 20-50 persons that too by following social distancing, wearing of masks and body temperature of each person would be checked before the prayers. In the neighbouring Malerkotla, which has a sizeable Muslim population, Mufti-E-Azam Punjab Irtekaul Hassan has asked the community members to follow social distancing during Eid prayers. “Namaz will be offered, but with social distancing. Earlier we would have prayers at 4-5 places, but now we will be holding Eid Namaz at 20-50 places so that very less people gathered at each spot. We have asked people to say Eid prayers in open spaces, vacant plots and in their own streets,” said Mufti-e-Azam Punjab. Community members have said that since Covid-19 was at its peak, so they had decided to keep celebrations simple. “Earlier we would say Eid prayers in big gatherings and meet people and visit our relatives, but this time we will offer such prayers in open spaces. Also we are not going to visit relatives and they too might not come in view of Covid surge. We are not allowing children, who would normally go out on Eid to celebrate, out as the fear of Covid looms large,” Muhammad Mushtaq, a businessman from Pakhowal Road, said. Meanwhile, messages are doing round on social media asking the community members to do charity on Eid and help those affected with Covid directly or indirectly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/call-for-simple-eid-help-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82556891.cms||Shariq Majeed

Reacting on the issue, state education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said, “The teachers who are on the field will be vaccinated as mentioned in the list but other than that, it is difficult for us to vaccinate everyone because of the acute shortage of vaccines. It is better to vaccinate those people who are working on the field every day. We don’t want to include the entire teacher’s department and then fail to vaccinate them. When the supply will become normal, everyone will be vaccinated.” Currently, more than 1 lakh government teachers are conducting a door-to-door survey to prepare a list of people suffering from fever or Covid symptoms. In total, government teachers’ number is 3.15 lakh. Narayan Singh Sisodia, spokesperson of Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh said that if there is a shortage of vaccines, then other teachers should not be sent on field. “Government must make sure that non-vaccinated teachers should not go on field. We must not risk the lives of these teachers unnecessarily,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tough-to-vaccinate-all-teachers-dotasra/articleshow/82560259.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Overconfident youngsters are super-spreaders: Survey||RAJKOT: Overconfident youngsters sauntering around on the roads, believing that they have strong immunity, are the biggest contributors to the menacing surge of Covid-19 infections in and around the city. This has been revealed in an elaborate field survey carried out by researchers of Rajkot-based Saurashtra University who tried to find who the virus superspreaders were. Dimpal Ramani and Hasmukh Chavda, both assistant professors, surveyed 1,080 who were found roaming outside without any genuine reason and found that 71% of them were in the age group of 15-40 years. “We saw that vegetable vendors or grocery shop owners were often dubbed as superspreaders. But we have found that these youngsters are actually responsible for the spread as they not only move around without reason but also give two hoots to Covid rules like mask and social distancing,” said Ramani. They decided to carry out the survey as the number of daily cases in the city continue to remain high despite night curfew and a near lockdown of commercial activities. Rajkot city has recorded 38,305 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak of pandemic last year. Researchers said these youngsters are unable to confine themselves to the four walls of the house and venture out by giving various excuses to their family members. In the survey, 17% people found moving outside without reason were from the age of 40-55 while 12% were above the age of 56. Ramani said “We found that teenagers and youngsters are the actual superspreaders because they venture out by giving various excuses or convincing their parents with emotional blackmail.” Yogesh Jogsan, head of the SU’s psychology department said, “These youngsters are unmarried and they don’t have family responsibility. They believe their immunity is strong but the senior citizens of their families and children get infected as these youths are virus carriers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/overconfident-youngsters-are-super-spreaders-survey/articleshow/82558563.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: In keeping with Ramzan spirit, rozedars give away home-cooked meals to Covid-hit families||DEHRADUN: While the pandemic’s second wave has resulted in a muted Ramzan this year, as many are hospitalized with Covid-19 and others are confined to their homes, many rozedars in Uttarakhand are delivering home-cooked meals to Covid-affected families for free. This was a way of fulfilling Ramzan’s spirit of giving and togetherness, they told TOI. Tasnima Kauser, an artisan from Doon, packs the meals she sends with uplifting messages like “get well soon” and “keep smiling”. She recently uploaded a video on social media, providing a contact number for anyone who wanted a meal. “I am going on the ten-day long special prayers (Aiteykaaf) of Ramzan so I will not be able to take calls. Therefore, request you all, whoever is in need of a meal, to place your requests with my colleague,” she said in the video. Shaista Shaikh, a practising advocate from Sahastradhara who also cooks and sends meals to families struggling with the disease, told TOI, “The Covid’s second wave, while being so disruptive, has also brought out togetherness in people. Brotherhood has found its true meaning at this time with people standing by each other, humans irrespective of cast, colour and creed. We are sending food to struggling families along with a prayer, and praying to Allah that they all heal quickly,” Shaikh said. Shishab Tasneem Farooqui, who runs a real estate firm in the city, said, “We are running an initiative of delivering food to people who need it at this time. We are a group of 40-45 people. Eight men cook the meals and deliver them on receiving requests.

---||Goa||Yet another high as Goa records 75 deaths in one day||PANAJI: The state reported 75 Covid-19 fatalities on Tuesday, the highest for a single-day since the pandemic began. Also, the number of daily infections again crossed the 3,000 mark, even as the positivity rate dropped marginally to 37%. In just 11 days of May, the state has seen 622 fatalities, with half of them occuring at Goa Medical College (GMC). On Tuesday, 48 of the 75 deaths were at GMC, while 17 died at the South Goa district hospital and five at private hospitals. The youngest fatality of the day was a 34-year-old man from Salcete. Two patients — a 70-year-old unknown male and an 84-year-old man from Orlim — were brought dead to hospital. Ten patients died within 24 hours of their admission. With fluctuations in oxygen supply continuing for yet another day at GMC, patients’ relatives and attendants took to social media to post frantic appeals. “Pramod Sawant please help. This cannot be happening again and again. What is going on? There’s such a huge shortage of cylinders in GMC,” posted Ashley Delaney in a Facebook post. Another post read, “This cannot be happening all the time. This is just not done,” hours before chief minister Pramod Sawant visited GMC’s Covid wards on Tuesday morning. As of Tuesday, there were 32,835 actives cases in Goa. The day also saw 321 hospitalisations, the highest in 24 hours, and 178 patients were discharged. With no beds or even trolleys, several patients continue to be on the floors of GMC’s wards. A patient’s relative asked on social media if anybody could help her sister suffering from severe pneumonia get an ICU bed. “She needs to be in ICU due to her severity, but they have kept her in the general ward. Last night, the oxygen supply was off for a while in her ward, and two patients died at that time. My sister became breathless,” she said in her post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-another-high-as-goa-records-75-deaths-in-one-day/articleshow/82562354.cms||---

Emboldened by the absence of tough action on those venturing out, several people were out in public places compared to Monday. Although offices, shops and commercial establishments were closed, scores of people on two-wheelers and several others in cars were seen driving on the roads. Police have started stopping the vehicles and advising them not to venture out unnecessarily. Some of the motorists said that they were construction workers or electricians while some gave excuses to police like they were going out to hotels to buy food. “Yesterday, I didn’t come out because of stringent action by police. But today the contractor I work for called me in the morning for work,” said a mason who was going to a construction site at Ramanathapuram. Towards evening, people were seen stepping out of their houses for walks and in groups in some places of the city. Police said that they were told not to be tough with the public. During the previous total lockdown last year, police used to punish those who were loitering out. “Now we are stopping them to inquire the reason for venturing out. If they give a genuine reason, we let them go. Or else we turn them away,’’ a police officer said. However, police said that if more people start coming out of houses, they would have no choice but to act tough.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/motorists-crowd-roads-on-day-2/articleshow/82560250.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Set up paediatric ICUs as 3rd wave buffer, says chief minister Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Anticipating a third Covid wave, which experts suggest could severely affect children, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to immediately ramp up infrastructure and set up paediatric ICUs in all districts. A government spokesperson said, the chief minister was reacting to expert assessments on a probable third wave and said, arrangements should be in place to protect children. “Paediatric ICUs with a minimum capacity of 10-15 beds in all district hospitals and 25-30 beds in medical colleges should be set up. Also, there should be a paediatric ICU at divisional headquarters with a minimum capacity of 100 beds,” he said. Experts claimed the third Covid wave could be lethal for children as most adults or at least a large percentage of the population would have been inoculated by then and children, who have mostly been safe from the virus, would become more susceptible. The CM also said, necessary medical equipment and medicines should be procured and physicians and healthcare staff should be trained to handle the crisis. With beds being added to hospitals, the chief minister stressed on the need to mobilise more staff, including nurses, health and sanitation staff. He said, final-year medics, paramedics, interns and retired professions can be employed. The government is likely to start appointments under these categories within a week, said sources. Also, health and medical education departments have been directed to ensure availability of medicines, including Remdesivir. “The Centre has raised the daily allocation of Remdesivir for Uttar Pradesh. In government Covid hospitals, this injection is available for free. The district magistrate and chief medical officer are making the injection available at private hospitals as per requirement. The government spokesperson said, ventilators and oxygen concentrators have been provided in all districts and additional chief secretary (health) and principal secretary (medical education) have been asked to ensure the devices remain operational. He said, if these are lying idle or defunct, the DM and CMO will be held responsible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/set-up-paediatric-icus-as-3rd-wave-buffer-yogi/articleshow/82562373.cms||Neha Lalchandani

While it took a year to register 8,169 cases of Covid-19 from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, the district has recorded 9,694 cases in just 40 days from April 1 to May 11 this year, an official from the health department said. Forty-five people died of Covid-19 in the district till March 31, 2021. The district registered 895 cases on Monday, the highest ever in the past year. “At present, 2,984 positive cases are being treated across the district,” the official said, adding that 32 people had succumbed to the infection in the last 40 days. Activist K Ramamurthi said hundreds of people from the district are working in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. “They had returned to their homes after the lockdown was imposed in those states. Many didn’t go for health check-up and became spreaders of the virus in the district,” he said. Many were not maintaining social distancing and refused to wear face masks. “This is also another reason for the spread of the virus in the district,” he added. He urged the state government to increase the beds with oxygen facilities at the government hospital in the town. “Beds in private and government hospitals are fast being occupied with Covid-19 patients. It is the need of the hour to increase beds and oxygen-equipped beds,” he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/krishnagiri-dist-is-now-a-hotspot-for-covid-19/articleshow/82560267.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Immune response triggered by first dose does not disappear due to delay’||Counselling recipients to not panic, immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune has said the first dose has already triggered an immune response which does not disappear because of delay in administering a second dose, only that it’s not optimum, and hence the second is needed. “A booster (second) dose essentially increases quality and quantity of the first dose response,” she said, warning senior citizens to avoid crowded immunisation centres for the second dose since the risk of infection may outweigh the benefit. The first dose remains in the body with a limited half-life. All antibodies produced are proteins that degrade over time. “So, the immune response generated by the first dose may possibly start tapering off after 4-5 months,” Bal added. The duration between two Covishield doses was increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks primarily based on data from international trials where after a first dose immune response was measured until the second dose was given. “In some cases, due to trial related issues, the second dose was given as late as 12 weeks and still the effect of the first dose was pretty much okay,” she added. For Covaxin,a variation in duration between first and second dose was not tested in human beings though. “The makers uniformly tested at the end of four weeks. That's why everybody is recommending booster for Covaxin at the end of 28 days. Theoretically, if there is enough response that lasted four weeks, maybe it will last up to fifth week too. But we don’t know that since there is no data,” Bal added. In the UK, recommended gap between doses of Covishield is 12 weeks, while in Canada, authorities have opted for up to 16 weeks. Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at CMC, Vellore, had told TOI that a study by Public Health England (linked to the UK variant) has shown 65% protection against symptomatic Covid-19 and 80% against a severe form of the disease after a single dose of Covishield. Dr Arora also reiterated that even if a person contracts Covid after the first dose and takes 6-10 weeks to recover, he/she must complete the vaccination schedule by taking the second dose after recovery. Dr Naveen Thacker, executive director of the International Pediatric Association, said it is from an immunology perspective that experts suggest a 'minimum' interval, instead of 'maximum', between doses. He said, "irrespective of the vaccine, it is always better to have a slightly longer gap in most cases. In case of Covaxin, data published so far suggests a minimum interval of four to six weeks, but perhaps a longer gap could be more effective. Either way, those due for their second shots must take it even if it's delayed.” Dr Thacker too said the first shot is not needed again if the follow-up is delayed. "For children’s vaccination, the dictum 'pick up from where one left off' is followed. If repeating a schedule (in case of a delayed second dose) is not done in children - who have a weaker immune response - then it is not recommended for Covid vaccination in adults too," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-immune-response-triggered-by-first-dose-does-not-disappear-due-to-delay/articleshow/82560293.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Fraudsters dupe patients’ kin who seek online help||JAIPUR: Abhinav Sharma (22) of Jagatpura here is frantically calling up the cyber cell of Jaipur to register his complaint against an unknown person for duping him of Rs 8,000. Sharma, whose father is down with Covid, was looking for an oxygen cylinder on an urgent basis and had posted a request on Twitter. “Somebody forwarded the number to me for oxygen cylinder with a disclaimer that nothing needs to be paid until the cylinder is delivered at your doorstep. Since the condition of my father was not good, I had gone against the advice and transferred Rs 8,000 as a security amount on that contact number,” said Sharma, whose father Upendra Narayan Shastri is a veteran. The caller didn’t respond thereafter and after a while blocked his number. After calling from another number, the fraudster made fun of him and disconnected the call. This is not a case in isolation. Every day, several Covid patients’ relatives/friends end up losing money to fraudsters who promise to deliver oxygen on the condition of depositing money online. Many police stations have received complaints about the same in the last two weeks. The scamsters based in West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh get the numbers of the distressed from social media and take advantage of the urgency of patients. An IT expert, Arnab Sarkar, who lives in Mansarovar is still surprised how he was fooled by an online oxygen scamster. Sarkar had sourced the number for an oxygen cylinder for his uncle down with Covid. “The person asked for Rs 5,500 for a 15-litre oxygen cylinder, which we agreed considering the urgency. He asked that 50% payment should be made in advance. Thereafter, he said that the full amount has to be paid since they had some technical issue and after much debate, we again agreed as we were racing against time. The cylinder never came,” said Sarkar, who added he was aware of the tactics. Reacting to the cases, Ajay Pal Lamba, ACP, Jaipur Police Commissionerate, urged people that they should not make any payment against any medical service until they have verified it by themselves. “||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fraudsters-dupe-patients-kin-who-seek-online-help/articleshow/82560290.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Covid-19 tally zooms past 1L-mark in dist||Coimbatore: The Covid-19 tally in the district crossed the one lakh-mark on Tuesday, when it recorded more than 2,500 fresh cases for the third consecutive day. The daily caseload, as per the state health bulletin, stood at 2,650, pushing the tally up to 1,00,546. The district has recorded 44,300 cases in just two months, compared to 56,246 cases it logged in nearly a year from March 22, 2020, to March 10, 2021. As per the data, 46% of the 1,00,546 cases was recorded from March 10, when the second wave had just begun, to May 11 this year. The number of active cases in the district has also touched a record high of 14,324, even as 1,723 patients were discharged from various treatment centres. The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, shot up by 19 to 793 on the day. It is to be noted that experts had earlier predicted that the district, which was recording hardly two deaths a day in March last week, would see a spike in fatality rate a fortnight after the surge in the daily caseload. They said the 19 deaths itself was a fraction of the 70-odd Covid-19 deaths that were recorded in the government hospitals alone in the district. Reportedly, there is a shortage of slots in crematoriums. R Veerapandian, a resident of Periyanaickenpalayam, said, “We have been trying to find a crematorium for our relative who died of old age, but couldn’t get a slot. Now we are planning to keep the body in a mortuary until we get a slot.” While the demand for remdesivir is still high, the queue at the Coimbatore Medical College was more regulated on the third day of the sale on Tuesday. It had sold the anti-viral drug to around 63 people by noon. Dr Madhan, who heads the remdesivir sales counter, said they had begun issuing 50 tokens to the attenders of patients with more than 25% lung involvement on verification of RT-PCR result copy. “This way, we can keep the remaining 33 vials for emergency cases. We can sell 500 doses (six doses per patient) to 83 people a day. We also have limited the number of doses one can buy, to prevent bulk purchases,” he told TOI. Priya Muruganantham, who bought the medicine for her aunt whose pulse is dropping and is breathless, said the waiting time seemed to be one or two days presently. She had taken the token on Monday after two days of waiting and picked up the doses on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-19-tally-zooms-past-1l-mark-in-dist/articleshow/82560303.cms||---

BJP MP Manoj Kotak said, “All complexes don’t have space for a waiting room, vaccination room and observation room. They also don’t have enough members to engage private hospitals for a drive. BMC must allow a few of them to come together and it must appoint nodal officers or allow NGOs or local organisations to be nodal officers for such clusters.” Congress MLA Amin Patel also sought a plan for doorstep vaccination for slums and chawls. “These people face a lot of issues for online registration and they must have a split of online and offline walk-in vaccinations,” Patel said.

In an article — Uttar Pradesh going the last mile to stop Covid-19 — published on its official website, WHO considered details of UP’s massive campaign in 97,941 villages in 75 districts. “Uttar Pradesh government has initiated house-to-house active case finding of Covid-19 in rural areas to contain transmission by testing people with symptoms for rapid isolation, disease management and contact tracing,” the article stated. The importance of the exercise may be gauged from the fact that, as per data, pandemic was shifting to rural areas. Speaking about the drive and WHO’s mention in its website, additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal said: “Over four lakh symptomatic persons were identified in the exercise. Of these, 4,500 tested positive through the rapid antigen test. Arrangements to isolate others have been made. Prophylactic medication has been initiated.” The article noted that as many as 1,41,610 teams led by 21,242 supervisors have been deployed by the state health department for active case finding exercise spanning five days. “Each monitoring team has two members, who visit houses in villages and remote hamlets to test everyone with Covid symptoms using Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) kits. Those who test positive are quickly isolated and given a medicine kit with advice on disease management. Contacts of those who test positive are quarantined and tested using an RT-PCR at home by a rapid response team,” it said. It added that two mobile vans have been allocated to each block in a district in the state to test people with symptoms, even as routine sample collection and testing continues in community health centres. “WHO, which supported Uttar Pradesh government in training and micro planning for the activity, now has field officers on the ground to monitor and share real-time feedback with the government for immediate corrective action. On the inaugural day, WHO field officers monitored over 2,000 government teams and visited at least 10,000 households,” the article said, adding WHO will also support the Uttar Pradesh government in compilation of the final reports. The article concluded by stating that those with symptoms are tested and given medicine kits and information on quarantining and isolation, both at home and hospitals. People without symptoms are urged to get vaccinated and follow Covid-appropriate behaviours to prevent transmission in rural areas of India’s most populated state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/who-praises-ups-door-to-door-covid-testing-in-villages/articleshow/82562399.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Restrictions on Telangana and Andhra Pradesh passengers travelling to Delhi has led to many last-minute cancellations by people, forcing the airlines to cancel the flights. “I was to go to visit Delhi for some personal work on May 12. However, due to the restrictions imposed by the government, I decided to cancel my trip and postpone it to a later date,” said Vinay Pulugundla, a resident of Kondapur. Not just this, the South Central Railway (SCR) is also facing a similar issue wherein people are not willing to travel to the national capital by train. According to SCR sources, about 250 passengers who travelled from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been sent to 14-day institution quarantine in Delhi after they failed to procure a Covid-19 negative certificate. “All the passengers arriving from the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to national capital territory of Delhi from May 10, 2021 onwards by train shall have to undergo mandatory government institutional quarantine/paid quarantine for a period of 14 days at facilities established/identified by the concerned district magistrate,” read a press release issued by South Central Railway. The Telangana government’s decision to impose 10 days lockdown also led to massive confusion among passengers travelling to various cities. “Hi @RGIAHyd and @IndiGo6E.

However, with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) doing away with the mandatory online registration for those above the age of 45 years, Pathak was able to get her first dose. “We were trying to get an appointment for the past few days, but slots were getting booked within no time. Thanks to the civic authorities, I could take my first dose as they have started allowing on-site registration for beneficiaries,” she said. AMC immunization officer Dr Smita Nalgirkar on Tuesday said those who are above 45 years can do spot registration at vaccination sites for the first as well as the second dose. “Citizens should ensure that no crowding takes place at vaccination sites and social distancing norms are followed. Those who are interested can seek appointment at the vaccination site through CoWIN portal as well,” she said. In a similar measure, Hingoli has removed the need to pre-register on CoWIN platform for citizens above the age of 60 for both the doses. “Also, no online registration is required for the second dose of Covaxin for all age-groups,” an official notification said. Meanwhile, in keeping with the directives of the state government, the AMC will focus on vaccination of those needing the second dose by suspending the immunization programme for 18-44 years age-group from Tuesday. “Vaccination centres having availability of Covishield and Covaxin will be declared by AMC every evening as per current practice and those needing the second dose should get themselves vaccinated,” Nalgirkar said. As per official data, so far around 32.6% beneficiaries across all identified categories have taken both doses of the vaccine. Till Tuesday, the progressive count of vaccination within municipal limits of Aurangabad has reached to 2,70,315, including 95,218 beneficiaries aged between 45 to 59 having comorbidities followed by 81,054 senior citizens, 46,876 frontline workers, 40,662 healthcare workers and 6,505 between the age of 18 and 44.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/45-beneficiaries-welcome-walk-in-vaccination-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/82555005.cms||---

While compulsion of referral for admission in divisional and district hospitals was ended, hue and cry for ICU beds also reduced massively. As per the the morning report on bed availability at L-3 and L-2 facilities of the government and private hospitals, a total of 33 patients were admitted to DRDO’s hospital by Tuesday morning. Talking to TOI, the district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that critical Covid patients, who needed ventilator and other ICU facilities, are being admitted to DRDO’s hospital on being referred from government and private hospitals of Varanasi and adjoining districts. Apart from carrying their prescription and referral letter of hospital, the patients or their attendants are required to get confirmation for admission from Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre and also DRDO hospital by forwarding details on their WhatsApp numbers- 7307413510 and 7307015441 respectively. The patients should get discharged from the hospital, where he or she is admitted, only after getting confirmation for admission from DRDO hospital. Beginning of DRDO’s facility has changed the statics of vacant and occupied beds in L-3 and L-2 facilities of eight government and 51 private hospitals. Of 441 beds in L-3 facilities of BHU’s super speciality hospital and DRDO hospital 230 were vacant on Tuesday morning while of 592 L-2 beds as many as 183 were vacant. In private hospitals 80 of 313 in L-3 facility and 574 of 1,665 beds in L-2 facility were vacant. While the pressure had started reducing on the hospitals, especially, with L-2 facilities is past one week with the decrease in the new Covid-19 positive cases, the DRDO facility has brought respite mainly to the government hospitals, said the officials. Now, the compulsion of referral from any doctor or hospital for admission at L-2 facilities of SPG divisional and DDU district hospitals has been ended, said the DM adding that now patients can directly go to these facilities to get admitted and treatment. Similar facility will be available for non-Covid patients, he added. More relief was announced by the UP minister Neelkanth Tiwari that now patients can also reach these two hospitals for admission even in the night hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/drdo-covid-hospital-brings-respite-improves-bed-statistics-in-other-hosps/articleshow/82560300.cms||---

The sight of their plight was something more than he could live with. And his conscience didn’t allow him to be a mere silent spectator. On Tuesday, he met district superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinamand and donated his one-month salary - Rs 34,474 - to the chief minister’s public relief fund for Covid-19. Babu had donated his one-month salary to the chief minister’s Covid-19 relief fund last year as well. “I noticed a lot of ambulances that were waiting at the hospital with Covid-19 patients, who were struggling without getting enough oxygen. So, I decided to donate my one-month salary to the chief minister’s public relief fund for Covid-19,” Babu, who has been working as a personal security officer to a Hindu outfit functionary for the past few months, told TOI. He also requested the public not to come out on the streets without any purpose. “Many don’t know the value of people’s lives and don’t bother about others’ health. People should work with the government to contain the virus spread.” A resident of Kalikkanaickenpatti village near Palani in Dindigul district, Babu is yet to get married. His father V Subramaniam, a retired constable, had died when Babu was just six years old, while his mother had died on April 27, 2019. Babu resides in the police quarters on the premises of the police recruitment school along with elder brother S Raja and his 20-year-old daughter R Bhuvana, 20. His family members are dependent on his monthly salary to make a living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cop-donates-1-month-salary-to-relief-fund/articleshow/82560334.cms||A Subburaj

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad PHC first in state to get O₂ generation plant||AURANGABAD: A primary health centre (PHC) at Waluj near Aurangabad has become the first in the state to have oxygen generation plant capable of catering to 48 patients round the clock. There are over 1,800 PHCs in the state, meeting the medical care requirements of 30,000 people. The PHC, which is surrounded by MIDC Waluj industrial area, was a six-bed hospital. During the pandemic last year, its spacious premises was utilized and it was upgraded to a 50-bed hospital. The capacity of this PHC was further increased to 100 beds in February this year, after the number of Covid-19 positive patients registered a surge in Gangapur tehsil. Authorities said that this oxygen generation plant has been setup with the financial assistance from the Jankidevi Bajaj Gram Vikas Sanstha. Aurangabad ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawale told TOI, “This is the first PHC in the state to have its own oxygen generation plant. If things go according to plan, some more PHCs will also get their independent oxygen generation plants in the district, thus bringing down the overall dependency on external supply of oxygen.” District health officer Dr Ulhas Gandal maintained that this oxygen generation plant can fill 30 jumbo cylinders within 24 hours. “Considering the current situation and challenges related to oxygen supply, this set up has come as a huge relief,” he said. He added that central oxygen line has been installed at the PHC and a total of 48 beds have been connected with it. “This is probably the best facility in any PHC in the state and we are working on improving it further,” said Dr Gandal. Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve, citing the rising number of cases in rural areas, demanded that many more such improvisations should be done at PHCs across rural areas, so that residents do not need to pay huge fees at private hospitals or head towards urban areas for seeking treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-phc-first-in-state-to-get-o-generation-plant/articleshow/82555054.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Talking to reporters after inspecting a 255-bed Covid hospital set up by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Singh said, “Mistakes are committed by those who perform. This is not the time for criticism. Instead of criticising, people should come forward and give suggestions to the government. They will be welcomed.” He said the swiftness displayed by the Centre in tackling Covid crisis should be praised. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted the pandemic as a challenge and the government is doing everything possible to tackle it,” he said, adding that many countries were helping India in the hour of crisis because of the diplomatic relations forged with them by the Prime Minister. Claiming that the World Health Organization (WHO) has “praised” the work of Uttar Pradesh government, he said it was “not a small thing”. On Monday, WHO had tweeted: “In #India’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh, the state gov. has initiated house-to-house active case finding of #COVID19 in rural areas to contain transmission by testing people with symptoms for rapid isolation, disease management & contact tracing (sic).” The 255-bed Covid hospital will have 25 ventilators and approximately 100 HFNCs (high flow nasal cannula). Thanking the PM and the Union defence minister, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, “A 500-bed Covid hospital set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was made functional at Lucknow’s Avadh Shilpgram and a 750-bed Covid hospital started operating in Varanasi on Monday. People should follow the guidelines of the Centre and the state government to help break the chain of transmission of the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rajnath-not-time-for-criticism-govt-taking-steps-to-check-surge/articleshow/82562433.cms||---

Ghazipur officials swung into action after bodies were found near Chausaghat, Buxar following which officials of Bihar claimed the corpses had flowed down from UP. As villagers panicked suspecting threat of outbreak of epidemic due to rotting bodies and sounded alarm, the district magistrates of Ghazipur and Buxar rushed SDMs, Ramesh Maurya of Sevarai and K K Pathak of Buxar for fact finding. During inspection, seven bodies were spotted in river Karmnasha before its confluence in Ganga on Ghazipur-Buxar border. DM Ghazipur M P Singh said, “All the bodies are heavily decayed and are suspected to have been disposed of days ago. It is difficult to trace from where bodies were disposed of in rivers, but we have asked police to find out whether villagers of our district are doing so.” “We are telling people that bodies are not to be disposed of in rivers, but have to be cremated. If they are not capable in cremating a body due to financial hardships or any other reason, they should inform police and local administration as funds and resources are available for this,” Singh added. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “Vigil has been increased after bodies were found floating in rivers. Our teams are on the ground and there is no major surge in Covid cases or fatalities in rural areas now.” Besides carrying out massive screening of rural population, collecting samples and distributing medicine kits to symptomatic persons, the monitoring of cremation grounds has also started, he added. Meanwhile, the situation at cremation ghats in Varanasi has improved. BHU neurologist Prof V N Mishra said, “From April 10, the number of bodies coming to Harischandra and Manikarnika ghats had increased, but after May 3, things are normal.” Gulshan Kapoor, manager of Mahashamshan Nath temple at Manikarnika Ghat said, “In normal days, 80-100 bodies come here, but the figure had increased threefold after April first week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bodies-spotted-in-river-ganga-trigger-panic-across-ghazipur-villages/articleshow/82560352.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The 44-year old on Tuesday said he had to run from pillar to post to get the issue fixed and undergo the vaccination. “I had registered myself on CoWIN portal on April 30 and got a slot between 9 am to 11 am. However, I could reach the vaccination site in evening and was told by authorities that I had missed the bus,” he said. Dismayed, Patil was planning to seek a fresh appointment but got a message in next couple of hours informing that he had received the first dose. “The next day, I went to Varud-Kasar primary health centre, a vaccination site. The authorities and staff present there distanced themselves from the issue and gave evasive reply,” he said. Patil said he followed the issue with local authorities for next few days, but to no avail. “I finally shared the issue with a political figure and through his intervention, I got my first dose on May 6,” he recalled. Aurangabad district immunization officer Vijaykumar Wagh said, “The first possibility is that he might have proved his identity at the vaccination site but could not take the vaccine. Secondly, a glitch could have happened in the central server. We will seek more details into the incident by tracking the beneficiary ID number,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-jab-but-man-still-gets-vax-cert-inoculated-later/articleshow/82555093.cms||Prasad Joshi

According to Chivvemla police of Suryapet district, the incident took place at Kuda Kuda village in Chivvemla mandal. At 11.30 am, unidentified fraudsters approached R Yellamma, 75, when she was sitting alone in front of her house in Kuda Kuda village. Family members of Yellammma had gone to attend cremation rituals of a villager and she was alone at home. “The fraudsters, posing as government workers distributing medicines for Covid-19, approached Yellamma and offered her four tablets,” Chivvemla police said. Yellamma initially refused to take the tablets saying that she already took both the doses of the vaccine. However, the fraudsters insisted that she should take the tablets for better protection against the disease. After Yellamma consumed the four tablets, the fraudsters left the place and again visited her after 10 minutes. “As Yellamma was still up, they gave her another tablet and a little while after consuming it, she dozed off. When she woke up at 4.30 pm, her three tolas gold chain was missing,” police said.

---||Nagpur||Govt intervenes to maintain supply chain from China, keep med prices in check||Nagpur: People are already paying huge money for specialized drugs for Covid-19, including anti-virals as well as steroids, due to the shortage. But even commonly used medicines like Paracetamol and Ivermectin would have been costlier, if the government of India and the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA) had not intervened and maintained the supply chain of raw material for these drugs from China. Just two weeks without supply from China had already pushed up prices of commonly used medicines for manufacturers in Indian markets. China’s national airline ‘Sichuan Airlines’ had suspended all cargo flights to India from April 26 following a surge in Covid cases in India. Due to this, the supply of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API) was stopped. Anticipating the flight suspension will continue, pharma manufacturers in Nagpur had started buying available stock at high rates from suppliers across India. “The price of Paracetamol surged to Rs900 per kg against Rs350 per kg, and Azithromycin to Rs14,000 against Rs8,500 during the past two weeks,” said a pharma manufacturer in the city. The prices are likely to come down now. Nagpur has many small pharma manufacturing companies, which produce such general medicines in units. About 50 such units are functioning in various parts of the district. The annual turnover of these companies is more than Rs700 crore. Ashok Kumar Madan, executive director of Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), revealed that the flight suspension too has been called off by the Chinese government now. “After Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, and the IDMA took efforts, it was ensured that flights will come from China with the necessary supply of pharma materials. Flights resumed from Tuesday. We are not expecting any shortage of API in near future,” said Madan. This has saved people from facing major price hikes for commonly used medicines. Maharashtra Registered Pharmacists Association president Kailas Tandale said, “We must be ‘atmanirbhar’ in pharma raw material now. Just a few days of flight suspension, and prices of commonly used medicines increased multifold for manufacturers. We must not depend any more on China patented salts and APIs for pharma manufacturing. “What is the point in buying Ivermectin from Rs15,000 per kg to Rs70,000 per kg, and Doxycycline from Rs6,000 per kg to Rs15,500?” he added. Pharma manufacturer Ranjit Sethi said India was a world leader in the production of API in the 1970s. “Even today, we are called pharmacy of the world. We should stop our dependency on other countries for raw material,” he said. CLOSE CALL Anticipation that China will not supply raw material (APIs) led to multifold rise in prices of many commonly used medicines for manufacturers Methylprednisolone, used in Covid-19, rose from Rs85,000 to Rs2.30 lakh within a week Paracetamol hiked from Rs350 to Rs900 per kg Ivermectin rose from Rs15,000 per kg to Rs70,000 per kg Doxycycline from Rs6,000 per kg to Rs15,500 Azithromycin from Rs8,500 to Rs14,000 Thankfully, prices came down as flights resumed from Tuesday||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-intervenes-to-maintain-supply-chain-from-china-keep-med-prices-in-check/articleshow/82560378.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||India||Congress brass signals thaw, names ‘dissident’ Azad chief of Covid task force||NEW DELHI: In what appears a significant step towards reconciliation in the dissidence-ridden Congress post a poor score in the assembly polls, the party on Tuesday named veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad to head a “Covid relief task force” that will coordinate the party’s pandemic mitigation activities. Azad is a leading member of the dissident bloc, G-23, which last year through a letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi strongly questioned the drift in the leadership after the 2019 poll debacle and sought significant reforms and collective leadership to set the ship right. Also, Maharashtra minister and former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan has been named as chairman of the committee which will “evaluate” results of the assembly elections and submit a report "within two weeks". The other members of the committee are Salman Khurshid, MP, Manish Tewari, who is also a signatory to the G-23 letter, and MPs Vincent Pala and Jothi Mani. The party’s defeat in Kerala, Assam, Puducherry and West Bengal has caused serious unease in Congress ranks even as success in Tamil Nadu came as a junior partner of DMK. It touched off a debate in the meeting of the CWC on Monday where Sonia Gandhi announced a probe panel. But Azad heading a party committee is a significant move. The senior Congress leader has issued conciliatory statements in the wake of the debacle in the recent assembly elections. In an interview to TOI (May 3) after the verdict, instead of issuing any critical statement, he said the results were disappointing but it was not the time to dwell into the reasons for the defeat and instead was a moment to ensure unity in the party for a focused fight against the pandemic. Even in the CWC meeting on Monday, Azad stuck to this line while making pointed observations on alliances and the big picture. The accommodation of Azad in a leadership position is a major departure from the heartburn caused by the controversial letter by G-23 seeking reforms and questioning the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, even though it did not name him, by calling for a full-time party chief. Azad’s reported praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a Jammu rally in February, following his retirement from Rajya Sabha which itself became a source of friction, also led to criticism within the party. He was kept out of the recent assembly election campaign in five states. The other members of the Covid relief task force are Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, Pawan Bansal, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh, Randeep Surjewala, Manish Chatrath, Ajoy Kumar, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Sappal and Youth Congress chief BV Srinivas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-brass-signals-thaw-names-dissident-azad-chief-of-covid-task-force/articleshow/82564435.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Rajasthan Solar Association has taken up the matter with the energy department and Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd to find a suitable solution so that both death of endangered species like GIB and lesser 1 Florican can be checked and the power projects do not get affected. While the SC has put the onus on the state government to ensure that the that ‘bird diverters’ are installed on the existing power lines and undergrounding of the new ones in the vicinity of the habitats of the rare species, it has also said that the companies’ CSR funds can also be used to meet some of the expenses. Industry estimates that undergrounding of the power lines will require an estimated Rs 22,000 crore. Additionally the order has created an uncertainty for bidding of 1785 MW projects that is under process by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), said RSA. “The GIB potential area covers a very large geographical space and the main areas of conservation of GIB in western Rajasthan overlaps with one of the main renewable energy hubs of the country which is very crucial for green energy supply of the country,” said the letter by RSA to RRECL. The letter further said that ROW (Right of way) will be challenge as undergrounding the transmission lines would require further land to be procured. “Since land acquisition is a very challenging task. In tender timelines, developers are given 12-to-18-month time. Hence, land acquisition would take more time than the 12-month period given by the court order,” the letter stated. It has suggested the government to form a committee comprising officials from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, SECI, RRECL, Ministry of Power, Environment and Forest and the RSA to assess the feasibility along with technical, financial and environmental impact of under grounding the transmission lines. The court had said that in future, all low-voltage power lines will be laid underground in the priority and potential habitats of GIB. In respect of existing ones, the same shall be converted into underground. For high-voltage power lines, the court ordered the formation of a committee to suggest on the technical feasibility of underground lines. But bird diverters are a priority until any action is taken, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/solar-cos-seek-govt-help-after-sc-order-on-power-lines-to-save-gib/articleshow/82560460.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||BMC likely to ease appt norms, prioritize 45+ needing 2nd dose||MUMBAI: The state’s decision to divert nearly 2.75 lakh Covaxin doses to complete the second dose of beneficiaries from the 45-years-and-above group will “slow down” the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age-group, said public health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday. On Tuesday, 26,015 people from all age groups could take the vaccine, a drop from 31,043 vaccinations on Monday. Faced with a lot of criticism about people above 45 struggling to book appointments online, civic authorities are likely to come out with revised guidelines on Wednesday. Citizens have been complaining that the slot announcements are only made on Twitter, which many over 45 are not acquainted with. Glitches with receiving OTPs and security codes are also not allowing people to register. On Tuesday, the booking slots were not open till 11pm for the next day’s vaccination that is likely to start at most centres post-noon. AMC Suresh Kakani said BMC may consider walk-ins for some percentage of people over 45. “We will issue fresh guidelines,” he said, adding online registrations will remain the pre-dominant mode. “Earlier, we were vaccinating 1.5 times our capacity. We have been able to bring that down to a normal rate and reduce overcrowding with online registrations,” he said. Slots are now opened according to vaccine availability. Aaditya Thackeray, guardian minister for Mumbai suburban, said on Twitter that he met BMC chief I S Chahal and Kakani to discuss a strategy for “ensuring second shot is administered in time; and communication & slots for those not tech savvy or on social media”. The state said with a large number of people due for second dose, they may prioritize such people, in which case the wait for first shot may get longer for the 45+ category. “Covaxin stocks purchased by state for the 18-44 age-group will now be given to people from the 45+ age-group due for second dose. Vaccination for the younger group will have to be slowed down till supply stabilizes,” said Tope. There are over 5 lakh beneficiaries from the 45+ category due for their second dose of Covaxin, and the state only has 35,000 Covaxin doses. Another 16 lakh people who took the first dose of Covishield are due for their second dose. Palghar district has halted vaccination for the 18-44 age-group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-likely-to-ease-appt-norms-prioritize-45-needing-2nd-dose/articleshow/82560517.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The police have issued four helpline numbers that will be operational from May 15. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash has initiated the helpline in coordination with two social organisations. Due to rising number of Covid-19 cases, people are struggling with different problems such as ambulance drivers overcharging patients or even family members of Covid-positive patients facing problems getting essentials as well as medicines. “They can contact the helpline numbers and the police will provide help,” said an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police. The officer said that if people come across any Covid-19 patient not following isolation norms, people not wearing masks, any commercial establishment operating beyond the prescribed time limit, they can contact the helpline. “We will take strict action against them,” the officer stated. He added that people can contact the helpline, if they are overcharged by ambulance driver or they come across someone involved in black-marketing of remdesivir or tocilizumab injections. The police will also provide help if the entire family is Covid-19 positive and needs medicines and/or essentials. “We will also provide help for children, who have lost their parents in the pandemic,” the officer said. The helpline numbers are 8010430007, 8010810007, 8010460007 and 8010830007.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/helpline-from-saturday-for-citizens-to-cope-better/articleshow/82560498.cms||---
---||Noida||After audit, vacant hosp beds show up in Gzb||Ghaziabad: At a time when ICU and oxygen beds are hard to find, private hospitals in the district have reported several vacant ones over the past three days. The reason, officials say, is a crackdown by the administration on private Covid facilities, most of which have been claiming full occupancy.According to official data, there are 51 Covid hospitals in the district, including five government ones. Together, these facilities have 3,141 Covid beds, including 747 ICU beds. Till May 8, almost all ICU beds were full and only a few oxygen beds were available in some hospitals. But following a recent audit and subsequent meetings with hospital representatives, several vacant critical care beds were found.While on May 9, six ICU and 27 oxygen beds were available at private hospitals, the number went up to nine ICU, one ventilator and 44 oxygen beds the next day. On Tuesday (May 11), 22 ICU, two ventilator and 48 oxygen beds were free across 46 private hospitals.From April-end, an audit is being conducted by the district administration and senior officials in PPE have been taking stock of beds at private facilities. According to sources, during the audit, it was found that many private hospitals, including a few prominent ones, had vacant ICU and oxygen beds. But they had put up “no vacancy” sign boards and were not attending to critical patients at all. But what made the administration conduct an audit? Sources said the decision was taken after orders to provide beds by senior health and administrative officials were ignored. Apart from that, several hospitals were not providing even 10% beds for the government integrated Covid command centre, as per state government order. State-appointed nodal officer Senthil Pandian C said: “The hospital officials never thought that we would enter their premises and conduct a head count for beds. Now, hospital officials are informing us about vacant beds on their own.” Health department sources claim that hospital owners had adopted a “pick and choose” policy instead of “first come, first serve”.“Many beds were booked in advance and kept ready for influential people. In some cases, asymptomatic people were found occupying beds. Some hospitals flouted waste disposal norms and did not have qualified staff,” a source said.Dr Mithilesh Kumar, Ghaziabad municipal corporation’s health officer, who is part of the audit team said: “It was wrong on the part of the hospitals to hide the actual status. Many Ghaziabad residents could not get beds because of this ‘virtual’ scarcity created by private hospitals. We will continue with the audit and ensure that such things are not repeated.” Officials said the health department has recommended revocation of licence for one hospital and suspension for another. Senior administrative officials said given the situation, no coercive measures are being taken against other facilities, except for issuing show-cause notices. The audit team included Ghaziabad municipal commissioner Mahender Singh Tawar and Kumar, who is also the nodal officer of private hospitals, among others. “We have issued show-cause notices to some hospitals and are planning to write to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers after we finish the process,” Kumar said. Officials are also planning an audit of Covid deaths and medical bills issued to patients.According to an estimate, about 30% beds in the district are occupied by Delhi residents. Officiating district magistrate Krishna Karunesh has asked private Covid hospitals to get additional ICU beds in a couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-audit-vacant-hosp-beds-show-up-in-gzb/articleshow/82562507.cms||Aditya Dev

Police said no suspicious transactions have been found yet. Police wrote to different banks and sought details of 39 accounts belonging to 12 persons, including Madhu, his family members and those arrested in the double murder case. Of the 39 accounts, police received details of 34 bank accounts. “As of now, there were no major money transactions from Madhu’s or his family’s bank accounts. The call detail analysis also does not suggest any unusual activity between Madhu and other accused during the time of murder. We are verifying more details like money involved in house construction of one of the accused,” said an investigator. Ramagundam police, who are investigating the double murder case of advocate couple G Vamana Rao and PV Nagamani, have so far arrested seven persons, including Madhu’s nephew Bittu Srinu. Recently, Vamana Rao’s father Kishan Rao levelled certain allegations against Madhu and others in connection with his son’s murder in a letter to Ramagundam police commissioner V Satyanarayana and inspector general Y Nagi Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-putta-bank-transactions-fine/articleshow/82560454.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP demands retired official’s removal from irrigation department||MUMBAI: Terming it a “criminal appointment”, BJP leader Chandrakant Patil demanded the removal of retired IAS officer V K Gautam who was posted as officer on special duty in the sensitive irrigation department by the MVA government a week after an inquiry was proposed against him for alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts in the Commonwealth Games during his stint there. “This is a criminal appointment and should be revoked. It goes against the advice of the general administration department (GAD) which was against it,” said Patil. “Irrigation minister Jayant Patil should explain what is his compulsion in hiring a retired bureaucrat against the government’s advice?” asked Chandrakant Patil. “It seems the irrigation department is moving to the old regime of irregularities and corruption,” said Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition. “Today more than 100 senior officers are facing charges in the court from the department. It is heard that the irrigation department is planning to revive even those tenders which were cancelled by the cabinet of the last government,” Fadnavis added. When Fadnavis was chief minister in 2018, his government had appointed retired official Radheshyam Mopalwar to head MSRDC. Mopalwar had earlier faced bribery allegations. Defending Mopalkar’s appointment, Fadnavis said, “MSRDC is a company and right from the beginning, it has a provision to appoint a serving or retired officer as MD.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-demands-retd-officials-removal-from-irrigation-dept/articleshow/82558750.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Dehradun||In May, cases in hill districts accounted for a third of Dehradun total cases||DEHRADUN: In the last 10 days, 19,100 (27.6%) of the total 69,293 coronavirus cases reported in Uttarakhand were from its nine hill districts. Pauri, Tehri and Uttarkashi were the worst affected, according to state health department data. The breakup shows that from May 1 to 10, 3,211 Covid-19 cases were reported from Tehri, followed by 2,898 from Pauri, 2,599 from Uttarkashi, 2,217 from Chamoli, 2,037 from Champawat, 1,856 from Almora, 1,684 from Pithoragarh, 1,304 from Bageshwar and 1,294 from Rudraprayag. In the first 10 days, these nine hill districts contributed a significant number of cases to the state’s caseload. Tough measures are needed to check the trend. Check-up camps in villages, strict checking at district borders are needed to bring down the case numbers in the hills. The hill districts, where neither testing centres nor health facilities are close by, have seen an alarming rise in cases. On May 1, the total active cases in these nine districts was 12,241. By May 10, the number nearly doubled to 21,339, registering a 74.3% increase. Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni alleged that the number of daily tests had been reduced in an attempt to record lesser positive cases daily. “The number of RT-PCR tests done daily has been on the decline. This would have serious ramifications in hill districts, where health facilities are not usually available and people have to go to plain districts like Dehradun and Haridwar,” she told TOI. “The next 10 days are crucial. I request the government to provide more doctors, health staff and ambulances for the hills. Besides, there is a need to carry out random checks on people who have returned from other districts and monitor whether home isolation norms were being followed,” she added. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said that as a measure of arresting the surge in Covid-19 cases in the hills, RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests had been made mandatory for people travelling from the plain districts – Dehradun, Haridwar, US Nagar and Nainital – to the remaining hill districts. “Health and district teams are also maintaining records of returnees by consolidating inputs from village heads,” Uniyal told TOI. On Monday, the Uttarakhand high court had directed the state government to increase testing facilities and disburse testing vans to hilly areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-may-cases-in-hill-districts-accounted-for-a-third-of-states-total-cases/articleshow/82556972.cms||Kautilya Singh

With the number of active and hospitalized patients going down in Nagpur, the demand of the oxygen too has come down. During pas few days Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Rrailways coordinated to augment oxygen supply to Nagpur district which had suffered an acute crisis during the Covid surge in April. Nagpur, having a reserve of around 400 tonnes, forwarded its quota of the oxygen to Pune as one of latter’s plant at Raigarh halted operations to carry out maintenance work. It is learnt the Raigarh plant would need another day to resume operations. Until the plant starts functioning, Nagpur district will cater to the need of Pune and surrounding districts as at present the Nagpur has a reserve enough for at least four days at present rate of Covid infection. More tankers are set to leave for Pune from Nagpur soon. Oxygen supply in some districts in Marathwada like Beed and Aurangabad too got affected as another oxygen plant in Gujarat went under maintenance. Nagpur district, which is steadily getting oxygen supply from Bhilai and Angul, has been asked by the state’s oxygen nodal agency to share its quota with the districts that have less. “Inox had a liquid oxygen reserve of around 300 tonnes as on Monday. Seven air separation units too are producing around 50 tonnes of oxygen daily. Apart from local production, Bhilai is sending 60 tonnes and a substantial quota is coming from Angul,” said an official from the district collectorate. Collector’s office here is sending oxygen even to districts like Akola and Amravati on a regular basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-cases-down-oxygen-rich-nagpur-supplying-pune-other-dists/articleshow/82560465.cms||---

The BJP brass wants them to retain their Parliament membership, which will allow them to serve seven assembly segments instead of one each, reports Rohit Khanna. “The party has sent out a message that it wants me to retain the berth in Parliament. I have been a BJP soldier and will continue to be so,” Sarkar said on Tuesday. “We will submit our resignation within two weeks,” he added. Pramanik, who won by a wafer-thin margin of 57 votes, voiced similar sentiments. The decision of the two BJP MPs will leave a total of five Bengal assembly seats vacant. Elections couldn’t be held in Murshidabad’s Samserganj and Jangipur seats owing to the death of candidates in the run-up to the polls while Trinamool candidate from Khardah (North 24 Parganas) Kajal Sinha passed away before he could celebrate his win.

The Pimpri Chinchwad police said the SUV driver forced Sohoni (32), a resident of Andheri in Mumbai, to stop near Somatne exit, alleging that his car had caused an accident and injured one person. The driver went on to demand Rs1.25 lakh from Sohoni for not filing a police complaint. “He then forced Sohoni to accompany him to an ATM kiosk at Somatne Phata and made the actor withdraw Rs50,000, which he collected and drove away,” senior inspector Sunil Pinjan of the Shirgaon police station told TOI. “We have obtained CCTV footage of the incident and the actor has identified the culprit from the footage,” Pinjan said, adding that the police will soon nab the offender. Sohoni, who had to finish the emergency work for which he had to travel to Pune on Saturday, was able to obtain the CCTV footage on Sunday and approached the Pimpri Chinchwad police on Monday to lodge an FIR. The actor, who has featured in TV serials ‘Mulgi Zali Ho’ and ‘Asmita’ as well as the movie ‘Dry Day’, said, “Last Saturday (May 8), I reached near Somatne Phata when a man in a white SUV raised his hand and asked me to stop along the expressway. The SUV too stopped and, soon after getting down, the man started arguing with me. He claimed that my car had caused an accident involving his SUV. He claimed that a person sustained injuries in the accident. I was surprised about how I did not notice the incident.” Sohoni added, “The man started threatening that he would file a police complaint. While I tried to reason, he demanded Rs1.25 lakh for not going to the police. I was in a hurry to reach Pune as it was a matter of emergency and I barely had the time to argue with this person. He forced me to accompany him to an ATM kiosk at Somatne Phata after I told him that I was not carrying cash. He made me withdraw Rs50,000 and drove away with the cash.” “I had decided that I to file a police complaint. The next day, I went to Somatne as I suspected the man must be from the area as he knew where the ATM kiosk was located. With some of my friends, I managed to get the CCTV footage and identified the person. On Monday, I filed the police complaint,” Sohoni said. A police officer associated with the investigation said, “We have identified the suspect. He is from Pimpri Chinchwad area. We are working on some clues to see that he is arrested soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/suv-driver-intercepts-robs-actor-of-rs-50k-on-e-way/articleshow/82560528.cms||Mihir Tanksale

A letter from the chief secretary issued on Tuesday says that keeping in mind the rising number of Covid positive cases, it was important to get people of the state vaccinated at the earliest. The letter further states that due to unavailability of Covishield and Covaxin, the state has formed a five-member committee to procure the vaccines from other countries. The letter further mentions that the committee will look into the possibilities of importing Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik through global tendering. Meanwhile, the state government has constituted a 11-member “Covid-19 High Powered Task Force” to look into various aspects related to Covid and take effective measures to control the virus. The committee will also decide the future strategy to tackle Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-forms-committee-to-procure-covid-vaccines-through-global-tendering/articleshow/82556990.cms||Kautilya Singh

Pune rural got 32,000 doses of the total quota, followed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (28,000) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (15,500). Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that over 2.5 lakh beneficiaries in the district were waiting for the second dose of Covishield. “They will get the priority for the next few days. This means the vaccination for the 18-44 age group is likely to be kept on hold for some days. These (75,000) doses will be enough for a maximum two-three days. We will hopefully get new stock before these doses get exhausted,” he said. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said inoculation for people aged between 18 and 44 years would be open at two centres and the slot booking would be available on Co-Win from 8am on Wednesday. “For the 45-plus age category beneficiaries, the PMC has allotted 118 vaccination sites. Of these, 112 will offer Covishield and six will provide Covaxin. Around 80% of Covishield doses will be given to those whose second dose is pending. For the first-time beneficiaries, the remaining 20% doses will be administered on a prior-slot booking basis,” he said. The Pimpri Chinchwad civic body has decided to keep the 18-44 age group vaccination on hold and vaccinate those aged 45 years and above on a priority basis. The municipal administration said in a statement that all of its vaccination centres across the eight civic facilities would remain open for the 45-plus age group beneficiaries. It has appealed to the beneficiaries aged between 18 and 44 years not to crowd the vaccination sites. A PCMC official said the vaccination on Wednesday would be conducted from 10am to 5pm across its eight designated sites. On Tuesday, the district registered vaccination of 12,478 people. Altogether 5,068 of them were from the 18-44 age group category. The Pune civic body registered the overall vaccination of 6,739 beneficiaries. In Pune rural, 4,179 people were vaccinated, followed by 1,560 in Pimpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-75-5k-covishield-doses-stock-to-last-2-3-days/articleshow/82560505.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Traders are now trying to stay afloat by taking their products and services at customers’ doorsteps. Garment retailer Shahin Aziz said, “Since our shop is closed, we have been sending photographs on WhatsApp and offering home delivery of garments. For Eid, I sent a broadcast message to our customers appealing them to show some support for small businesses such as ours and received a good response from them. Sales have not been as they were in the pre-Covid times, but at least we have had some income since last month due to Eid shopping.” An accessories store owner from Laxmi Road, who has suffered heavy losses since last year, said, “Businessmen like us were anyway losing the battle to e-commerce websites, who could afford to offer heavy discounts. After the pandemic hit, things have become so bad that we cannot earn enough to run our homes. Initially, I waited for things to get back to normal but then I decided that I have to adapt my business according to the current situation. I have started selling the stock I had through social media. I received a good response for items such as hair accessories, bands and clips, and sheet masks ahead of Eid. There is also good demand for children’s accessories and toys.” Mohammed Iqbal, a resident of Khadki, said that though he skipped buying new clothes for himself this year, he reached out to a local children’s garment shop owner to make purchases for his daughters. “It is easier to use e-commerce websites for shopping, with cheap prices and larger variety but, in difficult times like these, we should support local shopkeepers so that they can also earn some money and their families can also celebrate the festival. I bought two dresses for Eid for my daughters from a couple, who are selling their stock through Whatsapp,” Iqbal said. Vimannagar resident Rubina Khan made Eid purchases for her family from a neighbour, who sells garments through Whatsapp after losing her shop due to the pandemic. She said, “The lady sends pictures of her stock of garments for men, women and children on Whatsapp for customers to select and make online payment. She sends the orders to them through various delivery services if the location is far away, or her sons deliver if the address is close by. She is the sole breadwinner of her family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bespoke-services-for-eid-help-traders-stay-afloat/articleshow/82560534.cms||---

Over three lakh students from Maharashtra participated in this survey held over a period of three days that ended on Tuesday. Another survey among schools on their preparedness to conduct internal assessment of students of Std X revealed that 82% schools were ready for it.Deputy director at MSCERT Vikas Garad said that a Google form with a basic questionnaire regarding the entrance test was sent to all schools in Maharashtra and shared on various social media platforms for students to participate directly in this survey. It was launched on Sunday. “In three days, over three lakh students participated and recorded their opinions regarding the entrance test and a majority of them seemed to have shown willingness for it.”Of the total surveyed students, 1.9 lakh students were willing to appear for the entrance test while over one lakh students disagreed. As many as 2.8 lakh students were from Maharashtra board while the rest of the students who took the survey were from ICSE, CBSE, IB and other boards.Garad said the survey was launched by the MSCERT in order to understand the sentiment of the students before making any decision about the admission procedure for FYJC. “This is the first-of-its-kind survey to find out what the students want. Before jumping to any decision or knowing what students are thinking it would be unfair to announce the process. We have a sizeable sample survey with three lakh student responses that will help us in designing the process of admission for FYJC,” Garad said.Meanwhile, as many as 17,487 of the 21,110 schools said they were ready to carry out internal evaluation.Education experts, though, say the survey so far is not indicative of what the majority of students or schools want. Of the more than 17 lakh Class X students, just 3 lakh have taken part in the survey. “Students who have taken the survey may be from urban areas. Those in rural areas may not be ready for CET,” said Shubhada Arole, principal, Dr M G Parulekar school, Vasai.Arole said while the school is in favour of CET, it is also ready to evaluate students internally. The maximum feedback came from Mumbai students at 58,250, followed by those in Pune (29,376) and Thane (29,209). From Mumbai division, covering Greater Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar districts, 1.1 lakh students took part in the survey.Garad said while students have responded positively to CET, more numbers are needed to get a clearer picture. In the internal evaluation of students, Pune schools (1,951) have done better than Mumbai (1,862). Uma Shankar, principal, SIES College, Matunga, suggested round-the-year class evaluation can be the basis to score students.The state appears to be keen on a CET as they fear huge inflation of marks across boards, said an official. Schools, too, have started preparing students for CET. Students, though, are worried the 100-mark CET may carry questions of all subjects. “The CET should be based on maths and science questions,” said a Goregaon school principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-65-students-who-took-state-survey-want-fyjc-entrance-test/articleshow/82560589.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Delhi||Delhi airport: Covid forces Terminal 2 to check out||NEW DELHI: Operations at Terminal 2 of Indira Gandhi International Airport will be suspended from 12.01 am on May 18 and Terminal 3 alone— like April-September 2020 — will be used by all international and domestic passengers. The decision comes due to a sharp fall in air travel during the unfolding Covid catastrophe in India. A DIAL official said the other reason for this move was to “consolidate all operations in one terminal to reduce manpower requirement during the pandemic.” In the last few days, IGIA has seen its daily footfall crash to below 20% of pre-Covid level. India’s busiest airport is learnt to be witnessing just 30,000-40,000 daily passengers — combined figure for domestic and international arrivals and departures — these days, as opposed to 2 lakh per day till last March. Mumbai Airport is also handling all passenger flights from one terminal for the same reason. IndiGo announced on its website: “Delhi terminal update: Effective May 18, 2021, all flights will arrive and depart from Terminal 3.” The ferocity of the second wave has seen airlines doing something unimaginable for commercial organisations: Advising people to remain home and travel only if necessary. For instance, Air India has tweeted: “Stay indoors, stay safe. If, for some reason, air travel is a must, we have kept our planes safe and sanitised just for you. Please be safe, on ground or in flight.” Tata Group’s Vistara also tweeted recently: “With the overwhelming number of active Covid cases, it is imperative we all remain cautious and follow all safety precautions diligently. We urge to travel only if necessary and if you do, please follow all safety protocols which help us in keeping the skies safe for you.” Almost 20 countries have in the last fortnight imposed travel restrictions from India, some even suspending flights here. And domestic travel has witnessed a sharp drop due to testing requirements by various states. As a result, the current level of domestic-cum-international traffic is down to a level that can be handled by T3 alone — like last year. Delhi Airport’s T2 was reopened for domestic flights last October when domestic air travel had started picking up after being allowed to resume in May-end. T1 is yet to reopen since last March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-forces-terminal-2-to-check-out/articleshow/82558781.cms||---

My family and relatives back home have already been vaccinated with the first dose. They have asked me to come there to get the shot. I will take the Pune-Patna flight next week. This way, I will be able to spend some time with my family as well,” Kashyap said. Short trips to hometowns or ‘places of contacts’ have risen in Pune amid vaccine scarcity. “There are many who are opting for such trips of not over four to five days. The airfares are not very high at present. Each day, at least two to three such booking are happening,” a representative of a city-based travel company, said. Sarthak Mishra, who is Kashyap’s friend from Patna, said he also got his first dose in his hometown. “I will travel back to Pune on Saturday and will return to Patna when it is time for my second dose,” Mishra said. Sudhir Janak, who is set to make a trip to Prayagraj in UP, said, “I haven’t seen my family since a year and getting my first dose while I am there is an added advantage.” Pradeep Kumar Sinha (48), who hails from Kolkata, said he was also considering to travel to his hometown. “I was administered the first dose about a month-and-a-half ago. I am confused about the situation in Pune. My friends in Kolkata told me to come there for the second dose,” Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shortage-prompts-flight-to-hometowns-for-shots/articleshow/82560540.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Search for ICU beds continues despite drop in cases in PMR||Pune: Despite a drop in cases and smaller hospitals resuming full-fledged operations, the search for an unoccupied intensive care unit (ICU) bed is far from over in the urban areas of Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR).Covid hospitals equipped with ICUs said they were still flooded with inquiries for an ICU bed each day.Experts have laid emphasis on strengthening the healthcare infra — ramping up ICU beds and oxygen support at hospitals — in rural areas as one way to reduce the burden on city hospitals.“Mainly young adults from rural Pune get severe Covid pneumonia and require an ICU bed with non-invasive ventilator support. We get a sizable number of inquiries, mainly for ICU beds from rural parts of Pune and adjoining districts every day,” said chief intensivist Vilas Gundecha of Inlaks and Budhrani hospital.The rural parts have been reporting the highest daily Covid cases in PMR, compared to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.The city areas of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, on an average, report 2,000 cases per day. The tally goes up to an average of 3,000 in rural areas.Further, during the oxygen crunch in the middle of April, a sizable number of ICU beds at hospitals in city areas were vacant, as ICU patients need a high, uninterrupted supply of oxygen. These beds rapidly got filled once the crisis was resolved more than a week ago.“But Covid hospitals in rural parts — dependent on a regular supply of oxygen cylinders — are still struggling. So many are still not admitting patients in their ICUs and this has led to a massive strain on hospitals in the city areas,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India — an association of small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune.Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad conceded that patients’ relatives were still struggling to find ventilator beds. “There are certain issues in terms of skilled human resources when it comes to ICUs in rural hospitals,” Prasad said.A sizable number of private hospitals in rural areas only have a single physician to run an ICU. “When the doctor falls ill or for some reason, cannot report to duty for a prolonged period, the ICU’s operations are suspended. Besides, doctors at government-run hospitals are not confident enough to manage critical patients on ventilators and prefer to refer such patients to bigger facilities in the city,” he added.“The third aspect is geographical constraint. For example, if a patient in Indapur tehsil requires a ventilator bed and if there is one in Manchar sub-district hospital in Ambegaon tehsil, the family are often not keen on shifting the patient so far,” Prasad said.As per the divisional commissioner’s dashboard, PMC had no ventilator beds available, while PCMC had nine and rural Pune — including municipal councils — had seven available at 8.30pm on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/search-for-icu-beds-continues-despite-drop-in-cases-in-pmr/articleshow/82558778.cms||Sandip Dighe

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has also asked the government’s chief standing counsel CS Rawat to ensure that shops selling oxygen cylinders and other supplies are not forced to shut because of the curfew in several towns and cities across the state. The oral direction came from the court while hearing a PIL filed by Dehradun resident Anu Pant about the Covid situation in the state capital. The bench was informed by Abhijay Negi, counsel for petitioner, that several shops selling oxygen supply shut down in the evening due to curfew despite people being in dire need of it. “The court asked the government counsel whether oxygen shops come under essential services. The government counsel agreed, after which, the court directed that this should be communicated to both the administration and the shop owners,” Negi said. Negi added, “The court also expressed its concerns that the essential supplies like food and medicine should reach the people in need and to those locked inside containment zones. Therefore, the bench directed the district authorities to issue passes to volunteers involved in the task.” The court has now clubbed the PIL with around other similar petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ensure-passes-to-ngo-volunteers-involved-in-covid-relief-work-hc/articleshow/82557005.cms||Prashant Jha

The Maharashtra government, has initiated discussions with foreign vaccine manufacturers to speed up the inoculation of people aged between 18 and 44 years. “Our inoculation drive is currently going on at a slow pace, because vaccines are not being made available. The chief minister has clearly said Maharashtra has the potential to purchase 120 million doses in one go, but availability is the main issue. The Centre must intervene in this matter and make vaccine doses available for Maharashtra,” Tope said. “If the Union government gives its nod, we can procure Sputnik, or other foreign vaccines, for our citizen,” said the minister “If the Centre gives clearances to other approved foreign vaccines, the state can float a global tender as has been done for oxygen and remdesivir injections,” he said, adding that Maharashtra was currently conducting 2 lakh tests as day with Pune district leading the chart. “We conduct more RT-PCR tests than any other state in the country,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-says-no-response-so-far-from-sputnik-manufacturers-for-supply/articleshow/82560603.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||No vax cert: HC says negative report must for all entering state||Panaji: The high court came down heavily on the state government once again on Tuesday for allowing certain categories entry into the state without a Covid negative certificate. It directed the administration to ensure that no person is permitted entry without such certificate from the intervening midnight of May 11 and 12. However, the court made an exception for those entering for medical emergencies, those coming in ambulances, or those bringing essential supplies. While hearing three PILs over various Covid-related issues, the high court pulled up the two district magistrates for modifying its May 6 interim order where it had directed the state to ensure that a negative certificate obtained within 72 hours be a must for people entering Goa. Following a nudge from the high court, the government had made it compulsory for only tourists entering Goa to produce a negative RT-PCR test report that’s less than 72 hours old, or a vaccination certificate. However, Goans and those entering Goa for work were exempt from producing these documents. The division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and Nitin W Sambre noted that the government modified the order and granted exceptions to various other categories of people to enter Goa. The North and South district magistrates “either on their own or otherwise, have proceeded to carve out exceptions in favour of residents of Goa entering the state, persons entering Goa for work, and persons who have vaccination certificates.” “The district magistrates were bound by our order and could not have by themselves or otherwise modified our order or refused to comply with our orders. Fortunately, even the learned advocate general for the state of Goa does not defend the action of the district magistrates and states that by Tuesday evening necessary amends will be made in the orders issued by district magistrates so that the orders are entirely consistent with our interim directions,” the court stated. Referring to the restrictions to be imposed at the border, the court said, “From midnight intervening May 11 and 12, 2021, the state administration shall ensure that no person who does not possess a Covid negativity certificate based on a test done a maximum 72 hours will be permitted to enter Goa. The only exception shall be for persons entering Goa for medical emergency on production of proof or those who are coming in an ambulance.” Regarding the issue of oxygen supply, the court sought an affidavit from the government to indicate whether lack of oxygen supply continues to be the cause for any casualties. The court also asked for affidavits explaining the actual position of oxygen at the hospitals and posted the matter for hearing on May 12. Advocate general Devidas Pangam stated that the dean of Goa Medical College and the director of health services would file such affidavits by Wednesday, explaining the position of supply of oxygen at GMC, both North and South district hospitals, as well as the ESI Hospital. “We suggest that the director of health services obtain inputs from the nodal officers at these facilities and file an affidavit before us. The affidavit will indicate whether lack of oxygen supply continues to be the cause for any casualties. The affidavits will also give particulars about ventilators, HFNO machines, etc. in the context of supply of oxygen.” The court also directed the Goa Association of Resident Doctors to file an affidavit on the issue of supply of oxygen at various government hospitals by Wednesday. Relief for persons bringing in essential supplies Panaji: In a major relief to the state government, the high court has waived the requirement of Covid-19 negative certificate to persons entering the state in goods vehicles, making essential supplies of oxygen, medical drugs, raw materials to pharmaceuticals companies, medical equipment, milk, vegetables, food grains, eggs, meat and gas cylinders. “Accordingly, the said waiver is granted by way of an ad interim relief in this application. To this limited extent, our orders dated May 6, 2021, and May 11, 2021, will stand modified until tomorrow (Wednesday),” the court said. As the high court put restrictions on the entry of persons in Goa on Tuesday, the state government made an application in the evening seeking waiver for persons bringing essential supplies to Goa. IN the evening, amended orders were issued by the district magistrate, giving exemptions - to all persons entering the state for medical mergencies on production of proof or those who are coming in an ambulance. Exemption is also for all persons entering the state in good vehicles carrying essential supplie sof oxygen, medical drugs, raw metrials to pharma companies , milk, vegetables, gas cylinders, etc||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-vax-cert-hc-says-negative-report-must-for-all-entering-state/articleshow/82562527.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

KCB CEO Pramod Kumar Singh stated in a letter to ZP CEO Ayush Prasad that apart from the people residing in the cantonment areas, the KCB has to distribute vaccine doses to Ammunition Factory Khadki and the Indian Railways too.  “Because of the limited dose allocation, we could only start vaccination for 45 above age group,” Singh said. ZP CEO Ayush Prasad said, “We are going to distribute more doses to the KCB...KCB has several Covid-19 hotspots in its limit. So, carrying out the vaccination drive on massive scale is necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kcb-seeks-1500-doses-per-day/articleshow/82560632.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Goa||26 die due to O2 shortage at Goa’s premier govt hospital||PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane made a startling announcement on Tuesday — that many Covid patients were dying due to oxygen supply problems in the early hours of every morning at Goa Medical College (GMC), and that 26 had died between the same hours on Tuesday. The minister asked the Bombay high court to probe goings-on at GMC. "Due to interrupted supply of oxygen, we feel that between 2am and 6am many people are dying in GMC. There is a need for an inquiry directly by the high court. There are petitions pending before it." Stating that his "conscience was clear", he said that "the HC can appoint an expert committee to find out why deaths are happening between 2am and 6am and come out with a white paper". For days, TOI has reported a nightly drop of oxygen that often leaves patients gasping for breath. With no help forthcoming, doctors and nurses have been forced to improvise, sometimes hooking up to three patients to a single cylinder. Rane’s statement came on a day that Goa recorded 75 Covid deaths, its highest-ever single-day tally, of which 48 patients died at GMC. "On Monday, our requirement was about 1,200 cylinders, but we received 400 cylinders. The hospital has been facing a shortage of oxygen supply," the health minister said. Asked to react to Rane's statement, Sawant said, “Doctors at GMC would explain this issue better, and I will not be able to tell you how many patients died due to short supply of oxygen. I am not an expert. Whatever has to be said, the doctors have to say.” Oxygen supply through GMC’s central line has been erratic for weeks, putting the lives of patients who are on non-invasive ventilation, those with severe Covid pneumonia and those with acute respiratory distress, at risk. Among the slew of measures taken by the government last month for Covid management was the appointment of three IAS officers as nodal officers to maintain the supply of medical oxygen to hospitals. "It is their responsibility to find out what the problem is and inform the CM about it. I will also talk to the CM to learn where the mismanagement is happening. As health minister, I want to know about it," Rane said. The health minister said the chief minister was "misinformed" but did not elaborate. He said that he and Sawant have been working towards mitigating the crisis, but haven’t understood where the problem is. “The information has to be obtained from the three nodal officers and what analysis they have done — how to bridge the short supply,” Rane said. Rane said that the chief minister and health secretary Ravi Dhawan were informed about the deaths occurring between 2am and 6am through notes. “I also told the health secretary that the time (2am to 6am) was critical as more deaths are reported during that period,” he said. A patient’s relative said for the last 20 days, he has watched several patients dying in that time period at GMC as the oxygen supply to the wards dips. “The disruption in supply has been happening with regularity for the past so many days. I don’t know why it has been happening and why the problem has not been fixed. I have seen people dying before my eyes,” he said, without wanting to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/26-covid-patients-die-as-o2-supply-drops-for-4-hours-at-gmc-rane-for-hc-probe/articleshow/82562541.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||Covid crisis: HC slams JNU for ‘apathy’ towards students, faculty||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday rapped Jawaharlal Nehru University, which has seen a three-fold rise in Covid cases in past few weeks, for “apathy” and lack of “swiftness and alacrity” in responding to requests by students and faculty to set up Covid care and oxygen production facilities on the campus. Justice Prathiba Singh said that considering the “rigour” of the pandemic, the varsity administration “ought to have reacted with swiftness and alacrity” to the several correspondence sent to it from April 13 onwards. “Almost a month has gone by, but there has been no response from the vice-chancellor or the administration. There is complete apathy. I am shocked,” the judge said. The court noted that from 74 Covid cases on April 18, the number of cases in the campus had gone up to 211 on May 7. HC said that all the varsity had to do was get in touch with authorities and help could have been given by any local hospital. “You had to try. It was only a question of taking interest in doing so,” it added. The court said such a conduct of the varsity, in not responding to the requests, “would constitute gross neglect by the JNU administration in a situation, which is completely alarming.” It directed JNU to file a status report on the steps taken by the administration in respect of the requests made by the petitioners — JNUTA, JNUSU and two faculty members — for dealing with the Covid pandemic in the campus since April 13. It also directed the VC and the registrar to ascertain the necessity and feasibility of creating a Covid care facility in the campus and to file a status report regarding that.

---||Pune||PCMC awaits state nod for buying vax||Pimpri Chinchwad: Mayor of Pimpri Chinchwad Usha (Mai) Dhore has sought health minister Rajesh Tope’s approval to directly purchase around 15 lakh Covid vaccine doses for vaccinating eligible adults in the municipal limits. The PCMC was forced on Tuesday to suspend vaccination for the 45 and above category due to the dose unavailability. The vaccination for the 18-44 age group was done in a limited manner across eight centres in the municipal limits. A total of 3.47 lakh people have received their first shots in the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, while around 84,000 beneficiaries have got both the doses till date. BJP’s leader of house in PCMC Namdev Dhake said they had got the nod from the standing committee for the direct purchase of vaccines from the manufacturers. “We want to buy the vaccines to speed up the vaccination drive in the civic limits. We have raised concerns about the distribution of fewer vaccines from the state or Union government quota. In the review meeting with deputy CM Ajit Pawar, we demanded increase in our quota of vaccines,” Dhake said. Rajesh Patil, municipal commissioner, PCMC, told TOI they were yet to receive any clarity on the issue of direct purchase of the vaccines from the manufacturers. Personal data on display Some citizens raised concerns about PCMC’s vaccination centre displaying information such as cellphone number and Aadhaar card number of the eligible beneficiaries on the notice board. Rajesh Patil said the issue was ‘rectified’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-awaits-state-nod-for-buying-vax/articleshow/82560625.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Decline in cases not a victory over Covid as yet, warn experts||NAGPUR: The anti-viral Remdesivir injection, that had been in short supply for the last few weeks, suddenly seems to have lost all demand with number of hospitalized Covid patients dropping by approximately 37%. Even active cases have fallen by around 40% between April last week and May second week. Most sought after barely two weeks ago, it’s learnt now several Covid hospitals in the district have started requesting district administration to refrain from allotting the drug in the absence of any patients that need it. Gilead Sciences’ repurposed drug Remdesivir had hit the headlines in April after a shortage hit the headlines. The collector, for the first time, had to take up allotment and distribution of the drug along with Tocilizumab. With decrease in number of patients at hospitals, the distribution of Remdesivir quota too has increased though stock arriving in the district had reduced. On May 10, distribution of Remdesivir was at around 84% of requirement, as there were 3,998 vials for 4,740 patients in Covid hospitals. This figure was 67%, with 2,973 Remdesivir vials on Tuesday for 4,467 patients. On April 26, district administration had received stock of 6,597 Remdesivir vials but it was sufficient for only 67% of the functional bed capacity then, which was as high as 9,835. On April 23, only 43% of hospitalized patients had access to Remdesivir as there was stock of 4,094 vials against 9,595 functional beds. Dr Mohan Nerkar, a director of Seven Star Hospital, said Remdesivir was in high demand when the number of patients was higher. “At present, the requirement of Remdesivir has gone down considerably. First, the patient and relatives are counselled about benefits and side-effects of Remdesivir, and then we are also discouraging the drug if someone is admitted more 10 days after infection, when the period of viral replication is over. If someone is admitted on the eighth day, then the dose would be two vials, and if on the ninth day then it would be one,” said Dr Nerkar. “There is also no point in increasing the stock of the drug if it is not required. It also has adverse economics behind it,” said the senior physician. Senior physician Dr Nikhil Balankhe too said patients and their kin have realized that Remdesivir is important but not indispensable after viral replication period, and it also does not have any record of reducing mortality rate. “Earlier, patients’ kin would attack doctors and nurses when Remdesivir would not be available. Now, even when a nurse explains, patients and their kin cooperate,” he said. Dr Rajesh Atal, another senior physician, also said the crisis of Remdesivir is a matter of the past. Dr BK Murli, director of both Hope Hospital and Ayushman Hospital, said he had not requested Remdesivir for both his hospitals from the district administration, as the number of patients has dwindled. “Now, patients are coming to us after completing Remdesivir courses and in critical condition mostly. There is no point is stocking it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/decline-in-hospitalized-patients-leads-to-huge-drop-in-remdesivir-demand/articleshow/82560656.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Mob attacks Pune police team in Ghaziabad||Pune: A five-member team of Pune police, in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh to detain a woman for questioning over the recent murder of a head constable from the Faraskhana police station, was attacked by a mob on Monday afternoon. No one was injured but a vehicle, hired locally by the police team, was damaged in the incident. “We did detain the woman and our team is bringing her to Pune via Delhi after intimating the Ghaziabad police about her detention,” senior inspector Rajendra Landge said Tuesday. The police had arrested Pravin Mahajan, a criminal, on the charge of stabbing head constable Sameer Sayyed to death in the Budhwar Peth red-light area on May 5 following a quarrel. “Mahajan had illegally entered the city in breach of an externment order. The investigation has revealed that on entering Pune, he went straight to the (detained) woman’s room,” said Landge. “Mahajan and Sayyed quarrelled over the woman, whom they knew well,” he added. “We suspect the woman knows the reason behind the attack that resulted in Sayyed’s death. She fled the red-light area soon after the incident. She was traced to her native place in Ghaziabad. We wanted to bring her here to examine if she had any role in the murder, based on certain claims made by Mahajan,” Landge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mob-attacks-pune-police-team-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/82558793.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Short on shots, Kerala keeps 18-44 jabs on hold, Gujarat, Rajasthan focus on worst-hit belt||MUMBAI: Eleven days since the Centre allowed states to vaccinate their 18-44-year-old population, fewer than 25 lakh have got the shot across the country. Grappling with a vaccine shortage, some states like Kerala haven’t started the drive, while others have been forced to improvise. Maharashtra, the worst-affected state, has opened phase III for its younger population with limited doses and restricted them to those who can book a slot on Co-Win. Till May 10, the state has given 5.1 lakh shots. A few other states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, which are towards the top of the leader board, have adopted a more conservative approach by first vaccinating high burden districts. Karnataka started phase III on a small scale from Tuesday. Gujarat is prioritising the 18-44 drive in seven municipal corporation areas of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar and Gandhinagar, and the three districts of Mehsana, Kutch, and Bharuch. The state has vaccinated 3.1 lakh people in the last 10 days. Rajasthan, too, initially restricted the drive to 16 of its 33 districts, including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Ajmer, Udaipur. R K Saran, a district official, said this was the modus operandi for the first seven days as doses were limited; they opened it to the entire state from May 8. To ensure equity, they have allowed 50% walk-ins at rural areas. The state has vaccinated over 4.2 lakh till May 10. Vaccination expert Dr Naveen Thacker, who was India’s representative to Gavi (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization), said Gujarat and Rajasthan’s approach seemed more practical in the light of rising cases and vaccine shortage. “Spreading the doses thin across the state may yield little in terms of reducing deaths or severity,” he said. Karnataka, which had planned to begin phase III from Monday, could start only from Tuesday for want of doses. A state official said they have received only around 3 lakh doses which will not allow a full-scale drive. The state had ordered 1 crore doses. In Kerala, re-elected CM Pinarayi Vijayan has said it would first finish vaccinating its 45-plus citizens. However, private centres procuring their own vaccines are free to vaccinate from all age groups. Dr Vineeta Bal, immunologist from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (Iiser), Pune, said vaccinating only in high disease burden areas may not yield any immediate benefits but can help reduce cases in the third wave. “Maharashtra should focus on vaccinating those in the service industry, or people who come in contact with many others, such as vendors, people working in public transport, etc,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-short-on-shots-kerala-keeps-18-44-jabs-on-hold-guj-raj-focus-on-worst-hit-belt/articleshow/82560702.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Isolated places in Dehradun witnessed a morning rush as people scrambled to buy essentials. Shops selling essentials are now allowed to be open from 7am to 10am only, as compared to till 12 pm earlier. Police meanwhile clamped down on people unnecessarily venturing out of homes. Those out without a valid reason were challaned and vehicles were seized. “The police of all the districts have been instructed to ensure that there is strict compliance of the curfew across the state,” said Ashok Kumar, Director General of Police (DGP) Uttarakhand. In Nainital, district police booked the owner of a liquor shop as it stayed open even though curfew guidelines require vends to be closed in Nainital, Haldwani and Bhowali. Dozens had flocked to the shop without masks. “The liquor shop, which falls in the rural area in Jeolikote, was open and dozens of people had gathered here on Monday. The shop was closed the same day but a case was registered under section 188 () of IPC and relevant sections of the disaster management act against the owner the next day,” a police officer told TOI. In Haridwar, around 500 people were caught roaming around without any reason. CO city Abhay Singh told TOI, “Most residents adhered to the Covid curfew but some flouted guidelines and were fined.” All government offices have been closed as well. The curfew will last till May 18.

In Thalisain block of Pauri Garhwal, hundreds of people in around 30 villages have come down with fever and cough, according to local sources. Suresh Chandra, head of Patuli village, confirmed that dozens in just his village are suffering. "But no one has been tested yet. There is panic all around and many are in self-isolation. It has been over a week since people started falling sick,” Chandra said. Kuldeep Rawat from Pajyana village said that he has spoken to several people from nearby villages and estimates that close to a thousand people are showing Covid-like symptoms but no one has come for testing yet. The nearest testing centre from Pajyana is 25km away and locals said that the ongoing lockdown has made it difficult for them to travel. “If any of us show severe symptoms, we will have to either travel to Srinagar Medical College, which is 90 km away or to Dehradun, which is close to 250 km from here,” said Rawat. Local officials in Pauri Garhwal confirmed that villagers have complained of fever and cough. “We are trying to collect samples from the area. We are still waiting for the results,” an official said. Things are just as bad in Uttarkashi but there tests have taken place. Seventy-four people from two villages have tested positive -- 54 in Kishanpur and 20 in Pal Barsu. Both the villages were sealed by the administration and sampling of around 500 people is being done. In addition, 10 from a village in Kotdwar tested positive on Monday after attending a funeral last week. Shridev Maratha, pradhan of Kishanpur village, which has a population of 1,800, said that people from nearby Thalan village had recently participated in a couple of weddings. “Initially, five people from Thalan tested positive. When a few in our village started getting symptoms like high fever, we called the health department team to conduct tests in our village. They took 80 samples on May 5 out of which 57 tested positive,” said Maratha. Additional chief medical officer, Bhatwari (Uttarkashi), Dr Bipul Biswas, said that weddings and the Kumbh have led to a surge in cases in the area. “In several villages, we have found that those who returned from the Kumbh, or from other cities, tested positive and spread the virus. In almost 70% of the villages where mass positivity has been reported, weddings had taken place,” said Biswas. In Tehri Garhwal, close to 300 people have tested positive for Covid in nearly 80 villages of Thauldar and Thatyur blocks in the last few weeks, according to Jot Singh Bisht, a Congress leader and social activist. But locals believe the actual numbers could be much higher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mountain-villages-in-ukhand-grapple-with-covid-like-symptoms-await-tests/articleshow/82557020.cms||Prashant Jha

Between May 5 and May 10, there have been 21 arrests for fake news and 34 FIRs registered by various police stations. Five of these FIRs were lodged in Kolkata. The police have so far carried out arrests from Cooch Behar, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Howrah. Cops have also taken help from Twitter and Facebook to not only delete close to 500 fake posts, but permanently deleted 148 social media accounts for spreading hatred and hurting community sentiments. Bengal Police and CID recommended deletion of 137 posts while the rest came from Kolkata Police. The state cyber cell has now begun demarcating each fake video — from those circulating only on WhatsApp to those being shared across social media platforms — and accessing its impact. “One video is making its way to various types of social media. We are trying to identify at the base and then delete these videos before they can cause further damage,” claimed an officer. Home department sources said that necessary orders have been passed to all SPs to ensure that peace talks are held regularly and that every complaint is accounted for and the same shared widely with local sources and media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/21-arrests-34-firs-to-stop-fake-news/articleshow/82558831.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Pune||Hospitals may lose remdesivir supply if families told to get drug: Collector||Pune: Remdesivir allocation of a hospital will be frozen if it asks relatives of Covid patients to buy the drug from the open market, the district collector has said.  The Centre procures remdesivir vials from manufacturers and distributes them to states that pass on the stock to districts.This loop ensures hospitals get stock based on the number of admitted patients. Hospitals are also not supposed to send families looking for the drug in the open market. “Stringent action, in terms of freezing the daily supply, will be initiated against a hospital if it asks families to buy remdesivir from outside,” said district collector Rajesh Deshmukh. But small hospitals said they often have no choice but ask families to get the drug because the district administration does not always allocate required supply. Hospitals said when patients’ families realise remdesivir is not being administered because of shortages, they often volunteer to get the drug from outside and pressure doctors into prescribing it. Aniket Joshi, who treats Covid patients at 10 city hospitals, said, “If a hospital needs 20 vials for 20 patients, it gets 15 vials. Sometimes, even less. So it has to skip the dose for rest of the five patients.”Joshi said despite counselling, many believe Covid treatment is incomplete without remdesivir. He said, “Patients even call up family to tell them they are not being given remdesivir. The relatives then put pressure on doctors to prescribe the drug. We won’t have these problems if district officials ensure hospitals get the required number of vials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-may-lose-remdesivir-supply-if-families-told-to-get-drug-collector/articleshow/82558826.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The complainant transferred the money online to the bank account number given to her between April 4 and 19. When the woman didn’t receive the machine, she lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Monday. The complainant told TOI that last month, she watched a video online about a few machines, which one could operate from home and earn money. “I liked the incense sticks making machine, so I contacted the cellphone number mentioned in the video,” she said. The woman said that the person told her that he would be providing raw material with the machine. “He also promised me that he would purchase the incense sticks from me for Rs40,000 per tonne,” the woman said. “I liked the deal and mortgaged my gold chain, used my child’s school fees and transferred Rs1 lakh online to the man,” she added. The man had sent her a bill, GST number and even a bill of the transport operator. “I wanted to surprise my husband, so I sent him to the transport operator’s office to collect the machine. My husband found that the bill was a year old and the person had duped me,” she said. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, an officer from the Wakad police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-duped-of-rs1-lakh-in-online-deal/articleshow/82560684.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Students launch website to stop oxygen, med fraud||Kolkata: A group of students launched a website to verify the information that appears on social media to support Covid patients with authentic leads. The website, http://dhoond.epizy.com, has been designed to ensure that the patients don’t fall prey to the black marketeers when there has been a scarcity of oxygen cylinders and medicines. As India fights the second wave of Covid-19, social media is flooded with Covid-related information, some of which are false and unverified forwards. So, it is a huge challenge to authenticate the leads from this vast ocean of data. Students of JU, Scottish Church College, St Xavier's University and St Xavier's College are associated with this initiative and they have been doing this work day in and day out from their houses. Shrestha Baisnab, a student of Jadavpur University, said, “For the past two weeks, all we could see on the social media were leads for oxygen cylinders, ICU beds, plasma and medicines. The common information in all these posts was that people posted their locations, hoping that they would get their requirement in and around them. That’s when this idea was born to help people in this global crisis.” The group is using crowd-sourced data and location intelligence to make it easier for people to identify leads on oxygen, ICU beds, food delivery, blood and plasma near their locations. “With so much unstructured data based on locations, we tried to give a proper representation to the verified leads in the form of a user responsive map,” said Samriddho Ghosh, another JU student. He added that with the help of the location data, they can predict the demand for oxygen cylinders and plasma donors, which is helping their team of eight members verify more information and upload them on the website quickly. “In times of uncertainty and fear, what matters the most is authentic information. We are providing verified leads so that the families of patients don’t become the victims of fraud and can also save time in emergency situations,” said Debanjali Mitra, a student of Scottish Church College. However, the biggest challenge is to verify whether the leads on oxygen cylinders, ICU beds and food delivery are genuine. “On most occasions, leads get exhausted within minutes after being posted. Sometimes, people don’t pick up calls or charge some exorbitant amount,” said St Xavier's University student, Hridraj Biswas, adding that they verify every lead before uploading them on the website where they update the existing data regularly. The group is set to launch their app soon, which is being designed by Aban Mandal, another JU student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-launch-website-to-stop-oxygen-med-fraud/articleshow/82558902.cms||Dipawali Mitra

These patients can seek doctor’s advice through video call, voice call and online text messaging. Khadki has more than 500 patients in home isolation. Even patients from other areas in the city can make calls for consultation, said Pramod Kumar Singh, chief executive officer, KCB. “The objective os this initiative is to provide authentic medical advice to these patients,” Singh said. Dr Mangesh Pol, who has been treating Covid patients, said, “We get calls from patients in 40-50 age group. We prefer video calls so that we can check their real time oxygen saturation level and fever.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/counselling-for-patients-in-isolation/articleshow/82558838.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Goa||With patients on brink, GMC’s SOS calls to CMO unanswered||PANAJI: Since April 4, Goa Medical College (GMC) has been frantically sending SOS calls, even to the chief minister’s office, pleading for oxygen supply to be restored as close to 500 patient’s lives were at risk. The phone calls, around 20 of them in a short span of an hour, went unanswered even as patients convulsed, gasped and died at GMC. Oxygen supply through GMC’s central line is erratic, putting the lives of patients who are on non-invasive ventilation, those with severe Covid pneumonia and those with acute respiratory distress, at risk. Documents in possession with TOI show that while the state government covered up the deaths and repeatedly insisted that the state had sufficient oxygen supply, patients continued to lose their lives between 2am and 6am. Sources within the health department released documentary evidence showing how calls were made every night to Scoop Oxygen, the chief minister’s office and other authorities asking for oxygen supply to be restored immediately. On Tuesday, the oxygen supply dipped at 4:41am and doctors immediately sent an SOS asking for the supply to be replenished. Ten attempts were made to reach the supplier, but the phone was switched off. The proprietor of Scoop Oxygen was called five times and finally with no response coming, a call was made to the chief minister’s office at 5.17am. “During this time (36 minutes) one patient desaturated to 80 SPO2 and was ventilated with the oxygen cylinder,” the document states. TOI has itself received and reported about SOS calls from patients and their relatives every night pleading for oxygen. The records show that on Tuesday the O2 supply dipped again at 5.42am and then again 6.34am, 8.45am and 10.20am in wards and in the operation theatre. “The supply of the central oxygen has remained interrupted till date, leading to a critical fall in the oxygen saturation of the comorbid, physiologically compromised patients with severe Covid pneumonia. This has increased the mortality and morbidity of these critical hospitalised patients,” said an urgent note moved by some of the doctors at GMC. On an average, GMC has around 400 patients who require oxygen support to survive. Each patient requires two to three oxygen cylinders per day based on the severity of the infection. So while GMC required anywhere between 860 to 930 cylinders, to sustain patients, GMC received just 330 to 630 oxygen cylinders over the last five days. “There are frequent interruptions on a daily basis. The uninterrupted supply of central oxygen at adequate pressure as well as cylinder oxygen is vital for the management of Covid patients,” said the note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-patients-on-brink-gmcs-sos-calls-to-cmo-unanswered/articleshow/82562565.cms||Newton Sequeira

We told the owner that he has to submit proof of the dog being walked regularly. As per neighbours’ complaints, the dog is kept tied outside all day, without regular walks since the last two years. We have also asked for the dog’s vaccination records from the owner. He has been unable to furnish all of this so far. Further action is being considered in the form of a notice to the owner.”Vineeta Tandon, managing head, PFA, said, “The dog has had bouts of nose bleeds because he being kept out in the heat all day. Breeds such as St Bernards, Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamute are not meant for the tropical weather in India and can succumb to serious health problems like heat stroke, dehydration, weakness and gastroenteritis, if exposed to the harsh summer heat continuously.”Tandon alleged that the police has failed to register a complaint under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, despite videos and pictures of the dog being tied outside all day. “While the authorities have been dragging their feet, the animal continues to suffer. The dog should be immediately confiscated for its own wellbeing under relevant sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure, PCA and Bombay Police Act,” said Tandon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spca-investigates-alleged-mistreatment-of-pet-dog-by-its-owner/articleshow/82560724.cms||Neha Madaan

The BJP also alleged that the BMC had inflated the estimated cost of the contract to Rs 86 crore from Rs 25 crore. The BJP alleged that the firm had tied up with a local company and had participated in the tender by giving dealership to a local company. “A private firm has been blacklisted by Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Medical College for non-performance. The company could not set up the oxygen plant in 30 days as per the work order and so it was blacklisted in November 2020. Now the same company is making a backdoor entry in the BMC by giving dealership to Ms Highway Construction Company, which was penalised in the penguin enclosure scam,” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said. Mishra said that he had written to additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu asking him to disqualify the blacklisted firm. “Ms Highway Construction Company has taken an authorised dealer/distributor contract/MOU from M/s Unissi India Private Limited so as to fulfil the tender condition that allows the authorised dealer/distributor to claim the experience of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Once the blacklisting of the firm is found to be factual, take immediate and urgent action in the matter by disqualifying the firm,” Mishra’s letter said.  Unissi India did not reply to a query from TOI. An official said the company had claimed that Unissi completed all the work and got all payments. “They have claimed that the firm is not blacklisted as on today as there is stay on the blacklisting,” the official said. “Oxygen plant rates vary according to the oxygen production capacity and the method used,” a BMC statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tainted-co-in-race-to-set-up-oxygen-plants-in-city-says-bjp/articleshow/82560832.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli stressed on the need for the AAP government and the Centre to increase the number of doctors, nurses and support staff in hospitals, identifying it as one of the main reasons for patients often not being attended to even inside a hospital. “You can’t leave patients unattended. Either allow a family member or a private attendant inside. Maybe a kin who has recovered from Covid can be there. That’s why doctors’ and nurses’ numbers need to be increased, we have been saying this for sometime now. You can’t blame the doctors, will they work on treating a patient or keep answering calls from the worried relatives?” the bench pointed out. The advice to Delhi government to bring out a policy came after the amicus curiae senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao said kin of patients are not allowed inside sealed Covid wards and don’t get any information on their condition. “Often diapers of senior citizen patients were not changed for two days,” Rao highlighted. The court also expressed its displeasure over Delhi government claiming that on May 10, 250 beds in the new dedicated Covid facility in Dwarka, Indira Gandhi Hospital, were already operational. “It was not fair on the part of Delhi government to give incorrect facts,” the bench said, adding that “the newspapers of Saturday said 250 beds in the hospital were operationalised, but not a single bed has been occupied till date”. The remarks were made after the government apologised for the incorrect statement on May 10. The bench was informed that for lack of oxygen cylinders and concentrators, the beds have not yet started. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra assured it that 150 beds would be operationalised during the day and another 100 by Wednesday. The court directed Delhi government to give category wise — with/without oxygen, ICU and non-ICU — details of its beds and listed the matter on May 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/patients-cant-be-left-unattended-at-covid-hospitals-says-hc/articleshow/82558949.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||Urvi left with less than 30m tunnelling||Kolkata: East-West Metro now has less than 30m of tunnelling work left. Tunnel borer Urvi is likely to achieve its breakthrough on Thursday, hitting the diaphragm wall below Bowbazar’s Durga Pithuri Lane and crossing the biggest milestone for the project. Engineers of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing the city’s most ambitious infrastructure project, said tunnel boring machine (TBM S-616) might punch the diaphragm wall below Durga Pituri Lane by Thursday evening. Thus would end the most tedious journey of the Metro corridor project. For it was here at Durga Pituri Lane off Bowbazar that many buildings were razed — after some of them either collapsed or were critically damaged on 31 August 2019 and around 700 residents evacuated as water gushed into a under-construction tunnel. The giant machine digging the westward tunnel ran into an aquifer resulting in water seepage and large scale subsidence. Tunnelling was stopped as Chundi, the TBM digging the westbound tunnel, became defunct. In February 2020, Urvi, the twin TBM digging the east-bound tunnel, restarted and continued till its destination Sealdah station. On January 4, a recommissioned Urvi started its journey to bridge the last 800m gap of the westward tunnel started. Urvi’s breakthrough will finally mark the completion of the TBM-driven tunnels of the Rs 8,575.98crore East-West Metro project. A diaphragm wall is built to integrate the tunnel with the station. In this case, the diaphragm will bridge the two portions. Had it not been for the second wave of the pandemic, KMRC and contractors ITD ITD-Cementation would have celebrated the breakthrough with much fanfare. In end April, many ITD’s staff members got infected. The front office had to be kept shut from May 2 to break the contagion chain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/urvi-left-with-less-than-30m-tunnelling/articleshow/82558919.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Pune||Retailers urge PMC to allow shops to operate for longer||Pune: The Pune District Retailers’ Association has urged Pune Municipal Corporation to allow shops to function for more hours and also permit non-essential shops to provide home deliveries in specific time slots, in view of the drop in the number of daily cases. The association recently submitted a memorandum to the municipal commissioner. The association said the essential shops were operating only in the morning, while non-essential shops had been completely shut for a month. This had led to a huge financial setback. Some relaxations could be given, the association stated. TimesViewThough nobody would ask for a total relaxation of the curbs, the PMC can think of ways to allow non-essential shops to function. What is perceived as non-essential can become essential when people need plumbing material or electrical parts at home. At present they do not have any way to address these problems. The administration can consider allowing them to home deliver or operate for limited hours a couple of days of the week to minimise the inconvenience faced by people.Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retailers’ Association, said, “The state government and civic administration imposed strict restrictions last month after Covid-19 cases had increased. The shopkeepers accepted the decision and followed the restrictions diligently for over a month. Now, the cases have been reducing and the situation appears to be under control. The government should allow all shops to function for limited hours,” he added. A trader, Suresh Mehta, said that many had faced huge losses because of the restrictions. “We are asking for a relaxation for a few hours. This is because the cases have reduced considerably. The shopkeepers will follow all the necessary steps,” Mehta said. Nivangune said that a demand had also been made to provide vaccines to the staffers working in the retailers’ shops. “There is a shortage of vaccines, which has led to overcrowding at the vaccination centres. The staffers at retail shops are trying their best to get the doses, but are facing many challenges. It will be good if the administration vaccinates the staffers because they are almost like the frontline workers,” Nivangune said. Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of Federation of Trade Associations of Pune, said that all non-essential shops were shut for a month. The shopkeepers were not in a position to bear the restrictions any more, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retailers-urge-pmc-to-allow-shops-to-operate-for-longer/articleshow/82558938.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Motilal Nehru College to get 7 more RT-PCR machines||PRAYAGRAJ: Amid preparations for confronting the anticipated third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an additional thrust on speedy identification of suspected Covid cases and getting the result of RT-PCR test in much lesser time at Motilal Nehru Medical College. Hence, the microbiology lab at MLN Medical College of the city is all set to increase the number of trained staff to 41. It would also add seven more machines to conduct the RT-PCR test. This is the only government facility which conducts RT-PCR test of people with Covid-like symptoms. “For the purpose, we will now have seven machines in place. Two have already arrived and the rest will be made available soon”, said head of the microbiology department, Dr Monica. Moreover, the present strength of 30 staff members, including the 18 lab technicians, would be increased to 41, as the department is set to get 10 more lab assistants. Recently, when over half of the trained technicians were infected with the virus, the lab was forced to work with the bare minimal strength of staff. The move will ramp up RT-PCR testing, which in turn will speed up the treatment of the infected patients. “We are strengthening our facility in order to be able to fight the spread of infections in future owing to the anticipated waves of the virus. We want the microbiology department of MLN Medical College to be ready in advance to confront the invisible enemy,” said principal of the college, Dr SP Singh. Recently, around 6,000 tests were being conducted daily in the college’s microbiology department. However, as Covid infected 15 employees of the department, the lab was working with half the staff capacity. Due to this, the investigation reports remained pending everyday. “We will soon be better equipped with seven RT-PCR machines and an enhanced staff strength, ready to confront the anticipated third wave with determination,” said Dr Monica.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/motilal-nehru-college-to-get-7-more-rt-pcr-machines/articleshow/82560758.cms||---

The personnel have also established a liasoning network with hospitals to make available beds or medicines for Covid-infected personnel or members of their families. Senior police officers make timely calls to infected personnel to check on them. The cops hold online meets with Covid-positive staff to enhance his/her moral. “A majority of our personnel are under home quarantine but, in order to avert depression and anxiety, we have taken a few steps and it is really helping us out,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad. “As of now, the police stations have 31 positive patients, and, in the last 10 days, the number has gradually declined. Many policemen and their family members have been infected, which increases their anxiety. So, we decided to deal with the issue through friendly chats. We also arranged necessary supplies and medical facilities. We have given them elaborate plans on how to isolate in the house, even if it is a 1BHK. Also, we are keeping a tab on their requirement for medicines and healthy food,” Gaikwad said. According to the system, each morning a senior inspector or crime inspector from the police station calls the infected personnel and talk to them. During the chat, they also note down the oxygen level and temperature of the infected personnel. The senior police inspector maintains a chart of these details. “They inquire about the health of infected personnel and other family members in a friendly manner,” she added. The senior police officers have arranged interactive sessions by artistes and actors. “This has also helped a lot and it reduces the anxiety of the people at work,” the officer said. It has been noted that if the personnel and his/her family members are care for, it helps reduce depression and anxiety that the infected personnel may be feeling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-help-colleagues-overcome-anxiety-depression/articleshow/82558958.cms||---

Uncertainty looms large like never before on designers and tailors as the pandemic has put couture business in danger zone. City based fashion designer Shirin Ali says, “We are facing uncertainty as our sales have dipped to a major extent. Customers are not coming due to curfew. This is the second Eid season in which all our expectations of doing good business have been hit. We have been facing losses for the past two years.” “The trend of online shopping has also become popular and has dented our business to a major extent,” Ali added. “Gone are the days when customers used to carry their decades-old Baranasi sarees to designers and asked us to design latest outfits from them,” recalls Ali, adding “The timing of both the first and second corona wave has hit us and snatched our business in two consecutive festive seasons.” “The business had revived well by February and we were hopeful of our sales increasing further in the marriage and festive season, but now it is difficult to say if there would be any business recovery this year,” said Aditi, another fashion designer. “We also offer online shopping but customers prefer buying from big e-commerce sites as they get exchange facilities,” she added. The local designers say queries for orders and bookings had started coming in March but the second wave hit the wedding season first and now the Eid one also. The owner of a showroom trader at Civil Lines said, “No one knows when this situation will improve and when our business will revive.” The pandemic has changed the lifestyle and priorities, and spending money on fashion and luxury is now unconvincing for many.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/second-covid-wave-dashes-hopes-of-business-revival-for-fashion-industry/articleshow/82560859.cms||---

Despite conducting nearly 50,000 Covid-19 tests, only 8,443 new cases were reported from the region. On the other hand, 14,707 patients recovered from Covid-19. Death toll of all 11 districts reduced to 173, the lowest since April 14. This development is a strong indicator that the Covid-19 curve is moving downwards. As projected by scientists, decline of the second wave will be faster than its surge. So, we can expect quick dip in new cases and deaths in next one week. While cases from city (municipal corporation area) were very less, cases are still coming from rural areas of Vidarbha and they need special attention now. Out of 173 deaths reported on Tuesday, Nagpur city accounted for 32 deaths, Chandrapur 9, Akola 4, and Amravati 5.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops file chargesheet in 2019 pub brawl case registered by Anup Dange||MUMBAI: The Gamdevi police last week filed a chargesheet against Yash Shah, grandson of film financier Bharat Shah, and six others for obstructing a public servant from performing his duty. The incident took place in November 2019, when police inspector Anup Dange had visited a pub and found it opened beyond the permissible time. Dange had recently written a letter to the CM, home minster and other senior officials alleging that Param Bir Singh had discussed with other officers how to remove the name of one of the accused from the case. Singh had rubbished the allegations. “We filed a chargesheet last week,” said R G Rajbhar, senior inspector of Gamdevi police station. Those named in the chargesheet include Yash, his two friends, three people with whom Yash had allegedly got into a fight and pub owner Jitu Navlani. In his letter dated February 2, Dange narrated what had happened on the intervening night of November 22-23 in 2019. He had gone to check all pubs at Breach Candy to ensure they had closed within deadline. But a person who introduced himself as Jitu Navlani pressurised him to allow his pub to stay open citing his connections with Singh, who was then the director general of ACB.  Later, a scuffle broke out between two groups of patrons outside the pub. As police intervened, a “drunk patron manhandled constable Santosh Pawar”, an officer had then said. The drunk man and two of his friends, including Shah’s grandson, Yash, were held after Yash tried to flee. Shah and his son Rajiv demanded that Yash be released and got into a spat with cops. A fresh case was filed against Yash’s father and grandfather. Navlani was also named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-file-chargesheet-in-19-pub-brawl-case-registered-by-dange/articleshow/82560865.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Parties issue Covid-19 helplines but little help||Hisar: In addition to the district administration, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jananayak Janata Dal (JJP) and the Congress have issued their helpline numbers, taking the initiative to help Covid patients get treatment. On Monday, TOI checked the ground reality by contacting the numbers. No one picked up the BJP helpline number, 7404862684 and there was no reply after 24 hours. No solutions are being provided on helpline numbers of the district administration, JJP and the Congress too. Three patients sought assistance on the helpline numbers. They include a 78-year-old Covid-19 patient admitted in Agroha Medical College, who is now in critical condition. On Sunday night, doctors told his relatives that his condition was serious and asked them to arrange a ventilator for him as soon as possible since no ventilator bed was available in the medical college. The second patient is a 62-year-old man, resident of New Professor Colony, who tested positive on May 3. After this, he received many calls from the health department team asking him to note his temperature, but he did not receive the kit mentioned by the health minister. He was not even given medicine. His oxygen level was 73 on Monday and he needed an oxygen bed immediately. The third case is that of a 40-year-old resident of Thakka village, who was admitted in a private hospital. Although he tested negative, he had all symptoms of Covid and the doctor advised him to get admitted in the Covid care centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parties-issue-covid-19-helplines-but-little-help/articleshow/82560879.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||They drive through Drive-In, spot real-life heroes||AHMEDABAD: They say life imitates art – and it couldn’t have been truer for movie-loving Amdavadis who drove to Drive-in Cinema on Tuesday. But instead of catching their favourite flick on the humongous screen, they were in for a different kind of shot. Instead of watching movies from the comfort of their cars, the comfort this time was to remain safe in the bubble and get vaccinated right in the vehicle. Instead of tickets, volunteers checked their documents and instead of getting parking space, they got their queue numbers! The city boasts of one of the few functional drive-in theatres in India. After Bhopal, the city converted its cinema infrastructure into a vaccination facility. The drive was launched here on May 10, and over 300 have received vaccination daily, said AMC officials. “In movies, we see heroes and villains. Here, we saw healthcare workers fighting against Covid-19 and saving us. How is it not straight out of a movie?” asked Rajendra Avasthi, a resident of South Bopal who got vaccinated along with his wife. Naranpura resident Chirag Shah, who had come with his wife and sister, gave another simile. “We wait for three hours for the films to get over. Here we waited for three hours to get vaccinated. As a movie buff, I had seen many films here, and we spent the time discussing movies and the pandemic,” he said. Several citizens tried to beat the rush for the token, like getting tickets for first day first show, and got successful. “We had tried at a few other centres, but here the arrangements were such that we were assured of getting the shots right inside the comfort of our car. What more could we ask for?” said M J Parikh, who got vaccinated alsong with his wife. “We all must get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/they-drive-through-drive-in-spot-real-life-heroes/articleshow/82559030.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: St Michael’s Church in Mahim starts vax drive on its premises for 45+ age group||MUMBAI: One of the oldest churches in the city, St Michael’s Church in Mahim, on Monday became the first in the city to start a vaccination centre within its premises. A total of 237 beneficiaries above the age of 45 years got the jab on the first day. St Michael’s is famous for its signboards that display messages packed with pithy humour and the Wednesday novenas that drew people of all faiths until the pandemic-induced lockdown. Parish priest Fr Lancy Pinto said when he heard the BMC was looking for spaces in every civic ward to set up vaccination centres, he was more than keen to offer space on the church premises. “We requested that the drive be started for those in the 45+ category as there are several in that age bracket in the locality. Being centrally located, it also offers easy access,” he said. Local Shiv Sena corporator Milind Vaidya, who helped set up the centre, said the facility is located at an isolated spot within the premises so that the drive can continue uninterrupted even after religious places are given a nod to reopen. Assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward, Kiran Dighavkar, said the parish has given an undertaking that vaccinations can be carried out for the next six months. “Two booths with a capacity to vaccinate over 200 people daily have been erected,” he said. However, the centre had to be closed on Tuesday due to a vaccine stockout. Rita D’Sa, a parishioner and former president of the Bombay Catholic Sabha, said since the church and adjoining school have several gates, it has been decided to facilitate entry and exit of those coming for the vaccine through Gate No. 6. “Our only request is that walk-ins should be allowed for senior citizens since they are finding it extremely difficult to book online slots,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-st-michaels-church-in-mahim-starts-vax-drive-on-its-premises-for-45-age-group/articleshow/82560882.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nashik||DCHC in Satana to start by Friday||Nashik: Civil surgeon Ashok Thorat on Tuesday set a three-day deadline to start the Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) in Satana. According to an official, the DCHCs have been started in Kalwan and Deola talukas. And the task to have all the necessary requirement and facilities in place for the DCHC in Satana is being carried out. On Tuesday, the number of active patients in Satana stood at 1,347, but the taluka does not have a DCHC to aid its fight against Covid-19. Thorat’s decision comes after Satna MLA Dilip Borse raised the issue that people from the taluka are failing to get any treatment at the local level and are forced to find a DCHC in the neighbouring talukas or travel all the way to Nashik civil hospital. The MLA had raised this question during the cold review meeting conducted by district Guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal at Nashik district collectorate on Saturday. Following the meeting the civil surgeon decided to visit rural areas on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The visits to Satana and Deola were part of the same decision. Thorat during his visit to Satana felt the need to start the DCHC, but there are some issues that have delayed the process.“The DCHC will now support people who require oxygen support. This will prevent the patients from travelling to Nashik city in search of treatment,” Thorat said. Meanwhile, active cases in Nashik city dropped from over 18,500 on May 3 to less than 14,000 on Tuesday. However, the number of active patients in rural areas remains unchanged at 15,700.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dchc-in-satana-to-start-by-friday/articleshow/82555566.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The men were apprehended on Monday. Jigar Parekh, 27, of Shilaj, and Ashok Darji, 66, of Ghatlodia, allegedly bought the stock from a Surat man. According to the crime branch officers, they got an input that two men were carrying remdesivir in an autorickshaw. A crime branch team intercepted the men. Police officers said that they recovered a box from Parekh in which they found the 12 remdesivir vials worth Rs 37,440. He could not show any licence or permit. Along with him, Darji, the autorickshaw driver, was also held. The crime branch said he is Parekh’s aide. Crime branch officers said Parekh told them that he bought the injections from a Surat man whom he knew as Jignesh by paying Rs 11,000 for each vial. Parekh was planning to sell the drugs to relatives of Covid-19 patients in Ahmedabad at the rate of Rs 18,000 per vial.

---||Pune||Union health ministry presents Mum, Pune models for effective Covid mgmt||Mumbai/Pune: Days after PM Narendra Modi lauded Maharashtra’s efforts to control Covid-19, the Union health ministry on Tuesday presented the Mumbai model of decentralised war rooms as an effective method for bed allotment and Pune as a case study for successful implementation of strict containment measures, leading to a decline in cases — two important aspects of management of infection. Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry, told a press conference on Tuesday that citizen communication and decentralisation of processes, such as setting up of ward level control rooms, helped smoothen the hospital admission process in Mumbai. Stringent implementation of containment activity in Pune has led to a dip in the positivity rate as well as the number of cases. “The positivity rate was 41.8 % before strict lockdown-like curbs were imposed, which has now dropped to 23.4%. Also, cases are on the decline,” said Agarwal. He said Pune’s positivity rate was 69.7% in March first week after which it started measures like night curbs, imposed from 11pm to 6am. Reacting to the health ministry briefing, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said the district was adopting stringent restrictions even before the state government announced its curbs. “Pune's strict containment measures, night restrictions and weekend lockdowns have helped bring down the positivity rate, which was high in March and April, to around 21-23% now. Our testing rate is the highest in the state and we have scaled up our vaccinations to 1.5 lakh per day,” he said. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “The positivity rate in the rural areas had touched 40% but went down to around 25% last week. Closing restaurants, malls, schools and colleges and allowing only home delivery of food and groceries are among factors that have helped bring down cases. Increasing vaccination and tracking superspreaders has also helped.” Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, "There is an intermingling of habitation between the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal areas where one lakh people travel between the two places. Therefore, strict containment measures had to be implemented in our areas. The positivity rate in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas in March was a high 45% but that reduced to 21% last week. Importantly, despite restrictions, we allowed major manufacturing units to continue operating, which in a way minimised the blow to the economy.” Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar believes “it is still time before we get to a positivity rate of below 5%.” He said, “However, the strict containment measures with weekend lockdowns has seen the rate in the Pune municipal areas come down from 33% in the first week of April to 15% now. The peak in cases (56,000) was observed on April 21 which is down to 28,600 now in just 20-odd days.” State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said Pune’s average daily cases from April 9 to 15 were 10,026 which has fallen to 9,299 in the May 1-7 week — a negative growth rate of 7.25%, all because of the restrictions, surveillance containment measures, ramping up of testing and crowd control. “Political and bureaucratic will also played a major role in the containment measures. The containment model is basically three Ts — tracing, testing and treatment, which along with restrictions has helped bring down cases,” he added. Last week, even the apex court had praised the Mumbai model for its effective handling of the crisis. The ministry had said Mumbai’s central dashboard to monitor available hospital beds, track ambulances and a system of procuring beds ensured citizens did not face a problem in getting one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/union-health-ministry-presents-mum-pune-models-for-effective-covid-mgmt/articleshow/82560887.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Ahmedabad||Who’s accountable for Bharuch fire: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday directed the government to find out who is accountable for the fire at Bharuch’s Patel Welfare Hospital, in which 18 persons, including Covid patients and nurses, lost their lives on the night of April 30. The HC asked petitioner advocate Amit Panchal to implead Bharuch’s chief officer, Mobin Pirzada, the nodal officer of the hospital, the Bombay Patel Welfare Society, and Bharuch’s chief district health officer as party respondents, and issued notices seeking their response in two weeks. Further hearing has been posted to April 25. The HC rapped the state government for its alleged inaction to prevent fire incidents in Covid-19 hospitals and said that all its actions are on paper only. While hearing the petition seeking action in the fire incident, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia said that somebody has to be made accountable for the incident and commented that the state government’s reply on the issue was vague as to it did not say who had visited the hospital on the day of the fire incident for checking. Justice Bela Trivedi suggested that Bharuch municipality should be impleaded in the proceedings because the affidavit was not clear on who was responsible for checking the facility during the inspection by the fire department. There has to be accountability and responsibility at the level of the municipality. The judges said that the government’s affidavit was vague as it was silent on who had visited the Bharuch hospital for fire inspection and why the new building, where the Covid ICU was situated, was not inspected. The government affidavit claimed the authority was not intimated that a Covid ICU was running in the hospital’s new building. The judges said it is hard to believe that the authority was ignorant about the new building and about the hospital running a Covid facility. Petitioner advocate Amit Panchal filed the petition, alleging inaction on part of the authorities that led to the hospital operating a Covid ICU in its new building without proper fire NOC. The petitioner questioned as to why the inquiry reports of two earlier fire incidents - Shrey Hospital in Ahmedabad and Uday Shivanand Hospital in Rajkot – have not been made public. Justice Trivedi commented, “Merely appointing commission will not serve any purpose.” After a brief discussion, Justice Karia said, “The court’s anxiety is what are you (the government) doing to prevent such incidents in future. You may hang him (the responsible person) or you may dismiss him. But what are the measures you are taking now, particularly with regard to directions issued 20 years back. The directions are for all the hospitals. It (inaction) amounts to contempt of court. It is contemptuous action on part of the government that it is not being vigilant, and incidents keep happening again and again.” The judge further commented that the government actions are on paper, as the government report mentioned about the letters written by the authorities but was silent on what action was carried out on basis of those instructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/whos-accountable-for-bharuch-fire-hc/articleshow/82559171.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Muslim youths make appeal for no gathering, safe Eid in Covid times||KOLKATA: Several young Muslims have planned to celebrate Eid by staying indoors and avoid big gatherings due to the second wave of Covid-19. Many of them are also making an appeal to their fellow Muslims to offer the Eid prayer at home and avoid going to the mosque to curb the risk of contracting the virus. Traditionally, the festival is marked with prayers in mosques and visits to friends and family. Many young boys and girls have taken a resolution that they will not wear new clothes and participate in celebrations for the most important festival of Muslims across the globe. “This Eid helping somebody is as simple as just staying at home,” said Afreen Ahmed, a young advocate in the city. “The cases of people requiring hospitalisation are increasing rapidly and none of us will want our loved ones to suffer. The best way to protect ourselves, our families and the society is to stay indoors on Eid and avoid any gathering,” Afreen has written in her Facebook post. Prayers on Red Road have already been cancelled to curb the spread of the virus and imams have already appealed that elderly people and those with co-morbidities should pray at home. Most of the mosques will hold prayers in multiple shifts to allow social distancing. “Last year, the community had set a very good example by praying at home and spending the festival with the family. . We must again come together and avoid big gatherings over lunch and dinner,’ said MD Asif, a school teacher. “We wait for Eid every year but this time I have decided to shun all festivities in solidarity with fellow Indians who have lost their near and dear ones,” said Ashfaque Mondal, a student of Presidency University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/muslim-youths-make-appeal-for-no-gathering-safe-eid-in-covid-times/articleshow/82559167.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||IIT, IIM, AIIMS alumni AIR concern, set up Covid care facility in south Delhi||NEW DELHI: At a time when Delhi’s healthcare system is flailing while trying to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, alumni of national institutions such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Indian Institutes of Management and Indian Institutes of Technology have supported the creation of a Covid care facility in south Delhi. Currently at a strength of 80 beds, the facility will see the number going up to 200 in the coming days. TimesViewWith unashamed profiteering and total insensitivity, Covid-19 has brought out the worst among some of us. But the worst global pandemic in over 100 years has also galvanised many to put their best foot forward. Thousands have gone out of their way to help strangers. We not only need to encourage them, but also help them help others.The alumni group, referred to as AIR Foundation, has collaborated with the south Delhi district magistrate’s office in creating the facility at the Jain Community Centre in Chhatarpur. The group is crowdfunding the initiative and has garnered a little over Rs 1 crore till date. “We are raising support to augment the already operational Terapanth Bhawan Covid care centre in Chhatarpur to start with and then replicate such facilities in other districts of India,” explained a group representative. The facility became operational a few days ago with the help of the district administration and volunteers who are contributing both hard work and expertise. What started off as an isolation centre in a hall of the Jain Community Centre when the pandemic first hit the city last year has progressed to being a full Covid care centre providing relief even to critical patients in the second wave, said a person who was watched the facility develop. She said, “It charges no money from patients, who are provided oxygen concentrators, BiPAP machines, suction machines and the necessary drugs by trained healthcare workers.” When the second wave of infection overwhelmed Delhi, the need to transform the basic care centre into a full-fledged medical facility was quickly supported by alumni of IITs, AIIMS, IIMs and Maulana Azad Medical College and several entrepreneurs and industry professionals. “The contact details and basic medical parameters of the patient are shared with the doctors at the care centre. The patient then gets a call from the doctor and based on the assessment of that doctor, the patient is asked to approach Terapanth Bhawan,” revealed a representative about the process for admission to the Covid care centre. The facility discourages walk-ins to avoid chaos, but tries to arrange temporary oxygen for such patients till they are able to arrange beds in a hospital. The centre does not charge money from the patients. The representative said, “All facilities, medicines, food, sanitation, etc., are being provided free of charge. However, some necessities like particular blood tests, CT scans, etc. are outsourced and have to be paid for directly by the patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-iim-aiims-alumni-air-concern-set-up-covid-care-facility-in-s-delhi/articleshow/82559205.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Bareilly||Retired CMS of Rampur district hospital found dead; no foul play, say cops||BAREILLY: Retired chief medical superintendent (CMS) of UP’s Rampur district hospital, who was working on an extension at the health facility and treating Covid-19 patients, was on Tuesday found dead at his home. Police and his family members didn’t suspect any foul play in the death and said that 63-year-old Dr BM Naagar may have died due to natural causes. Naagar was placed under suspension 15 days ago after a public spat with a nurse, which was caught on camera and shared on social media platforms. Dr Naagar was staying alone at a government quarter in Rampur’s Civil Lines area. His family members, who live in Meerut, alerted the doctors at the government hospital after Naagar didn’t pick up phone calls. Officiating CMS of Rampur district hospital, Dr Rakesh Mittal, said, “A hospital staff received a call from the doctor’s wife in the afternoon. She had been trying to reach out to Naagar on his phone number but the call wasn’t being received. I too tried to call him several times, but the calls were not answered. So I sent a hospital staff to his home. He found Naagar lying unconscious in his room. Then a doctor was rushed immediately who declared him dead.” SHO of Civil Lines told TOI, “Prima facie, it appears that the doctor died a natural death. The family also said they do not want a post-mortem examination. So the body was handed over to the family in the evening. His last rites will be performed in Khatauli, Muzaffarnagar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/retired-chief-medical-superintendent-of-rampur-district-hospital-found-dead-no-foul-play-say-cops-kin/articleshow/82557087.cms||Maria Khan
---||India||Sachin Waze, arrested in Antilia & Hiran cases, dismissed from police||MUMBAI: Suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, arrested by the NIA in the case of an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia, and the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, was on Tuesday dismissed from police service, an official said. The order terminating Waze’s service was issued by Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, said a spokesperson of Mumbai police. A 1990-batch officer of the Maharashtra cadre, Waze (49), also known as an “encounter cop”, was suspended after his arrest by the NIA in the SUV-cum-murder case on March 13. Waze, now lodged in jail, was reinstated in the Mumbai police in June 2020 after being suspended for 16 years in a case related to alleged custodial death of Khwaja Yunus, an accused in the Ghatkopar bomb blast of 2002. Post-reinstatement, he was appointed the head of the Crime Intelligence Unit. As the CIU head, he was handling a slew of high-profile cases, including the fake TRP case, fake social media followers case, the DC car finance scam and the Ambani security scare case (in which he is now an accused), the official said. The SUV with explosives was found near Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai on February 25. Hiran, a Thane-based businessman who was in possession of the SUV, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5. Waze had allegedly played a key role in both the incidents, the official said. The NIA has so far arrested nearly half a dozen people in connection with the SUV-cum-murder case, including Waze and API Riyazuddin Kazi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sachin-waze-arrested-in-antilia-hiran-cases-dismissed-from-police/articleshow/82564815.cms||---

The action included attachment of over Rs 86 lakh of Razorpay, a leading payment gateway, for failing to carry out due diligence on the Chinese firms and facilitating payments to them. “ED has issued an attachment order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act attaching Rs 76.67 crore in various bank accounts and payment gateways pertaining to Chinese loan app companies and their Indian associates,” the agency said. The money laundering probe was initiated by the ED on the basis of FIRs registered by Bengaluru CID after a series of complaints were received by the police. Recovery agents of these Chinese-controlled loan apps harassed and blackmailed borrowers who failed to return the loans. Earlier, similar actions were taken in Hyderabad and some Chinese nationals were also arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/loan-apps-rs-77cr-of-companies-run-by-chinese-nationals-attached/articleshow/82564825.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Covid norms go for a toss as liquor shops open in some UP dists after 10 days||Bareilly: Long queues were seen outside liquor shops that opened on Tuesday for a limited duration. The Uttar Pradesh government has asked district magistrates (DMs) to take a call on opening of liquor shops in respective districts. As the liquor shops reopened for a two-hour window period after around ten days on Tuesday, large crowds thronged these shops flouting Covid-19 protocols. People were seen violating social distancing and other Covid-19 norms in several videos that surfaced on social media. In Moradabad, shopkeepers said that they had been repeatedly requesting the customers to maintain social distancing and follow the Covid rules but locals continued to flout the basic guidelines at the liquor shops. Crowds of people were spotted at liquor shops located in Majhola and Civil Lines localities of Moradabad. Only a few of them wore face masks. Several others were spotted violating the basic Covid guidelines even though Covid-19 cases are being reported from the district on a daily basis. Vidu Bharadwaj, owner of a liquor shop, said, “Following the instructions from the district administration, we had reopened the shops for a few hours on Tuesday. It is likely that the shops shall remain open from 10 am to 7 pm from Wednesday onwards. However, we are waiting for an official statement from the administration and excise department.” “As per the stated guidelines, we are only allowed to sell two bottles or eight quarters per person and not more than that. It has become tough to maintain the guidelines as despite requesting people to maintain the decorum, many are not paying any heed,” added Bharadwaj. Asked why no police personnel was present at the spot when guidelines were being flouted, SHO Civil Lines, Moradabad, Yogendra Krishna Yadav told TOI, “Regular patrolling is being done across the city to ensure Covid protocols are followed and lockdown guidelines are not flouted. It got crowded as liquor shops were opened after a long time on Tuesday. It is not possible for police to remain present everywhere all the time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-as-liquor-shops-open-in-some-up-dists-after-10-days/articleshow/82557100.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kolkata||Bratya plans political film on gangster Hubba Shyamal||Kolkata: A day after education minister Bratya Basu’s ‘Dictionary’ won the Best International Feature Film award at the Nepal International Film Festival, the director firmed up his plans for his next feature, this one set to be a “political film”. It will be based on the life of Hubba Shyamal, a gangster, often referred to as the ‘Dawood Ibrahim of Hooghly’, who was booked in over 30 cases, including murder, extortion and drug smuggling. On Basu’s list is also a screen adaptation of Satinath Bhaduri’s ‘Dhorai Charit Manas’. The news of the Gautama Buddha Award for ‘Dictionary’ came the day Basu was virtually sworn in as the state education minister on Monday. “I have always believed that a good film will be recognized at international festivals and on OTT platforms. My belief was only reinforced when the European jury members conferred this award on ‘Dictionary’. It felt good to know my film connected with the jury at a foreign festival. This award is a vindication of my beliefs in the path I have followed as a film-maker,” he said. Asked if he was thinking about introducing films and theatre in school curriculum, Basu said, “I have some plans and will have a word with the chief minister and see how that can be executed,” he said. Currently, his focus is, however, on efficient management of the Covid crisis. “I spoke to my doctor. If all goes well, I should be back on the streets by this weekend after recovering from Covid. Once the situation is under control, I will shoot for Riingo’s ‘A River in Heaven’ and Soukarya Ghosal’s next,” he said. Thereafter, Basu wants to start pre-production of ‘Hubba’. Bangladeshi actor Mosharraf Karim, who was also part of ‘Dictionary’ cast, along with Nusrat Jahan, Abir Chatterjee, Madhurima Basak, Arna Mukhopadhyay, Falguni Chatterjee and Poulomi Basu, will essay the title role. “My film will be a curious blend of crime and comedy,” he said. Hubba, who was active from the end-90s, was arrested thrice but released on bail. He was first picked up in December 2005 from in front of a Salt Lake multiplex. “Left was in power in Bengal. A global change had set in with people having access to internet, mobile, FM channels and social media. Hubba used 70 mobiles,” Basu said. In 2009, Hubba had filed nomination as an Independent candidate in Konnagar’s civic polls but subsequently withdrew his candidature. In 2011, his decomposed naked body was found floating in a canal in Baidyabati. “Through this film, I want to explore the changing dynamics of politics and underworld in the age of globalisation,” Basu added. Besides this script, Basu has also written a play based on contemporary Bollywood and cricket, called ‘Roll, Action, Cut’. “It explores the world of power, glamour, cricket and politics. From #MeToo movement to nepotism, I have included everything. Even political parties, like Shiv Sena and BJP, find mention.” he said. Asked how he intends to balance his work as a minister with his passion for writing, acting and direction, Basu said, “For me, it is a switch-on and switch-off process. After a hard day of campaign, I still wrote till late. That’s my vitamin, my energy drink.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bratya-plans-political-film-on-gangster-hubba-shyamal/articleshow/82559176.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Hyderabad||Citizen : READER’s corner||I found my superpower: Being proactive & focused By Abhiraaj Arora To inspire people, don’t show them your superpowers. Show them theirs. —Alexander den Heijer My travels and experiences have taught me a lot. One thing that has really caught my attention is the problem of shrinking green cover from the earth’s surface. I have seen a marked difference in how I feel when I am in nature verses when I am surrounded by concrete. Last year, I returned to Hyderabad (from Germany) just before the lockdown. All of a sudden, I found myself surrounded by tall buildings and very limited access to trees. I couldn’t go out of my home and it started affecting me mentally. I realized I need to do something about it. Soon, I was introduced to the Leader-In- Me programme at school. Habit 1 of the programme (adapted from American educator Stephen R Covey’s book: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) taught me to be proactive and see the alternatives and not the roadblocks. It was easy for me to sit and complain but I chose to do otherwise. After talking to my parents, I decided to grow plants on our balcony. I started focusing on Habit 2 which says: Begin with the end in mind. I started creating a mental picture as to how I wanted our balcony to look and the plants I wanted to grow. We sat down, as a family, to discuss. My mom wanted decorative and flowering plants; dad and me wanted to grow vegetables. It was difficult. Here, I put to use Habit 4, which was to think win-win, which helps us to build trust and Habit 6, synergize, which helps us to look for new and better alternatives. We took the third alternative and grew herbs and leafy vegetables first. We also started making our own manure using egg shells, banana peels and tea leaves. Now, I am trying to follow Habit 7: sharpen the saw. I have set up daily walking goals, I am reading up new content about gardening, I am collecting seeds to give to a trust that plants trees and I am happy to have gardening as a new hobby. My next aim is to learn how to create a compost pit and once I master the basics, I want to spread the awareness about the same in my neighbourhood. Habit says find your voice and inspire others to find theirs. I am trying to inspire others by using my voice. Being proactive is my superpower. What’s yours? (The writer is a class 7 student at Glendale Academy) I learnt to cherish small pleasures of life By Pranab Saha Last year, I had just finished my final exams and was waiting to go for outings when the lockdown was announced. All my happiness at exams being over, disappeared. In fact, for many days, I didn’t know what to do with myself. Then I decided that since there was nothing much to do, I might as well work on improving myself. I started to sketch, listen to music, watch movies and read with fervour. My drawing and writing skills improved. My reading speed also increased two-fold. As sad as it sounds, I also learnt to stay without friends. But this was a wonderful opportunity for me to bond with my family. We played board games and I discovered my love for Scrabble. I also read about the new genetic engineering technology called ‘CRISPR’ and was fascinated by it. I spent hours marvelling about how this could change mankind forever. The lockdown gave me an opportunity to reflect on all the things that I took for granted so far, such as going to my granny’s house every summer, meeting my relatives, gorging on Haleem during Ramadan, playing with my friends and going to my community library. I missed my friends in school and on the bus. I never thought I would miss them but I actually did, even the ones that would make fun of me! On the upside, I discovered new books and authors to read. I helped my mum in cooking new dishes that we had not experimented with before. Online classes helped me stay in touch with my friends virtually. The new normal gave me a chance to witness the way my parents work. I participated in various competitions and workshops arranged by my mum’s office. Once we are ready to go out again, I will look at the world with new eyes. I will cherish the simple pleasures of life like hopping on to an auto, having an ice-cream while watching the world go by. I really miss all the field trips organised by my school. Once the world is rid of the coronavirus, I would like to visit the Hussainsagar Lake and feel the wind on my face. I would want to relish all the Hyderabadi delicacies in the tiny by lanes of the Old City. I know we will be a part of history but I hope that a pandemic like this never happens again, ever.

---||Kolkata||Costly diesel pushes up price of pulses, pinches kitchen budget||KOLKATA: A costlier diesel has made prices of essential commodities going through the roof. Fighting the fire in the kitchen budget is seemingly impossible, said homemakers. After edible oil, the prices of pulses — an essential edible commodity — have registered a record rise. The retailers put the blame squarely on the daily rise in diesel price. The transportation cost has almost doubled in the last one year. The impact on the retail price is thus inevitable. Pulses are the essential proteins for all during this pandemic, more so for vegetarians. “But under the current circumstances, we are forced to cut corners to strike a balance in the budget. We have reduced the quantity of daal in our meal,” said Anindita Samanta, a homemaker at Thakurpukur. The rise in prices of pulses happened in a short time — within a fortnight. Masoor dal (premier category), which used to be sold at Rs100-Rs 110 a kg, is now selling at Rs 135-140. The ordinary Masoor price rose from Rs 80 to Rs110 a kg. The retail price of premier Moong is now hovering around a double century-mark. Even a fortnight ago, the prices varied from Rs 150 to Rs 170. The premier Chana (chhola) daal that used to sell at Rs 80-Rs 90 a kg, is now selling at Rs 110-Rs 120, the ordinary variety is now retailing at 90, which used to be Rs 70 a kg, said Gaurango Adhikary, a retailer at Janbazar market. The Urad (biuli) daal price has also gone up — from Rs 110-Rs 115 a kg to Rs 130 a kg — in just one week, said Samar Ghosh, a retailer at Gariahat. The Retailers Association of India (RAI) has an assurance, though. “There is enough stock of grains, pulses and other daily essentials for the extended lockdown period and beyond in different parts of the country. There is no need for citizens to believe otherwise and engage in panic buying,” it said. RAI also said that the association along with its members is working closely with various state governments, including that of Bengal, and with the Centre to address supply concerns. There was a fresh bout of panic buying at various pockets of the city at the end of the election. People indulged in panic buying despite the government sending strong signals of not imposing a blanket lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/costly-diesel-pushes-up-price-of-pulses-pinches-kitchen-budget/articleshow/82559190.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Mumbai||Vax drive for 18-44 in Maharashtra may be frozen till June 1 on expert advice||MUMBAI: In view of the massive shortage of vaccines in Maharashtra, the state task force has advised the MVA government to suspend the drive for 18-44 years till June 1, by which time more doses are expected to be available, TOI has learned. By Tuesday evening, many districts had gone ahead and suspended vaccination for the 18-44 age-group altogether, although Mumbai has not taken such a call. BMC officials said they haven’t decided to suspend the drive yet, but a decision may come in a day or two if vaccine shortage becomes more acute. The Maharashtra government had earlier in the day decided to divert nearly 2.75 lakh Covaxin doses that were purchased for the 18-44 group to complete the second doses for the older group. This move will “slow down” the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age-group, said public health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday. On Tuesday, 26,015 people from all age groups could take the vaccine, a drop from 31,043 vaccinations on Monday. Faced with a lot of criticism about people above 45 struggling to book appointments online, civic authorities are likely to come out with revised guidelines on Wednesday. Citizens have been complaining that the slot announcements are only made on Twitter, which many over 45 are not acquainted with. Glitches with receiving OTPs and security codes are also not allowing people to register. On Tuesday, the booking slots were not open till 11pm for the next day’s vaccination that is likely to start at most centres post-noon. AMC Suresh Kakani said the BMC may consider walk-ins for some percentage of people over 45 years. “We will be issuing some fresh guidelines,” he said, adding that online registrations will remain the pre-dominant mode. “Earlier, we were vaccinating 1.5 times our capacity. We have been able to bring that down to a normal rate and reduce overcrowding with online registrations,” he said. The slots are now opened according to vaccine availability. Aaditya Thackeray, guardian minister for Mumbai suburban, said on Twitter that he met BMC commissioner I S Chahal and Kakani to discuss a strategy for “ensuring second shot is administered in time; and communication & slots for those not tech savvy or on social media”. The state, meanwhile, said that with a large number of people due for their second dose, they may prioritize people requiring the second dose, in which case the wait for the first shot may get longer for the 45+ category. “The Covaxin stocks that were purchased by the state government for the 18-44 age-group will now to given to the people from the 45+ age-group who are due for the second dose. The vaccination for the younger group will have to be slowed down for a few days till supply stabilizes,” said Tope. There are over 5 lakh beneficiaries from the 45+ category who are due for their second dose of Covaxin, and the state only has 35,000 Covaxin doses. Another 16 lakh people who took the first dose of Covishield are due for their second dose. Palghar district has halted vaccination for those in the 18-44 age-group. In a late evening order, district collector Dr Manik Gursal said doses received for the 18-44 category will be used to administer second doses for the 45+ category. Tope spoke to Union health minister Dr Harsh Varshan on Monday night, seeking enhanced vaccine supply for Maharashtra. “Vaccine supply is a challenge even for the Centre. We have approached both the vaccine manufacturers in the country and have also written to the Russian Direct Investment Fund to seek supply of Sputnik vaccine, but no manufacturer has shown the ability to match our requirement,” Tope said. So far, a total of 1.84 crore beneficiaries in the state have received at least one dose of vaccine. State officials said that the government will be pursuing with the Centre regarding allowing a state-level app for the vaccination drive. “A demand for a state-level application was raised by CM Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting with PM. This app will be useful as the state wants to plan out its own vaccine strategy and add age-related filters for sequential vaccination for the 18-44 age-group,” an official said.

---||Kolhapur||4 districts account for 11% of state’s active patients||Kolhapur: The four districts of Kolhapur, Satara, Solapur and Sangli together account for almost 11% of all active Covid cases in Maharashtra. Satara and Solapur districts specifically have been reporting a consistent rise in Covid cases for more than two weeks. Currently, the state has around 6.5 lakh active patients. As per the data released by the state government and the district administrations, about 69,500 of the active cases are from these districts. Satara district alone has around 22,500 active cases — the highest in southern Maharashtra. Solapur district has 19,001 active cases, Sangli has 16,992, while Kolhapur has 10,987. The officials are unsure if the number of active cases has peaked or not. They said considering the pattern of rise in the 12 other districts that are now showing a slight decline in Covid cases, Kolhapur, Satara, Solapur and Sangli districts may witness a rise in the active for another week or so. Yogesh Sale, the Kolhapur district health officer, said: “The high number of active cases are due to a high number of daily tests. Around 70-80% of the patients are home isolated. We, however, have to ensure that they get cured on time and the disease does not progress and hospitalisation is avoided. We expect the number of cases to peak in a week or two. Measures are being taken accordingly. New cases are bound to come up as interaction among people has not stopped. The asymptomatic patients continue to come in contact with the family members and they then come in contact with their neighbours or shop operators.” Most of the cases are being reported from the rural areas of these districts. Of the 19,000 active cases in Solapur district, around 17,000 are from the rural parts. The trend is similar in the other three districts. Recently, Sangli guardian minister Jayant Patil had said that village-level committees have been set up to keep an eye on the home-isolated patients in the villages. In Sangli, over 13,000 patients — most of them in rural areas — are under home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/4-districts-account-for-11-of-states-active-patients/articleshow/82555719.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Restaurants bank on takeaways, home delivery to tide over financial crisis||Kolkata: The leading restaurants in the city are pinning hopes on home delivery and takeaways to tide over the crisis following closure due to the second wave of Covid-19 from May 2. Some restaurants are hoping to do reasonable business through combination of takeaways and home delivery but majority of them in central Kolkata have decided to stay shut as they feel that takeaways and home delivery is not remunerative enough. So is the story of most of the restaurants in malls which too are closed since May 2. The biryani chains, Chinese restaurant chains are particularly doing well in home delivery. Mughlai chains like Aminia, Royal, Oudh, Arsalan, Zeeshan and Chinese chains like Chowman have witnessed brisk business in last one week while some iconic restaurants in Park Street like Peter Cat, Mocambo, Floriana, Waldorf, Moulin Rouge are also doing home delivery. Director of Aminia, Kabir Azhar, said that they were doing home delivery through both Swiggy, Zomato and its own delivery team. “There is also takeaway. This time as there is no full lockdown, a lot of people are buying from takeaways. Lot of dining sales have been converted into takeaways. We are also doing home delivery through our dining staff,” he added. Many traditional Mughlai hubs in central Kolkata are open just for home delivery. Haleem, which is usually available during Ramzan, is the fastest selling item. Aliah on Bentinck Street has set up a counter at the entrance for parcels. At Royal Indian on Rabindra Sarani several delivery guys from aggregators reach around 4 pm. Zeeshan and Arsalan in Park Circus and Sabir’s in Chandni are also open for home delivery and parcels. MD of Chowman, Debaditya Chowdhury, and Shiladitya Choudhury, founder director of Oudh and Chapter 2, said though the announcement was sudden for everyone, it was quite anticipated by them. Owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo Nitin Kothari said it is also doing home delivery through Zomato, Swiggy and its own workforce. “It would be 15-20% of our sales,” he added. Charles Mantosh, owner of Floriana, Moulin Rouge, Waldrof, said they are also doing takeaways and home delivery. But, president of HRAEI, Sudesh Poddar, said most of the restaurants in central Kolkata have closed their kitchens. “As there is no locality nearby there is hardly any demand for takeaways and home delivery,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurants-bank-on-takeaways-home-delivery-to-tide-over-financial-crisis/articleshow/82559220.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji
---||Delhi||Make formula public, let more firms produce vaccine: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has suggested to the Centre that it should make the Covid vaccine formula public so that more and more companies can make them. Kejriwal has also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi making the same demand. The new companies could be asked to give royalty to the two vaccine manufacturing companies for sharing the formula, he suggested on Tuesday. Currently, only two companies are producing six-seven crore vaccines in India in a month and the country is facing a shortage, Kejriwal pointed out. “In this sense, vaccinating the entire country will take more than two years. Till then we don’t even know how many waves of Covid will come and how much destruction we will have to face,” he said. The vaccination drive has gained momentum in Delhi with the city now administering 1.25 lakh doses every day and the government planning to inoculate three lakh people every day if vaccines are available. “A major problem that is being faced is that of shortage of vaccines. We have only a few days of vaccine left in Delhi and this problem is being faced countrywide. There is a shortage of supply of vaccines in the entire country,” the chief minister said. “There are some states where because of the scarcity of vaccines, the process has not even started as yet.” In the letter to Modi, Kejriwal underlined the need for the production of the vaccine on a war footing to vaccinate all citizens. The central government can do away with the production monopoly using the patent law, he suggested. It will help in giving protection to the citizens before the third wave and save many lives, he added. In a digital address, the chief minister said the Centre should formulate a national policy to vaccinate every person within the next few months by increasing the production and multiple companies should be engaged. “We must increase the production of vaccines in India at insurmountable levels and formulate a national policy to vaccinate every person within the next few months. Unless everyone is vaccinated, the battle cannot be won,” Kejriwal said. The chief minister suggested that the Centre should take the formula from these two companies and give it to all those companies that can safely make the vaccines. “The central government has the power that it can execute this... It can make the vaccine-producing formula publicly available to the companies that want to make the vaccines,” Kejriwal said. He urged that vaccines should be produced in all plants that are successful in making them and every Indian should be vaccinated. “This is the only way by which we can vaccinate all Indians rapidly,” he emphasised. Kejriwal said the country had some of the biggest pharma companies in the world. “We have world-renowned scientists. I can say this with a guarantee that if they are given the opportunity, they will provide full support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/make-formula-public-let-more-firms-produce-vax-cm/articleshow/82561045.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Hyderabad||Expect vaccine drive for 18+ to start from June||n How different are the symptoms in the second wave as compared to the first wave? —Vinay Pujari The Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat etc. are much the same. The only difference is that the rapidity of the severity of these symptoms is much higher in the second wave as against the first wave. Clinical deterioration of Covid-19, especially those with comorbidities is very fast. When can we expect vaccination drives for 18-44 years to start? Has Telangana placed orders with manufacturers? —Suhas AR We can expect the vaccination drive for 18-44 years to commence from June. Currently, we have insufficient doses from the Centre and hence priority is being given to those who are due for their second jab. The manufacturers are not directly handing over the vaccine to the states since the centre has instructed that the manufacturers should give 50% of the vaccines to the centre and 50% to the state. Negotiations are on with the central government and the manufacturers to secure vaccines to Telangana. What additional measures can we take while handling the patient’s food and clothes at home? —Parimala G Tadas Clothes worn by Covid-19 patients must be kept separately and sterilized using basic methods such as boiling water or with an antiseptic liquid. Clothes of Covid-19 patients must not be washed with other normal clothes, they should be washed separately. As far as food is concerned, a designated space must be identified where the caregiver can keep the food outside the room where the patient is isolated. The food should not be directly handed over to the patient. Utensils being used by the Covid-19 patient must be separate and washed under boiled water. Those handling their food must wear gloves and keep it in the designated area. Utensils must be washed in boiled water. Should the caregivers undertake the RT-PCR test if they have no symptoms and should the test be repeated for them once the patient tests negative for Covid-19? —Priyanka G An RTPCR test should only be conducted if one has come in direct contact with the Covid-19 affected patient for one to three minutes. If there is a direct contact, a person should get tested within two to three days. Just entering the room where the Covid-19 patient co-existed doesn’t call for an RTPCR test unless one develops any symptoms. Once the Covid-19 affected person tests negative, the caregivers need not undergo any RTPCR test. Repeating the test is not required. I am a senior citizen aged 74. My wife and I got the first dose of the vaccine on March 25. I am unable to get a slot for the second jab. The Arogya Sethu app is not reachable in spite of repeated attempts. What should I do? The CoWin site shows all dates as booked. Is there any alternative? —S Raghavan The gap between the first jab and the second jab can extend from six to eight weeks. One should just ensure that the same vaccine is administered for the second jab as well. Private hospital which administered the first jab has now denied the second jab if we just walk-in. Through online registration, we were given a May 12 slot, which was also cancelled without any specific reason. Can you please guide us as to how we can get a second vaccine? —Shripal Choudhari Now that the government has started walk-in service for those due for a second jab, you can directly go to any government or private hospital and get vaccinated. If the vaccination is available, no hospital can deny the second jab to you. What are the guidelines for post ICU home care and management after moderate to severe disease? —Amrita Pokade Soon after they turn positive, treatment should be continued as per the discharge summary by the doctor for another 7-10 days. Although isolation is not required, one must maintain some distance for a week from other people. Where can we find reliable information on availability of rehabilitation clinics or home ICU care providers? —Amrita Mahendarkar The government website https://covid19.telangana.gov.in/ provides all the information. Apart from this, there are several independent healthcare websites that are now providing information on ICU care providers and rehabilitation clinics Recently, I got a cold fever headache followed by frequent sneezing. My family feared Covid-19. However, my test results were negative. Please provide details about what are the symptoms required if one should get tested for possible Covid-19? And also advise us which vaccine is effective for me as my age is 60 years? —Mubbesher Mehdi Covid-19 is like any other common cold. Severe watering of the nose, severe headache, redness of the eyes, severe nasal itching, continuous sneezing, high temperature, severe muscle pain, muscle cramps, nasal secretion are some of the symptoms to look forward to. If you have these symptoms, one must get tested. While there is a lot of debate on Covishield vs Covaxin, there is not much difference in both the vaccines. They both are effective in fighting the Covid-19 virus and can be taken without any hesitation. How can we know bed and oxygen availability in hospitals in real time? —Asim Shaik People can follow the government website and personally check with the hospitals on bed availability. Apart from this, there are a lot of independent platforms started by volunteering groups and NGOs that are working in this space. Their volunteers on the field are able to share the availability status of beds by personally verifying them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/expect-vaccine-drive-for-18-to-start-from-june/articleshow/82561016.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Hakim focus on e-vehicles to cut down on pollution, cost||Kolkata: Firhad Hakim put maximum thrust on electric vehicles and charging infrastructures on the first day at office as the new transport minister on Tuesday. “We need to reduce emissions and earn carbon credit for the city,” Hakim said, making his priorities clear. He held meetings, where certain decisions that had been pending owing to the polls, were taken. The transport department, he said, would encourage private operators to adopt e-buses. “This is the future of vehicles. E-buses will offer immunity from the rising fossil fuel prices. I will sit with private bus operators. Because of the sharp rise of fuel prices, the government expenditure has gone up. Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation will look into it,” he said. Emphasizing on the need to go digital, Hakim said they planned to start e-permit and strengthen other e-payment and e-challan systems so that people did not need to visit the public vehicles department. “We have to make e-services available to citizens,” he said. About the current shortage in public transport vehicles, Hakim said if necessary, the number of state buses would be increased to meet the demand. “I have asked the MD of WBTC to submit a report on fuel bills and the scope of strengthening fleet size. Those who will replace their 15-year-old vehicles with e-vehicles will be given incentive,” he said.  Kolkata’s effort to adopt e-vehicles has been recognised globally. As the mayor of the city, Hakim had visited Copenhagen to receive the C40 Award for green mobility in the city. Hakim also said new auto routes would be created to link roads with major highways, where other public transport modes were not available. “Auto routes are used as last-mile connection by Metro passengers. As the city expands, new autos routes will be created, but everything will be done according to a plan and survey. The transport department will assess the ground-level demand,” Hakim said. Pointing at overloading as a problem, he said it had to be abolished to conserve roads and prevent pollution. The number of temporary weigh-bridges would be increased and penalty would be hiked, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hakim-focus-on-e-vehicles-to-cut-down-on-pollution-cost/articleshow/82559219.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Citizen: Impact||Sewage overflowing for 10 days fixed at Dilsukhnagar Hyderabad: Sewage overflow which has been leading to an increase in mosquito menace at Shantinagar, near P&T colony in Dilsukh Nagar for consecutive 10 days was fixed after the grievance was aired on TOI’s citizen reporter app last month. According to local residents, the sewage was constantly overflowing on the main road in front of Kaveri Curry point, causing huge inconvenience to the residents. "I had raised a complaint on the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation online portal as well. But no action was initiated. The sewage was stagnant on the road side and was turning into a breeding spot for mosquitoes," said Venu Narayan, a resident who flagged the issue. Within a few days after it was published in these columns on May 1, officials of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board swung into action to resolve the issue. The spot was also visited by the local corporator who intervened into the matter and got the issue resolved. "The old sewage pipelines are not withstanding the growing population in the area. Following my proposal, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has sanctioned funds to lay 1,000 meters of underground drainage pipeline in the area," said Baddam Prem Maheshwar Reddy, corporator, 23-Gaddiannaram. The corporator plans to divide the 1,000 meters of pipeline in different parts of the area where the sewage overflowing problem persists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citizen-impact/articleshow/82560997.cms||---

---||Goa||Preparatory classes to also get midday meal||Panaji: The Union education ministry has announced that it will implement provisions of the new National Education Policy (NEP) in schools across the country from the new academic year. Once these provisions come into force, Goa will have to extend benefits under the midday meal scheme to students for the preparatory classes. A letter from the Union ministry of education last month had reminded the state of this provision of the NEP. Accordingly, Goa officials are expected to give a commitment on this to officials in the ministry at a meeting to be held this month. Ahead of the meeting, Goa officials have been told that it will have to consider implementation of provisions of the NEP with regards to midday meal scheme from the new academic year. At present, midday meals are only provided for students studying from Class I to VIII. “NEP envisages that the midday meal programme shall also be extended to the preparatory classes in primary schools. Mid Day Meal Scheme plays a significant role in the context of manifesting the principles of NEP 2020 ie access, equity, quality, affordability and accountability,” Goa was told. “NEP observes that children are unable to learn optimally when they are undernourished or unwell. Many children belonging to disadvantaged sections of society reach school with an empty stomach. Even children, who have a meal before they leave for school, get hungry by the afternoon and are not able to concentrate. Mid-day meal helps children to overcome “classroom hunger”,” the letter to Goa stated. When a review of the midday meal scheme’s implementation will be carried out by central officials this month, Goa will have to clarify whether it plans to extend the benefit of midday meals to students even in preparatory classes. Besides this, as per another NEP recommendation, 100% immunisation of students should also be ensured and a health card issued to students to monitor this, the state has been instructed. As most schools remained closed during the academic year 2020-21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state has been asked to submit details of how it provided benefits of the scheme to students during school closure. “In these difficult crisis times, the government of India advised all states and UTs to provide Food Security Allowance to eligible children to meet their nutritional requirements. In this context, you are also requested to provide detailed information about the methodology adopted, process followed and monitoring mechanism adopted to ensure timely delivery of Food Security Allowance in your state,” the letter to Goa stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/preparatory-classes-to-also-get-midday-meal/articleshow/82561320.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Nashik||13 from Nashik were part of DRDO’s trial for drug 2-DG||Nashik: As many as 13 Covid-19 patients from Nashik were part of phase III trial of the DRDO drug at a city-based private hospital. The private hospital in Nashik was chosen for the trial of a drug that has been developed by the DRDO’s leading laboratory, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), in collaboration with private laboratories. The drug (2-DG) has now been granted the emergency use approval by the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) to help reduction in supplemental oxygen dependence. Explaining the trial process Dr Manoj Chopda, MD (Internal Medicine) and DM (Cardiologist) of the private hospital, said patients in need of oxygen or ventilators were chosen for the trial with permission from their family and after informing them about problems related with the trial. “Eight men and five women were chosen for the trial and all of them were between the age group of 45 and 70 years. All the patients depicted faster recovery in terms of use of oxygen as well as testing negative for Covid,” he said. “We observed the patients for 14 days with minimum hospitalization for seven days. The significant inference from the same was that the drug helped in drastically reducing the need for supplement oxygen,” he added. While the patients not on oxygen tested negative for the virus on the eighth day, those on oxygen support did not need any assistance to breathe after the third day of the treatment. “At the same time, patients who were on BiPAP (Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure) were put on oxygen and after the saturation was stable they were also removed from oxygen,” Chopda said, adding the stay time of patients was reduced significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/13-from-nashik-were-part-of-drdos-trial-for-drug-2-dg/articleshow/82555737.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Covid vaccine: Stocks running out, Delhi to float global tenders||NEW DELHI: Nearly 125 vaccination centres administering Covaxin in Delhi will be closed from Wednesday because the stock of the vaccine meant for those in the 18-44 age group is finished. Only three-day stock of Covishield for the same age group is left, AAP MLA Atishi stated on Tuesday. Meanwhile, shortage of vaccines seems to have triggered a confrontation between the AAP government and the Centre. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said Delhi government would float global tenders for procuring Covid vaccines because “the Centre is forcing the states to invite global tenders for vaccine procurement.” “It is the role and responsibility of the government of India to integrate the needs of all states and procure vaccines through a global tender for India, instead of leaving states to fight in an international marketplace for vaccines. If states are asked to purchase vaccines internationally through global tenders, then the state with the largest coffers would unfairly procure the maximum number of doses. This will lead to fights among states, and further bashing and criticism of the country in international communities,” Sisodia said in a digital press conference. Sisodia said the BJP has asked why Delhi did not float global tenders for procuring vaccines and slammed the Centre for it. Sisodia said the Centre wants the states to compete with each other in the international market for vaccines. He demanded the Centre to launch a nationwide Covid vaccination drive on the lines of pulse polio drive. “The Centre exported vaccines that could have been used in India, and is now sowing discord among states. In times of a deadly crisis, its role has had a detrimental effect on managing Covid crisis and certainly pitting states against each other only makes things worse. It is apparent that the central government’s model of Covid management is to overlook the needs of Indians and export vaccines to other countries,” said Sisodia. “Countries such as the United States or European nations prioritised vaccinating their own people. In India, the central government is apparently more interested in lying and vilifying others instead of taking immediate interest in managing the Covid crisis,” Sisodia said. AAP has said that India exported 6.5 crore vaccine doses. Sisodia said that the country could have vaccinated an additional 6.5 crore citizens had it started mass vaccination drive and inoculated individuals fully in March. “Instead of accepting their mistakes, BJP is busy blaming state governments,” said Sisodia. Delhi government has ramped up vaccination coverage to ensure more and more people are vaccinated at the earliest. Around 1.5 crore people are above 18 in the capital. Delhi needs three crore doses to vaccinate these 1.5 crore people but the vaccine is in short supply. Till Saturday, the city had received just 40 lakh doses. Delhi needs 2 crore 60 lakh additional vaccines. “For healthcare/frontline workers and those above 45 years, only 5 days stock of Covaxin, and 4 days of Covishield are left,” Atishi said, demanding the Centre to supply sufficient number of vaccines to Delhi because it has suffered much hardship due to Covid. “If we are not supplied sufficient vaccine doses, we will have no choice but to halt the vaccination programme,” Atishi said. In a press conference, she announced that 2,67,690 doses of Covishield will be supplied to Delhi by the Centre by Tuesday evening. Delhi has so far received 48,70,490 doses of vaccine and utilised 42,52,710 doses of vaccine among all eligible groups. Currently, Delhi is vaccinating two groups—healthcare/frontline workers and those above 45 years and those between 18 and 45 years of age. 1.4 lakh people were vaccinated in the city on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stocks-running-out-delhi-to-float-global-tenders/articleshow/82561127.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Kolkata||Torrential rain floods Kolkata, youth electrocuted near Raj Bhavan||KOLKATA: The city and the suburbs were lashed with torrential rain, which was accompanied by a thunderstorm, on Tuesday afternoon as the skies opened up around 2pm, flooding the streets. A 25-year-old youth died by electrocution as he waded through a waterlogged road near the Raj Bhavan main gate at Government Place (North). Officials at Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore said a massive cloud mass had formed over South 24 Parganas that moved over Kolkata. “The cloud mass entered Kolkata and moved slowly. It took four hours to cross the city and caused the kind of rain usually witnesses in monsoon,” said RMC director G K Das. The downpour was such that extensive parts of north, central and east Kolkata were flooded, with the KMC drainage pumping stations recording 70 mm of water at some places between 2pm and 3pm and over 130mm in others. “The city hasn’t witnessed such intensity of rain in a long time,” a civic official said. Some south Kolkata areas, like Gariahat, Rashbehari Avenue and Tollyunge, also saw heavy rain, while Karunamoyee and Sector V in Salt Lake were flooded. Waterlogging at Government Place, where poorly insulated wires from a lamppost or an electricity junction box were possibly inundated in the water, cost the life of Rishav Mondal, an engineer from NTPC Nabarun, Farakka. According to police, Mondal was walking through the flooded road when he collapsed. He was spotted floating in the water by a tea vendor, Bhola Prasad. His father, Montu Mondal, later said Rishav, who was employed with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, had just left office to return to his Kolkata home. “He spoke to me before leaving office. He told me about the rain and waterlogging. I advised him to take a cab,” said Montu. Later, a neighbour saw the news on TV and told the family about the loss. Dalhousie, Burrabazar and Jawaharlal Nehru Road were among the worst-affected places, where waterlogging persisted for several hours. According to a KMC drainage official, lockgates on Strand Road along the Hooghly were shut till evening due to high tide and so, stormwater could not be pumped out for a long time. Clogged sewerage was also responsible for flooding at SSKM Hospital, where water entered a few indoor departments. Parts of Ultadanga, Kankurgachi, Beliaghata, Thanthania, APC Roy Road, Bidhan Sarani, College Street and Chittaranjan Avenue stayed under water till late evening. A KMC official said pumping stations could drain out 10mm water in an hour. With places receiving seven times the volume, waterlogging was inevitable, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/torrential-rain-floods-city-youth-electrocuted-near-raj-bhavan/articleshow/82559247.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Centre firm on supply of O2 to TN from Inox||Thiruvananthapuram: The Centre has decided to go ahead with its decision to allocate oxygen for Tamil Nadu from Inox Kanjikode, despite the objection raised by Kerala. In the latest order by national health mission director Sanjay Roy issued on Tuesday, it has been ordered that Inox Kanjkode would provide 40 MT per day liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to Tamil Nadu on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 11 and 12). The allocation order by the Centre came a day after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to the Centre stating that the state would not be able to allocate oxygen to Tamil Nadu after May 10. “As per the decisions in the meeting of the central committee on oxygen allocation held on May 6, 2021, the state will allow 40 MT to Tamil Nadu up to May 10. However, after this, it will be practically impossible to allow oxygen to be taken outside the state considering the present situation,” the chief minister had said. The state had refused to provide oxygen as its buffer stock of oxygen had depleted from 450 MT to 86 MT, after parting it with other states in the wake of demand. The chief minister had said that the state should be allowed to use the entire 219 MT oxygen produced in the state, including 170 MT being produced in Inox Kanjikode. The Centre’s revised allocation of 40MT LMO from Inox Kanjikode to Tamil Nadu, reducing the original allocation to the state, was overruled by the state through an order under Disaster Management Act, on May 9. The state had used its powers under Section 20 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, asking Inox Kanjikode to supply 150 MT of LMO to the state, for last Sunday. On April 30, the Centre had allocated 150 MT LMO from Inox Kanjikode to the state and 20 MT to Karnataka. Later, on May 8, through another order, the Centre revised the allocation from Inox Kanjikode, after Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin wrote to the Centre. In the revised allocation, the Centre had said that Tamil Nadu has to be supplied with 40 MT for four days from May 9 to 12. This effectively reduced the state’s allocation after parting with oxygen to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, putting immense strain on the state’s buffer stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-firm-on-supply-of-o2-to-tn-from-inox/articleshow/82557127.cms||KP Saikiran

The college on Tuesday also set up a kiosk for RT-PCR testing on the campus, which will be ready from Wednesday. Principal Rama Sharma wrote, “Just like others, the university employees and their families are also facing challenges to find Covid facilities for their dear ones. This could help such people and reduce some of their anxiety.” Sharma added that there was no vaccination centre in North Campus, and a facility centre in the college would be a major help for the university staff. “People have to travel long distance to get vaccinated. We have the infrastructure for a Covid care facility, but we do not have technical facilities. Hence, we have written to the government to use our space,” she told TOI. The principal said a hospital or a vaccination centre would be better than using the hostel as an isolation centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hansraj-college-offers-hostel-space-as-covid-care-facility/articleshow/82559250.cms||---

Charity Commissioner Y M Shukla had on Monday issued a show-cause notice to ‘We The People Charitable Trust’ asking it about the authorisation given to Mevani to raise funds from public in the name of the organisation to set up oxygen plant and concentrators in his constituency of Vadgam. “‘We the People’ charitable trust is registered with the charity commissioner's office. It is been allowed to carry out public welfare activities and collect funds to do so,” said Mevani. “But suddenly on Monday, through media reports, we came to know that the trust’s bank account has been frozen. The commissioner says he did so after the organization failed to respond to the show-cause notice issued to them on May 3, seeking to know about the authorisation given to me for crowdfunding. But the organization has not received any such notice. “This is a political vendetta against me in the worst form and that too during such critical times, when we are fighting Covid and need to stand together,” said Mevani.

Mayo Hospital, originally known as Calcutta Native Hospital, is located within a kilometre of Howrah station and spreads over six acres with a capacity for 600 beds. On Monday, in a meeting with traders, religious figures and representatives of local clubs, chief minister announced the state government will revive the hospital as a Covid facility to start with. Traders in Posta assured the CM that they will extend support in supplying ration because it will not only benefit the local community but also the traders and labourers. “Mayo Hospital is very close to Posta and Burrabazar and people do not have a medical facility in the area so we will turn Mayo Hospital into a Covid-19 facility. Work will start soon,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Local traders had urged the chief minister to earmark a few beds for the shop owners and workers in the wholesale market of Posta which has been open even during the pandemic to ensure uninterrupted supply of edibles throughout the state. “We had requested the CM to provide us with a small facility for the treatment of traders and workers in Posta who are working despite the surge in cases. She immediately agreed and promised to turn Mayo Hospital into a Covid-19 treatment facility. We are indebted and have assured her of all the help from our side,” said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of the traders’ association in Posta. In the past attempts were made to revive the sick healthcare facility but to no avail. It was also decided to turn it into a satellite unit of Kolkata Medical College and Hospital but the plan did not materialise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-to-revive-british-era-hosp-as-covid-facility/articleshow/82559245.cms||Zeeshan Javed

She, however, added that the benefits of lockdown will become evident only after a week. Speaking to media persons in Kannur on Tuesday, Shailaja said that the Covid situation in the state was not uncontrollable, but warned that its spread was severe in some districts. “ICU beds in the state are filling up and steps are underway to increase its numbers,” she said. The minister refuted allegations that the state government was hiding or under-reporting Covid-19 deaths. She said that the state was classifying Covid deaths on the basis of medical reports prepared as per guidelines issued by the World Health Organization. “There is no need for us to hide or under-report Covid deaths,” she said, adding that Covid deaths cannot be hidden as all deaths would reflect in the death registrations carried out in local body institutions. The state was able to keep the death rate low by providing proper treatment to patients, and also because of the system in place for monitoring and treatment of lifestyle diseases, she added. She said that the government was trying hard to ensure oxygen availability to patients. “The state should be able to use the entire oxygen produced here, and the situation can be managed well if the state receives its share from the central government,” she added. The minister said that the government was experiencing shortage of trucks to transport oxygen and has requested the Centre to provide the required vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/decision-on-lockdown-extension-only-after-may-16-shailaja/articleshow/82557202.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said the Covid patient had ended up there while attempting to flee from the facility and managed to squeeze through the narrow window. But his escape bid was foiled because he realised any attempt to jump would lead to a nasty injury and hence, sat down on the sill. Finally, fire brigade and disaster management group personnel had to step in. One of them donned a PPE suit to rescue the man. The patient has been returned to the ward and kept under observation. According to Bowbazar police and hospital authorities, the patient attempted the escape at 3.30 am. A little later around dawn, staffers on early morning duty spotted him sitting on third floor window sill with his legs dangling. They then raised an alarm. As an anxious crowd gathered below, the patient — tired of sitting — even dosed off. Around 5.15 am, fire brigade and DMG arrived. One of them wore a PPE as others provided support. they used ladders to reach the patient and coax him to safety. Bowbazar police said the patient appeared to be mentally disturbed and the isolation had made him desperate. “He is being counselled and hopefully he will recover quickly,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-patient-rescued-from-hosp-window-sill/articleshow/82559258.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The Zero Shadow Day — when the sun is exactly overhead due to which the shadow of symmetrical and vertical objects almost vanishes — is expected to generate enthusiasm, especially among children who are confined in homes during the ongoing pandemic. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, said Zero Shadow Day has its genesis in the fact that there is 23.5 degree tilt in the Earth’s axis “It is not factually correct when we generally say that Sun comes overhead every day at 12 noon considering this tilt. When the Sun comes at the zenith (the highest point in the sky), shadow of symmetrical and vertical objects disappears as sun rays are falling perpendicular on them. The astronomical event happens twice in a year between the Tropic of Cancer (+23.5) and the Tropic of Capricorn (-23.5),” he said. While the Zero Shadow Day will again take place in July, Aundhkar said it is advisable to experience the Zero Shadow Day on May 19 considering the weather may be cloudy during monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/zero-shadow-day-brings-enthusiasm-amid-covid-blues/articleshow/82555758.cms||---

Prayargaj Navik Sangh president, Pappu Nishad said, "At a time when people are coming to Sangam – the confluence of the holy Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati to immerse the ashes of their family members of loved ones on the banks of Ganga and pandas/priests are performing all rituals, permission should be granted to a limited number of boatmen so that they could earn their bread and butter." He said that there was no restriction on pandas\ priests performing rituals at their camps as visitors from different parts of the country were arriving for immersion of ashes in the Ganga. Expressing disappointment, he added that there has been a complete ban on the plying of boats and that those arriving for immersion of ashes were doing so on the banks of Ganga instead go immersing the ashes in deep water as boatmen are not allowed to operate." Nishad added, "We would be following all the Covid protocol if the district administration grants permission and only five persons wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing would be rowing the boats." Nishad said they would be meeting the district magistrate and senior police authorities on Wednesday or Thursday in support of their demands. There are over 1,500 boatmen at Sangam who earn their livelihood while rowing the boats for visitors. "As rowing or sailing is completely banned in the Covid pandemic, the boatmen families are finding it difficult to arrange two square of meals," said Manoj, a boatman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/allow-us-to-operate-with-covid-norms-boatmen/articleshow/82561114.cms||---

There are roughly 400 textile exports units in Karur district, which are allowed to operate with 50% manpower. While 1.5 lakh workers engaged directly and another 1 lakh indirectly, the lives of the workers are at stake considering the pace of the Covid-19 spread. “In all likelihood they can become super spreaders as they came from different parts of the district and the neighbouring districts on a daily-basis,” says R Stiffen Babu, member of the Karur Textile Exporters Association. He said public could be seen moving in Karur town without any restrictions even during the complete lockdown. People could easily escape from police saying that they are going to textile units for work. He said he asked the district administration to take a call in this regard, as at least 10 days of lockdown is essential to contain the virus in the coming days. The world is seeing the alarming Covid -19 situation in India. Countries importing finished textile goods from us will acknowledge positively even if we ask for a grace period to send the orders, he said. Many of the textile units may say that they have pending orders, but the situation may go out of control by then. The administration needs to take a decision on the same, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-textile-exporters-association-demands-full-lockdown-of-units/articleshow/82561132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Authorities have reportedly told shop owners to display boards at the shops with the changed timing in the evening. “I rushed to the liquor shop this evening when I learnt that a lockdown has been imposed, I was late but the boards displayed said the store will remain open from 6 am onwards,” said Girish R, a resident of Jubilee hills. Confusion over opening of shops continued for some time in the evening as special instructions were needed on liquor shops timings. The license agreement of the liquor shops allows them to run the business between 10 am and 11 am, but the excise department can change the timings whenever necessary and give fresh notification. During the recent night curfew, the fresh timing was indicated in a notification. Apart from liquor shops, another notification permitting the activities at distilleries, according to the changed timings is also awaited. “Though some liquor consumers are relieved, but from sales point of time we are not hopeful, given the timings are too early,” said a shop owner. “There could be some logistics issues too as we have to submit our accounts to banks daily and their timings don’t match with us,” he added. The Telangana Liquor and Beer Suppliers Association has appealed to the state government to allow shops to allow door delivery through food delivery apps. The association also said that it would be better if the timings for business was changed to 12 pm to 4 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/owners-of-liquor-shops-unhappy-with-biz-timings/articleshow/82560193.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In some areas, the backlog has gone up to a week as finding a replacement for delivery boys who are down with Covid-19 has become a difficult task for dealers and distributors. Also, five distributors have died of Covid-19 in the last few months with many now scared to keep the offices open. Every day, about 70,000 refills are supplied in Greater Hyderabad and two lakh refills per day in the state. Federation of LPG Distributors of India president P Venkateshwar Rao told TOI that they have urged CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to recognise delivery boys as frontline workers and take up a special vaccination drive for them. Telangana LPG distributors president Jaganmohan Reddy confirmed that six distributors and 10 others, all involved in LPG booking to delivery, have died in the last few months due to Covid-19.“Though former minister Eatala Rajender had in principle agreed to hold a special vaccination drive for LPG staff, it has not been implemented. Later, the government issued orders stating that only 45 years and above aged people would be given vaccination. Almost all delivery boys are young and aged below 45,” he said. Greater Hyderabad LPG Distributors Association president Ashok Kumar said the recovery rate is high among delivery boys and appealed to consumers to inform the delivery boy if there are Covid-19 cases in the house so that they can take precautions accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lpg-supply-hit-as-infections-spike-among-delivery-boys/articleshow/82560364.cms||Roushan Ali

Days after principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghavan said that the high levels of the virus circulating in the country shows signs of a third wave coming, state health officials said they are gearing up to meet the challenge. “During the first wave in the state-run hospitals there only 18,000 beds and now the number has gone to 53,000 beds. Realizing the importance of the oxygen supply, we are planning to have cryogenic tankers soon, so that hospitals will not have any problem,” a top health department official told TOI. In a high-level review meeting, authorities said the third wave may be intense and the intensity can be reduced only with the help of vaccination. “We have a roadmap ready. As part of it, more staff are being recruited, and at primary health centre and mandal levels, infrastructure will be improved,” an official said. The main concern during the second wave was higher caseload not only in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) areas, but also in the many towns, especially where polls were conducted. Realising the importance of completing the vaccination, global tenders are being called, and about Rs 10 crore has been paid to Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India for more vaccine supplies. “If vaccination is not completed at a faster pace there can be more restrictions in the state on the moment of the people,” said one official. The proposed plan involves strengthening mechanisms up to the district levels. The health department will continue to focus on tracing symptomatic people and start giving them treatment even if they are tested or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-gearing-up-for-third-covid-wave-with-more-equipment-facilities/articleshow/82560113.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The Covid relief task force of the Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) received 5,000 calls and provided relief including oxygen and plasma supplies to 3,000 patients in the last one week. The control room works round the clock at the SIO Telangana state headquarters.

The SIO’s control room also provides online doctor consultation free of cost. It has a panel of 154 doctors, who attend to patients’ needs round the clock. Once patients or their attendants call the task force through the dedicated 24×7 helpline numbers or social media, the volunteers at the control room receive the information and pass on to the volunteers on the field, who will then attend to the problem. SIO Telangana unit president Dr Talha Faiyazuddin told TOI the organisation had enrolled 1000 volunteers across the state to reach out to the needy Covid-19 patients. “We receive information from our field volunteers. This is updated every six hours. The system of helpline is very easy even for a common person to take help.

It is this realisation that prompted a sub-inspector of police and a group of volunteers to feed more than 200 street dogs under the Thiruverumbur police station’s jurisdiction on Tuesday. “Usually, local people and restaurants would provide leftover food to street dogs. The lockdown has minimized the chances,” SI D Nagaraj attached to the station said. Already known for his extensive activities of helping the abandoned, slumdwellers and wandering mentally-ill people by providing them food and groceries during the first wave, he joined hands with a group of 21 volunteers including women who work under the banner “Time tochange”. “We discussed the modalities last Saturday when a suggestion came to feed the dogs too. All of us found it valid and started doing it from today,” he said. The team cooked 25kg of rice sourced from local people, prepared chicken gravy with 20kg of chicken, mixed them and served it to the dogs. “I am looking for sponsors to take care of the raw materials and the team will take care of the preparation and service till the lockdown ends,” said Nagaraj who issued identity cards to the volunteers to move around for the cause.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cop-youths-join-hands-to-feed-street-dogs/articleshow/82561161.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The Uttar Pradesh government has asked district magistrates (DMs) to take a call on opening of liquor shops in respective districts. As the liquor shops reopened for a two-hour window period after around ten days on Tuesday, large crowds thronged these shops flouting Covid-19 protocols. People were seen violating social distancing and other Covid-19 norms in several videos that surfaced on social media. In Moradabad, shopkeepers said that they had been repeatedly requesting the customers to maintain social distancing and follow the Covid rules but locals continued to flout the basic guidelines at the liquor shops. Crowds of people were spotted at liquor shops located in Majhola and Civil Lines localities of Moradabad. Only a few of them wore face masks. Several others were spotted violating the basic Covid guidelines even though Covid-19 cases are being reported from the district on a daily basis. Vidu Bharadwaj, owner of a liquor shop, said, “Following the instructions from the district administration, we had reopened the shops for a few hours on Tuesday. It is likely that the shops shall remain open from 10 am to 7 pm from Wednesday onwards. However, we are waiting for an official statement from the administration and excise department.” “As per the stated guidelines, we are only allowed to sell two bottles or eight quarters per person and not more than that. It has become tough to maintain the guidelines as despite requesting people to maintain the decorum, many are not paying any heed,” added Bharadwaj. Asked why no police personnel was present at the spot when guidelines were being flouted, SHO Civil Lines, Moradabad, Yogendra Krishna Yadav told TOI, “Regular patrolling is being done across the city to ensure Covid protocols are followed and lockdown guidelines are not flouted. It got crowded as liquor shops were opened after a long time on Tuesday. It is not possible for police to remain present everywhere all the time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-as-liquor-shops-open-in-some-up-dists-after-10-days/articleshow/82557245.cms||Maria Khan

Police suspect it to be a case of suicide and sent the bodies for the autopsy to ascertain the exact reason for their death. So far, 22 cases of couple suicides have been reported in Bareilly division since 2019. The couple aged, 23 and 19 — also distant relatives — were residents of Jaitipur area of Shahjahanpur district and knew each other since childhood, said police, adding that their families were against the relationship. Even members of their community had raised objections against their relationship and the girl’s family had started looking for a suitable match for her, said police, adding that since they were adamant to get married, they left home and were found dead the next day. SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal said, “The couple was identified from the mobile phone details of the youth. Their kin claimed that the couple had committed suicide, but we would conduct a proper investigation. The bodies were sent for autopsy and the report is awaited.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/missing-couple-also-distant-relatives-found-dead-on-railway-tracks-police-suspect-suicide/articleshow/82557205.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Leopard poached by poisoning calf carcass, paws and canines removed||Nagpur: A three-year-old leopard with missing paws and canines came to light on Tuesday in Sadak Arjuni forest range under Gondia division. This indicates that local poachers selling carnivore body parts are active in Gondia and Bhandara districts.Highly decomposed carcass of a male leopard was found by a group of tendu leaves collectors in compartment number 556 of Ghogarghat forest area. “We have arrested a father-son duo who sprayed poisonous insecticide thimet on the leopard carcass after it killed their calf,” says assistant conservator of forest ( ACF) Pradeep Patil.The arrested duo, Sukhaldas Torankar (65) and his son Sandeep (40), admitted that the leopard had killed their calf on the night of April 30. On May 1, Sukhaldas sprayed thimet on the carcass. “This means the leopard carcass is 12 days old, and the foresters did not know about the incident despite the carcass lying 50 metres from the roadside,” says Gondia honorary wildlife warden Sawan Bahekar.Sources said all the forest beats where poaching incidents have taken place were manned by women forest guards, indicating the staff is not moving out. Otherwise, such incidents would have come to light days earlier, they said.“After consuming the flesh, the leopard died. But Torankar has denied his hand in removing the four paws and canines. The accused were produced before JMFC Sadak Arjuni, who granted a day’s forest custody remand (FCR),” said Patil.Sources said NTCA protocol to dispose of the carcass was not followed and no post mortem was conducted. ACF Patil, Gondia honorary wildlife warden Mukund Dhurve and vets were present at the spot.Dr SB Waghaye said, “Post-mortem was not conducted as it was 11-day-old carcass. We took samples of both, intestine of calf and leopard, but it is unlikely poisonous substance will be detected from such an old carcass.” This is not the first case of leopard poisoning in Gondia and Bhandara divisions. On January 4-5, 2021, two leopards and a nilgai were disposed of after removing their body parts in Tilli (Mohgaon) under Goregaon range in Gondia. On February 15, two adult male leopards were dumped in a farm well after they were poisoned in the Adyal range under Bhandara division.Prior to that, a tiger was electrocuted at Chutia village in Gondia in November 2020, and during the same period a leopard skin was seized from three persons by Navegaonbandh police. The accused were residents of Sakoli.All these cases seem to be revenge killings, as cattle kill compensation is not paid on time. CCF P Kalyan Kumar said, “The Sadak Arjuni case is different as the farmer did not demand compensation nor informed us. It is true that by March 31, 2021, Rs1.20 crore remains to be paid towards cattle kill and crop damage compensation in four divisions in Nagpur circle.”Bahekar called for deploying special monitoring teams to check poaching menace and develop a local workforce and intelligence network relating to gangs traditionally involved in poaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-poached-by-poisoning-calf-carcass-paws-and-canines-removed/articleshow/82556948.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Drive-in will not expose the persons to anyone and they will be safe inside their car. There is no need to register for the jab, but one has to produce residential proof or Aadhaar card while availing the facility. It will be free of cost,” the DC said. Only two people, including the driver, will be allowed in a car. After the vaccination, the two will have to wait for 30 minutes. The facility is only for those above the age of 45 years, frontline workers and health care workers. Mohali has been vaccinating people 18 years old and above irrespective the fact the Punjab government is yet to start giving this group the shots officially.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/get-the-jab-in-your-car-at-mohali-drive-in-centres-from-today/articleshow/82557216.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Liquor shops want single-stretch operation hour in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Owners of liquor off-shops are urging the Excise department for a timing in a single stretch without interruption like jewellery trade. Most of the liquor off-shops in the city are facing a tough time for over a week following the clarification issued on May 1 by the Excise department following an order of state chief secretary restricting hours for markets in the wake of Covid second wave. Most liquor shops have witnessed a major decline in sales in the last one week. As per the order, the off-shops will remain open from 7am to 10am and again from 5pm to 7pm, along with other non-essential shops and markets. Sudip Kumar Ghosh, a leading liquor merchant told TOI that timing like 12 to 5 or 3 to 8 would be much better. Tamanjan Saha and Debasis Ghosh, who also have off-shops, agreed. The off-shops have already witnessed a 50% fall in sales in the last one week. Ghosh said another major problem it is facing is to open shop at 7am. “Most of our employees in the shops are coming from far-off places, so it is difficult to open shop before 8-8.30am,” he said. But, he was hopeful that the timing for off-shops would change as the government would consider the plight of the trade. Another retailer who has shops in north Kolkata said that it has to accommodate a lot of staff in order to open the shop by 8am. A liquor retailer in central Kolkata said that from an average daily sale of Rs 1.5 lakh-Rs 2 lakh in most of the shops, it has come down to Rs 50,000-75,000. “We are also facing problems in home delivery because we have registered the sale within the stipulated time,” he added. There are 350 bars (on-shops) and over 1,500 off-shops and country spirit shops (CS shops too are not allowed to sell IMFL) in Kolkata only. Total figure in Bengal will be over 7,000 taking together both bars and off-shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/liquor-shops-want-single-stretch-operation-hr/articleshow/82559297.cms||---

Those arrested were identified as Hetal Kathiriya, medical officer in Tristar Hospital and Vrajesh Mehta, administrator of Jiomax Hospital in New City Light. The duo had aided Rasik Kathiriya, the main accused of the black marketing racket busted on Sunday. Police had found injections worth Rs 2.70 lakh from Rasik, who is Hetal’s father, on Sunday. Hetal and Mehta were produced in a local court that remanded them to police custody till May 14. According to police, Hetal used to approach relatives of Covid-19 patients admitted in the hospital and inform them that she has contact with a person who can provide them the injection in short supply. Tocilizumab is in high demand for treatment of critical Covid-19 patients. While the actual price of the injection was Rs 40,000, the accused were selling it at Rs 2 lakh, said police. Mehta used to purchase the injection from a medical store and supply it to Rasik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-held-in-tocilizumab-racket/articleshow/82557248.cms||---

The library was launched by Kalkaji MLA Atishi on Tuesday. The facility will offer oxygen concentrators for free to those in need for 4-5 days. “In many serious cases, the oxygen level drops dangerously for a Covid patient during the commute from home isolation to hospitalisation. Patients in home isolation may also need oxygen support,” said one of the staff members at the MLA's office.“To help patients of Kalkaji in such situations, the library will provide concentrators for free.” “The government in Delhi prioritises healthcare needs of the public above all. Every form of assistance is being provided to help people in times of need,” MLA Atishi said. She tweeted: “In these difficult times, we all need to come together in this fight against Corona. I have launched an ‘Oxygen Concentrator Library’ in my MLA office at Kalkaji with the support of American Indian Foundation and daivik foundation. With oxygen concentrators being available in the locality, we can save the lives of patients whose oxygen saturation is dipping rapidly. After a patient has used the concentrator, it will be returned to the MLA office and will be available for use by other patients!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-concentrator-library-set-up-at-kalkaji-mla-office-for-locals/articleshow/82559311.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Ganga Ram among many Delhi hospitals to halt vaccine drive||NEW DELHI: Many hospitals in the capital are shutting down the inoculation drive due to shortage of vaccines. Some hospitals have already done so while a few others are managing with the available stock, but have the capacity to vaccinate more people. At Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, the Covid vaccination drive can’t be expanded as it is getting only 200 doses of Covishield every day. A senior official at the hospital said, “We were to vaccinate 600 people every day but we have not been able to do so as we are getting only 200 doses. We have all the infrastructure ready. Once we start getting more doses, we will vaccinate as many people as we can.” At Fortis Healthcare, which is carrying out the operations at seven centres in north India, the drive for the 45-plus category has been impacted due to the shortage. “We have received only 50,000 doses of Covaxin, so we are vaccinating around 2,500 people per day. We have also placed orders, but had the doses been readily available, we could have carried out the drive at a faster pace,” an official said. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has also shut down its drive after the stock got over. The hospital managed to vaccinate over 12,000 people from Match 1 to April 30. “We stopped the drive as we did not have the supply. We have asked the government and even placed an order with the manufactures. Initially, we were told that we won’t get Covishield but today we got a mail saying we will soon get it. We are waiting,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ganga-ram-among-many-city-hospitals-to-halt-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82561187.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ventilator admissions in state double in 10 days||Kochi: ICU and ventilator admission for Covid patients in state has more than doubled in the first 10 days of May. While on May 1, 650 people needed ventilator support and 1,808 were admitted in ICUs, by May 10, the number of patients on ventilator stood at 1,340 while those in ICU rose to 2,641. Between May 1 and 10, 36,000 new cases (avg) were reported in Kerala, with the lowest number of cases on May 3 (26,011) and the highest on May 6 (42,464). Public health experts said that if the present caseload continues, Kerala may soon see a situation where critical Covid patients will struggle to get ventilator support. “In several districts, only a few ventilators and ICU beds are vacant, especially government hospitals. Even if a patient is shifted from ICU or ventilator to the room, the vacant bed can’t be immediately filled (minimum 48 hours) as we must observe the patient’s condition. On paper, it shows vacant but in reality, the bed has to be kept on reserve,” said a senior government doctor. As per state-wise summary submitted to the Supreme Court by the amicus curiae who compiled the data from affidavits filed by the states, Kerala has 7,047 ICU beds and 1,905 ventilators. State government now claims to have increased the number of ventilators (3,776 both public and private) and ICU beds (9,735 both public and private). But, public health experts said that all these facilities can’t be utilized for Covid care. “Over the past few months, government hospitals have received ventilators from the Centre. But they don’t have enough specialized, trained manpower to manage ventilators, pressurised air or have a centralized oxygen supply. Meanwhile in private hospitals, almost 50% ventilators can’t be used for Covid care as they are neo-natal ventilators, MRI ventilators or kept for cardiac, neurosurgery patients,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman of IMA committee for vaccination promotion and coordination. The main concern among doctors is that now increasingly patients aged between 40 and 50 require ventilators and the intensity with which a patient’s condition worsens is a concern. “Many in this age-group have not been vaccinated and within two or three days of testing positive, their oxygen levels fall and they don’t respond to normal treatment and require ICU admission,” said Academy of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine president-elect Dr PS Shajahan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ventilator-admissions-in-state-double-in-10-days/articleshow/82557272.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Kolkata||Paediatric cases go up in 2nd wave, Institute of Child Health to start Covid unit for children in Kolkata||KOLKATA: After Medical College and Hospital and Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Institute of Child Health (ICH) Kolkata is starting a dedicated Covid unit for children. The rise in number of symptomatic Covid cases in the paediatric patients is prompting this drive. Unlike the first wave when children were largely spared of the infection, the second wave is turning out to be a different story. Doctors, however, said that in most cases children are not getting any severe symptoms despite the rising number of infection among the population. During the first wave only Medical College had such a dedicated unit. The ICH currently has six children under treatment for Covid infection. Apollo Gleneagles too has started four ICU beds for such patients. “We are starting with eight beds and we plan to scale it up further including some ICU beds. Though the situation is not alarming, the number of symptomatic patients among children has gone up this time. We also don’t want parents to move from one place to another for treatment,” said senior paediatrician Apurba Ghosh, director ICH Kolkata. “Ours is an institute where many parents seek quality treatment at affordable cost. We have to do a balancing act so that non-Covid patients continue to get medical care,” added Ghosh. The hospital currently has about 130 functional beds. The hospital plans to convert more beds for Covid care if the need arises. “Among many children we are seeing diarrhoea and vomiting as symptoms. Even as these can be termed as mild symptoms, since children are prone to dehydration and have feeding issues some of them will need hospital care,” said ICH paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri. On Monday, MCHK saw the arrival of seven infected children in its Covid ward, the largest single day admission. “So far we have treated 46 children during this second wave. Most of them did not need advanced treatment. However, most of the seven children who got admitted on Sunday have some comorbidities. We need more hospitals to come up with such dedicated facilities to share the load,” said Dibyendu Raychaudhuri, assistant professor of paediatrics at MCHK. At Apollo, among children being treated for Covid include a five month old with congenital heart problem and a child with bronchial asthma. “Many children are doing well at home with telemedicine consultation. But we need to be more careful if a child has got any kind of associated risk or comorbidities,” said paediatric intensivist Kaustabh Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/paediatric-cases-go-up-in-2nd-wave-ich-to-start-covid-unit-for-children/articleshow/82559306.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Sources said the fresh request was made following the oxygen crisis that has gripped the city and PGI in the last two-three days. Earlier, the administration had written to the government to increase its quota from 20 MT to 35 MT. Similarly, PGI had also demanded to increase its quota from 20 MT to 40 MT, which the administration backed. At a meeting of chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana and UT adviser and UT senior standing counsel under Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore on Tuesday, it was decided to request the Punjab and Haryana high court for a separate quota of 5 MT of liquid oxygen exclusively for PGI. The meeting was held after the high court’s suggestion for setting up a unified command centre for the Tricity for better Covid management. In the meeting, it was decided that a committee comprising deputy commissioners of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali will meet twice a week online to ensure effective coordination in all Covid-related matters such as lockdown restrictions, hospital and supply management and vaccinations. It was also decided director health services of Mohali, Panchkula and Chandigarh will meet twice a week over videoconference to decide uniform and coordinated approach in medical treatment of Covid patients under the guidance and consultation of PGI. Another decision was that in case of emergencies in the Tricity, the authorities will provide oxygen, medicines, medical equipment like ventilators to each other to avoid any untoward incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/emergency-give-10-mt-o2-ut-to-centre/articleshow/82557269.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This led the police to book Pooja Itan for obstructing a public servant from carrying out duty and also voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant. Her husband Deepak, 30, was only charged under Section 188 of the IPC for disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant. Khokhra PSI K D Hadiya, in his complaint, stated that they stopped a couple on a two-wheeler on Monday for being outside despite night curfew. The police asked the couple why they were violating the curfew, but did not receive a satisfactory answer. The cops began registering a case against Deepak when Pooja intervened and began abusing the cops. “She said that the police was standing at the crossroads, harassing people. She asked the cops why they were not catching anyone else. Female police officers Harsha Dhiru and Jagruti Subhash asked Pooja to calm down but she attacked them. When the other female officers rushed to provide backup, Pooja threatened to shoot a video and make it viral,” the complaint stated. The police have registered a case against Deepak and another against Pooja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/caught-for-violating-night-curfew-woman-abuses-cops/articleshow/82559325.cms||---

---||Mumbai||No sanction for admission to 107 PG medical seats in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: As many as 107 MD/MS seats in government and civic colleges in the state did not get sanction from the National Medical Commission (formerly MCI) to admit students in the academic year 2021-22 due to ‘deficiency’ in their compliance reports. These include seats in popular courses like medicine and surgery in Grant Medical College of JJ Hospital and GS Medical College of KEM Hospital. The state failed to approve ad hoc promotions to teachers on time affecting the teacher-student ratio in these colleges. There are close to 1,200 PG seats in government colleges. At a time when the state is facing a shortage of doctors in the pandemic, this delay could have been avoided, said a professor. But an official from the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) said since NEET-PG 2020-21 has been postponed till August 31, these deficiencies can be met before the admission process commences. Postgraduate seats in medical colleges are based on the number of faculty positions. The teacher-student ratio is 1:3 for a professor, 1:2 for an associate professor, and 1:1 for a lecturer. Maharashtra does not follow time-bound promotions and for almost two decades, ad hoc promotions and continuation letters are granted to qualified teachers every year. Since these teachers did not receive continuation/promotion letters for over eight months, it was noted during the commission’s inspection, which, in turn, reduced the total intake capacity in colleges. In the state, around 350 faculty members were awaiting their ad hoc promotion letters. In a letter to the medical education and drugs department on April 29, MUHS requested to make teachers available in colleges where PG seats are reduced due to the non-availability of PG teachers. Saurabh Vijay, medical education secretary, was unavailable for comment. Earlier, representatives of Maharashtra State Medical Teachers’ Association had approached medical education minister Amit Deshmukh to explain the problem with the delay in ad hoc promotions. Dr. Sachin Mulkutkar from the association said for 19 years, the same process is being followed. “We do not know why it was delayed, but we are now told that the file has been signed by the minister. We hope the promotion orders will be released soon,” he said. Dr. Sameer Golawar said the state needs to adopt time-bound promotions like those followed in central institutes like AIIMS. “This problem can be resolved then. There are 682 vacant posts for lecturers, 324 for associate professors, and 150 for a professor in the state. New colleges are being planned without filling faculty posts in existing colleges.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-sanction-for-admission-to-107-pg-med-seats-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/82569576.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Agra||Private Covid hospital charges Rs 10 lakh from patient who died||AGRA: Arun Kansal, a 62-year-old resident of Agra, died while being treated for Covid-19 at Ravi hospital and his family was charged a bill of Rs 9.6 lakh. This was found to be in violation of the rates determined by the state government for the treatment of Covid patients, and the hospital has been debarred from further admissions. Kansal, a resident of Krishna Nagar colony, was admitted to the hospital’s ICU, with ventilator support, for 19 days -- from April 9 to April 28, when he breathed his last. Out of the bill of Rs 9,60,212 issued by the hospital, Rs 4,65,876 were charged for medicines. According to the health department, isolation beds, including supportive care and oxygen at National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH)-accredited hospitals in tier A cities, like Agra, are not supposed to cost more than Rs 10,000 a day and Rs 8,000 a day for non-accredited hospitals. For ICU beds with ventilator care, patients can be charged a maximum of Rs 18,000 a day in accredited hospitals and Rs 15,000 a day at non-accredited ones. Following a complaint made by the patient’s family, and an initial investigation, district magistrate Prabhu N Singh has debarred the hospital from admitting Covid-19 patients. A showcause notice has also been issued to the hospital, which is owned by the former district president of Indian Medical Association, Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori. According to the chief medical officer, legal action will be taken against the hospital in case the clarification is not received. DM Prabhu N Singh said, “No hospital can charge more than the rates fixed by the state government. Ravi hospital has been debarred for over-charging a Covid-19 patient. Despite repeated reminders, the hospital did not place notice of the rate list and information regarding availability of beds and ventilators.” Defending his hospital’s claim, Dr Pachori, said, “The patient was admitted in a critical condition under the insurance policy… As the patient was suffering co-morbidity, best medicines including Remdesivir, Caspofungin, which were not available at the hospital, were arranged from outside…The patient died under treatment on April 28. As the limit of insurance claim was short, the caretakers of the patient provided a bank cheque of Rs 6,47,711. Later, they stopped payment from the account and made a fake complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pvt-covid-hosp-in-agra-charges-rs-10-lakh-from-patient-who-died-during-treatment-hospital-debarred-from-further-admissions/articleshow/82557268.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Delhi||Delhi: 15 hospitals, Covid care centres to get 990 ventilators||NEW DELHI: To ramp up infrastructure for critical Covid care, Delhi government has procured 990 portable ventilators that are being set up at 15 hospitals. The facilities include Burari Hospital, Indira Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Dwarka, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital and Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital. Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Chhatarpur will get 80 of these ventilators. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Monday that Delhi government was developing Covid infrastructure keeping in mind a possible third wave and was ready to manage up to 30,000 cases per day. Though the Covid positivity rate under the current wave has been consistently coming down and the daily cases are also declining, the number of critical patients requiring intensive medical care remains high. The Covid death count is also hovering around 300. An order issued by the health and family welfare department of Delhi government conveyed the approval of the competent authority for distribution of the ventilators procured by the department. Indira Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Dwarka will get 150 ventilators; Burari, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Deen Dayan Upadhyay and Ambedkar Nagar hospitals 80 each; Sanjay Gandhi Memorial, Satyawati Raja Harishchandra (Narela) and Acharya Bhikshu hospitals 50 each; Janakpuri Super Specialty, ESIC (Okhla) and Deep Chand Bandhu hospitals 40 each; and ESIC Hospital in Jhilmil 10. Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, Burari Centre and Sant Darshan Centre will get 80 ventilators each. “All the above hospitals are directed to get the ventilators installed immediately and submit a compliance report to the health department,” an order signed by the department deputy secretary stated. With the positivity rate crossing 35% and the daily case count touching 28,000, the current wave has overwhelmed the health infrastructure of the capital. It resulted into huge demands for Covid beds, especially those with ICU and ventilator facilities. For several days, many patients were forced to rush to NCR towns for ICU beds. The government has repeatedly said it’s trying to create more oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds for Covid patients. Delhi has seen creation of several ICU and oxygen beds since the beginning of the current wave a few weeks ago. On April 11, the capital had only 11,675 Covid beds in hospitals, which has nearly doubled and reached 22,953 on May 11. Delhi currently has 20,311 oxygen beds, including many at makeshift hospitals, and 5,863 ICU beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/15-hosps-covid-care-centres-to-get-990-ventilators/articleshow/82561260.cms||AlokKNMishra

Opened by NKDA chairman Debashis Sen, the camp has 10 beds with piped oxygen supply system attached with each bed. “There are many Covid-positive patients who require oxygen support. The idea is that Covid patients who are in urgent need of oxygen can come here and take oxygen under medical supervision till the person gets admitted to a hospital,” said an NKDA official. Meanwhile, the opening of second walk-in RT PCR centre on Tuesday had to be postponed due to heavy rains.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Writer & actor Madampu Kunjukuttan no more||THRISSUR: Writer and actor Madampu Kunjukuttan passed away at a city hospital on Tuesday. Kunjukuttan, 81, was suffering from various ailments and had tested positive for Covid-19, when he was admitted to the hospital, two days before his death. Madampu Sankaran Namboothiri, popularly known as Madampu Kunjukuttan, was born at Madampu Mana, a prominent Namboothiri family at Kiraloor in Thrissur on June 23 in 1941. Madampu had mastered Hashtyayurveda (traditional knowledge system related to the treatment of elephants) and Sanskrit. He had taught Sanskrit at Kodungallur, worked as a temple priest for some time and with the AIR later. Madampu had made a mark as novelist, short story writer, playwright and even as the anchor of a popular TV show ‘E4 Elephant’. His literary works include Ashwathamavu, Brashtu, Mahaprasthanam, Endaro Mahanubhavulu, Pothu, Amrithasya Puthra, Aryavartham, Nishadam and Ente Thonnisangal. He had won Kerala Sahithya Academy award for the novel Mahaprasthanam in 1983 as well the national award for the best scriptwriter for the film ‘Karunam’ directed by Jayaraj, in 2000. Madampu had won the Ashdod International Film Award for best screenplay for the film ‘Parinamam’. He was also the scriptwriter for several other popular films, including Desadanam, Gouri Sankaram, Makalkku, and Shalabham. Madampu had acted in some box-office hits, including Desadanam, Aram Thampuran, Agnisakshi, Aanachandam, Pothan Vava, Vadakkunnathan, Agninakshathram, and Karunam. When the late K R Mohanan made the film ‘Ashwathamavu’ based on Madampu’s novel with the same name, Madampu played the lead role, which was a rare incident in the Indian film field where an author and scriptwriter played the lead role. Interestingly, Madampu had won the wrath of some of the Brahmin community members when he penned his early works like Ashwathamavu and Brashtu as they challenged the orthodox sections in the community. He had even functioned as the secretary of the Yuva Kala Sahithi, the cultural wing of the CPI. But Madampu later undertook a drastic reversal of his ideological stance and became the president of the Thapasya, the cultural wing associated with the Sangh Parivar. He contested as a BJP candidate in Kodungallur assembly seat in 2001. The chairman of Brahmaswam Madhom Vedic Research Centre, Vadakkumpad Narayanan, said Madampu in his later life had a feeling that the Communist parties were excessively pampering the minority communities and were neglecting the majority community. He had also then developed the attitude that Communism was an ‘imported ideology’ , Narayanan said. However, Madampu had later said that he had committed two mistakes, one was the decision to contest as a BJP candidate and the other was to drop out of studies. Madampu leaves behind two daughters Haseena and Jaseena. His wife Savithri had died much earlier. The last rites were performed at his home compound with full state honours by adhering to Covid protocol, after taking special permission from the health authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/writer-actor-madampu-kunjukuttan-no-more/articleshow/82557277.cms||T Ramavarman

The move came days after TOI had published a story on the plight of the boy, who was forced to wait for 10 days to get the body of his father Raju (goes by the first name) released from Aligarh’s Deendayal Hospital, where he died after being admitted as a Covid-suspect. Several TOI readers, too, have shown their interest in providing financial assistance to the orphaned boy whose mother had died only a few months after his birth. The district administration has handed over a cheque for Rs 1 lakh to the boy, Rohit, as a fixed deposit, and the interest amount will be transferred to his bank account for his use. The FD amount will be released to Rohit after he attains the age of 18 “The boy doesn’t have any documents to his name. So, we will first issue an Aadhaar card to him for the opening of a bank account in his name and then the account will be linked to the FD account,” said district magistrate CB Singh, adding: “The person who helped the boy after his father’s death will be made his temporary custodian.” Koil sub-divisional magistrate Ranjeet Singh told TOI that the process was initiated and the boy would soon get documents. “The administration will help him in every manner.” After the death of his father, Rohit’s landlord had allegedly thrown him out of the house, but a neighbour, Mahesh Misra, a small workshop owner in Khirni Gate, helped him get his father’s body released from the hospital and cremated with the assistance of NGO Manav Upkar. Misra also provided shelter and food to the homeless and orphan boy. “He is the eighth member of my family. We will take care of him,” said Misra, who recently got married. “We have been seeing him since he was born. He was only a few months old when his mother died and he was raised by his father. He is now our responsibility.” “Rohit is illiterate, but my sisters will teach him so that he can read and write,” added Misra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-boy-who-waited-10-days-for-fathers-body-gets-rs-1-lakh-aadhaar-card-from-admin/articleshow/82557273.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Aurangabad||Grievance panels set up by state to settle MPJAY claims||Aurangabad: After rap from the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, the state government has formed grievance committees under the respective district collectors for securing and processing claims by eligible beneficiaries under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY) for Covid treatment. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan told TOI on Monday, “No eligible MPJAY beneficiary would be deprived of reimbursement towards Covid treatment. The beneficiaries are requested to submit their claims in a format prescribed by the district administration. We will scrutinise all such applications and ensure proper follow-up with the hospitals to get things done.” The next hearing of a PIL filed by Om Prakash Shete, the former head of CM’s Relief Fund, claiming that several needy Covid patients from BPL families were being denied the MPJAY benefits has been posted for June 22 by the HC. Shete had also attached affidavits by some of these beneficiaries along with his petition. “We hope and trust that the state of Maharashtra will take due care for implementation of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Public Health Scheme in its true letter and spirit and that not a single Covid patient below the poverty line and possessing all the necessary document is denied treatment or bed only on the ground that he does not have necessary financial capability,” the HC bench of Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice Shrikant Kulkarni said while hearing the PIL on May 7. “The state shall also further state the outcome of the show cause notice issued to the hospital upon grievance of the persons not receiving treatment under the said scheme,” the bench said. The government had filed an affidavit in the court stating that 26,48,827 patients were provided treatment free of cost in Covid care centres across the state so far. It further said that apart from patients on ventilators, 20 packages have been identified wherein Covid-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms can avail treatment under MPJAY. However, the HC took note of around 20 to 25 affidavits suggesting that Covid-19 patients from BPL families were denied MPJAY benefits despite having all the necessary documents and were being charged huge amounts as bills by hospitals. Also, it took note of a submission that even admissions were not given to these patients in the Covid dedicated hospitals recognised by the state government. The government then filed an affidavit stating that grievances of all such patients have been registered and show cause notice is issued to the hospitals. The HC said, “We would be more concerned with the immediate treatment of such patients. Such patients below the poverty line, possessing all the necessary documents and eligible for the benefit of the benevolent scheme shall not be asked to run from pillar to post and from one hospital to another for getting admitted only because of lack of finance and funds. The State shall take care of all such patients.” It added: “The Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Public Health Scheme is meant for the benefit of the persons below the poverty line and those who cannot afford treatment by paying huge amounts. The State is required to take steps to see that the benefit of the said scheme is not denied to even a single eligible Covid-19 patient.” The HC said that eligible beneficiaries denied benefits of the MPJAY can approach the grievance panels to seek redressal of their complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/grievance-panels-set-up-by-state-to-settle-mpjay-claims/articleshow/82555909.cms||Prasad Joshi

Twitter at its end is taking several steps to support these conversations,” a media statement said. Some of the features that can be utilised during this Covid-19 crisis are listed. Event Pages: Twitter has introduced dedicated ‘event pages’ for Covid-19 where people can find relevant information from reliable sources on the service. Twitter has recently introduced pages to guide people to credible tweets in each state. The Kerala page shows local updates from doctors, journalists and concerned citizens from the region. Moreover, the Covid-19 hub on the service’s Explore tab, a Covid-19 SOS page, Moments pages for vaccine safety, how to stay safe, also give relevant information from credible authorities. Twitter Spaces: “Earlier this week, we prioritised the rollout of Twitter Spaces in the country, and while globally only those with 600 or more followers can host a Space, in India everyone has access to host and tune into a Space on Android and iOS. Along with our global announcement, we also shared more about how people can stay safe in Spaces, including building safety controls for both hosts and speakers,” the media statement said. Twitter Lists: Twitter Lists curate all the tweets from accounts on that list in one place, making it easy to navigate and keep up with specific accounts during fast-moving events. “We have curated a series of twitter lists of health authorities, public health experts, health journalists, fact-checkers, and other authoritative sources, so you can stay up to date about information during the second wave of the pandemic. We’ve also created a list of verified organisations engaged in Covid-19 relief work,” the media statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/twitter-features-to-help-fight-virus/articleshow/82557285.cms||---

In association with the district administration which provided the human resources to run the facility, the hospital started operating on Tuesday by admitting three patients. AFMEC president Puran Dawar said, “The medical services at the centre will be managed by the health department. We have contacted highly experienced doctors from the US and UK to guide us in treating the patients via video conference. Treatment for people below the poverty line will be free. Others will have to pay nominal charges. The Covid care facility is established under corporate social responsibility. It is not a profit-making entity.” District magistrate Prabhu N Singh, who has been at the forefront in setting up the centre, said, “The new 350-bed Covid care centre established by AFMEC has piped oxygen supply on 60 beds. Oxygen concentrators are available on 200 beds. For patients in critical condition, arrangement of a 15-bed ICU facility has also been made. “ Patients will be referred to the AFMEC centre by the integrated command and control centre managed by the district administration. They can also approach on their own by directly contacting the hospital using its helpline number, 9557597705. “The hospital is surrounded by greenery and patients will feel close to nature. Following expert advice, we have included yoga and meditation in the treatment protocol. Patients will have a yoga session from 6 to 7 am. They will be encouraged to take up a short duration meditation at 3 pm. Mild music and spiritual songs will be played at the ICU ward to make patients feel relaxed. In consultation with experts, a healthy diet chart has been planned. We will ensure patients do not suffer any inconvenience,” Dawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agras-footwear-association-opens-350-bed-covid-hospital/articleshow/82557282.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kochi||81% of police force in state have taken 2 doses of vaccine||Thiruvananthapuram: As much as 81.2% of all the police officials in the districts and 86.1% of those in armed police battalions have been administered two doses of Covid vaccine till date. As a result, the number of police officers getting infected by the virus, despite being on the forefront of imposing the lockdown measures in the state, is very low compared to the ongoing rate of spread of the pandemic, show the figures. Of the 41,887 police officers who had registered for vaccination, 34,011 have been administered two doses of vaccine already, leaving only 7,876 personnel to be vaccinated. Similarly, of the 11,319 members from the armed police battalions in the state, 9,752 members have been administered the vaccine, leaving only 1,567 more to be vaccinated. Of the 13.9% of those who remain to be vaccinated in the armed police battalions, 80% are from the women’s battalion. “All those who are yet to receive vaccination both in the battalions and districts have been exempted because of valid medical and health reasons. Once their medical embargo is lifted, they will also be administered the vaccine,” ADGP (armed police battalion) and welfare officer for the police force K Padmakumar said. The result of vaccination among policemen has given a great degree of confidence among the members of the force, most of whom are on the field on frontline Covid duty. In June 2020, while there were 3,173 reported cases in the state, the number of police personnel who were affected were 98 (13.08%). On May 9 this year, when the number of those who turned Covid positive in the state was 35,801, the number of police officials affected were only 124, which is only 0.35% of the total affected. Of the 965 Covid positive police officials (as on May 10), the highest number is in the capital district (133), followed by Palakkad (129) and Ernakulam (103). Of the 965 who tested positive, 959 are recovering in their homes, which means that they are only mildly-hit by the pandemic, while four are in treatment in hospitals/ CFLTCs, and two are in their respective units itself. With regards to the 12 units in the armed police battalion, on May 10, there are 257 Covid positive policemen, of which 15 are in hospitals/CFLTCs, while 178 are in their homes and 36 in their respective units. The highest number of Covid positive cases are in KAP-2 at Muttikulangara in Palakkad (37) followed by KAP-1 at Tripunithura in Ernakulam (32). “Even while the members of the force are deployed for Covid frontline duty, their safety is top priority for us. We have successfully been able to reduce the Covid-19 cases in the force by strictly following all the protocols in addition to ensuring vaccination for our officers. Despite this, we are not lowering our guard and will continue to remain cautious,” Padmakumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/81-of-police-force-in-state-have-taken-2-doses-of-vaccine/articleshow/82557286.cms||KP Saikiran

Lijina Nair and her family members from Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur district had reached the Kognoli toll plaza, some 50km from home, when they were stopped. The Nair family, associated with bakery products in Ichalkaranji, was travelling to Kerala for Lijina’s wedding on May 20. All the preparations had been done in Kerala for the wedding to be held with 20 guests. The bride and her family members had got their RT-PCR tests done and had secured e-passes. As Karnataka began its strict lockdown from Monday, all vehicles coming from Maharashtra via Pune-Bangalore National Highway were stopped at Kognoli. Around 50 police personnel have been deployed at the check post. “This is ridiculous. We have a travel pass with negative RT-PCR test reports. They are still not allowing us to go. In fact, we are travelling to Kerala and not Karnataka but still the police deployed are adamant. Now, we will have to postpone the wedding to some other date,” Lijina said. Zaheer Mujawar, a resident of Nipani in Karnataka, had come to Kolhapur on his bike on Monday morning for his office work. His work was done in two hours and he started driving back, when he too was asked to return from Kognoli. “Lockdown is okay, but what about locals who live in Karnataka and work in Maharashtra or vice versa? Even after repeated pleading they didn’t allow me to return home,” he said. R S Khot, police sub inspector at the Kognoli toll plaza from Karnataka police, said that the travel ban will continue till May 24. “Those working in the border area are advised to make their arrangements on either side of the check post. Only essential services and transport vehicles are allowed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/e-pass-ve-rt-pcr-in-hand-but-no-entry-in-karnataka-amid-lockdown/articleshow/82555919.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two years on run, ex-bank manager held for duping mathadis of Rs 36 crore||MUMBAI: A former manager of a nationalised bank, who was on the run for two years after allegedly siphoning off Rs 36 crore from seven fixed deposit accounts belonging to a mathadi workers’ union, was finally arrested by the city economic offences wing (EOW) on Monday. Nikhil Roy (45), the suspended Byculla branch manager of the bank, was apprehended when he went to meet his family who were living in a rental apartment in Pune, while his associates Manish More (39) and Sudhir Pawar (42) were arrested on Tuesday. All three were produced before the Esplanade court, which remanded them in police custody till May 15. Till date, five people have been arrested in the case being investigated by a team, led by EOW chief Niket Kaushik, and officers Parinab Parab, Dattatrey Patil and Nitin Patil. “After the FIR was registered in 2019, Roy was suspended from the bank. He tried to evade arrest by moving from Nashik to Shirdi and then Shahpur. We finally got a tipoff that he would be coming to Pune to meet his family. We laid a trap and caught him,” said an officer. In his complaint to the EOW, Balraj Deshmukh, chairman of Iron and Steel Kamgar Kalyan Mandal, a union of mathadi workers, said in May 2018, Roy had approached the mandal and promised it a high rate of interest on fixed deposits. The mandal, which is among the 36 boards of mathadi workers, made seven FDs totalling Rs 45 crore between December 2018 and February 2019. Every month, board members of the Mandal would visit the bank and check the status. But in May 2019, the office-bearers found that Rs 36 crore had been siphoned off from their FD accounts. As Roy was evasive in his replies, the mandal approached the police. The police claimed that Roy had submitted fake documents to transfer the money to four separate bank accounts in Mumbai, Ichalkaranji and Gujarat. “We traced Rs 11 crore to an account belonging to Deepak Shah in Akhand Anand Cooperative Bank in Gujarat and froze it,” said a police officer. Shah and three others were arrested. In December 2020, the EOW arrested Kumar Kanade, president of an NGO, Raibag Integrated Voluntary Educational Rural Society in Belgaum, who allegedly received Rs 13.6 crore in his account from the proceeds of the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-yrs-on-run-ex-bank-mgr-held-for-duping-mathadis-of-rs-36-crore/articleshow/82561322.cms||Mateen Hafeez

So far, 215 deaths have been recorded due to Covid-19 in the district. Meanwhile, UP minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has written a letter to district magistrate of Mathura asking him to direct block development officers and ADO to conduct sanitization of each village of the district. In the letter, Chaudhary said, “Pandemic has spread in the villages after panchayat elections, even though all proper arrangements were made by the government.

---||Chandigarh||On MC’s plea, HC issues notice to waste collectors||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday issued notice to garbage collectors on the application filed by the municipal corporation (MC) in connection with collection of segregated garbage through twin bin vehicles. The MC had filed application to vacate the stay on the operation and effect of the Solid Waste Management Bylaws 2018 and a December 2019 resolution by the MC through which it had purchased motorised vehicles for garbage collection. The MC in their application submitted that out of 72 petitioners, 50 have already signed individual MoU with it. “At present, 882 persons have signed individual MoUs and have started working as assistants on the vehicles assigned. The system has started working smoothly, which has been introduced in the larger public interest for the benefit of city residents,” according to the MC application. On April 7, the high court had put a stay on the operation and effect of the Solid Waste Management Bylaws 2018 and a December 2019 resolution by the MC through which it had purchased motorised vehicles for garbage collection. The 390 vehicles were bought at a cost of over Rs 30 crore following the directions of National Green Tribunal to streamline solid waste management. The first phase of garbage collection through MC vehicles was started in December last year in sectors 1 to 30. In April, most of the city was brought under the MC drive. The garbage collectors, who had moved High Court, had contended that that the bylaws and the resolution were contrary to the letter and spirit of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, issued by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, which contemplated the need to empower the garbage collectors and help ensure their employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-mcs-plea-hc-issues-notice-to-waste-collectors/articleshow/82557284.cms||---

The duo had planned to elope, but the partial lockdown and night curfew forced the duo to defer the plans. When the parents got to know about it through accidentally listening to their calls, they were shocked and dialed the helpline,” said a counsellor. “The duo was counselled and were told that it is illegal to get married before the legal age.” In another incident, the helpline officials got a case of gaming addiction. “The woman called us to inform that her husband had got addicted to mobile gaming during the pandemic, and also used to lose money. Whenever he would lose, he would get angry on her and their children. He would throw the mobile phone at them and abuse them,” said a counsellor. “The man was sent for counselling and was told that his behaviour could attract police action. In the past few months, we have recorded spike in addiction cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/16-yr-old-counselled-against-eloping/articleshow/82559359.cms||---
---||India||Transfer Punjab & Haryana HC chief justice: Lawyers||NEW DELHI: Amid the surge of Covid-19 cases, a storm is brewing in the Punjab and Haryana high court where the HC Bar Association has passed a resolution demanding transfer of chief justice RS Jha and has decided to boycott his court, forcing the apex regulatory body of advocates, Bar Council of India, to step in to resolve the impasse. The HC Bar Association’s resolution boycotting the chief justice’s court till he was transferred out was stayed by the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana and on Monday, the Bar Council of India (BCI) refused to vacate the stay on an appeal by the HC Bar Association. However, the Bar Council of India, headed by senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra, decided to set up a seven-member committee with senior advocate Ashwini Kumar Chopra as convenor to resolve the stalemate. On May 7, the high court Bar Association had passed a resolution against the CJ seeking his transfer on the ground that there were serious irregularities in the matter of listing of cases and out of 49 judges, only 12 were allotted work, causing a large backlog of cases. The resolution said even urgent matters like regular and anticipatory bails were not being taken up. The Bar Council of India said howsoever it may empathise with the cause of the advocates in the state, it could not support the call for boycott of any chief justice or judge of a constitutional court. “Such extreme recourse could be taken by a body of lawyers only in rarest of rare cases where there are strong, compelling grounds and there is no other remedy left to the legal fraternity,” it said. The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana had passed a detailed order staying the May 7 resolution on the very same day. The association challenged the state bar council’s order on the ground that it was passed ex-parte. The Bar Council of India, while expressing concern over the grievance of the high court Bar Association, said such problems were common to almost all high courts. “Barring one or two HCs, all others are unable to take up urgent matters and there is strong resentment among litigants and lawyers,” it said. The Bar Council of India constituted a seven-member committee to meet the CJ of Punjab and Haryana HC for redressal of the advocates’ grievances. Apart from Chopra, the committee includes president and secretary of the HC Bar Association Harpreet Singh Brar, the exchairman of the state bar council, senior advocates Puneet Bali and Anu Chatrath, and Bar Council of India member Partap Singh. It also requested the high court chief justice to hear the committee and redress the grievances of the bar association as far as practicable and feasible. It also said the demand for the chief justice’s transfer was improper and unjustified and would not solve the problem faced by advocates and litigants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/transfer-punjab-haryana-hc-chief-justice-lawyers/articleshow/82564830.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This has been the situation for the past three-four days. There are 242 ventilator beds in various hospitals in the district — all of them currently occupied. Meanwhile, of the 515 ICU beds in the district only three are available. Even oxygen-support beds are scarce. At present, the district has 2,381 oxygen-support beds and of them only 171 are available. These too are expected to get occupied soon given the current rate of rise in Covid cases. Moreover, 2,428 non-oxygen beds are occupied and only 1,357 are available at the moment. The current bed shortage prevails despite the number of ventilator, ICU and oxygenated beds almost being doubled since the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. “The demand for ventilator beds is increasing. We have a limited number of ventilators at private and public hospitals. We are increasing the number of oxygen beds. Recently, we received 50 oxygen concentrators. More oxygen generation plants are being built in public hospitals. We will ensure that no patient requires ventilators and gets cured in the early stages of infection,” said Yogesh Sale, the district health officer. Patients from Sangli, Sindhudurg, Satara and even border districts of Karnataka are getting admitted to the hospitals in Kolhapur district. Several trusts, NGOs and even sugar factories are setting up Covid care facilities here, but they are facing oxygen shortage. The demand for oxygen has shot up to 55 metric tonne. Mushrif: Strict lockdown on cards in Kolhapur district Minister Hasan Mushrif on Monday hinted at the possibility of a strict lockdown in Kolhapur district. “Beds are not available, the younger generation is dying due to Covid. We have arrived at the conclusion to impose a strict 10 to 14-day lockdown. The decision will be taken in a day or two. Only milk and medicine shops will be allowed to operate during the lockdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/0-ventilator-3-icu-beds-vacant-in-kolhapur-dist/articleshow/82555921.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Single helpline, free ambulance for serious Covid cases in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: In a bid to streamline the process of admitting Covid patients in hospitals, the government on Tuesday has provided a single helpline number for related queries and decided to provide free ambulance service for serious cases. The medical and health department has issued a single helpline number, 181, for enquiries related to Covid from citizens across the state and asked state- and district-level war rooms to arrange ambulances and hospital admissions for serious patients. Patients will receive real-time information on availability of beds, oxygen and ventilators in Covid-dedicated hospitals, consultation centre, treatment centres, private hospitals and ambulance facilities. Patients requiring hospitalisation will not be denied admission under any circumstances. According to the order issued by the department, one can call helpline 181 for the state-level war room, functioning round-the-clock, for all Covid-related information, including names, mobile numbers of medical nodal officers appointed for various tasks such as providing beds, oxygen and availability of medicines, who work in coordination with hospitals. Instructions have also been issued to establish round-the-clock district-level war rooms. The nodal officers and war rooms will constantly be in touch with each other. Availability of ambulances will be ensured at the district as well as block level for Covid patients. The ambulance facility will be completely free for patients. Apart from ambulances under 108 and 104, district collectors will also be able to hire private ambulances if required. Covid patients living in home isolation too can contact these war rooms for medical advice, medicines or for treatment or admissions to the hospital. Enquiries from patients received on the helpline will be sent to the Rajasthan Liaison Portal and to the district-level nodal officer on WhatsApp by the officer-in-charge of the war room. In 30 minutes after receiving a call for assistance at the district level, the nodal officer will inform or provide the patient or his/her family the medical advice, medication and treatment required for them. The final outcome will be recorded on the portal. As per instructions issued, the nodal officer at the district-level has been made responsible for ensuring that a patient, who needs hospitalisation, gets admitted to a hospital. The officer will take necessary action with the help of the district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/single-helpline-free-ambulancefor-serious-covid-cases-in-state/articleshow/82561323.cms||---

In the petition, the petitioner has also asked the court to direct the state government to devise a proper plan/policy/guidelines for the payment of compensation to the families and kin of the Covid patients who died due to non-supply or shortage of oxygen in Ghaziabad and other districts of the state. The petitioner alleged that ADM (City), Shailendra Kumar Singh, is in-charge of oxygen distribution in Ghaziabad and under his nose black-marketing of oxygen is taking place. As alleged in the petition, there are around three Covid hospitals in his constituency. However, since past several days, despite his repeated requests and also of the district magistrate of Ghaziabad, the ADM (City) Ghaziabad, did not make even a single oxygen cylinder available in the aforesaid Covid hospitals, as a result of which, many patients died a slow, agonizing death, for want of life-saving oxygen. The petitioner has further alleged, that the ADM (City), Ghaziabad has been illegally black-marketing the oxygen supplies from Ghaziabad, in Delhi, Haryana, etc., and earning crores of rupees from the same, at the expense of the lives of innumerable citizens in Ghaziabad and other districts of Uttar Pradesh state. He has filed some audio and video clips along with petition, alleging that Shailendra Kumar Singh, ADM (City), Ghaziabad, along with some other persons, has been involved in large scale black-marketing of oxygen. The petitioner has alleged that on May 5,2021, he had filed a complaint, raising all these issues which was addressed to the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Ghaziabad but till date no action has been taken on his complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/mla-files-pil-in-hc-against-gzb-official-seeks-cbi-probe/articleshow/82561312.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Surgeon breathes his last at ‘symbol of his vision’||NEW DELHI: Dr Shekhar Agarwal, joint replacement surgeon and chief executive director of Sant Parmanand Hospital, died of Covid on Monday night. The 68-year-old doctor had taken both doses of the vaccine and was regularly working at the hospital before testing positive on April 22. After the positive result, Agarwal was admitted to the intensive care unit at Medanta Medicity in Gurugram on April 26. Agarwal was shifted to Sant Parmanand on Monday night, but he could not be saved. Apparently, he had always wanted to breathe his last at the hospital, the symbol of his vision. Agarwal specialised in knee and hip replacement surgery. He did his MBBS degree from Maulana Azad Medical College, and after higher studies, started his career at Jaipur Golden Hospital where he set up the orthopaedic department. He later worked at Shanti Mukund Hospital and Apollo Indraprastha. Hospital trustee Kishan Mittal, who was associated with Agarwal for 27 years, said, “He made Parmanand what it is today. It was also his idea to open an orthopaedic department at the hospital.” Recalling an incident from a decade back, Mittal told TOI of how Agarwal was taking the rounds of the wards and noticed a 17-year-old heart patient. He read her files and moved on. Over the next two days, he re-read her files and noticed that she had not been administered an injection because her family couldn’t afford the Rs 50,000 for the injection. “He then spoke to the doctor on duty and was on his way home when he told his wife, head of the gynaecological department at Sand Parmanand, about the girl. Suddenly, Agarwal took a U-turn, returned to the hospital and personally paid for the teenager’s injection,” said Mittal. “For him, it was always about treating all patients, irrespective of their economic condition. His heart was always open to the needy.” Mittal said when they met in the 1990s, Agarwal told him he was wasting a lot of time commuting 100 km every day. “He wanted to serve the people but since he was visiting four hospitals, most of his time went in travelling. He would even eat and sleep in the car,” said Mittal. “In 1997, he set up the orthopaedic department at Sant Parmanand Hospital, which till then was just an eye hospital. His dedication to the field was commendable. Anyone could call him at any time of the day and he would always respond, whether it had something to do with his speciality or not.” Dr P K Bhardwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, expressed grief at Agarwal’s passing. He said it was a great loss to the medical fraternity not only in Delhi, but in the entire country. “He was one of the best joint replacement surgeons in India and a thorough gentleman and devoted surgeon,” said Bhardwaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/surgeon-breathes-his-last-at-symbol-of-his-vision/articleshow/82561354.cms||---

But now the arrival of summer onions has increased to around 22,000 quintal a day. On the contrary, the arrival of late kharif onions has almost come to an end. Out of the 22,000 quintal of onions auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday, 21,500 quintal were summer onions and remaining are 500 late kharif onions. The average wholesale price of summer onions was recorded at Rs 1,201 per quintal on Monday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices of summer onions were recorded at Rs 641 and Rs 1,652 per quintal, respectively. Also, the late kharif onions fetched lower price in comparison with summer onions owing to its medium quality.

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 400 and Rs 1,095 per quintal, respectively. The summer onions have a shelf life of five to six months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them with a hope of getting better rates. They sell their produce as the per requirement of money. On the contrary, the shelf life of late kharif onions is less than a month. Hence, farmers have no option but to sell the produce at the prevailing market rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/arrival-of-summer-onions-increases/articleshow/82555941.cms||Tushar Pawar

The decision was taken following exorbitant rates of Rs 16,500 and above charged by blood banks, private and government hospitals. According to sources, the rates were fixed after several deliberations and couldn’t be reduced further as kits and machines required for the process were expensive. “It has been learnt that private hospitals were allegedly charging over Rs 30,000 for plasma therapy,” sources said. “Though the rates have been slashed, it is still higher than many states and cities. In Mumbai, the government has fixed a plasa bag price at Rs 5,550. Similarly, in Gurugram, it is Rs 8,500,” sources said. In convalescent plasma therapy, antibodies from the blood of a person, who has recovered from Covid, is taken and transfused into those of an active coronavirus patient to help kick-start the immune system to fight the infection. A medical officer at a city private hospital said after the plasma, the blood containing red blood cells is extracted, white blood cells and platelets are transfused back into the donor’s body. It requires at least 90 minutes to extract the plasma. The health department is also reaching out to patients who have recovered to meet the demand for plasma. “A database of recovered patients has been prepared. Many are coming forward to donate plasma,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-caps-200ml-plasma-bag-price-at-rs-10000/articleshow/82561357.cms||---

The HC noted there are serious findings by the Mumbai city civil court on March 31 of the grandson “beating up” his grandfather. The grandson, 30, has already moved out and the HC barred him from returning. Considering the pandemic situation and lockdown, the HC bench of Justice Milind Jadhav gave the 60-year-old son six weeks to find alternate accommodation and leave. The HC also directed the local police to check in on senior citizens twice a week to ensure their well-being. The father-son duo had moved the high court against an interim order passed by the civil court, which held the grandfather had made out a prima facie case to restrain them from residing with him. While the grandson and his mother have left the house, their lawyer R H Pathak informed the HC on May 5 that the son is “open for dialogue’’ as he has to look after his father. The son was then asked to state by May 7 how much time he needed to move out of his father’s house. On May 7, Advait Sethna, counsel for the octogenarian, said the son may be given some time to scout for a new flat on humanitarian grounds since he had recently undergone cataract surgery and needed time to recuperate. The judge appreciated the father’s stand. Advocate Pathak said the son was “dutiful” and has not indulged in any criminal act against his parents. He sought more than four weeks for the son to relocate. The HC gave him more than six weeks, but sought his affidavit in 10 days stating he would move out latest by June 18, and that he would not in any manner obstruct his parents’ free movement. The HC said if the son obstructed his parents’ movements or peaceful residence, the police is directed to take immediate action by registering a complaint against him. Both sides have made allegations against each other. The HC said at this stage it is difficult to analyse the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-orders-old-mans-son-grandson-out-of-home/articleshow/82562981.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Delhi||Delhi: Scientist who made Nehru Planetarium a city icon dies||Dr Nandivada Rathnasree, the self-effacing director of Delhi’s Nehru Planetarium who popularised astronomy among generations of school and college kids for more than two decades, succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday, leaving the astronomy community in the country in shock and disbelief. Under Rathnasree’s stewardship, Nehru Planetarium became one of the city’s iconic institutions — a popular spot for children and young adults across north India and a go-to place for enthusiasts during astronomical events. Rathnasree, who had a PhD on stellar evolution from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and did post-doctoral research on pulsar astronomy at University of Vermount, US, was the director of the planetarium for 22 years since 1999. She was also a foremost expert on the Jantar Mantar complexes in Delhi, Jaipur and Varanasi. “As mandated by Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, of which the planetarium is a part, Rathnasree attended office till April 18 or 19. She came down with a fever and cough on April 20. We consulted doctors on the phone and treated her at home because there was no bed in hospitals,” said Patrick Dasgupta, Rathnasree’s husband and a professor of physics and astrophysics at Delhi University. Dasgupta said her condition deteriorated on April 30. “Her oxygen level fell to 72. I frantically took her in an ambulance to six-seven hospitals through the night but could not get a bed. On May 1, we managed a bed at DRDO’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid Centre. She was being given oxygen and her levels were being monitored. She was improving till May 8 evening, but her condition worsened suddenly in the early hours of May 9 and she left us,” said an emotional Dasgupta. It was mainly due to Rathnasree’s untiring efforts that that the planetarium became a people-centric institution, said Ajay Talwar, an astro-photographer and vice-president of Amateur Astronomers Association Delhi, who had known her since 1999. “She was always engaging with and encouraging students, trying to get them topics for research etc. And she was always overworked. Not because someone was piling work on her but because she was always taking up new projects all by herself,” Talwar said. It was under Rathnasree’s leadership that the planetarium started conducting public watch programmes during astronomical events, which got massive response. She was closely involved with all new programmes developed for the public at the planetarium’s popular sky show for which a new digital projector was acquired some years ago. “She developed special programmes on Prof Yashpal just after he died and on Prof Govind Swaroop last year, as well as on scientists such as Meghnad Saha,” said Dasgupta.

---||Mumbai||Tenders to seek 1 lakh antifungal meds as cases rise to 2,000; KEM to get special ward||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government will float tenders to procure one lakh vials of the Amphotericin B antifungal injections required for the treatment of the deadly mucormycosis infection that is affecting Covid patients or those who have recovered. Public health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the state had nearly 2,000 patients under treatment for the fungal infection that can lead to blindness or be potentially fatal if not treated on time. In neighbouring Dombivli’s AIMS Hospital, 14 cases have been reported in the past two weeks, including two fatalities—a 69-year-old from KDMC and one from Thane rural, said Dr Ashwini Patil of KDMC. Looking at the influx of patients into the city, Parel’s KEM Hospital has decided to create a special ward for mucormycosis patients. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said the hospital currently has 35 patients. KEM and B Y L Nair in Mumbai Central have created special multi-disciplinary teams with doctors from anesthesia, surgery, ENT, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons and infectious disease experts to treat the infection that needs aggressive surgery as well as antifungal medication for four to 12 weeks. The BMC has collected medicine requirement from its hospitals to procure stocks. The state has asked Haffkine Institute to initiate procurement, for which a short duration tender will be floated. “Although nearly 2,000 patients in the state are currently under treatment for mucormycosis, the number may increase. We will be procuring one lakh vials of the antifungal drug. It will be procured and distributed to government hospitals, and private hospitals that are empanelled under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Abhiyan,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. He said dedicated wards will be set up for treating mucormycosis in each district. Importantly, wards will be set up in selected hospitals as treatment is resource intensive and requires multiple specialties. City hospitals continue to see a rise in admissions daily, although a majority are from other districts. At the state-run JJ Group of Hospitals, 18 are currently admitted. A dozen of them are awaiting surgery, of whom four are Covid-19 positive and admitted at St George Hospital. Dean Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar said 28 patients have been operated between February and May, of whom 22 have been discharged. The remaining six are in post-operative care.  Deshmukh said KEM is trying to raise resources through crowdfunding as a vial of Amphotericin B could cost Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000. Tope said the state will write to NPPA to cap the price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tenders-to-seek-1l-antifungal-meds-as-cases-rise-to-2k-kem-to-get-spl-ward/articleshow/82557405.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Allahabad||Anticipatory bails can curb Covid spread in prisons: Allahabad High Court||PRAYAGRAJ: Keeping in view the rise in Covid-19 cases and apprehension to life of the accused, police and jail personnel, the Allahabad High Court on Monday directed that alleged offenders may be given anticipatory bail for a limited period to ensure that they do not spread the coronavirus inside jails after being sent there. Anticipatory bail is granted to a person against whom an FIR has been lodged, and apprehending his arrest he approaches the subordinate courts or high court against the same. While granting anticipatory bail, the court directs that in case of arrest, the alleged offender will be enlarged on anticipatory bail. Allowing an anticipatory bail plea of one Prateek Jain of Ghaziabad, Justice Siddharth passed this order, while allowing anticipatory bail plea to the petitioner for a limited period. Prateek Jain is accused in a cheating case. The court directed that in case Jain is arrested then he shall be enlarged on anticipatory bail for the limited period, till January 3, 2022. While quoting the recent directions of the Supreme Court to decongest jails, the court observed, “The observations and directions of the Apex Court show the concern about the over- crowding of jails and in case this court, ignoring the same, passes order which will result in overcrowding of jails again it would be quite paradoxical. Counsel for the State has not given any assurance of protection of the accused persons, who are in jail and may be sent to jail, regarding their protection from contacting the infection of novel corona.” The court further observed, “Extraordinary times require extraordinary remedy and desperate times require remedial remedy. Law should be interpreted likewise… the apprehension of an accused being infected with novel coronavirus before and after his arrest and the possibility of his spreading the same while coming into contact with the police, court and jail personnels or vice-versa can be considered to be a valid ground for grant of anticipatory bail to an accused.” The court further observed, “The informant/complainant may take objection to the relief being granted to the applicant and may be dissatisfied from the observations made in this judgment in favour of accused. However, they should not lose sight of the fact that only when the accused would be alive he would be subjected to the normal procedure of law of arrest, bail and trial.” The court, considering the limited functioning of courts in the state, observed, “Experts are of the view that the third wave is likely to come in the month of September, 2021 and it is uncertain when the normal functioning of the court would be restored. In such uncertain times, it would be against the requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which provides equality before law and equal protection of law, to leave an accused unprotected from arrest and suffer the consequences of being infected with novel coronavirus.” However, the court, while granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner for a limited period, till January 3, 2022, directed him not to obstruct or hamper police investigation, not to leave the country and also not to seek any adjournment in the trial pending against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/anticipatory-bails-can-curb-covid-spread-in-prisons-hc/articleshow/82561373.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Meerut||Now, four mucormycosis cases found in Meerut hospital||MEERUT: Popularly known as black fungus, the rare but deadly disease seen as post-Coronavirus complication in Covid-19 survivors, has been suspected in patients in Meerut. At least four patients were found with the symptoms. Separate wards have been created in Gujarat for patients with fungal infection that aggressively affects the nose, eye and sometimes the brain. All the cases have been found in Nutema Covid Hospital in Meerut. According to hospital authorities, two patients are from Bijnor and Muzaffarnagar while the other two are from Meerut. “The Muzaffarnagar resident was in his late 50s and had blackening in the eye. The scraping had been sent for biopsy. The second patient was here for only a few hours and his family members took him away,” said Nutema Hospital director Dr Amit Upadhyay. However, due to diagnostic complexity, all the four cases are in the stage of suspicion with no conformation whatsoever. Speaking with TOI, neurosurgeon Dr Rohit Kamboj said, “The first patient is a 35-year-old and resident of Meerut. He is a post-Covid patient with very high blood sugar levels. When he came to us, he was visually impaired and had thick black lining on the lips. We had to conduct a surgery on him to remove the infected portions. The second was a 45-year-old home-isolated woman with almost similar symptoms and blackening of one eye. The third one is quite serious. She is a chronic diabetic and has strong mucormycosis symptoms. She also suffered from brain hemorrhage. We have strong suspicion of black fungus in these patients.” Dr Sandeep Garg, nephrologist and renal transplant surgeon, said, “My patient is a resident of Muzaffarnagar in his late 50s. He is a renal transplant patient who was administered immunosuppressive agents so that acceptance level of new kidney is ensured. In addition, he was diabetic and a post-Covid patient who had been administered steroids that further lowered his immunity making him vulnerable to black fungus attack. All four are most likely black fungus cases because of distinct representation of the disease and is often diagnosed through clinical methods as many a time other diagnostic methods like MRI are inconclusive.” Mucormycosis, a fungal infection, is being found in Covid-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes and prolonged intensive care unit stay. In an advisory, the ICMR recently said the fungal infection mainly affects people who are on medication that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. Warning symptoms include pain and redness around eyes and nose, fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits and altered mental status, the advisory stated. Major risk factors for this disease include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression by steroids, prolonged ICU stay, malignancy and voriconazole therapy, the ICMR-health ministry advisory said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/now-four-mucormycosis-cases-found-in-meerut-hospital/articleshow/82557406.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur cops crack down on hooch dens||Kolhapur: Kolhapur police, following rising complaints of sale of illicit liquor, have started taking action against hooch dens that have come up in the remotest parts of the district. On Sunday, police raided and destroyed a hooch den in Devkewadi jungle of Bhudargad tehsil. Around 11,000 litre of liquor and raw material were destroyed by police. The total cost of the hooch destroyed was around Rs 7 lakh. According to police, supply of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) has stopped due Covid-related restrictions and consumption is on the rise due to which sale of illicit liquor is on the rise. The illicit alcohol is stored in godowns and transported in vehicles labelled as essential service. Also, most of the hooch dens have come up in inaccessible hilly regions. “After getting tips from locals against illegal dens, we initiate action. Consumption of such liquor is dangerous and may cause death,” police inspector Tanaji Sawant said. Since last few weeks, transport of IMFL especially from Goa has also increased. With the help of the Kolhapur police, the district excise department is laying the trap to nab those involved in smuggling of alcohol. The smugglers are using narrow escape routes in Gadhinglaj, Ajara and Chandgad tehsils to bring Goa-made liquor in Kolhapur district. Solapur rural police have registered cases against 113 people involved in manufacturing and sale of hooch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-cops-crack-down-on-hooch-dens/articleshow/82555963.cms||---

---||Delhi||Rajpath revamp: Rs 286 crore tender floated to hire bleachers for R-Day parade celebrations||NEW DELHI: The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has now floated a tender worth Rs 286 crore for hiring bleachers or tier stands with chairs for Republic Day parade celebration, Beating Retreat Ceremony and Independence Day functions for 10 years, starting from next January. The government has taken up the work of revamping the Rajpath and has set the November-December target to complete the task before the next Republic Day parade and the hiring of bleachers with 30,000 chairs has been planned to make the celebration a grand one to mark India’s 75th year of independence. The CPWD has set the June 8 deadline for submission of technical bids. Bleachers or stands are raised and tiered rows of benches found at stadiums and other events. According to the bid document, currently installation of seats and making all necessary arrangements for the Republic Day celebration on Rajpath requires approximately 120 days and results in disruption on the Rajpath and surrounding area. “The installation and dismantling of these temporary facilities restrict the usage of space for the general public,” it said. Approximately 1.5 lakh chairs are used every year for the grand celebration. The CPWD document said, the intention of hiring bleachers is to reduce the time required to install all facilities and the proposal is to “develop a new modular design for the bleachers that is well integrated with proposed landscape design of Central Vista Avenue”. These bleachers will be used at the Independence Day function at Red Fort. It said the stepped seating arrangement will allow most visitors for a better view of the Republic Day Parade. According to the CPWD, complete installation of full requirements of the parade can be completed in 15-30 days. The bid document said the chairs shall be of tippling type having foldable seats for the ease of movement and the seats and the back of the chairs shall be made of UV resistant material to withstand the solar radiation during use and storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rajpath-revamp-rs-286-crore-tender-floated-to-hire-bleachers-for-r-day-parade-celebrations/articleshow/82559494.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Jaipur||No citizenship, Pak Hindu migrants in Rajasthan fail to receive Covid treatment||JAIPUR: Baser Mal from Sindh in Pakistan, who was living as a refugee, died of Covid-19 on May 2 in his makeshift mud house on the outskirts of Jodhpur. Before Mal, a Hindu, succumbed to coronavirus infection, he was taken to two private hospitals in Jodhpur only to be denied a bed due to his non-citizen status. The ongoing pandemic has spelled trouble for the Hindu migrants from Pakistan living in eight districts of Rajasthan. They are struggling for beds, vaccines, insurance cover and free ration provided by the state due to their foreign status. Since March 20, seven of them have died in Jodhpur, which has 2,500 such families waiting for Indian citizenship for the last 5-15 years. Mal had crossed over to India in 2007 after facing religious persecution in Pakistan for years. He came on a religious visa along with his wife and two children and remained a refugee till he died for want of proper medical aid. “The hospitals asked for his ID proof when we took him there on April 26. Even for his RT-PCR test, we had to use our connections in the administration. This is how those who don’t have Indian citizenship struggle for basic facilities,” said Dr Rajkumar Bheel, who is a close relative of Mal. Bheel, a dentist from Hyderabad in Sindh, is among the very lucky few to have accorded Indian citizenship in 2016.The Foreigners’ Registration Office (FRO) said 22,100 migrants, who have applied for citizenship, are living in shanties with no proper facilities. They have become vulnerable to Covid-19. The number of casualties among these unlucky souls is very high, says Hindu Singh Sodha of Seemant Lok Sangathan that works for the rights of migrants from across the border. “Neither they are protected under free food schemes, nor any state insurance/health schemes. They are left to fend for themselves in the most brutal manner, which is a matter of collective shame,” said Sodha. Bheel said the absence of an Aadhaar card is preventing the local authorities from getting them vaccinated. In a recent letter to the state government, Sodha had suggested that the migrants be allowed to be vaccinated on the basis of their Pakistan passport, long-term visas and FRO registration documents. Reacting to the plight of the migrants, Jodhpur district magistrate Inderjeet Singh said the authorities had been providing every assistance to them under their mandate. “I have written to higher authorities, seeking their guidance in providing the migrants vaccination and benefits under social welfare schemes. I am awaiting their response,” said Singh. The power to exempt any rule for their vaccination is vested with the Centre, said Antar Singh Nehra, district collector, Jaipur. Former education minister Vasudev Devnani had on Monday raised the issue with Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Ashok Gehlot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/with-no-citizenship-no-med-care-vax-for-pak-hindu-migrants-in-raj/articleshow/82561417.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Meerut||Celebrate this Eid at home, don’t come out: Darul Uloom & prominent clerics to Muslims in Meerut||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, Deoband and several clerics on Tuesday asked Muslims to celebrate the festival of Eid-ul-Fitr -- marking the end of Ramzan -- at their homes due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. They have also advised the followers against going out shopping for the festival, saying it may put them and their families in danger. Eid is expected to be celebrated on Thursday or Friday, depending on the sighting of the moon. Ashraf Usmani, spokesperson of Darul Uloom, said, “Darul Uloom urges Muslims to follow Covid-19 guidelines of the government on Eid celebration and stay at home rather than going outside.” A fatwa, released on the issue by the seminary, said that mosques should not have a gathering of more than five persons, including the imam who leads the prayer, on the day of Eid. Clerics too were of the same opinion. Prominent cleric Maulana Qari Ishaq Gora said, “Eid is a festival of brotherhood, and not of clothes or shopping. People should celebrate this festival with simplicity. In these trying times, the country needs everyone’s contribution. So let us decide that we will not purchase anything on this Eid. Instead help those in need of food and medicine.” Qari Gora asked people to greet each other over the phone and pray for the recovery of those who are infected with Covid-19. “Pray to god so that this disease ends soon from this planet,” Gora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/celebrate-this-eid-at-home-dont-come-out-darul-uloom-prominent-clerics-to-muslims/articleshow/82557411.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Her family had given up all hopes of her survival from the debilitating Covid attack. But the gutsy woman showed the virus in just 18 days what it takes to be a warrior nurse for over three decades. The 58-year-old battled death, slayed the virus in a long-drawn battle that kept everybody on the guessing game — and emerged the winner. Not only did she bounce back from her life-threatening ordeal, she is now back on Covid duty! “I was given duty at Samras facility just a week ago and I have been posted in the ICU. It was a scary experience as I struggled to beat coronavirus last year. But I am not afraid any more. It is my duty to serve the patients in the hour of crisis,” Patel, who is in nursing profession for 33 years, told TOI. Working in the psychiatry ward at SSG Hospital since 2013, Patel was given Covid duty on May 6 last year. “I have a habit of working closely with patients and making them feel comfortable. In September last year, I got infected with the virus and my oxygen levels dipped dangerously when I was under home quarantine. I was immediately taken to SSG Hospital and admitted in the ICU on October 4,” recalled Patel. “My condition was critical. I was kept on BiPap for some days and doctors said that there were little chances of my survival. To make matters worse, my two sons and husband too were infected with Covid in the same period and admitted to SSG. We couldn’t see each other during those tough days. But I was confident that we all will defeat the virus,” Patel said. It was after 18 days of treatment that Patel’s condition improved and she was discharged. “We thought that we lost her. But my mother is a strong a woman. She recovered from Covid despite being in critical condition,” said her son Aakash. The battle, though, had just begun as her blood pressure kept fluctuating and health parameters were not steady. “I used to feel very weak and wasn’t in a condition to even walk properly. It took me 81 days to get back to work. Our hospital staff and doctors saved my life,” she added. A resident of Patarveni village on the outskirts of the city, Patel travels 36km every day to serve the Covid patients at Samras facility. “I was born in SSG, graduated in nursing from this hospital and served as a nurse here. I am very much attached to SSG and my work,” said Patel who is just nine months away from retirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/never-say-die-ssg-head-nurse-defeats-virus-hoodwinks-death/articleshow/82557417.cms||Tushar Tere

The 150th journey has been completed in a span of 126 days, offering benefits to farmers and traders from the region. Chief public relations officer of SCR Ch Rakesh said so far a total of 47,957 tonne of agricultural produce has been transported by Kisan Rails from Nagarsol. “Agricultural produce like onions, water melons and grapes have been transported to various places like Adarsh Nagar in New Delhi, New Guwahati, Malda town, Agartala, Fatuha, New Jalpaiguri, among others,” he said. Rakesh said one of the important factors for the success of the initiative is the 50% concession received by the agricultural farmers and traders for transporting their produce by Kisan Rail. “The Union ministry of food processing industries has been offering this concession under Operation Greens - Top to Total scheme for transporting agricultural produce by trains,” he said. Besides, SCR officials said the transportation by Indian Railways ensures fast transportation with least damages, thereby helping in realizing better value for the produce. SCR general manager said even during pandemic Indian Railways continued to operate Kisan Rails duly taking all precautions for assisting the agricultural farmers and traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/150th-kisan-rail-leaves-from-nagarsol-with-246-tonne-of-onions/articleshow/82555971.cms||---

Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar cited the example of Rajasthan’s “Chiranjeevi Yojana” and said the Goa government needs to increase the annual cashless insurance cover to Rs 5 lakh per family. Mardolkar welcomed the government’s decision to bring Covid-19 disease under DDSSY, but said that some patients require more than ten days to recover from the disease. “The government should think over this and increase the days of treatment so the patients will not have to pay from their pockets if they get admitted for more than ten days,” he said. He said that the government was forced to revise DDSSY as it failed to provide beds, oxygen and ventilators in government hospitals. “Now government is fully dependent on private hospitals and hence to cover their mistake of failing to contain the spread of the virus, it has given solace in the form of the DDSSY scheme. But it should be given properly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-calls-for-free-treatment-at-private-hospitals/articleshow/82561412.cms||---

More government centres are expected to start inoculating people in the 18-44 age group from Wednesday. Vaccines procured by the state government has been despatched to 28 health districts. “The phase III inoculation drive took off in limited vaccination centres under three municipal corporations — Kolkata, Howrah and Bidhannagar. For now the priority is transport workers, hawkers and media professionals,” said Ashim Das Malakar, a state family welfare department officer. The state government had procured one lakh Covaxin doses and 3.5 lakh Covishield doses on its own for the phase 3 immunisation. While the two consignments arrived on Sunday and Monday respectively, the state will receive 4.8 lakh doses of Covishield on Wednesday that will replenish the stock for the 18-44 age category. Kolkata Municipal Corporation health department on Tuesday inaugurated its vaccination camp for city's transport workers. Held at the civic body's Maidan tent where around 150 doses were administered to transport workers on day one. Once the transport workers vaccination is over, the civic body then will start inoculating hawkers in places like New Market, Gariahat and Hatibagan before moving onto traders in Burrabazar, the city’s wholesale trading hub. So far only two hospitals in the state — Woodlands and Apollo Gleneagles — have been able to procure vaccines. “We will expand the drive to the larger population in the 18-44 age group once we get enough vaccine supply. The state government wants to purchase more doses, but the problem is availability with the manufacturers. But we are expecting to get 4.5 lakh Covishield doses by Wednesday that will go to the state’s own procurement kitty,” said a senior health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-rolls-out-vax-drive-for-18-44-age-group/articleshow/82559485.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Power struggles keep AIADMK infighting alive||After a day of hectic discussions that bordered on hostility, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam affixed his signature on the document required to be handed over to the assembly secretary. It officially declared party co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami as the leader of the opposition. Antagonism and acrimony were palpable with the party’s newly-elected MLAs a witness to the renewed friction between the leaders. Barely hours later, Palaniswami, accompanied by senior leaders, drove to Panneerselvam’s Chennai residence to hand over a bouquet of flowers to him and drape a green silk shawl over his shoulders. Peace was made, at least for now. The near-unanimous choice of Palaniswami as AIADMK’s leader of opposition in the legislative assembly was a far from smooth affair though senior leaders ensured the unpleasant internal squabbling did not erupt into the open. The grudging approval by Pannerselvam can only be termed a temporary truce. With the AIADMK out of power, if the fight for control of the party takes centre stage, the dual leadership structure could crumble in no time, especially with J Jayalalithaa aide V K Sasikala waiting in the wings. For now, the tenacious bond that is holding the two leaders together is the AIADMK’s ‘two leaves’ symbol. "A rupture in the party could take the fight before the Election Commission and the courts and lead to the symbol being frozen. The very existence of the AIADMK is its symbol. Without that, the party is as good as non-existent and the leadership inconsequential," said a senior AIADMK MLA, seeking anonymity. This is the reason why EPS and OPS are stuck together in the AIADMK’s dual leadership structure. "Now, the AIADMK is a 50-50 partnership firm with the two directors having equal rights. There is no option but for the leaders to continue with this arrangement, at least until the next assembly election in 2026," said the MLA. Historically, the AIADMK sustained due to a single leadership that was undisputed and uncontested — first M G Ramachandran, who founded the party and after his death and a minor skirmish, his protégé Jayalalithaa. After Jayalalithaa’s death and Sasikala’s takeover of the party and its subsequent split, the AIADMK regrouped again under EPS and OPS. Now, the party’s survival hinges on their unity. The election outcome has shown that the power equations in the dual leadership structure can be unbalanced by the fight for caste dominance. EPS represents the vellalar gounder community, dominant in the western part of Tamil Nadu, where the party made the maximum gains in the just-concluded assembly election. Whereas, OPS represents the thevar community in the south where the party took a beating. The thevar community to which Sasikala belongs had controlled the seat of power for at least three decades. But in the past four years, the balance of power had tilted in favour of EPS. This was accentuated by the fact that almost all OPS’s loyalists shifted to EPS after the merger of their factions. OPS faced the charge that he had let down his supporters. The present second line leadership owes allegiance to EPS and OPS is accused of being keen on the position of power and not the responsibilities that go with it. But before the two leaders bury their hatchet, there’s the local body elections that is bound to see them squabbling again over the choice of candidates. Victories in the pending urban body polls are crucial for the AIADMK and the DMK to cement ties with voters further. Then there is the Lok Sabha election, two years from now. The leaders may postpone the big battle for leadership, but several more minor wars would have to be won before that. While the Sasikala factor is still an enigma, her role, significant or otherwise, in the party’s quest for stability cannot be dismissed. Though Sasikala’s nephew T T V Dhinakaran put up a poor show, his party, the AMMK, played the spoiler for AIADMK in 20 constituencies in the thevar-dominant southern regions of the state, emphasising the complex caste matrix that could define the party’s future. Meanwhile, a key ingredient to keep a mammoth political organisation running is huge funding. This is an aspect that Sasikala is bound to explore and exploit in her unfinished battle to wrest control of the AIADMK. But after having tasted freedom and power, would EPS and OPS throw down the gauntlet or succumb to Sasikala?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/power-struggles-keep-aiadmk-infighting-alive/articleshow/82559489.cms||Jaya Menon

While Dennis Joseph had an almost complete script, his mind was working towards a powerful climax. Despite spending long hours on it, he couldn’t nail it. Then Dennis came across an article on the front page of The Times of India. The news was about a worker who lost his hand while printing a leaflet on industrial safety at the press. His hand was trapped in the machine and the leaflets came out of the press soaked in his blood. The movie’s plot centred on a journalist and his kin who become the victims of those in power since the protagonist (as a journalist) had unravelled the politician’s corruption. A case was forged and he was jailed. The journalist breaks out of prison and plans to kill the politicians. In the climax, G Krishnamurthy, played by Mammootty, sends his gang to assassinate the minister. But, the minister escapes and comes to the press where Krishnamurthy is printing newspapers carrying the article that the minister was killed . His lady-love guns down the minister, who falls into the rolling press. The newspaper carrying the minister’s death comes out soaked in his own blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/how-a-toi-story-led-to-a-movies-climax/articleshow/82557467.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC asks govts to take stock of availability of Covid drug||NEW DELHI: While the availability of key medicines, including Remdesivir, increasing in the capital, Delhi High Court red-flagged the “acute shortage” of Tocilizumab — a life-saving drug prescribed for Covid patients. The court was on Monday informed by the importer of the drug that till January-February 2021, the demand for the drug across the country was 2,500, which has shot up to 1,80,000 doses in the March-May interval as the second wave of the novel coronavirus ravaged India. Justice Prathiba Singh, after taking stock of the supplies and availability, directed the Centre and Aam Aadmi Party government that Tocilizumab doses, received by Monday night (10,000) and by May 15 (10,000), be distributed and allocated “transparently, efficiently and in a timely manner, so that they can be immediately administered to patients who are in need and have been duly prescribed with the same.” The court also directed the supplier, Roche India, to find out from the Japanese firm that manufactures the drug, or any other entity involved in its supply chain, if more quantities of Tocilizumab 400 MG can be made available, and if so within what timelines, in order to cater to the actual demand for patients in India. It highlighted that despite ramping up supplies to approximately 43,000 doses, as against a projected demand of 1,80,000 doses over the last three months, there is a shortfall of nearly 75% of the required demand of Tocilizumab 400 MG projected in the country. The high court also asked the Centre, either through the department of pharmaceuticals or the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), to file an affidavit stating as to whether there are any other applications for manufacture/import/sale of Tocilizumab 400 MG, with the DCGI. It said the affidavit must “comprehensively specify the status/stage of the said applications as well, if any.” The court had earlier directed the Union health ministry and the department of pharmaceuticals to hold a meeting with Roche India, which sells the drug in the country, to ensure immediate supplies of the medicine. The court passed the order after Roche India informed the court that it has no confirmed orders from the central government and was not aware of the actual demand in the country. It was hearing a plea moved on behalf of two Covid patients who were prescribed Tocilizumab, but were unable to arrange the medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-govts-to-take-stock-of-availability-of-covid-drug/articleshow/82561516.cms||Abhinav Garg

They have been working as frontline warriors to maintain essential telecom services during the pandemic. The employees have not even been considered on priority for vaccination and any type of cashless health insurance medical treatment. Also, there is no provision for compensating their families in case of death on duty. Around 100 BSNL employees have succumbed to Covid infection in the last one month. Out of these, five were from Kota division. Aaditya Vijay, president of All India Graduate Engineer Telecom Officer Association (AIGETOA), a representing association of BSNL, and its secretary P N Sharma have asked the management for immediate restoration of CGA (Compensatory Ground Appointment) facility. Union government, as well as BSNL management so far have shown a cold incomprehensive attitude towards 65,000 employees, most of whom are below 45 years of age, said Aaditya Vijay. He added that the employees and their families are under great stress as they are at a high risk of infection and those below 45 have not been vaccinated. Vaccination will help them to go out and perform their duties fearlessly, he said. The BSNL employees should also be covered under cashless medical treatment scheme by its management the Centre. Many other PSUs and government departments have already provided the same to their employees to boost their morale, an employee in Kota claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/recognise-us-as-frontline-warriors-say-bsnl-employees/articleshow/82559498.cms||---

Apart from their regular sweeping work, the sanitation workers are posted at crematoriums, vaccination centres and for lifting medical waste from hospitals, said union members. They claimed to have shared their demands with the mayor and commissioner recently, and also submitted a petition at the LG office. On Wednesday, they plan to submit a letter at the CM office. “We are risking our lives every day just because we don’t want people to suffer in this pandemic. The corporation is not paying us regularly and not even giving us better safety equipment like gloves, masks, soaps and sanitisers. We met the north corporation mayor, Jai Prakash, over this, but he cited lack of funds as the reason,” said JP Tank, president, Delhi Nagar Nigam Sharmik Sangh. “If there is no solution, we will be forced to go on strike on May 25,” said Pawan Taak, another member of the sanitation workers’ association. The north corporation mayor has blamed the Delhi government for not releasing the quarterly share (starting April) of funds, adding that revenue sources had depleted due to the pandemic. “The government has to release over Rs 1,000 crore for the three corporations and of that, Rs 460 crore is for north corporation. We have requested the CM multiple times, but there has been no response,” said Prakash said. A south corporation official said they won’t be able to give April salaries to category A and B staff if funds are not released by the Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sanitation-unions-of-n-corpn-threaten-to-go-on-strike-over-dues-lack-of-gear/articleshow/82559506.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Surat||Surat: Gritty nurse slays Covid twice, rejoins battle||SURAT: For the past three decades, this ‘florence nightingale’ of Surat has been a pillar of support to the caregivers of New Civil Hospital. But when it came to the battle times with the pandemic, Vasanti Nair, head nurse at NCH showed her steely grit behind the starched uniform. Despite contacting Covid twice in the past one year, the ‘unputdownable’ 53-year-old returned to duty on Monday, two days before International Nurses Day. Nair, a patient of thyroid and rheumatoid arthritis, has been on medication for many years now. She has, however, refused to to take a break till the coronavirus wave is controlled. Her daughter too suffered from Covid twice. In April 2020, Nair played a key role in setting up the exclusive and largest Covid-19 hospital at the stem cell building on NCH campus. She cared for the positive patients when fear and panic related to coronavirus was at its peak. She tested positive in May end and had to be hospitalised as her condition deteriorated. “I recovered after 10 days and soon after my quarantine period was over I joined duty. I continued performing my work when my daughter too got the infection,” Nair told TOI. “Nair did exemplary work in setting up the Covid-19 hospital in 2020 in a short time. After this, she was again assigned to set up another Covid hospital on NCH campus at the Kidney hospital building. Nair again tested positive this year on April 30 and was home quarantined for 10 days. But once it was over, Nair returned to duty immediately,” said Iqbal Kadiwala, chief of nursing staff at NCH. “This time the infection was not serious and I recovered with basic treatment. My family supports me and encourages me to work hard,” Nair said. Nair’s daughter Kriti, 24, a biotechnician at a private laboratory, who too tested positive in June 2020 and again in March this year, has also joined work after recovery. Similarly Nair’s younger sister, 51-year-old Sunita is also a senior nurse at the railway hospital in Udhna, who too has been relentlessly waging a war against the virus without a break at the hospital. “I am co-morbid and the fresh wave of coronavirus is terrifying. I saw stable patients dying suddenly. I sometimes feel afraid, but if we stop working then who will take care of patients in such times? This thought keeps me going despite getting infected twice,” Nair added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gritty-nurse-slays-covid-twice-rejoins-battle/articleshow/82557462.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

So far 2,000 villages in Barmer have been affected by the virus. Dozens of villagers succumbed to the virus and thousands are fighting the pandemic. The administration too is of the view that this time the pandemic has affected more villages than cities. Similarly, in Jaisalmer, almost all villages are fighting the virus. The Jaisalmer and Barmer district administrations have started setting up Covid care centres in all gram panchayats. Around 10-30 beds are being arranged om each gram panchayat. Village monitoring committee has been initiated to take charge of the Covid care centres. Barmer CMHO Dr BL Vishnoi said that till now more than 2,000 villages and hamlets in Barmer district have reported Covid-19 cases. He said that around 70% patients are from villages, while many villagers are also dying due to Covid. To stop this, door-to-door survey is being conducted. Since testing capacity of the district is 2,500 samples are being sent to other districts. Barmer district collector Lokbandhu Yadav said that Covid consultancy centres have been set up at Ramsar, Samdadi, Gadra Road and Sedwa to mitigate the second wave. He said that all SDOs have been asked to identify people with ILI in their areas so that maximum number of Covid-infected are identified. He has directed officials to distribute medical kits to all people with ILI symptoms. On the other hand, Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi has set up Covid care centre in all gram panchayats to keep Covid positive patients here as these villagers are staying in isolation. According to the order issued by CEO Charan, government senior secondary/secondary schools head master/principal have been made in-charge of these Covid care centres and gram panchayat development officers have been made co-in-charge. According to the order, each gram panchayat will arrange 10-30 beds at the Covid care centre as per the population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-care-centres-launched-in-panchayats-of-desert-dists/articleshow/82559519.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Cotton sowing delayed, only 20% of crop sown in Punjab||Bathinda: Cotton sowing in Punjab is set to be delayed as less than 20% of the crop has been sown till May 10. According to data procured from Punjab agriculture department, sowing has been done on only 63,220 hectares in Punjab till May 10 against the target of covering 3.25 lakh hectares. The ideal time for sowing is considered to be up to May 15 as the crop sown after that is considered to be prone to pest attack. The late start of sowing has been attributed to late harvest of wheat crop, unavailability of canal water for many days in the initial stages of sowing and now, curtailed power supply to the farm sector. Cotton is seen as a viable alternative to the water guzzling paddy but agriculturists feel it is a remote possibility. There is no clarity on the area under cotton in the outgoing cotton season of 2020-21 too. Till later months of 2020, the state agriculture department claimed that cotton had been sown over close to five lakh hectares but a few days ago, state agricultural department officials and additional chief secretary (development) claimed that as per actual girdawari (revenue assessment), in 2020, cotton was sown over 2.51 lakh hectares. The target for 2021-22 season has been set at 3.25 lakh hectares. Though the agri department collects sowing data daily, it monitors on a weekly basis. On the week ending May 7, cotton was sown over 41,117 hectares, which was less than 13% of the target. Department officials say sowing will pick up pace now. Farmers Mohinder Singh and Baldev Singh said initially, canal water was released late and even today in Mansa district, water in the Bhakra mainline was not available. They said it is expected to be released on May 12 and may reach tail end villages on May 13 or 14. Farmers who rely on underground water, apart from canal water in Bathinda, Mansa and Muktsar areas are also facing problems as farm sector gets power supply for only up to two hours, they said. Sources said though eight hours of uninterrupted power supply is given to the farm sector during paddy transplantation, exemption is also given for cotton sowing, which is not being done. Sources said cotton growers are expected to get good returns in the ongoing cotton season. In view of low production, starting cotton prices are expected to open close to Rs 6,000 per quintal, which had opened close to Rs 5,000 per quintal and gradually reached Rs 6,000 per quintal in February 2021 when the cotton marketing season was in its last legs. MSP in the outgoing season was Rs 5,725 per quintal for 27.5-28.5 MM long staple. Director, Punjab agriculture department Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said, “though cotton sowing started late and is proceeding at slow pace, we expect it to pick up pace. The department is sure to achieve the target though the sowing may go up to last week of May or even the first week of June.” He also comfirmed that 2.51 hectares was covered by cotton in the previous season as against the 5 lakh hectares initially expected.” Cotton cultivation this year District | Target (In hectares) | Land covered till May 10 Bathinda | 1,05,000 | 24,400 Fazilka | 1,00,000 | 10,900 Mansa | 70,700 | 15,300 Muktsar | 40,000 | 10,500 Sangrur | 3,500 | 1,035 Faridkot | 3,000 | 482 Barnala | 2,000 | 525 Moga | 800 | 78 Total | 3,25,000 | 63,220||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cotton-sowing-delayed-only-20-of-crop-sown-in-punjab/articleshow/82559507.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Goa||Procure jabs for 18+ to curb cases: NCP||Panaji: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)’s state president Jose Philip D’Souza has demanded that the government immediately procure vaccines for the 18-44 age group, stating that vaccination is the only solution to bring the Covid infection surge under control in Goa. With much fanfare, he said the government had announced that vaccination for the 18-44 age group would start from May 1. But with the government having failed to start this drive, it looks like the announcement was made to lure the young voters in the municipal elections which were held last month, D’Souza said, adding “ It’s the height of arrogance and self-praise that the government has led the situation to reach this pass”. “It is over three and a half months since the vaccination has started in Goa, and it is being conducted at a snail’s pace. This current surge in infections and death mortality could have been prevented if the government had responsibly vaccinated the entire eligible population,” D’Souza said in a statement. Stating that there is data to suggest that countries that have responsibly administered the vaccination on war-footing have managed to bring the infection spread under total control, NCP said that the BJP government under the leadership of Pramod Sawant warrants an immediate explanation on how it intends to curb the rise in cases and clarify the emergency plan to vaccinate the maximum eligible population. “It also owes the citizens an immediate explanation on the ongoing panic due to shortage of hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators, inadequate oxygen supply, and the reason behind the rising number of deaths at government-run hospitals compared to the private hospitals in the state,” he said. NCP also said that there is a demand that the Kala Bhavan at Dabolim, which is currently lying vacant, be urgently utilised as a Covid care centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/procure-jabs-for-18-to-curb-cases-ncp/articleshow/82561578.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||‘Govt should give its approval for trials of vaccine for children’||A third or fourth wave is natural for new viruses, says professor R M Pitchappan, a pioneer in human immunogenetics, but preparation for them is key. In an interview with Padmini Sivarajah, the visiting professor at Madurai Kamaraj University dispels fears about the vaccine and mutations. Q: The principal scientific adviser to the Government of India has warned of a third wave. What is your opinion?Yes, it is possible that there may be a third wave. In any new viral or vectorborne disease it is always seasonal and episodic, it takes a few cycles for the infection to die out. We cannot wait for herd immunity and all precautions have to be taken. We must also keep in mind that the pandemic will die down like the spread of hepatitis 20 years ago. Q: It is feared that the third wave will affect children. Can it be overcome?There is no evidence yet that the third wave will affect children alone. Children, except newborns till a few months, have a robust immune response capable of responding to most infections. There is no need to panic it can be overcome with care and vaccination. Children might require a low volume of vaccine due to their size and immune system. Pharma industries should think of systematically procuring and marketing it, but it is a laborious process. Passive therapy from convalescent plasma is another option. Q: Can the present Indian vaccines be administered to children?Theoretically the same vaccine should work in children, maybe with some dosage adjustments, but adverse reaction trials have to be done before implementing it. The government agencies should give the nod for trials and make the vaccine available for children. In a country where polio has been eradicated, it is possible to tackle Covid. Proper planning to vaccinate children and opening schools need to be made. The immune system of children may be less experienced, but it is not less competent than that of an adult. Q: There is a shortage of antiviral drugs. There are also conflicting reports on the usefulness of these drugs.A recent literature shows none of the drugs used as on date including these antivirals provide 100% efficacy in saving a life. The Indian vaccine manufacturers have scaled up their production. Yesterday, DCGI approved anti-Covid drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose developed by DRDO for emergency use in moderate to severe Covid patients as an adjunct therapy. The new drug reduces oxygen dependence and faster recovery. Q: What about alternate medicines?Researchers from Germany and India have identified Thymoquinone from Nigella Sativa ("Karunseeragam" in Tamil) having antiviral properties. It is also antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory. The drug can be synthesised in the laboratory. India with its vast scientific community and pharma should aim at such innovative, native medicines. This can become an affordable alternative, preventive and therapeutic like the siddha ‘kabasura kuidineer’ being attempted in various parts of the country. Q: People contracting Covid-19 after both doses is raising concern.The severity is less in people who contract the disease after vaccination. But if they succumb to the disease then these cases should be studied for demographic profile, medical history, nutritional status and co-morbidities. Linking the cases and data to the Aadhaar number, proper follow-up and introspection will help in policy making. Q: With the virus mutating fast, will these vaccines help?Antibodies generated due to vaccines may neutralise the virus to some extent if they have not mutated further in the host. The immune system also has other antibodies such as cytotoxic lympohocytes that tackle infection and help in long term immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-should-give-its-approval-for-trials-of-vaccine-for-children/articleshow/82559546.cms||---

INS Hansa is the first airbase to be taken up for modernisation as part the MoD’s Phase-II of the Modernisation of Air Field Infrastructure (MAFI) project. “As part of ongoing modernisation of infrastructure at Goa International Airport, being undertaken by INS Hansa, the runway will remain closed for all traffic from 10pm to 6.30 am daily till September 8. The multi-crore project will include installation and commissioning of modern airfield equipment like Cat-II Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Cat II Air Field Lightning System (AFLS). The modern equipment around the runway would be directly connected to the Air Traffic Control (ATC), thereby providing excellent control of the airfield systems to the air traffic controllers. “The upgradation of navigational aids and infrastructure under the MAFI project would enhance the operational capability by facilitating air operations of military and civil aircraft even in poor visibility conditions and adverse weather,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-to-modernise-airbase-runway-to-be-shut-every-night-till-sept-8/articleshow/82561589.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Workers leave Barmer in hordes||Jaisalmer: After the announcement of complete lockdown, labourers in Barmer district have started migrating back to their homes. Dozens of labourers from Madhya Pradesh, who are working in Barmer district, made a beeline at the railway station. The labourers anticipate being stuck here without their daily wages during the lockdown. The sudden migration of labourers in such huge numbers has led to crisis of construction workers for many projects, including the refinery, and if the exodus continues, many big projects will be in limbo. The migration of labourers started from first day of the lockdown. They were worried about a situation similar to last year. They left for their native places in Madhya Pradesh via Jaipur. The labourers say that in the last 15-20 days, inflation has gone up and their present wages do not suffice. The lockdown in Rajasthan started from Monday. Many of these labourers came to Barmer with their families from Damoh and Katni in Madhya Pradesh six months ago. At Jalipa army camp, they get work through contractors. According to Prem Khan, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, they had come to Barmer to work as labourers. Last year too, when the lockdown was imposed, they faced a lot of problems. There was no means to back them and they did not even get food. Labourers said that the way last year the train and bus services were stopped suddenly, they had to walk many kilometres, which scares them even today. Moreover, the contractor has also told them that there is no work and the ration and food prices have increased by five times. The state government, to stop this migration, has given relaxation to a few units, but looking at the problems faced by them during the lockdown last year, they have decided to return home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/workers-leave-barmer-in-hordes/articleshow/82559544.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Set up 100 MT oxygen plant in city, suggests amicus||CHANDIGARH: Give directions to set up a liquid medical oxygen manufacturing plant of 100 metric tonne (MT) capacity in the city to cater to the requirement of oxygen for Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali to fight the second wave of Covid-19. This is one of the suggestions that senior advocate Rupinder Khosla has made to the Punjab and Haryana high court hearing the matter related to availability of facilities and arrangements in Punjab, Haryana and the UT of Chandigarh to tackle the pandemic. They will come up for hearing before the high court on Tuesday. “The UT administration has already earmarked a suitable site for the purpose. The amicus is informed that the 100 MT plant can be installed in roughly two weeks. This will not only reduce the burden of availability of oxygen in the region but ensure the Tricity is self-sufficient in liquid medical oxygen,” the amicus has submitted while seeking the high court directions to the central government for the installation of the oxygen plant immediately. The amicus has suggested additional plants of relevant capacity can be set up in Mohali and Panchkula so that the availability of oxygen has a wider dispersal effect in the region. Neither Chandigarh, nor Mohali or Panchkula has any large-scale oxygen manufacturing plant to cater to the ever-increasing needs of the Tricity. Regarding health infrastructure in the city, the amicus has said the Sector 16 government hospital has a capacity of 550 beds, out of which 200 have been dedicated for Covid-19 patients. This number, he said, needs to be increased to 300. He has submitted the increase in the availability of oxygen, oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilator beds will have practically no use if the staff to man them are not recruited. “It has come out that frontline staff are not ready to join the pandemic war in these government hospitals as they are recruited on contractual basis with a salary of only Rs 16-17,000 for nurses, which is practically one-third of what a permanent employees draws. The home ministry may be directed to further tell the administration to recruit additional doctors and other paramedic supporting staff on permanent basis so that this deficiency in health infrastructure is removed,” the amicus has suggested||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/set-up-100-mt-o2-plant-in-city-suggests-amicus/articleshow/82557498.cms||Ajay Sura

As per health department data, an anticipated directly proportional decrease in new patient numbers has not taken place. At the start of the month, there were 12,043 active cases in Bhopal. As of Tuesday, people undergoing treatment for Covid-19 was close to 16,000, one of the highest ever. In the corresponding period, average number of new daily cases recorded in Bhopal has gone down by about 400 per day. “Recovery period for patients, hospitalised has increased by about 1.5 times. Complications are much more during the current surge,” said Paliwal hospital, director, Dr JP Paliwal offering an explanation. Earlier recovery period in hospital was around seven to 10 days, which currently can go up to 14 days depending upon patient condition. Moreover, despite drop in new cases, recovery rate has also dropped to about 90%. Infections like black fungus is also creating problems for patients in which in some patients are readmitted, he added. Many of the critically ill patients are hooked to ventilator for 12 to 20 days. Clinical diagnostics of patients can deteriorate in a very sudden way. Be it being hooked to high-frequency nasal canula and other markers, said Roshan hospital, director, Dr Rakesh Sukheja. He compared the situation of some patient with those requiring dialysis. In some situations, patients become a candidate for lung transplant, prolonging life is through supported oxygen flow for some, he added. Meanwhile, health department daya shows that since May 1, availability of oxygen supported beds has increased by 16%, while ICU beds availability has increased 10% in Bhopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/new-cases-dip-in-bhopal-but-active-numbers-remain-high/articleshow/82559549.cms||---

Delhi Police, however, maintained they were carrying out investigations based on a court order. “On a writ filed by Dr Deepak Singh about politicians involved in illegal distribution of Covid medicines, etc, Delhi High Court has directed the police to conduct an inquiry. In compliance of the directions of the high court, an inquiry is being conducted from several persons concerned,” said Delhi Police. “Dilip Pandey was contacted today but his phone was found switched off. Later, the inquiry officer spoke with his PA and subsequently an advocate called up and said that he would submit the reply of Dilip Pandey tomorrow,” said a Delhi Police officer. “It has become a crime to help somebody under the Modi government. My entire family is struggling to fight Covid infection, but the Crime Branch came to me to inquire how I helped people. They sought an answer. Not once but thousand times, I will help people even though Modi-Shah hang me for that,” Pandey, an AAP functionary, tweeted. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said the Crime Branch came to him also for inquiry. “It was not because of Narendra Modi but due to the court order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mla-cries-foul-over-questioning/articleshow/82561588.cms||---

Broadway resident Muthusamy, who met with an accident on ECR on Tuesday, a day after the complete lockdown kicked in, failed to get help despite several attempts. The pharmacist, who suffered deep injuries to the legs and was unable to move, had managed to grab his phone which had fallen down. He kept dialling 103, but couldn’t connect. Moreover, a recorded voice speaking only in Hindi and English further compounds the woes of complainants. The control room was earlier addressing at least 100 complaints a day across Chennai alone. The traffic emergency number had been established to receive complaints on traffic emergencies including accidents and congestion on roads and was very helpful. Within five minutes of a complaint being received a patrol vehicle was directed to the spot to assist those in distress. Hundreds benefited. Not anymore. “Those who seek emergency help are unlikely to get any assistance if they rely on this number. Most of the time it remains defunct. On the few occasions that we manage to connect, we don’t understand what the recorded voice is saying and we keep trying unnecessarily wasting our time,” said Manimegalai, a resident of Kannigapuram at Vyasarpadi in north Chennai. On Tuesday, TOI called the number from various phone numbers but could not get through. A traffic police officer said the personal contact numbers of the authorities concerned were available online. “If these do not work, there is always the scope to call 100. They would immediately direct the call to the officials concerned,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/emergency-no-103-inaccessible-to-public/articleshow/82561587.cms||---

When he did not come out of the washroom for long, the ward attendant broke open the door and found him lying unconscious. He was rushed and kept on a ventilator but could not be saved. He was admitted at the hospital around a week back and was having trouble breathing. His SpO2 level (Oxygen level) was around 73-75. Koh-e-Fiza police reached the spot on getting information and registered a case.

He went into the washroom around 11.30am and hanged himself with his towel by tying it to the hanging rod inside the washroom. When he did not come out after around 20-25 minutes, the ward attendant, who was instructed to keep an eye on patients using the washroom by hospital management, started knocking on the door.

The Rajya Sabha member held an informal meeting with his party colleagues to discuss the issue of constitution of the new SIT by the state government to probe into the sacrilege and Kotkapura police firing incident. He even attacked the high court claiming that by giving such a decision it had favoured the Badal family. He said chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had earlier announced that the Punjab government would challenge the high court’s decision in the Supreme Court. Now, it seems like something behind the curtain has happened and because of which the chief minister has taken the complete U-turn, he added. The new SIT has been given six months to conduct the probe, added Dhindsa. Understanding the seriousness of the situation, the Congress government in the state should have challenged the high court’s decision in the Supreme Court, said Dhindsa. He added that since 2015, the matter had been investigated by various agencies but the present and the then government left no stone unturned to save the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dhindsa-says-new-sit-in-kotkapura-police-firing-hogwash/articleshow/82559557.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Group alleges omission of gas tragedy victims from list of Covid-19 deceased||BHOPAL: A group of NGOs working among survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy, has alleged omission of names of 19 gas tragedy victims from the list of persons who have died of Coronavirus infection in the state capital. In a letter addressed to ACS, gas relief, Mohd. Suleman; director, gas relief, Basant Kurre and district collector, Bhopal, Avinash Lavania, a representative of the NGOs also enclosed papers of the hospitals where these 19 persons underwent treatment for Covid-19 along with evidence of them being gas victims, to substantiate their claim. The letter, written by co-convener of Bhopal Group for Information & Action, Rachna Dhingra, said, “As a representative of organisations working with the survivors of the 1984 Union Carbide disaster, I would like to bring to your attention a serious issue pertaining to non-reporting of 19 Covid-19 deaths of gas victims. This is a follow up email on my earlier email of Oct 22, 2020 where I had given a list of 7 gas victims who died due to Covid-19 in BMHRC and their deaths were never reported to the district & state authorities. Due to your intervention, BMHRC did respond and confirmed that 9 gas victims died due to Covid-19 in their hospital till September 2020. Out of these 9 Covid-19 deaths among gas victims, 7 were not declared to authorities and even till today these names have not been added.” She further wrote, “I am hopeful that the administration will rectify this issue and will add the names of the 19 Covid-19 deaths of gas victims in the official list at the earliest.” Talking to TOI, Dhingra said that the list of persons who died due to Covid-19 which she has referred to in her letter is the list compiled before the onset of second wave of Covid-19, which has been far more devastating, and she is sure that the number of gas victims, who have not found mention in the list of persons dying of Covid-19 in the city, must have gone up further. “We have analysed 650 deaths till now. They are people who died before the second wave. Now, keeping track of deaths has become very difficult. But, among 650 deaths that we have been able to compile, 320 are gas victims, which is a huge number considering the fact they constitute only about 18% population of Bhopal,” she said, adding that at least 25 names among these 320 were missing in the list but since they had proof of about only 19, so they mentioned only 19 names. Speaking to TOI, director, gas relief, Basant Kurre, said “I have not seen the letter but if the persons concerned have undergone treatment in a hospital, their names should be there in the list. All the hospitals inform about Covid-19 deaths to the district administration because their last rites are performed under Covid-9 protocol. But, if at all names have not been entered into the list due to some reason, they can always be added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/group-alleges-omission-of-gas-tragedy-victims-from-list-of-covid-19-deceased/articleshow/82559579.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Though the state government order mandates all commercial buildings measuring more than 3,000sqft to be shut, the market has not been closed. Rajasekar, a Chintadripet resident, recalls how there were only 19 shops earlier, but now there are more than 75. At least about 1,000 retail fish vendors and customers start flocking the market from 6 in the morning, without wearing any mask nor maintaining social distancing, he told TOI. J M H Imran, who owns the market, said there about 72 shops – 20 measuring 8X16ft and the remaining 60 ‘box vending’ facilities – inside the private market. Asked about violation of covid protocol, he said they were strictly following the norms and that shops are divided into odd number and even number shops. These two groups do business in two-week cycle, ensuring 50% occupancy, he said. As against just one entry and exit earlier, now the market has four gates -- two for entry and two for exit, he said, adding that customers are provided with masks and are allowed in only after they use sanitisers. Both masks and sanitisers are provided free of cost for the visitors, he said. “We are taking all measures to keep the place clean after the business hours. A few years ago, whenever people cross this market place, they had to cover their nose due to the stench. Now the place wears a clean look without the stench,” Imran added. When contacted sources in the Greater Chennai Corporation said they have not received any complaint about this market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/violation-of-protocol-chintadripet-fish-market-a-potential-covid-super-spreader/articleshow/82561660.cms||P Oppili

It isn’t easy living with thalassemia -- a blood disorder that causes the body to have less hemoglobin than normal -- but the last couple of months have been exceptionally tough on the 29-year-old. “Ever since the lockdown, it has been difficult to get blood as donors have dwindled and blood donation camps have been cancelled,” says Shikkha, who rounds up friends and family to take to the hospital when she needs a transfusion. “I had my last transfusion on May 5 and need another in 20 days. I take it one day at a time now and hope I can get a donor by then.”Dr Revathi Raj, president of the Thalassemia Welfare Association at the Voluntary Health Services in Taramani, says the pandemic has resulted in an acute shortage of donors and supply. “People are afraid to come to hospitals to donate blood,” she says. On account of lockdown travel restrictions, transport is another hurdle.“We have to keep haemoglobin levels at about 9 grams. For every week the transfusion is delayed, haemoglobin levels drop by 1 gram. For most people, we have been able to maintain the haemoglobin levels at only 7 or 8 because of limited blood availability,” says Dr Raj.Adults living with thalassemia require two units (each around 250 ml) of blood transfused every 21 to 35 days, says hemato-oncologist Dr Aruna Rajendran, who works with the Institute of Child Health, Egmore. For every 450 ml of donated blood, once the plasma component is removed, one only gets 300 ml of usable blood.“For children, if transfusions are delayed, growth is affected. In the case of adults, headaches, and fatigue can result if they are less transfused as haemoglobin is what enables red blood cells to carry oxygen,” says Dr Aruna. “Preserving a baby’s cord blood during can help reduce a family’s stress on finding a donor,” she adds.“The government has announced that one can donate blood 14 days after vaccination. We can only appeal to donors as these children and adults depend on blood for their survival,” says Dr Aruna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/thalassemia-patients-face-shortage-of-blood-donors-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82561683.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Union health ministry presents Mumbai, Pune models for effective Covid management||MUMBAI: Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the Maharashtra government’s efforts to control Covid-19, the union health ministry on Tuesday presented the Mumbai model of decentralised war rooms as an effective method for bed allotment and Pune as a case study for successful implementation of strict containment measures, leading to a decline in cases—two important aspects of battling the infection. In a press conference on Tuesday, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry, said effective citizen communication and decentralisation of processes, such as setting up of ward level control rooms, helped smoothen the hospital admission process in Mumbai. “They decentralised the control room meant for citizen engagement and each of the 24 wards had one control room. These control rooms not only had telephone operators, they had doctors and medical support staff who coordinated with ambulance operators. This team analysed the need for a patient to be hospitalised and assisted them in admission,” said Agarwal. Also, the test results were shared with the administration that communicated these to the patients and guided them, and this approach eliminated panic, said the health ministry. Mumbai’s successful handling of the second wave has been credited to the war rooms working 24x7, jumbo field hospitals and oxygen management. Last week, even the apex court had praised the Mumbai model for its effective handling of the crisis. The ministry said Mumbai’s central dashboard to monitor available hospital beds, track ambulances and a system of procuring beds ensured citizens did not face any problem. Stringent implementation of containment activity in Pune has led to a dip in the positivity rate as well as the number of cases. “The positivity rate was 41.8% before strict lockdown-like restrictions were imposed, which has now dropped to 23.4%. Also, cases are on the decline,” said Agarwal. Pune district has shown a decline in Covid cases in the past two weeks. The Centre and the state had been at loggerheads regarding various issues from vaccine supply to even the allotted oxygen quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/union-health-ministry-presents-mumbai-pune-models-for-effective-covid-mgmt/articleshow/82557585.cms||---

City police have been registering around 20 cases against illegal liquor smugglers every day for the past ten days and have seized large quantities of IMFL, country-made liquor and illegal liquor from their possession. Sources said that the liquor was also being illegally soldfrom closed liquor shops in the city with liquor shop staff selling them off at higher rates. In one such case, Mangalwara police on early Monday morning caught four accused including the employees of a liquor shop while they were taking liquor boxes in a loading auto-rickshaw after breaking the seal of the liquor shop located at Azad Market. Police seized 42 boxes of liquor worth around Rs5.5 lakh from the accused. However, the accused were only booked under Section 188 for lockdown violation and Excise Act. SHO Mangalwara Sandeep Pawar said that police patrol team on Monday early morning caught four accused including the manager and staff of a liquor shop located in Azad Market area while they were loading the liquor boxes in a vehicle after breaking the seat placed on the shop. In many such cases, the involvement of some police officials providing indirect support to bootleggers and liquor store staff in selling illegal liquor was also found. In such an instance, a sub-inspector and two constables posted at Piplani police station were removed from active duty three days back for their alleged involvement with the liquor contractor in the area and a probe has been ordered against them. The number of bootlegging cases were reported in large numbers from rural areas including Parwalia, Bilkhiria, Ratibad, Kolar Rural, Sukhi Sewania, Eintkheri and Berasia. A video went viral few days back in which a liquor shop was shown open in Eintkheri area offering service to several tipplers. Speaking on the high number of illegal liquor cases reported in Kolar police station area, a senior police officer said that the boundary of Kolar area is connected to Bilkisganj in Sehore district, Noorganj in Raisen district and Mandideep. The boundaries are covered by forest area and the illegal liquor suppliers have made their hideouts in the forest area. He added that in the villages on the outskirts of Kolar, many bootleggers manufacture illegal liquor in their home and sell it. The bootleggers and people addicted to liquor reach these spots through various rural roads and smuggle liquor into the city. Police have raided many such hideouts and destroyed them. He said that after the Kajlikhera police outpost was set up, the bootlegging cases were controlled to an extent in Kolar area but the accused have now shifted their bases further in the forest area and are manufacturing illegal liquor. Cases in which illegal liquor was brought to Bhopal from surrounding districts through rural areas were also reported. ASP Rajesh Singh Bhadouria said that sale of illegal liquor is on the rise as the liquor shops have been closed during Corona curfew. The illegal liquor makers have also become active in the rural areas. Police have been keeping a close eye on any such activity and taking immediate action on getting information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/booze-shops-shut-bootleggers-have-a-field-day-in-city-rise-in-illegal-liquor-sale-amid-curfew/articleshow/82559582.cms||Sudeept Mishra

The 45+ age group too would get only the second dose of Covaxin at GMCH, Prabhakarrao Datke Rognidan Kendra at Mahal and Dr Ambedkar Hospital at Indora on Wednesday. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the civic body is left without a single dose of Covishield and therefore no inoculation drive has been planned at other centres even for the 45+ group. “Resumption of the vaccination depends on availability of doses. If we receive the doses by Wednesday, the drive would be extended to other centres from next day,” he said. Of the 189 centres, the NMC could carry out vaccination only at 19 centres for Covishield and at eight centres for Covaxin. The Covishield centres jabbed 1,539 beneficiaries while Covaxin centres saw 1,130 turn up for the shots. The rural tally too dropped to just over 5,000. The district’s overall tally was at 7,342. Nagpur division’s achievement as on Tuesday stood at 18,869 with most of the beneficiaries belonging to the 18 to 44 years group taking their first jab. Of these, 13,806 took the first dose. Meanwhile, a post carrying names of private hospitals and their numbers went viral on social media claiming that they were inoculating people at Rs250. NMC officials clarified that so far there was no clarity on fixing rates for private hospitals and appealed to citizens not to trust such posts. Earlier in the day, several NMC centres witnessed huge rush of desperate citizens willing to get jabbed. However, they were unhappy and peeved on knowing that the drive won’t be conducted for the day. Some citizens said they had been visiting the centres for the last couple of days hoping to get jabbed at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-jabs-only-for-45-at-three-nmc-centres-today/articleshow/82559588.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Across the city, the number of streets under strict containment (more than 10 cases) has increased from 375 on April 28 to 725 on May 9. However, they are not evenly spread all over Chennai. The number of streets under strict containment (more than 10 cases) has more than doubled in the central and southern regions of the city in the last 11 days. In the northern part, it has only increased by around 4% during the same period. Central Chennai (zones 6-10) contributes 60% of all containment zones, southern Chennai (zones 11-15) contributes 26% and the northern zones (1-5) the rest. Ambattur (zone 7),Teynampet (zone 9), Kodambakkam (zone 10), Valasaravakkam (zone 11), Alandur(zone 12) and Adyar (zone 13) have recorded more than a 100% increase in containment zones. Valasaravakkam has recorded almost a four-fold increase during the same period. In north Chennai, Madhavaram and Tondiarpet zones have recorded a decrease in the number of containment zones. In Royapuram, there was no net increase during the last 11 days. The number of wards in the city not reporting a single street under containment has reduced from 80 to 51 during the same period. For instance, 10 of 18 wards in Teynampet have more than 10 streets under containment and one (ward 109) has 20 such streets. In Adyar, ward 177 has 19, while in Kodambakkam, ward 142 has 14 streets marked as containment zones. Vijayanand, a data analysist who has been tracking Covid-19 cases in the city, said active cases are witnessing a decreasing trend in zones such as Royapuram, Tondiarpet, TVK Nagar, Perungudi and Madhavaram. However, active cases are fast rising in zones such as Anna Nagar, Adyar, Ambattur, Kodambakkam, Valasravakkam, Shollinganallur and Tiruvottiyur, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/most-containment-zones-in-central-parts-of-chennai/articleshow/82561714.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Online scam targeting those in need of remdesivir busted||MUMBAI: An online remdesivir fraud came to light after a Khar-based businessman who was duped of Rs 40,800 approached police with a complaint. Khar Police on Tuesday filed an FIR against an unknown person after freezing a Patna-based bank account that the fraudster had used to dupe people in desperate need of remdesivir injections. The fraudster had accumulated a total of Rs 13.37 lakh in the account by fleecing various people.  After freezing the account, police learnt that the account was in the name of non-profit organisation Cipla Foundation and had been opened using fake documents. The fraudster had already withdrawn Rs10 lakh. The scam was unearthed when businessman Kunal Katariya filed a police complaint on April 27, after realising he was cheated while trying to secure remdesivir vials for his family members online. Sub inspector Nettra Mule, who was on duty then, immediately called the nodal officer of State Bank of India where the account was registered and froze the account. “Officer Mule managed to stop Katariya’s money from getting withdrawn from the bank’s Patna branch. The fraudster managed to withdraw Rs 10 lakh but with the account now frozen, the remaining sum of Rs 3.37 lakh has been saved. We have got in touch with some of the victims who are from Delhi. The FIR has been registered and the team is probing the case,” said Khar police senior inspector Gajanan Kabdule. Inspector (crime) Sandip Patil said Katariya came across Cipla Foundation’s mobile number online. The fraudster posed as a representative of Cipla Foundation and told the victim to transfer Rs 20,400 for six injections. “Katariya made two transactions of Rs 20,400 each after the fraudster claimed the first transaction had failed. The victim realised he was duped when he did not receive his order,” said Patil. “Please beware that unscrupulous persons have set up bank accounts fraudulently in the name of Cipla Foundation and enticing unsuspecting public, by fraudulently representing as employees of or authorised by Cipla Foundation... Cipla Foundation is not engaged in any form of dealing in the sale of COVID19 related medicines. Authorities have been alerted and are investigating the matter”tter,” Cipla Foundation tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-online-scam-targeting-those-in-need-of-remdesivir-busted/articleshow/82561740.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Chennai||Chennai: 2 held for trying to buy remdesivir illegally||CHENNAI: Two men were arrested at Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday for trying to buy remdesivir by submitting medical certificates of a dead Covid-19 patient. Police identified the men as Christy Paul (34) of Ayanavaram and Sathish (37) of Ponniamman Medu in the northern suburbs of the city. The two, under the guise of volunteering, had obtained medical certificates from a person who was waiting in the long queue outside KMC to get remdesivir for his relative admitted at a hospital in Thanjavur. Without the person's knowledge, Paul and Satish last week took photocopies of the medical certificates and other documents required to obtain the drug from the government counter. But when they arrived at KMC on Tuesday to submit these records, a salesperson at the counter grew suspicious when the address in the medical certificates was different from the one mentioned in their ID proofs. During police interrogation, the duo admitted that they stole credentials to buy remdesivir to sell in the black market, said a senior police officer. “When we called up the doctor's number mentioned in the medical certificates, we learned the patient had died on May 7," the cop added. One more person -- Selvakumar (43) -- was arrested at KMC for following a similar modus operandi to buy the drug. But in his case, though the patient was alive he did not need remdesivir on Tuesday. Even after opening remdesivir sales counters at five other districts, the queue at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital gets longer with each passing day. This was primarily because counters in Madurai, Trichy and Coimbatore sell vials to only 50-70 persons a day .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/2-held-for-trying-to-buy-remdesivir-illegally/articleshow/82561686.cms||Ram Sundaram

Only custodians and caretakers of masjids will be allowed inside the mosques for namaz, the Association of All Goa Muslim Jamaats said on Tuesday. The association has appealed to Muslims across the state to perform the namaz at home and avoid organising any gathering/congregation for the prayer. Eid-ul-fitr is scheduled to be held this week. “In view of the state curfew implemented by the government of Goa from May 9 to 24 due to the second wave of the pandemic that has hit our state, the executive members of the association appeal to members of the community to follow certain standard operating procedures towards Eid-ul-Fitr,” a letter of appeal by the association read. They also appealed to people to wear a mask, maintain Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and to stay at home. The hilal committee of Goa will meet on Wednesday to decide on the sighting of the moon and announce its decision regarding the date of Eid soon after. The committee also appealed to people to donate fitra before Eid. “Let’s all pray for the safety of our frontline workers like doctors, paramedical staff, police personnel, etc, and for the end of the virus,” the letter read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amid-spurt-in-cases-no-eidgah-namaz-this-yr/articleshow/82561685.cms||---

Rane had said, on Monday, that the state government would provide ivermectin tablets as a prophylactic treatment protocol for all Goans above 18 years of age to reduce the severity of the impact of Covid-19. The decision, Rane said, was taken based on studies conducted in the UK and US. This treatment is much more effective “in clearing the Covid virus” and people have to take it for five days in a row, the health minister had said. The medication is harmless and even those with comorbid conditions can safely take it, he had said. Rane said that they have received suggestions that even children above the age of 10 years can be given the preventive treatment, “but we have decided to start it for those above 18 years”. “We are doing this in the interest of the state. Even if someone has taken the vaccine, they must also take the tablets,” the minister had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/who-warns-against-use-of-ivermectin-to-combat-covid/articleshow/82561703.cms||---

The final arguments in the eight-year-old trial against Tejpal in Goa concluded in March. The case witnessed many twists and turns. On November 7 and 8, 2013, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event organised by Tehelka at a starred hotel in North Goa. On November 22, Goa Police lodged a suo motu FIR against Tejpal. He turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013, and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail on May 19, 2014 to attend the cremation of his mother and since then, had been out of jail. In July 2014, Tejpal was granted bail. In September 2017, a Mapusa court framed charges against Tejpal for allegedly raping a junior colleague in November 2013. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial. The cross-examination of the survivor began on October 21, 2019. Earlier, Tejpal had, through a criminal revision application, challenged the framing of charges by the additional district and sessions court. On December 20, 2017, the high court of Bombay at Goa had dismissed Tejpal’s application. Tejpal has been charged for offences under Sections 354, (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over women, committing rape of such women) and 376(2)(k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpal-case-court-likely-to-pronounce-verdict-today/articleshow/82561770.cms||---

A number of restrictions are already in force in all eight municipal corporation areas and 28 other cities and towns in a bid to contain spread of Covid-19 pandemic. The restrictions and night curfew from 8 pm to 6 am will remain in force until May18, after which a decision will be taken, the state government said. Trade and commerce bodies like the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry had sought some relaxation in day-time restrictions on commercial activity, as these were affecting the livelihood of a number of traders, especially, small-time traders. Thanking citizens for co-operating with the government, CM Vijay Rupani, after the core committee meeting, said that as a result of night curfew and other restrictions,the number of daily Covid-19 positive cases have dropped from over 14,000 to around 11,000.

---||Goa||GMC finds it hard to cope with high number of Covid admissions||PANAJI: Despite the opening of the new super specialty block at Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital where more than 100 patients have been accommodated, the old block continues to struggle to cope with high number of admissions. After an initial respite, the old block has begun accommodating patients on trolleys and on the floor again. “When the super specialty block opened and patients were moved there, it was a breather for us as we were able to clear out all the patients who were on trolleys and on the ground, giving us space to walk in the wards. The very next day the wards began filling up again as we are receiving so many admissions each day,” a healthcare worker at GMC said. The shortage of NIV beds has left doctors with no option but to ration oxygen and make tough decisions. “Not every bed in GMC’s Covid wards has central oxygen ports which are required for severe patients who are on non-invasive ventilators (NIVs). I often have to choose who gets these beds. I pick the ones who have a better chance of survival and longer life to live,” the doctor said. A patient in one of the Covid wards told TOI that those who are off NIV and not dependent on high flow oxygen anymore are moved from the bed to a trolley to give the patient on the trolley and opportunity to avail of the NIV. “This happens,” another doctor said. “Once the patient is off NIV, he can be on a mask anywhere and cannot claim his bed. Every new ward that is opened at the premiere medical institution is filled up within no time, with the most critical cases as well as those rejected by all other hospitals and those who cannot afford treatment in any private hospital, all landing up at GMC. On Tuesday, health services reported 321 single day hospitalisations, the highest till date. “The situation will worsen until more beds are made available and more doctors are brought on board. GMC receives all the bad patients and the disease is progressing quickly in patients during this second wave,” a doctor treating Covid said. Healthcare workers not only struggle to find available beds to move patients from one Covid ward to another depending on their condition, but also struggle to find vacant space on the floor so that patients can at least be accommodated on the ground or trolleys and connected to cylinders or even on room air. “This is the situation in GMC. If all hospitals have run out of beds, GMC always finds a way to somehow accommodate them. It is the last stop so we cannot send patients back. The South Goa district hospital only has few ICU and ITU beds available so we get those patients too as we have many more non invasive ventilators here,” the doctor said. Patients with Covid and other complications are also referred to GMC as the hospital has all the specialty doctors under one roof for any kind of care. “We need a longer lockdown and we need time to discharge these patients so that the hospital clears out. We shouldn’t have a situation where the lockdown ends and cases shoot up to 4,000 every day again, then it would be pointless for us,” the healthcare worker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-finds-it-hard-to-cope-with-high-number-of-covid-admissions/articleshow/82561764.cms||---

Now, amphotericin B that is used to treat mucormycosis detected in some Covid-19 patients is in short supply. Much like remdesivir or tocilizumab, many are desperately searching for vials of amphotericin B for their relatives, friends or persons known to them. And the drug used to treat fungal infections has become evasive. According to traders, it is the severe mismatch in demand and supply that has led to the situation. They point out that from the limited availability, the government has also kept some stock for its hospitals. Gujarat State Druggist and Chemist Association president Alpesh Patel said that Vadodara used to get around 1,000 vials of amphotericin B every year. “There are four companies that make it. It is not possible to ramp up production overnight and the number of patients is going up significantly,” said Patel. He pointed out that a patient needed six vials of the drug every day. “We have around 100 patients of mucormycosis presently. A shortage is obvious,” he said. Patel added that hardly 10% of the stocks of the drug were coming to the market presently, as the remaining were bought by governments. The injections cost any amount from Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,800 depending on the brand that is available.

Price of the premium quality petrol has already gone beyond Rs 100 per litre and was selling at Rs 103.52 per litre on Tuesday. Diesel, too, has crossed Rs 90 per litre mark and was pegged at Rs 90.74 per litre on Tuesday. Petrol and diesel prices, which were largely stable in April, started rising again soon after assembly results were declared in five states on May 2. Except for a day or two, fuel prices have been steadily rising since May 4. If the price of petrol rises by another 11 paise on Wednesday, it will touch the Rs 100 mark per litre for the first time in history. President of M P Petrol Pump Owners' Association, Ajay Singh, said that it has been close to two months that people were speculating that petrol price would reach Rs 100 per litre mark any time. But in April, prices of petrol and diesel didn't rise, they in fact marginally dipped on April 15, thereby keeping the petrol price within Rs 100 per litre mark. But after the election results in five states, the prices have started rising again and petrol may touch Rs 100 litre mark on Wednesday itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/post-poll-results-fuel-prices-on-fire-again/articleshow/82559629.cms||---

If the chief minister and health minister Vishwajit Rane are unable to manage the Covid-19 crisis, President’s rule should be imposed in Goa. The role of both the CM and health minister needs to be investigated in the deaths due to Covid, Goa Suraksha Manch president Nitin Faldessai said. “The conflict between the chief minister and Rane is out of control and, as a result of this, many are losing their lives at GMC. Stop politicising the issue and resign if you are unable to save the lives of critical patients,” said Faldesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsm-question-cm-rane-over-deaths/articleshow/82561798.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Decline in cases not a victory over Covid as yet, warn experts||NAGPUR: Amid the steep decline in daily cases, experts and top officials have warned against any lapse in Covid protocol presuming the danger is over. On Tuesday, the daily cases further dropped to 2,243, though Covid casualties increased to 65 in the district. Total 6,725 patients recovered in the day, while daily testing declined to 14,464. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has warned citizens that the decline in cases must not be assumed as a victory over Covid-19. “We must continue with the same Covid-appropriate behaviour and no one should lower their guard. We have seen how bad the situation turned in the last two months. We must continue to take Covid-19 seriously. Use of mask, hand hygiene and distancing must be followed as we have been doing right now,” he said. The civic chief added that vaccination is key and everyone should get the jab as and when they are eligible. Public health officials and doctors too said the fight is far from over and citizens need to stay alert as next target would be kids. Deputy director of health services Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said until all of us don’t fight it out unitedly, it will not be possible to beat Covid-19. “The fight is very simple. Keep your nose and mouth covered with mask, use hand sanitizer, and avoid going to crowded places. There is strong possibility the next target of Covid-19 would be kids. Therefore, parents and all family members need to be alert and extra cautious,” he said. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said the decline in cases is the result of lockdown, increased herd immunity and adherence to Covid norms. “If people stop following Covid-apt behaviour, the cases will again increase within a month. I would appeal to all to not be spreaders in their families and get vaccinated. People need to boost immunity with balanced diet, enough sleep, hygiene, positive attitude and exercise,” he said. VHA convener Dr Anup Marar said there seem to be a plateau happening presently on Covid front as one can notice lot of beds vacant and less distress calls. “People should still keep their fingers crossed. The mutations happening are alarming. Likewise, slow vaccination pace is further frustrating. Increased mortality during the second wave impact among unvaccinated persons below 45 years and fast deterioration within 5-6 days indicates that forthcoming thrid wave may further reduce the deterioration period to 2-3 days and affect children as well,” he said. Dr Marar warned that limited number of trained paediatricians, medical officers, nursing and paramedical personnel are available and hence the government should urgently increase vaccination cover to all above 12 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/decline-in-cases-not-a-victory-over-covid-as-yet-experts/articleshow/82559634.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Chief Minister’s Covid Upchar Yojana is a historic scheme bringing under it 88% to 90% of the state’s population and giving them free treatment for Corona infections.” The home minister claimed that 600 government hospitals and 188 private hospitals will be working under the scheme. “Now no poor person will die for lack of medicines and treatment,” Narottam Mishra said. In the cabinet meeting, chief minister Chouhan said that apart from two to three districts in the northern part of the state and another few in the Malwa region, the Covid situation is under control. Narottam Mishra said that the cabinet also discussed the likely third wave of Corona and the preparations to confront it. “The government is making all preparations including the ventilators, beds, ICU because we are being told that the third wave could affect children,” Mishra said. Mishra said that the cabinet discussed the wheat acquisition from farmers. “Wheat purchase is ongoing while one crore metric tonnes have already been purchased. Cabinet has also taken a decision to purchase mustard, masoor and gram at prices above MSP. This would mean government will spend more than Rs 10,000 crore on acquisition of grains,” Mishra said.

---||Ahmedabad||Reduce cap on participants at weddings and funerals further, Gujarat HC suggests||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday suggested the state government to take a call on further reducing the number of guests allowed to participate in weddings and funerals at present. Currently, a maximum of 50 people are allowed to attend weddings and up to 20 people are permitted to take part in funerals. During the hearing of a suo motu PIL on the surge in Covid-19 cases, the HC asked the state government to consider reducing the number of participants in social functions. The HC’s suggestion came after senior advocate Shalin Mehta submitted that the high court had in its last order on May 4 said that the existing restriction measures to break the chain of virus are not enough and the government should take stricter action to restrain unnecessary movement of people and gatherings. Advocate Mehta submitted that the government was asked to ponder over the HC suggestions. It has allowed maximum attendance of 50 persons during a marriage, which is too many. He said that the government can order to suspend all marriage functions for seven days and stop super-spreader events. He said that the limit of 20 persons during funerals also needed to be brought down. The state government’s counsel submitted that the authorities are trying their best to implement the court’s directions. To this, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia said that from the record the court knows that the officers have done a good job, but the government may think over advocate Mehta’s suggestions and reduce the limit of people’s participation in marriages and funerals. The court even commented that nowadays, nobody even wants to attend such functions. The state government submitted that, on the other hand, it has been receiving various requests to increase the limit of people who can participate in such social functions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reduce-cap-on-participants-at-weddings-and-funerals-further-hc-suggests/articleshow/82559823.cms||---

On May 6, builder Raju Shah wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, home minister Dilip Walse Patil and director general of police Sanjay Pandey seeking a probe by a special investigation team . Shah claimed that in 2019, he even filed a writ petition before the Bombay high court seeking a probe. “My petition never came on board. Then came the pandemic and lockdown. I lost all hope, but when I recently read the news about Singh’s involvement in illegal activities, particularly the Sachin Waze episode, I wrote to the CM, home minister and DGP,” Shah told TOI. The case pertains to a complaint filed by real estate agent Madan Gandhi in 2017 that several builders, in connivance with officials, had duped government authorities of personal profits worth Rs 40 crore. Earlier, assistant police inspector Anup Dange, inspector Bhimrao Ghadge, and bookies Sonu Jalan and Ketan Tanna had levelled similar serious corruption charges against Singh. The bookies’ complaint is being probed by the state CID.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fresh-trouble-for-param-bir-builder-makes-extortion-claim/articleshow/82559771.cms||Ahmed Ali

The Delhi-based lawyer, who has been appointed along with two other advocates as standing counsels, is known for making derogatory remarks against minorities. The notification appointing Umrao is expected to be issued in a few days. “An advocate from Uttar Pradesh by the name of Prashant Umrao is one of those appointed. He has been a hate monger and a misogynist bigot. He has been using his social media to spew communal venom against the Christian and Muslim communities,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. Congress has demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant should immediately withdraw the appointment of Umrao. Standing counsel are permanent representatives of the state in the Supreme Court. Chodankar said that Umrao’s appointment is detrimental to Goa’s “secular, liberal and progressive values” and was akin to an insult of Goans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lawyer-known-for-slandering-minorities-is-goas-standing-counsel/articleshow/82561949.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Fear of hospitalisation affects mental health the most in 2nd wave||BHOPAL: “Will I be required to go to the hospital?” is the first apprehension raised by majority of the people who are testing positive in this second wave of Covid-19 in MP In the last one week in the city, at least two positive patients have committed suicide at hospitals itself. There has been a shift in the cause of fear. During the first wave it was death and how to recover which were causing maximum anxiety among people, now it’s concern about resources including hospital beds, oxygen, medicines and the cost of treatment that are impacting the mental health of people, said experts. In an initiative aimed at providing psychological relief to people during pandemic, the state government had also set up a facility wherein proactive calls are being made to people testing positive. Till now, more than 65,000 calls have been made and mental health professionals have interacted with at least 50,000 patients in the last one year. “There has been an increase in apprehensions since the second wave began. Our teams are proactively calling people and providing relief. Major concerns are related to treatment and there is fear due to the information regarding high mortalities etc,” said deputy director, health mission, MP, Dr Sharad Tiwari.  City-based consultant psychologist, Dr Satyakant Trivedi said, “There has been great surge in depression cases and the fears that are leading to this situation have changed now. This time main cause is related to resources, whether I will be able to get a bed, how will I manage oxygen. People are scared that if three-four members of their family test positive, how will they manage the cost of treatment”. “So many patients come to us with sleep related and other mental disorders, which is induced by use of steroids. Messages are being circulated on social media regarding benefits of using steroids like Dexamethasone, which has very adverse impact on mental health. Due to all these factors, people are becoming agitated, losing sleep, developing complications”, Trivedi said. A mental health professional, Rahul Sharma who works with the state govt’s facility set up for calling the Covid patients, said, “On an average we are talking to around 300 positive patients every day, the first fear among these is whether they will have to go to hospital? They are scared about the resources. People who are testing positive want to get well at home itself and do not want to be in a condition where they have to go to a hospital. This fear has surpassed the fear of death”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fear-of-hospitalisation-treatment-cost-affect-mental-health-the-most-in-2nd-wave-experts/articleshow/82559639.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Nagpur||Docs advocate combo of primary, adjunct therapies for best results in Covid||Nagpur: Anti-viral drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab may have grabbed attention in the recent past, but leading physicians strongly recommend a combination of primary and secondary or adjunct therapies as a more comprehensive approach to getting better results in Covid treatment. With the advent of ‘black fungus’ disease Mucormycosis, doctors are now equally vigilant regarding administering the secondary line of treatment using anti-fungal and antibiotics too. The doctors underline the fact that Covid treatment is not a matter of a miracle or wonder drug, but it’s a combination of many therapies, as there is no definite medicine with an impeccable and full-proof result till date. Renowned physician Dr Mohan Nerkar, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said a combination therapy comprising primary and secondary treatments for moderate and severe patients at hospitals is the most desired line of treatment. “The combined use of Remdesivir during replication phase for reduction of viral load, anti-inflammatory steroids for patients going into oxygen supplementation, and use of Heparin as blood thinner, are among the most common and primary line of treatment in hospitalized Covid patients,” he said. “Patients showing hyperactivity of immune system or cytokine storms are being treated by monoclonal antibody drugs like Tocilizumab and Bevacizumab,” said the expert physician. Dr Nerkar also said the secondary line of treatment comprising of antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs too is crucial now as ‘hospital acquired’ secondary infections, like mucormycosis and aspergillus, too are catching up with Covid patients. Senior physician Dr Nikhil Balankhe said combination therapy is nothing but a multi-pronged attack on the virus, which does not have a definite system of treatment as of now. “The basis of multi-drug therapy is that they would act at different levels and on various aspects related to the virus and it’s effects on the body. The idea is to bring a cumulative effect of various drugs and therapies for the elimination of the virus,” said Dr Balankhe, who is in-charge of the ICU at Viveka Superspecialty hospital. “Various theories and therapies are also evolving frequently as different combinations are being tried and tested. For example, the combination of Remdesivir with Baricitinib, instead of steroids as an anti-inflammatory drug, is a highly followed theory now,” said Dr Balankhe. “One of the futuristic combinations may be that of Molnupiravir, which stops viral replication, and Defence Research and Development Organization’s (DRDO) 2-DG that eliminates the virus,” said Dr Balankhe, adding that any drugs should be used judiciously at the right time and in right proportion. Experienced physician Dr Rajesh Atal said secondary therapies for oxygen also play a key role in keeping a Covid patient on the fight so that he can allow his body to take the drugs and medicines for recovery. “We also suggest physiotherapy and also lung exercises to increase lung capacity, which is an important secondary therapy,” said Dr Atal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/docs-advocate-combo-of-primary-adjunct-therapies-for-best-results-in-covid/articleshow/82559652.cms||Soumitra Bose

She lost her father last year in the first wave of the pandemic. Diviya is now residing with her maternal grandparents but her future is uncertain. No one knows if she will ever get the life that she deserved when she was with her parents. On April 27, Devi Singh Meharat, resident of Rajiawas village of Beawar succumbed to Covid. His wife, in depression, committed suicide, leaving behind a daughter and a son, aged 11 and 7, respectively. In Bhilwara four-year-old Bunty (changed name) was left alone as both Covid claimed his parents. There are many children who have been orphaned in this pandemic. The relatives of such children initially take the responsibility of bringing them up, but no one knows what the future holds for them. Looking at the situation, several associations are demanding that the state government should initiate some programmes for these children’s safe future. “The Gehlot government is doing everything possible to save people. If the state comes up with an education or fixed deposit plan for these children, then it can make a huge difference in their lives,” said Lalit Verma, former Congress corporator of Ajmer. “There have been cases where the entire families have been affected by Covid. They have no relatives and if something happens to the parents then the children will be left to fend for themselves. If such children get some aid from the state government, then it will be of great help. We demand that the government should assure free education or scholarships for such children who have lost both the parents,” added Ramesh Saini of an NGO in Beawar. “The situation is so pathetic that no relatives or neighbours are ready to look after children of Covid positive parents. They fear that the children also may be infected and hence sometimes such children can go without food for days,” said Rajesh of Ramganj. Rajesh was admitted to a hospital along with his wife for four days, while the children remained alone at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-caregivers-for-kids-orphaned-by-virus-activists-seek-govt-support/articleshow/82559650.cms||---

The ED will examine the financial statements of companies associated with Deshmukh and his family members. It will also investigate firms associated with Waze and his family members and their financial transactions. A source said, “The ED will examine if there was any financial connection between Deshmukh and Waze. Subsequently, they will also inquire if any transaction took place between them and others associated with the bribery allegation, including former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.” ED may call lawyer who moved Bombay HC for a probeThe ED, which has registered a money laundering case against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, will probe the money trail beginning with Sachin Waze on the basis of allegations that he had extorted from complainants while working with the Mumbai police. The agency may call lawyer Jaishri Patil to record her statement soon as she is one of the four petitioners in the Bombay high court who had demanded an investigation into the corruption allegations against Deshmukh. The ED’s PMLA case is based on a corruption FIR registered by the CBI earlier against Deshmukh, based on a letter written by Singh alleging the minister had demanded Rs 100 crore from Waze and some other police officers. During the search of one of Waze’s seized vehicles, the National Investigation Agency probing the planting of explosives case had found Rs 5 lakh in cash and a currency counting machine. A bar owner had given a statement to NIA and CBI that he had collected Rs 1.5 crore on behalf of bar owners in the western suburbs of the city for Waze. In its earlier investigation in the Television Rating Points (TRP) money laundering case, the ED came across information that Waze had collected Rs 25 lakh as bribe from the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) for not harassing its executive in a TRP cheating case he was investigating.  Four petitions had been filed in HC after Param Bir Singh’s letter controversy where he alleged Deshmukh had set a collection target of Rs 100 crore a month. One of the pleas was by advocate Jaishri Patil demanding an investigation by an independent agency. The court directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Subsequently, Deshmukh resigned and the CBI has registered a corruption case against him. NIA has arrested Waze for planting the explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and for killing shop owner Mansukh Hiran, whose vehicle he used for planting explosives. In a statement, Deshmukh said, “This is just political vendetta against me for the crimes that I never committed. It is possible that the Centre might not be very happy with some of the key decisions that I took while serving as the home minister of the state earlier, and thus they are now using the machinery like ED & CBI against me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-may-call-lawyer-who-moved-bombay-hc-for-a-probe/articleshow/82559775.cms||Vijay V Singh

The faculty members including that of GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri, have stopped non-Covid duties and threatened to stop Covid-19 duties in their respective medical colleges from Wednesday if their long pending demands are not addressed in 24 hours. The GMERS Faculty Association said it has given additional 24 hours in view of the Covid-19 patients who are admitted at their hospitals. “Our demands are very basic and pending for the last 10 years. For, last two months, we have made all efforts but have failed to get any response from the state government. We are once again requesting the state government to resolve our issues by Wednesday,” said association president Dr Hiren Prajapati. “If the state government still does not address our problems, we will be forced to stop Covid duties. The health department and Gujarat government will be solely responsible for that,” he said. In a representation to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, the association has said that against the sanctioned strength of 1,800 faculty, the eight medical colleges are being run by only 700 members. It has demanded promotion of faculty, government’s contribution to PF, non-practicing allowance and transport allowance like other government employees and arrears that they have not received even four years after the implementation of 7th Pay Commission. “We are demanding that we should be treated at par with other government employees. Currently, we are being treated as employees of some private entity. In fact, we have to bear expenses of medical treatment of our relatives even if our families get infected when we are on Covid-19 duties,” he said.

The story headlined ‘3 years after promise of water, Chhatarpur village still parched’ showcased the plight of a large number of Dalits in a tiny hamlet of Chhatarpur in Bundelkhand region, who had decided to boycott elections three years ago as the region faced severe water crisis and no government had addressed it. On the polling day, villagers were persuaded by officials to vote and the BJP candidate won from here. Three years later, water crisis still persists in the village and deepens in the summer. During the 2018 assembly polls, the villagers of Korinpurva village had come out with a slogan “Netaji tum karlo note, pahle paani baad mein vote” (politicians, first resolve the issue of water and then we will vote). “We thought the promise made by officials would be fulfilled,” the villagers rued. They also approached MLA Rajesh Prajapati who had won the election. He also promised to help, but failed to keep his words, a villager quipped, adding, “Now, everybody has an excuse of the Covid crisis.” Hundreds of Dalits continue to fetch water from a tubewell after walking over a kilometre to another village where the water level is declining fast and may exhaust any time. The rights commission called for a detailed report on the issue from the Chhatarpur collector and the CEO of the janpad panchayat concerned within a fortnight. It also asked the authorities to inform it about the steps taken to provide water in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mphrc-seeks-detailed-report-on-parched-chhatarpur-village/articleshow/82559645.cms||Ankur Sirothia

Following this, four firms participated in the bidding process. Out of this, three firms qualified in the process and work order to deliver, 5,800 oxygen concentrators was issued.” These oxygen concentrators will be sent to different districts of the state. An official said, “Oxygen concentrators will ease the requirement of the life-saving gas in the state. As there is shortage of tankers, there was a problem in the state to transport oxygen. However, these concentrators can be sent conveniently.” The official also informed the central government had also increased the state’s oxygen quota on Tuesday. Now, Rajasthan is expected to receive 40 metric tonnes of oxygen extra from the oxygen plant at Hazira, Surat. Following this, 310 metric tonnes of oxygen will be received by the state from Centre, while 125 metric tonnes is being produced by different agencies in the state. A source said, “The oxygen provided by the Centre is way less than needed. The state requires 615 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but the Centre was allocating only 270 MT.” Health minster Raghu Sharma on Saturday announced that government has planned to procure 50,000 oxygen concentrators from abroad to address a shortage of the life-saving gas for Covid patients. It was informed the government had already placed an order for 1,250 concentrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/650-oxygen-concentrators-arrive-in-city-from-russia/articleshow/82559667.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even in the city’s legal fraternity, voices are growing for arranging vaccination for lawyers, their attorneys and families on the premises of Nagpur bench of Bombay high court and district and sessions court here. The demand started gaining momentum after the demise of former District Bar Association (DBA) president Sudeep Jaiswal, a highly popular lawyer, who succumbed to Covid-19 last Saturday. Some of them claimed that judges and their families have already been vaccinated and therefore, they were in a safe zone, but lawyers were still prone to get infected. While mentioning that over 4,000 lawyers were being affected due to the pandemic, Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa president Anil Gowardipe requested Tope to arrange a vaccination camp on the court premises during the ongoing summer vacations. “These should be organized for a day at taluka courts and for a couple of days at district courts. It would help in saving the lives of the legal fraternity members and their families,” he said. Lawyer Ravi Sanyal, who filed an intervention in HC along with Neeraj Khandewale and Sameer Sonawane in this regard, said they were court officers and unless they were saved, nobody was safe in the judicial system. “The Madras HC had already inoculated all lawyers and even the Bombay HC’s principal side has arranged a similar drive for its members. It’s high time we all need to make efforts to get vaccinated as early as possible,” he said. Vax drive hit due to shortage: HCBA The High Court Bar Association (HCBA) here is making an all-out efforts for organizing a vaccination drive for all its members, their attorneys and families. “We had personally met municipal commissioner B Radhakrishnan in third week of April and appealed to him to arrange a camp on HC premises. After his approval, we also met the HC administration to seek its permission, which responded positively. But now, the NMC is citing severe shortage of doses for the delay,” HCBA secretary Prafulla Khubalkar told TOI. The HCBA team once again met the NMC chief in April last week after the Centre opened inoculation of the 18-44 age group, but received the same reply. “Now, they indicated to us that a camp for the above 45 group would soon be arranged on HC premises in the first phase. After vaccines become available, all others can join,” Khubalkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccinate-lawyers-their-kin-bar-council/articleshow/82559665.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On January 10, when TN’s Covid death toll reached 12,222, around 18% (2,084) were those without any comorbidities. By May 9, such people accounted for 6063 of the 15,648 deaths (39%). On Tuesday, 78 of the 298 people who died in the state had no comorbid conditions. “In absolute numbers, deaths are still high among people above 50 years of age and among people with uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension. But during the last four to six weeks, we are seeing more young and healthy people in ICUs,” said Kilpauk Medical College Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P. “Some of them don’t make it.” On Tuesday, five of the 298 who died were in their 20s and had no comorbid conditions. Of the people in their 30s, were a 30-year-old man and 37-year-old woman with diabetes, a 38-yearold man with hypertension and another man with chronic kidney disease. At least 21 of the 48 people in their 40s had no comorbid conditions. Between January and May, the growth rate of deaths was highest (37%) among people in the 31-40 age group. On January 10, there were 456 deaths in this age group and 623 on May 9. In the same period, deaths in the 20-30 age group rose from 142 to 187, by 31%.

The dairy co-operative has set up an oxygen plant at Shree Krishna Hospital (SKH) at Karamsad in Anand. The plant with a capacity of producing 20,000 litres per hour of oxygen and can serve 60 patients in a day was inaugurated by chairman Ramsinh Parmar. SKH has been treating more than 500 Covid-19 patients and daily new 40-45 patients come for treatment at the hospital. It has tied up with Linde Company to fulfil the need for medical liquid oxygen. It has a facility of 6,000-litre oxygen tank to cope up with daily demand for oxygen and a 1,000 litre three small tanks to deal with the crisis. But since the hospital is receiving less than the earlier allotted quota, it is facing difficulties when the tanker is stuck in a traffic jam. The new facility will help to some extent to meet the enhanced requirement, hospital sources said. Parmar said that Amul will establish more oxygen plants in Nadiad and Balasinor. SKH is treating Covid patients from all over Gujarat. Keeping this in mind, the first plant was established at this hospital, he said. Amul Dairy’s managing director Amit Vyas said that the oxygen plant has been set up within eight days with around Rs 45 lakh cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/amul-dairy-sets-up-oxygen-plant-in-anand/articleshow/82557831.cms||---

Hours after midnight, when villagers reported uneasiness and some lost consciousness, they were rushed to a nearby private clinic in Zaidpur police station area. While three died on the way, two others succumbed at the district hospital, where they were later shifted. Police managed to send only two bodies for autopsy after villagers hurriedly cremated those who died soon after consuming hooch. Five people were arrested, including the liquor shop owner in Mittupur area of Azamgarh, where the poisonous brew was bought. Superintendent of police, Ambedkarnagar, Alok Priyadarshi, told TOI that station house officer of Zaidpur police station, a sub-Inspector and two beat constables were suspended for laxity. “The hooch toll is currently five and we are investigating the illegal sale of spurious liquor. We are waiting for the autopsy report of one of the victims and have filed a case in Zaidpur police station,” said the police officer. Angry villagers who had laid siege to the Mittupur police station after the deaths, were later dispersed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hooch-snuffs-out-five-lives-in-ambedkarnagar/articleshow/82561848.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

This is the second similar incident in the past fortnight during which the state has lost four of its big cats. The cub was found near the railway tracks between Dodramohar and Polapatthar railway station – around 50 km from Itarsi junction. Forest officials were informed by the motorman of the Kerala Express train who alerted the next station staff. Officials say water holes within the Satpura Tiger Reserve (STR) are drying up, pushing tigers out in search of both water and prey. “This is a male cub and must have ventured out with its mother in search of water. It apparently got separated and got hit by train. It is from the STR. We have deployed our sniffer dogs for further investigations,” a senior forest officer told media. The spot is around 25 km from STR’s Bhauri range. Sources say the forest officials had not been patrolling the region to check waterholes, most of which are dry. Earlier, a tigress was run over by a speeding train in Midghat area of Hoshangabad district on Sunday evening. Forest department were informed by the railway employees who found the carcass on tracks near Choka railway station around 6 pm. It was third tiger to have been killed on the same track in the last five years, say officials. Midghat section lies within the Ratapani Tiger Reserve, where the tiger population has increased from between 40 to 50, as estimated in the recent tiger census, say forest officials. Last year National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had asked the Railway Board to go in for a smart, efficient and green rail infrastructure to minimise the impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functions in tiger landscapes, but nothing much happened. This advisory was issued in the wake of continuing diversion of corridors, core and buffer areas in tiger landscapes for expansion of rail network, gauge conversion and doubling of existing lines across the country. Meanwhile forest officials had not been able to solve mystery behind recovery of tiger carcass inside the Kanha National Park in Balaghat district on Saturday night, just two days after a tigress was found floating in the Rajiv Gandhi irrigation canal in Wraseoni tehsil of the same district. The tiger found dead inside Kanha’s Bhaisanghat range was identified as T-44 aged about 12 years, officials say. Sources said all body parts of the striped animal were intact except two broken canines. Autopsy on sub-adult tigress found from the irrigation canal on Thursday suggests ‘injury with a blunt object’ on the lower jaw. All organs were found intact in both the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tiger-cub-run-over-by-train-near-itarsi-in-mp/articleshow/82559654.cms||P Naveen

The Jaipur railway child help desk officials claimed that while the number of cases in 2020-21 were fewer than previous year, they are getting more number of runaway cases. According to officials, while there were around 350 cases of child trafficking, child labour and runaways in 2019-20, this reduced to approximately 100 incidents in 2020-21 and 10 out of 15 cases are those of runaways. These include children from lower and middle-class families. Anup Yadav, coordinator, Jaipur railway child help desk told TOI, “The number of cases has reduced because of the lockdown as no trains were plying. For child labour and trafficking the preferred mode of transport is railways, especially trains from Bihar. However, we found that after the trains began to run again, majority of cases that we were getting were of runaway children as opposed to the previous years.” The officials said that children gave different reasons for running away from homes. Yadav said, “When asked, the children gave variety of reasons and some of them were as trivial as the fact that they were stopped from playing outside during lockdown or were asked not to spend too much time on social media.” These runaway children are handed over to the child welfare committee who get in touch with the families. In case there are no legal guardians, then the minors are accommodated in shelters. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has also started the process of collecting data of the number of children who have been rescued from child labour in all districts in the past two years. This will also include those rescued by various organisations in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cases-of-runaway-kids-on-rise-in-covid-times/articleshow/82559655.cms||---

HLL Biotech Limited, which owns the Integrated Vaccines Complex (IVC) facility, invited bids from vaccine-makers to use the 100-acre facility for production of vaccines in January. But it has not received favourable reply so far. The central government has now extended the deadline for bids to May 21. A senior HLL Biotech official told TOI that four private firms approached them during the pre-bid meeting and raised various concerns over "stringent" norms in the tender. "So, we have diluted some of the tender conditions," he said. For instance, the upfront fee, which was Rs 52 crore, has been cut drastically. "We hope to finish this process soon," he said. While he was not able to estimate a time-frame as to when manufacturing would begin or when vaccines would be rolled out, public health experts say the delay could put the country at a severe disadvantage. P Wilson, DMK MP, said if private manufacturers were unwilling to use the IVC facility, the Centre should step in and start manufacturing. Wilson, who has been vociferously demanding in courts and on public platforms that vaccine manufacturing centres in TN be utilised by the Union government, said not only HLL but PSU units in Coonoor (Pasteur Institute) and Guindy (King Institute) could be used. “If the central government says it lacks the technical know-how to manufacture vaccines in these centres, it can resort to compulsory licensing under Section 92 of the Patents Act," he said. Maharashtra government’s Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation had got the Centre’s nod to produce Covaxin through technology transfer from Bharat Biotech. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to transfer Covaxin technology. D Ravikumar, VCK MP, said Tamil Nadu can also try to sign a MoU with Centre and acquire patent for Covaxin, developed using Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) funds. The state can also look for options to manufacture other vaccines like Sputnik as the current vaccine supply is no way close to the demand, he said. TN needs at least 15 lakh vaccines immediately, according to official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-takers-for-vaccine-complex-in-chengalpet/articleshow/82559666.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Kolkata||Madhyamik on June 1 uncertain||Kolkata: The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has informed the school education department that it isn’t possible to hold the Madhyamik examinations as per schedule from June 1 to June 10. The Board has sought to know from the government whether the examinations will be deferred or be scrapped altogether. Any decision by the state will also have a bearing on the state higher secondary examinations slated to start on June 15. There are around 10 lakh Madhyamik examinees. "The decision to postpone or cancel the exams needs to be taken by the state government," said West Bengal Board of Secondary Education president Kalyanmoy Ganguly. Education minister Bratya Basu had on Monday informed that the decision will be taken by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. "The students are in a dilemma. Their session was held online. Some physical classes and practical sessions could be held between February and March. It is unfortunate that the delay in taking a decision is putting them under more stress," said the headmaster of a government school. According to board officials, they had an initial discussion with the state school education department. The officials agreed that with train services stopped and the state buses and Metro services running at 50% capacity, it will be a problem for examinees and teachers to physically turn up at examination centres. It is largely believed that the restrictions will remain till May 31, making it impossible to hold the examinations in time even if the Covid situation improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/madhyamik-on-june-1-uncertain/articleshow/82557904.cms||---

The bodies have floated into Bihar from UP. Autopsies done by our doctors have confirmed that these are 4-5 days old," Jha tweeted. He added, "The last rites of 71 bodies performed as per Covid protocol. A net has been placed on the river at Ranighat, bordering UP and Bihar. We've advised the UP administration to be vigilant; our district admin is keeping vigil too. Advise all to give all respect to those dead, and Maa Ganges (sic)." In another tweet, Jha, a close aide of chief minister Nitish Kumar, posted, "Honourable CM Nitish Kumar is pained at both the tragedy as well as harm to the river Ganges. He has always been particular about the purity and uninterrupted flow of the river and has asked the administration to intensify patrolling." Meanwhile, a blame game has erupted between Bihar and UP officials over the bodies floating in the river. Buxar DM Aman Samir has denied that the dead bodies were from Buxar and claimed that they washed up downstream from neighbouring Ghazipur district in UP. However, Ghazipur DM denied that the bodies were from his jurisdiction. "As the bodies were found there (Buxar), they would know better about their origin. We are conducting regular patrolling and investigation will also be conducted," Ghazipur DM Mangla Prasad Singh said. Meanwhile, the Buxar district administration could not ascertain the cause of death in the post-mortem of the 71 bodies recovered from the river so far. "The work of fishing out bodies from the river and carrying out the post-mortem went on throughout the night. The autopsies could not ascertain the reason for death as the bodies got highly decomposed. Nevertheless, DNA samples of some of the bodies have been preserved for further investigation," Buxar DM Aman said in a statement. The Buxar DM said adequate arrangements of wood for funeral pyres have been made at the ghats in Chausa where six to eight bodies are cremated daily. The DM also instructed all BDOs, circle officers and SHOs of the district to keep a strict vigil at the ghats and ensure that no one dumps bodies in the river. Patch Union minister appeals for probe Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat termed the bodies floating in the river at Buxar as "unfortunate and a matter for probe". In a tweet posted on Tuesday morning, Shekhawat tagged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath and appealed to take immediate cognizance of the matter. "The incident of corpses found floating in Ganga in Buxar is unfortunate. It is definitely a matter of investigation. The Modi government is committed to the cleanliness of 'mother' Ganga. This incident is unexpected. The states concerned should take immediate cognizance of this incident," Shekhawat tweeted. Patna/Buxar: A day after bloated and decomposed human bodies were found floating on the banks of river Ganga at Chausa in Buxar district, Bihar government claimed that altogether 71 bodies have been recovered from the river and all had floated downstream from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. In a series of tweets posted on Tuesday, state water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha claimed that the bodies were four to five days old and their last rites were performed as per protocols. "The Bihar government is seized of the matter of unfortunate case of floating mortal remains in river Ganga, near Chausa village in Buxar district. The bodies have floated into Bihar from UP. Upon postmortem, our doctors have confirmed that these are 4-5 days' old bodies," Jha tweeted. Jha, who is a close aide of chief minister Nitish Kumar, further tweeted: "Honourable CM Nitish Kumar is pained at both the tragedy as well as harm to the river Ganges. He has always been particular about the purity and uninterrupted flow of the river and has asked administration to intensify patrolling to ensure this is not repeated." He added: "Last rites of 71 bodies performed as per protocols. A net has been placed in Ganges in Ranighat, bordering UP and Bihar. We've advised UP (Uttar Pradesh) administration to be vigilant; our district admin is keeping vigil too. Advise all to give all respect to those dead, and Maa Ganges (sic)." Meanwhile, a blame- game seem to have erupted between the officials in Bihar and UP over the bodies floating in the river. Buxar district magistrate (DM) Aman Samir has denied that the dead bodies were of Buxar and claimed that they were washed up downstream in the river from neighbouring Ghazipur district in UP. However, Ghazipur DM denied that the bodies floated from his district. "As the bodies have been found there (Buxar), thus they would better know about their origin. We are conducting regular patrolling and investigation will also be conducted," Ghazipur DM Mangla Prasad Singh told a reporter at Buxar over phone. He added that over a dozen bodies were being carried out from Bhabhua on Monday night, which was stopped by Ghazipur district administration. Meanwhile, Buxar district administration could not ascertain cause of death in the post-mortem of the 71 bodies recovered from the river bank so far. Also, nets were put in the river to trap more bodies, if any. "The work of taking out bodies from the river and carrying out post- mortem went on the entire night. Post- mortem was conducted on altogether 71 bodies but reason of death could not be ascertained as the bodies were highly decomposed. Nevertheless, DNA samples of some bodies have been preserved for future residences," Buxar DM Aman said in a statement. Earlier, panic prevailed in the area on Monday morning after more than 30 decomposed bodies were seen floating on the bank of the river, especially at Mahadeva Ghat at Chausa. Though Buxar district administration has claimed that the bodies floated down the river from Uttar Pradesh but locals claimed many people in villages mostly in Ghazipur and some in Buxar as well dispose the bodies in the river out of taboo. Some also attributed it to high cost of cremation or funeral pyres and the bodies were of people who succumbed to Covid-19. Buxar DM Aman said on Tuesday that adequate arrangements of pyre woods have been made at the ghats in Chausa, where six to eight bodies were being cremated daily. The DM also instructed all block development officers (BDOs), circle officers (COs) and SHOs of the district to keep strict vigil at the ghats and ensure that no one immersed bodies in the river.

Police have initiated proceedings to book him and other accused under national security Act (NSA). Meanwhile, the bar association have urged the lawyers to not plead for the accused and also submitted a memorandum to the government to book the accused for sedition. A special investigation team (SIT) that has been constituted to probe the matter has sent its report for imposing NSA on the accused to the district superintendent of police. Additional SP, Rohit Keswani who is heading the SIT said, “The accused Mokha was arrested from his City hospital on Tuesday. SIT interrogated him about the fake Remdesivir injection case. It has surfaced during investigation that he had procured 500 fake Remdesivir injections from Gujarat and of those he had injected them to 50 patients. The remaining injections are yet to be traced”. Meanwhile, CSP Omti, R D Bhardwaj said, “Mokha will be produced before court on Wednesday and we will request his remand for further interrogation. We are also investigating whether any patient who was administered the duplicate Remdesivir injection by the accused died.” Utkarsh Agarwal a lawyer at MP high court said, “Need of the hour is to have special legislation to curb the menace of black marketing and fake sale of life saving drugs. If this special legislation cannot be passed in Parliament or state legislatures at this stage, then, certainly an ordinance can be promulgated with immediate effect. This special legislation can be on line of retributive theory of justice so that this evil practice of black marketing and fake sale of life saving drugs can be countered by instilling fear in the minds of predators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/jabalpur-hosp-dir-arrested-cops-move-to-book-him-under-nsa/articleshow/82559668.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Oxygen cylinders drown in canal, cops guard all night||Kolkata: The police posted at a spot on Southern Bypass on Sunday night had not guarded anything more zealously. Neither had they ever participated in a search and rescue operation this unique. All through Sunday night and into the early hours of Monday, cops from Sonarpur police station stood guard next to a truck that had turned turtle, keeping a watch on part of the cargo that had dropped on the road. A part of it had rolled into the canal and lay submerged. The truck was on the way from Domjur to Baruipur sub-divisional hospital when the accident happened. And its precious cargo comprised 70 jumbo-sized oxygen cylinders, a consignment that has in this moment of crisis has become more precious than gold. It was quite late at night that Baruipur sub-division assistant chief medical officer Indranil Mitra received the distress call and learnt that the truck ferrying the oxygen cylinders after refilling them at a plant in Domjur had overturned. Fearing a possible loot, he called up the Sonarpur PS to secure the cylinders. A large crowd had gathered at the spot when police arrived. Before dispatching the injured driver and helper to a hospital for treatment, the cops learnt there were 70 cylinders in the truck. But only 23 were found around the truck. The remaining 47 cylinders had presumably rolled into the canal. Unless a few of them had already been stolen. A vehicle from the hospital reached the spot to recover the 23 cylinders. The cops stayed put, guarding the invisible cylinders resting on the canal bed.  At dawn, divers were deployed to fish the cylinders out of the water. With the crowd gradually building up, the cops also took help from local fishermen who joined in the rescue act. Much to everyone’s relief, all 47 cylinders were successfully recovered by noon. They were then transported to the hospital in Baruipur. “We were tense about the recovery of cylinders because they are crucial to keep the oxygen supply going for Covid patients. It is very difficult to get new oxygen cylinders now,” said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oxygen-cylinders-drown-in-canal-cops-guard-all-night/articleshow/82557928.cms||---

I am sure Deshmukh will cooperate with the investigating agencies. When CBI registered a case against him, too, he had extended full cooperation,” Malik said. NCP leader and labour minister Hasan Mushriffclaimed it was “an attempt to destabilize the three-party government” and “to divert the attention of people from key issues in the pandemic which (PM) Modi has failed to address.” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the Modi government was “playing dangerous politics detrimental to democracy.” - Prafulla Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-centre-abusing-power-trying-to-destabilize-mva-govt-says-cong-ncp/articleshow/82559783.cms||---

However, on Tuesday, the fire brigade officials rushed to the rescue of a monkey that accidentally fell into the river while swinging from the grills on Dadhichi Bridge. The firemen rushed to the spot in their rescue boat. On spotting them, however, the monkey swam across and climbed on to a pillar of the bridge. Thinking it would be easy to catch it while it was on the pillar, the firemen tried to approach it from the other side. They even tried to lure the simian with a banana, but the monkey refused to accept it. In fact, it became aggressive towards the men. Sensing that it would be difficult to trap the monkey, the firemen called the forest department. With great effort, the men caught it using a rope, put it in a cage and brought it to safety. This is not the first time that a monkey has been rescued from the river. The firemen had earlier saved a monkey that had fallen into the Sabarmati from Gandhi Bridge. The firemen had tied a rope around the monkey and secured its safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/monkey-swings-off-bridge-falls-into-sabarmati-river/articleshow/82563459.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rapid test enough for hosp admission||Kolkata: The state government has allowed rapid antigen test (RAT) even to private hospitals for early detection and treatment of patients who come with Covid-19 symptoms. So far, RAT was allowed only in government hospitals and private hospitals could not conduct this speedy test that gives result in 30 minutes. The change in testing protocol, however, came with a caveat. While those who test positive will be moved into the Covid ward, patients with negative reports must be rechecked with RT-PCR test. “If the RAT throws up negative result of a symptomatic patient, RT-PCR samples be taken for reconfirmation while keeping the patient at the isolation bay still,” read the advisory. The latest advisory on Covid testing from the state health department on Tuesday read: “It has been observed that many serious patients are coming to hospital emergencies with Covid-like symptoms. RT-PCR is taking longer time. Due to the delay in getting the confirmatory reports, there is delay in initiating treatment in Covid wards. In such a situation, all Covid hospitals may use RAT in emergency cases.” “When there is the need to test more, RAT will not only help in early detection but also isolation and timely treatment for those who need medical attention,” said Anirban Dalui, public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan, Even as bigger corporate hospitals that have testing techniques like GeneExpert that takes about two hours to detect the infection, smaller nursing homes have been finding it difficult to admit a patient the Covid ward if they did not come with a positive report. Also, many patients at home isolation are having to wait two to three days for an RT-PCR report. “It is a good initiative on part of the state government. Many labs have been asking for it. Though we have GeneExpert facilities in our hospital for urgent cases, this move will be helpful for smaller hospitals,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, microbiologist at Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rapid-test-enough-for-hosp-admission/articleshow/82557984.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With oxygen fast getting exhausted, doctors at Garia’s Remedy Hospital sent out desperate SOS messages to everyone they knew. The hospital’s oxygen supply that runs on cylinders had not arrived on time due to a snag at the refill station in Domjur. A health official who received the call said the doctor at the other end of the line was begging for help and was literally in tears. a patient’s kin carries a cylinder to the hospitalAccording to Kolkata Police, commissioner Soumen Mitra received a call around 9.20pm about the precarious situation at the hospital and asked the KP welfare cell to step in. The cell’s team contacted the dealers. At first, nine cylinders were arranged by the cops. The Baruipur SDO also called oxygen manufacturer Linde and arranged for 40 B-type cylinders. In addition, 13 cylinders from Baruipur hospital and 10 from M R Bangur were sent. The frantic efforts on multiple fronts saw 72 cylinders reach the hospital by 11.15pm. A few minutes delay and the oxygen supply would have run out and left patients gasping. The scheduled delivery of 65 cylinders reached the hospital around 3.30am. “The demand for oxygen has gone up, causing delay in refill. In addition, a snag had occurred at the plant, further delaying delivery,” an hospital official recounted. Officials at Baruipur sub-division hospital said the private hospital had a capacity of 40 patients but twice as many patients were admitted there. Cops from Narendrapur PS had to be deployed to control a mob that had gathered after a patient with respiratory distress died while waiting in the ambulance. “With oxygen supply very low, we were not in a position to offer oxygen to another patient who had not yet been admitted,” a hospital official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/72-o2-cylinders-sourced-in-2-hours-save-73-lives/articleshow/82557948.cms||Sudipto Das

Dorsey’s announcement of the grant, and his choice of NGOs to whom he had directed it, also sparked off controversy and chatter on Twitter. Dorsey tweeted that the $15 million for India will go to three NGOs- Care ($10 million), Aid India ($2.5 million) and Sewa International ($2.5 million) for their relief work. $15 million split between @CARE, @AIDINDIA, and @sewausa to help address the COVID-19 crisis in India. All tracked… https://t.co/Q0ovwMlgMd— jack (@jack) 1620670295000A large section of Twitter users commented that head of the social media platform had chosen to fund Sewa International, a NGO they claimed was the American arm of Sewa Bharti, a welfare organisation affiliated with the right wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). “A lot of us have been campaigning and warning people to not donate to RSS-affiliated @sewausa and yet…,” a Twitter user Sharjeel Usmani, wrote on Twitter. “Part of Jack Dorsey’s donation for India went to Sewa Bharati. Let the outrage begin!!!,” another user @Sootradhar, tweeted. Dorsey’s statement defines Sewa International as “a Hindu faith-based, humanitarian, non-profit service organization.” Based in Texas, Sewa International has raised over $7 million for its India Covid relief efforts as per information on the NGOs site. Agency reports quote Sewa International’s vice president for marketing Sandeep Khadkekar thanking Dorsey for his generous donation. “We are a volunteer-driven non-profit organisation, and we believe in serving all, following the sacred Hindu benediction, ‘Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah,” Khadkekar told PTI. “Thank you @jack. Our volunteers are working day & night to help the people in need. We appreciate your support,” Sewa International tweeted on Tuesday. The $15 million grant comes from Dorsey’s Start Small initiative, a fund he launched in April last year, setting aside around $1 billion of his equity from fintech startup Square (almost 28% of his wealth) to tackle Covid-19 globally. For the sake of transparency, Dorsey has been tracking contributions from it on a separate Google Sheet open to all, and as per the tracker, he has already disbursed around $397 million to various organizations globally in the last year. In case of global organisation Care, the grant will go towards its efforts to set up temporary Covid-19 care centres, providing oxygen, PPE kits, and other critically needed emergency supplies for frontline health workers. It will also help address “vaccine hesitancy and helping ensure that people get vaccinated, particularly in remote, marginalized communities in India,” Doresey’s tracker said. For Sewa International, the grant will support procurement of lifesaving equipment such as oxygen concentrators, ventilators, BiPap, and CPAP machines as part of Sewa International’s Help India Defeat COVID-19 campaign. Association for India’s Development (AID)’s grant will help under-resourced communities identify Covid symptoms, prevent spread, access care and treatment, benefit from medical equipment including oxygen, oximeters, thermometers, protective gear and vaccination among others. The grant comes at a time when Twitter has been in the news recently for suspending actress Kangana Ranaut’s account, a move that her supporters consider as an attempt to stifle right wing voices||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/row-over-dorsey-aid-to-rss-linked-ngo/articleshow/82559722.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

In Kapurthala area, the Jama Masjid clerics have provided free ambulance service to ferry patients to hospitals, are helping in burial of those losing their lives to Covid and also providing free oxygen to the needy patients. The staff of these two mosques have gone all out to aid families in need of any form of medical assistance. “A few days ago, a patient from Ayodhya came to Lucknow and his family contacted us for oxygen since the ambulance was out of the life saving facility. We arranged a jumbo cylinder. He then was able to look around Lucknow for a bed which however was not possible and he then travelled ahead with oxygen provided by us,” said secretary of Insaniyat Welfare Society at Masjid Noor, Mohammad Imran. Everyday members of the mosque help over 50 people with 10 litres of oxygen cylinders, which they have procured from donors, friends and families. Once the cylinders are empty and return to them, the young men attached to the mosque stand in queues for several hours despite keeping roza to refill the cylinders. “We are not sending anyone away. Even if a person returns to us twice or thrice, we are refilling the cylinder everytime. Doctor’s recommendation and identity records are being maintained. We are charging nothing from people,” he added. Volunteers from Kapurthala’s Jama Masjid, after performing their Fajr (sunrise) namaz post Sehri (meal at dawn during Ramzan), stand in queues outside the oxygen refilling centres. The mosque started out by seeking donations to start a 24x7 ambulance service for Covid patients. “We managed to collect good funds but then a doctor donated his ambulance to us. With the funds we will soon be buying an even bigger vehicle for the same purpose,” said Imam of the Jama Masjid, Maulana Tauheed Alam. The ambulance also doubles up as a hearse van bringing the deceased to the mosque’s graveyard where the committee helps in burial too.  The ambulance also ferries mosque volunteers to oxygen refilling centres to help them get in line on time and bring back the life saving cylinders for free distribution from the mosque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mosques-extend-help-to-covid-patients-in-crisis/articleshow/82561991.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Kolkata||Govt for strict monitoring of O2 therapy to curb wastage||Kolkata: The state government on Tuesday released the oxygen therapy protocol for hospitals, advising hospital superintendents to ensure meticulous monitoring and preventing overuse that can lead to a crisis. It has also fixed responsibility on an assistant superintendent and the nursing officer-in-charge for prudent use of oxygen. As per the state protocol, hospitals need to ensure that oxygen saturation level in patients with respiratory distress is maintained at 92%-96% with oxygen support after initial stabilisation and not given high flow of oxygen to maintain a higher saturation. “Doctors must write appropriate devices and initial oxygen flow rate in the prescription and on-duty nurses should monitor the saturation and increase or decrease the oxygen flow to maintain the saturation of around 94%,” an official explained. Though the state still produces more oxygen than it currently requires, the rate at which infections are rising and patients are getting admitted to hospitals, the oxygen requirement is predicted to double in a month from 300 MT now to 600 MT by June 10. That will push the demand beyond the production capacity and lead to a crisis. The state currently has a production capacity of 490 MT. Though several oxygen plants are being installed at hospitals, the only way to prevent a crisis, feel officials, is by ensuring prudent use of oxygen and minimal wastage. At present, eight to nine out of 10 patients being admitted to hospitals are requiring oxygen support. In most hospitals, the oxygen requirement has doubled in the past three weeks. While several hospitals used to refill liquid oxygen tanks on the premises once every alternate day, most are having to refill them daily while a few are even requiring a refill two times a day. The protocol released on Tuesday also calls for real-time data entry of Covid patients on CPMS portal for monitoring the overall condition and management of Covid patients. “This helps in identification of critical and dischargeable patients, rational use of oxygen in CCU/HDU beds by monitoring the CPMS score,” an official explained. The notification called for deputing an assistant superintendent at each hospital who would be responsible for overall management of supply and stock of oxygen in the hospital and ensure its rational use. Also, a ward sister is to be identified as nursing officer-in-charge of oxygen management of all Covid patients in the hospital. She will, in turn, be responsible for building up capacity, perform supportive supervision and ensure strict adherence to oxygen management guidelines among all staff nurse of the hospital. The floor sisters have been empowered to regulate the oxygen concentration by adjusting the volume of oxygen flow to keep the saturation level at 92%-96% and at 88%-92% in case of patients with COPD, asthma or chronic lung disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-for-strict-monitoring-of-o2-therapy-to-curb-wastage/articleshow/82558038.cms||---

The objective, particularly in areas under the newly merged Loni Kalbhor and Lonikand police stations, is to enable these units to overcome the issue of staff shortage. Loni Kalbhor and Lonikand police stations collectively cover an area of 589sqkm. which is nearly the size of the Pune police commissionerate (590sqkm) prior to the merger. “Most college boys and girls have been appointed as SPOs after they volunteered their services,” deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI. “We have appointed 200 SPOs at the Loni Kalbhor police station. They assist us free of charge during peak hours. They are hardworking, enthusiastic and actively patrol on foot and create awareness on Covid-19 guidelines,” Patil further added. DCP (zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “This year, we have appointed a limited number of SPOs as the exposure level is higher and there is no complete lockdown in the city. They are doing a commendable job.” “Zonal DCPs have appointed around 1,000 SPOs based on need. We have also drafted in NCC cadets and ex-servicemen. Most of them have volunteered their services, while others are paid a daily honorarium of Rs250. The SPOs discharge their duty like real policemen,” DCP (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge said. Sandip Jadhav, an SPO, said this was their chance to serve the society. “We make announcements in public places to close shops, wear masks, maintain social distancing, and send loiterers home. We have also helped police curb vehicle thefts in rural areas,” he said. “We have also been trained on helping accident victims. Our appointment as SPOs increased our confidence level and we communicate better. I now have a fair idea of the duties. responsibilities and pressure on policemen, especially during the pandemic,” SPO Kiran Modak said. “Instead of sitting at home, I opted to become as SPO. I help police in check vehicles nakabandi points at Rajaram bridge and other places. I now know the difficulties police face in discharging their duties,” Kishore Konde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youngsters-appointed-as-spos-lend-support-to-cops/articleshow/82559768.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Patna||Ex-MP Pappu Yadav arrested in 32-yr-old kidnapping case||PATNA: Former MP and Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav was arrested from his Patna residence on Tuesday, first for the lockdown violation and then in a 32-year-old kidnapping case registered with Murliganj police station in Madhepura. The court had issued a non-bailable warrant against him for not appearing in the case trial. Earlier, an FIR was lodged against Pappu in Saran for allegedly damaging several ambulances purchased from the MPLAD fund of Saran MP Rajeev Pratap Rudy lying covered and unused at Amnaur amid the Covid-19 crisis. He was also accused of misbehaving with a few persons there while showing the ambulances. People on social media, however, are raising questions on the timing of his arrest as he was continuously helping the families affected by the Covid pandemic and exposing the severe shortcomings of the state government in handling the crisis. Town DSP Suresh Prasad, along with the SHOs and police personnel of three police stations, had reached his residence to arrest him. The FIR was lodged by a magistrate deputed at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) by the district administration after Pappu visited there with his 15-20 supporters. However, he was set free in the case from the police station on a personal bond that he would appear before police whenever required in the course of investigation in the case. City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said the FIR was registered under relevant sections of The Epidemic Diseases Act and The Disaster Management Act. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said while Pappu was in their custody, Madhepura SP sent a letter around 9.30am that he is to be arrested in a case as per the court order. “He was served a notice as per law and set free in connection with the Pirbahore case. But we kept him detained after getting the Madhepura SP’s letter. Later, a Madhepura police team took Pappu away,” he said, adding he was requested several times not to move without a valid pass. Madhepura SP Yogendra Kumar said an ACJM court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Pappu in September last year as he was not appearing in a trial of a kidnapping case registered with Murliganj police station in 1989. “In March, the court ordered to attach his property at Khurda village under Kumarkhand police station area of Madhepura in the case in which he was arrested on Tuesday,” Kumar said. He said the police team is yet to return with Pappu. The SP said 12 persons, including Pappu, are accused of kidnapping a youth. The FIR was lodged by his father. “Police had already filed the chargesheet against all the accused in the case,” he said. The SP said Pappu would be produced before a court, which will decide further legal course of action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-mp-pappu-yadav-arrested-in-32-yr-old-kidnapping-case/articleshow/82557627.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Hyderabad||Ten-day lockdown in Telangana from today, with relief||HYDERABAD: After resisting pressure for a lockdown from different quarters for more than a month, the Telangana government on Tuesday finally gave in and ordered a lockdown for 10 days from Wednesday morning. The decision to shut down till May 21 was taken in the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. With this, Telangana has become the last state in the southern India to go for lockdown. Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have already imposed full or partial lockdowns. The Telangana cabinet will again meet on May 20 to take a decision whether to continue lockdown. Under the new guidelines, only a handful of facilities have been told to shut completely. These include cinema halls, swimming pools, clubs, gyms, amusement parks, and sports stadia. An official statement said relaxation will be given daily between 6 am and 10 am allowing all shops to open. Public transport like the RTC buses and metro and also liquor shops will be open during these hours. Government offices will work with 33% staff. Banks and ATMs would function normally. E-commerce services like home delivery for essentials, food, medical equipment have been exempted from the curfew. IT and IT-enabled services, including telecom, postal services and internet too have been exempted. Earlier in the day, the Telangana high court had said that there was a talk of lockdown being imposed after Eid was celebrated on December 14. The judges had said that if the state was to shut to reduce the impact of the second wave of Covid-19, the decision should be taken immediately. By afternoon, the government had informed the court that the cabinet had decided on shutdown. Sources said that, so far, KCR was reluctant to impose a lockdown in the state and even went on record that it would impact the livelihood of crores of people, especially workers and labours, apart from hitting the state revenues. He was of the opinion that there was no improvement in the states which had gone for lockdown for the past few weeks. Keeping this in view, the cabinet decided to continue paddy procurement in the centres and exempted all fertilizer and seeds shops, all agriculture and allied sectors like rice mills, warehousing, cold storage, transportation of paddy. The state government also decided to give exemption to all emergency services such as medical shops, hospitals, panchayat raj and municipal services to take up sanitation drives, drinking water supply and power supply. The state government offices are also allowed to function with 33% of their strength. Apart from the lockdown, the cabinet asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to ensure that all essential medicines required for treatment of Covid-19 patients, including remdesivir and oxygen supplies, are available for both government and private hospitals. KCR spoke to the manufacturers of remdesivir over phone from the cabinet meeting and asked them to cooperate with the state government and supply more vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ten-day-lockdown-in-t-from-today-with-relief/articleshow/82562031.cms||Koride Mahesh

Solely dependent on rainfall despite having fertile land, the couple could never harvest Rabi crop on their two acres land. But, for the first time this year, the small farm of this couple, expects to harvest nearly 930 kg cumin, which they will sell in Asia’s biggest spice market at Unjha. Over the years, this island, located in the middle of a salt desert, has seen a sea change in the lives of its residents. One can not only see several swathes of 'oasis' blooming with crops, but people have access to permanent water supply, something that was a luxury till few year back. The green revolution is not limited to just Khadir Beyt, things have changed for good at many villages in Banni grasslands and coastal Abdasa too. The parched land of theses villages now have a green hue thanks to the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) project carried out by Gujarat Ecological Education and Research (GEER) Foundation. The project, the execution of which began in 2018, has changed the life of over 2,200 households residing in 32 villages. The project is providing livelihood security and precious water to the fishermen community locally known as ‘Pagadiya’ of coastal Abdasa town, the pastoral community of ‘Maldharies’ in Banni grassland and marginal farmers of Khadir Island. In 2017 the union government sanctioned the, with a budget of Rs 21.35 crore, with an aim to strengthen the natural resources of the region and to give respite to the local communities living here from the effects of climate change. The projects also aimed to restore the ecosystem of the region. The construction of ‘Holiyas’ and ponds was among the most important part of the project. ‘Holiya’ is a ‘Recharge-cum-Production Tube-well’ that recharges sweet rain water in shallow natural underground aquifers. “We have planned and executed various rain water recharge structures in both surface as well as underground aquifers. We have created nearly 30 Holiyas and 78 wells out of total 100 targeted which has changed the life of local communities, they are now able to take Rabi crop with the help of water recharging,” R D Kamboj ex-director of GEER Foundation . “Five farmers use one ‘Holiyas’ on community sharing bases. These Holiya’s have recharged 141 crore litres of rain water into the natural aquifer of which 100 crore litres is available for irrigation,” Kamboj added. The villagers also use this water for irrigation as well as for livestock purposes. Viram Bhil a resident of Gadhda village owns nine acre land. “Thanks to this project I have cultivated Rabi crop for the first time in my life this year, which has substantially increased my family’s income,” Bhil said. The fishing community too has new source of income now. They have taken to farming and are cultivating cash crops like groundnut and cotton apart from raising livestock. The cash crop and livestock products such as milk and ghee have increased their income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/holiyas-usher-in-sea-change-in-parched-kutch/articleshow/82558100.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Jaipur||CM appeals to all parties to unite for human service||Jaipur: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has called upon political leaders to rise above their ideologies and unite in the fight against Covid. He said human service is the religion of all politicians and today was the time to fulfill it. All sections of society are helping as much as possible in this crisis. Politicians also have an obligation to support each other in times of crisis and motivate people to win this war. Gehlot was holding an all-party meeting on Tuesday to discuss the Covid situation. He said the second wave had taken a very deadly form in the state and the country and its spread was increasing at many times faster than preparations of the governments. Preventing this was the most important task in which political activists and leaders can play a big role, Gehlot said. He added that political parties should make positive efforts to make common people aware of the seriousness of the disease, prevent it and cooperate in providing treatment. Gehlot sought support from all political parties on the demand from the central government to increase the quota for the supply of medical oxygen in the state. He said the leaders of all parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, should appeal to the central government to provide maximum supply of medical oxygen, other resources and equipment in view of the large number of Covid patients in Rajasthan. He said all parties should vigorously raise the demand of increasing the supply of vaccine for complete vaccination in the state. Medical and health minister Raghu Sharma said the state government had expanded medical facilities, but the pandemic has been horrifying and there is an extreme pressure on resources. In the meeting, all political parties said in one voice that they were ready to support the state government. Through their respective organisations, they would extend all possible assistance to prevent the virus from spreading, generate awareness on treatment facilities and provide relief to people. The suggestions include giving more momentum to the vaccination programme, increasing registration in the Chief Minister Chiranjeevi Health Insurance Scheme, taking more vigilance to prevent infection in rural areas. Leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said all parties will fulfill their responsibility of constructive cooperation with the state government. He gave suggestions such as supply of medicines to the patients living in home isolation and strengthening the system up to the CHC and PHC level to provide initial relief to the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-appeals-to-all-parties-to-unite-for-human-service/articleshow/82559821.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Four given bail in O2 concentrator ‘fraud’||New Delhi: Merely booking manufacturers or importers under criminal law without a regulatory regime in place will be counter-productive, observed a court on Wednesday while granting bail to four persons, including Matrix Cellular CEO Gaurav Khanna, in a case of alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators in the national capital. Chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said that despite repeated directions by Delhi High Court, the government hadn’t capped the price of essential medical devices. “Nor any regulation has been made by the government for sale of the same by the importers to the government for its equitable distribution to the needy persons for reasons best known to the government,” the bail order stated. Accordingly, bails were granted to Khanna, Gaurav Suri, Satish Sethi and Vikrant, lodged in judicial custody in the case being investigated by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch. For Khanna, senior advocate Trideep Pais and advocate Samudra Sarangi had relied upon a number of invoices demonstrating sale and purchase of the equipment by Matrix Cellular. The order also highlighted that merely booking of the manufacturers or importers without any evidence and only to show that the state is concerned about its citizens in procurement of life-saving devices would be counter-productive. “It shall create further scarcity of already scarce medical devices as it will discourage the manufacturers and importers from pushing their resources” into procuring essential devices for needy people, it added. The court, however, clarified that its observations should not be construed as any sympathy for the black marketers and hoarders. “However, the vacuum in the law needs to be filled up by the legislature or for that matter by the executive by issuing appropriate regulations.” The court said it “is also unable to comprehend as to why the provisions of Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 are not being invoked by the state” if it wanted to stop black marketing. As the investigating officer (IO) of the case referred to a statement of a person who, police claimed, has been cheated by the accused, the judge said, “Even as per the said statement, in my considered opinion, at best a case of breach of contract is made out and no prima facie case for cheating under Section 420 IPC... more so when the allegations are specifically against co-accused Navneet Kalra”. Against all four persons, the court found no prima facie case of criminal conspiracy and cheating. The investigating officer, however, claimed more victims might come forward, prompting the judge to make it clear that “the IO is free to continue the investigation... without being influenced by the aforesaid observations, which only record the opinion of this court at this stage based on the material collected by the IO”. The court noted that the officer had looked for notifications to determine whether oxygen concentrators were essential commodities, meaning Section 3/7 of Essential Commodities Act was invoked in the FIR without the IO being sure about the existence of any such notification. “Once again, such an approach on the part of police to book a person first and to look for the law later on can’t at all be appreciated particularly when it amounts to curtailment of the fundamental right of liberty of a citizen,” the court underlined. The bail plea of Hitesh, a manager of Townhall restaurant, will be decided on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-given-bail-in-o2-concentrator-fraud/articleshow/82587690.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Delhi||Court reserves its order on Kalra’s pre-arrest bail plea||New Delhi: A Delhi sessions court on Wednesday reserved its order on the anticipatory bail plea of businessman Navneet Kalra, who is an accused in a case of hoarding and black-marketing of oxygen concentrators. After hearing arguments of senior advocate Vikas Pahwa and public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, additional sessions judge Sandeep Garg reserved his decision on the matter. Seeking relief for Kalra, Pahwa pointed out that his client had only carried out a legitimate transaction of import. “Customs authorities were activated. Customs was aware of the transaction. The GST is deposited with the government. Invoices are given, returns are filed,” the counsel argued. Pahwa, along with advocate Vineet Malhotra, submitted that all rules had been complied with and the transactions of sale were through banking channels. “Oxygen concentrators are not cosmetic, they are not for luxury. It is only (for use) when someone is medically unfit or someone is dying. When selling it through banking channels where is the offence?” asked Pahwa. Pahwa further argued that there were police officials, judicial officers, politicians, neighbours and friends who had purchased the machines for emergency use not for luxury. The lawyer further pointed out that there was no MRP fixed by the government till date then how could the prosecution assert that the price at which his client was selling the machines was an exorbitant price. “There is no memorandum of understanding or notification. We could not find a single notification, which fixes the price of oxygen concentrators,” Pahwa underscored. The meaning of black-marketing, Pahwa said, was hoarding a particular product for a few days and seeing a crunch, selling the product. “But when I import and then sell it through banking channels where is the question of black-marketing?” he argued. According to Pahwa, Kalra was being made a scapegoat to divert the attention of the people. “It is being deliberately done. A campaign is going on against me (Kalra). The purpose is that the attention of people is diverted from core issues in the society today,” he added. “What they have at the time of arrest are only recoveries and the entire investigation is pending. They thought, first arrest all these people and then investigate. Is this the way the criminal justice system works?” Pahwa asked further. The counsel also argued that if allegations were to be believed, it could only be an immoral act or an offence under consumer protection act but not Section 420 (cheating) IPC. “It is the figment of imagination of Delhi Police,” he added. On the contrary, public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava argued that the Crime Branch had not shared anything with the media. The prosecutor also relied on a lab report to demonstrate that the seized oxygen concentrators were of poor quality with a working capacity of only 20.8%. Police have also alleged that it came to their notice through social media posts that Kalra had collected advance payments from several needy persons for oxygen concentrators but he kept postponing the supply on the pretext that the shipment was held up and kept increasing the price. “Also, that he did not eventually supply the item to several persons, nor refunded their advance amount and is absconding,” it is alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-reserves-its-order-on-kalras-pre-arrest-bail-plea/articleshow/82587798.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Covid meant Metro hurdles had to be met on global video calls’||MUMBAI: The Covid-19 pandemic brought along multiple challenges for the Metro project in the city as countries shut borders, making access to machinery, equipment and human expertise a herculean task. As the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) gears up for trial runs for Metro Lines 2A & 7, TOI speaks to MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev on the difficulties caused by the pandemic. Q: What was the Metro project status when you took over in May 2018?A: The bhoomipujan for the Metro lines had been conducted in 2016 with a 3.5-year timeline set by the government. When I joined, the construction of viaducts had begun for both lines and in March that year MMRDA had issued a request for proposal for rolling stock. The Centre was firm that Indian companies must be given an opportunity to compete for the contract. This meant tweaking tender conditions which the project financiers, Asian Development Bank, were reluctant to revisit. It required several rounds of discussions with ADB, the Union ministry of urban affairs and the PMO. By August 2019 the tender conditions had been reworked and by November 2019 the tender was awarded. BEML, an Indian company, bagged the contract for trains and Alstom for signalling and telecommunication. Q: Has Make in India helped Metro projects?A: BEML is making Metro rakes for the first time. It is important to remember that the crucial components for rakes are not manufactured in India. In this case the propulsion system and air suspension are from Japan, cables and emergency doors from South Korea, traction control and management system from Hitachi Italy, and auto-couplers, brake and helical system from Germany. In case of signalling and telecommunications, the equipment is from France, Czechia, Denmark, Singapore, South Korea, Italy, Finland, Spain and China… By the time the equipment were ready to be shipped to India, Covid had begun disrupting flights as countries closed borders. Personnel and equipment could not be transferred to India. Manufacturing and assembly were hit for nearly a year. Q: Could you cite some of the pandemic-linked difficulties?A: The propulsion system, which is an important component in a train, is from Japan. After Covid struck, Japan is yet to grant permission to its engineers tovisit India. All synchronisation of the propulsion system has been done by video conference in three timezones — India, Japan and Europe. This gave the engineers only a 2-3-hour daily window to resolve complex issues. Also, Mumbai has its own challenges — any infrastructure work on heavy traffic and congested roads would take 5-5.5 years to complete. Metro work is complex and involves work with 17-18 sub-agencies and multiple approvals from the railways and others. It also involves land acquisition for depots and stations, the shifting of high tension lines, diversion of utility lines… Q: What was your biggest challenge?A: One of the biggest challenges was launching steel girders between Dahisar and Mira Road railway stations with a nullah and river on one side and a minor nullah on another. We laid metal plates across tracks for cranes to cross over, shut the minor nullah, laid pipes inside the nullah for water to drain and launched steel girders during the monsoon, saving a couple of months. The pandemic caused major disruptions but we are ready in 5.5 years without any cost overruns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-meant-metro-hurdles-had-to-be-met-on-global-video-calls/articleshow/82559902.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray meets governor to make a pitch for Maratha quota||MUMBAI: Six days after Supreme Court struck down the law to provide reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday called on Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to submit a memorandum urging President Ramnath Kovind to provide for the quota. This was the first meeting between the governor and the CM in a long time; they have been at loggerheads over several issues, the last being the episode where the governor had to get off a state government aircraft after the CM denied him permission to use it. “We have submitted our memorandum to the governor. We expect that he will forward it to the President with favourable remarks. I have written a similar memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and in addition, I will meet him soon. I am sure the Central government will do justice to us,” Thackeray said. He was accompanied by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, state Congress president Nana Patole and cabinet members Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat, Eknath Shinde and Dilip Walse Patil. Significantly, after the brief meeting, Thackeray made an attempt to blame his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis for the manner in which the apex court struck down the legislation. “In my opinion, it was not a foolproof legislation and as a result, it did not withstand scrutiny,” Thackeray said. Fadnavis described the CM’s statement as duplicity, saying that when the law was drafted, the Shiv Sena was a partner in government and now that the state lost the legal battle, the CM is unfortunately blaming him. In his five-page letter to PM Modi, Thackeray has stated that in view of the SC order, it is the President of India and the government of India alone which can identify and notify the Maratha community as socially and educationally backward, enabling it to enjoy reservation. “I earnestly request you that appropriate steps be taken, albeit in accordance with law, declared by the Supreme Court to identify and declare Maratha community as SEBC to enable them to claim the reservation in education and public employment at least to the extent of 12 per cent and 13 per cent respectively,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-meets-guv-to-make-a-pitch-for-maratha-quota/articleshow/82559898.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Videograph Eid fete in Old City, Telangana HC tells police||HYDERABAD: Questioning the Hyderabad police for allowing crowding at Charminar and other Old City areas during the ongoing Ramzan month, the Telangana high court has asked police to videograph the celebrations on Eid-ul-Fitr day and furnish them to the court. The court took note of the media coverage that highlighted violations of social distancing, not wearing mask and other Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the Old City areas. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy initially sought a joint action report from three police commissioners of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda along with GHMC commissioner, but later did not insist on it following the decision of the state government to impose a 10-day lockdown in the state starting from May 12. “No matter which religious function it is, people of all religions must now realise that this is not time to indulge in congregations,” the judges said. The bench came down heavily on the statements made by public health director Dr G Srinivasa Rao who contended in the previous hearing that the government is ready to conduct RT-PCR tests but the people are hesitant. “The health director said that the government will do one lakh tests per day, but now they are reduced to 55,000 tests per day. We are witnessing serpentine queues for tests,” it said. Expressing concern over the fleecing methods of private hospitals, the bench wanted the health authorities to bring all these hospitals under the purview of the Essential Commodities Act to control the fees there. Responding to a request from advocate general BS Prasad who wanted the bench to direct the central government to supply 600 metric tonnes of oxygen to the state daily, the bench wondered whether this pathetic situation was a result of the rosy picture painted by the public health director. “Your daily bulletins want us to believe that there are fewer cases in Telangana and things are better here. Then naturally, the Centre will give oxygen to those states that are saddled with more cases,” the bench said. “These rosy pictures he is painting are actually harming the state,” the bench said. The bench asked T Surya Karan Reddy, additional solicitor general, as to why there is a shortfall in the supply of oxygen to Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/videograph-eid-fete-in-old-city-hc-tells-police/articleshow/82559865.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Harassed woman asked to lodge FIR||PATNA/BHAGALPUR: Ruchi Raushan, 33, will lodge an FIR against those who sexually harassed her during her husband’s treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Bhagalpur and later in Patna. Her husband Raushan Chandra Das died on May 8 in a city hospital due to alleged negligence of doctors and staff at the two hospitals. Bhagalpur police on Tuesday arrested Jyoti Kumar, the staff of the private hospital, who was accused of sexually harassing the woman. Earlier, the hospital manager said he had been suspended and a hospital probe team was also looking into the allegations. Ruchi, whose video went viral on social media on Monday, told TOI over phone on Tuesday that she will lodge an FIR after reaching Noida on Wednesday. Her husband was a software engineer in Noida, where the family stayed before coming to Bhagalpur on Holi. “I pray to God that no woman passes through the ordeal which I went through,” said Ruchi, alleging how a compounder of a private hospital in Bhagalpur pulled her dupatta and touched her waist inappropriately when she requested for medical help to her husband. “My husband could do nothing. I could see his eyes bulging out of anger and he started sweating. My mother, who was on the other bed, also started shouting and I could do nothing as my husband and mother were undergoing treatment there,” she said. Ruchi said she shifted Raushan to JLNMCH for better treatment, but alleged that neither doctors nor nurses visited the Covid ward and how her husband was left with the mask on his face without connecting it with the cylinder pipe. On her husband’s request, Ruchi said she brought him to a private hospital in Patna where, too, the hospital staff intentionally stopped the oxygen supply in order to force the attendants to purchase oxygen cylinders on black market. The woman, who had come to her mother’s place at Kahalgaon after many years on Holi had never imagined that her husband will leave her forever, just 12 days before their anniversary. Calling him Babu, Ruchi said he would have survived had he been given proper treatment. Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Gudia said the three-member team comprising City SP Puran Jha, ASDM Anu Kumari and Bhagalpur Mahila Thana SHO Ritu Kumari for probing the alleged molestation and negligence in the treatment of her husband contacted the victim over phone and asked her to lodge a written FIR at Patna itself. “I have talked to the Patna SSP over phone regarding the issue,” she said, adding that they were also screening the CCTV footage of the private hospital. Meanwhile, RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari lashed out at CM Nitish Kumar and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi, asking them to get an FIR lodged on the basis of the video and get the matter investigated by a special team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/harassed-woman-asked-to-lodge-fir/articleshow/82557429.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Giving a surprise to some 15-20 odd elderly women who felt lonely and depressed during Covid treatment, the doctors on duty donned the role of their children and got them a sugar-free cake to celebrate ‘Happy Mothers’ Day’ with them on May 9. Dr Manoj Sehray from the anesthesia department who was present on duty with his wife Dr Shweta Poonia and Dr Vikas Sehray, Dr Neeraj Bharti, said, “It was Mother’s Day and there were many aged women in the ICU.” He said that many of them had got tired of the critical situation and they were losing hope as they could not meet their loved ones in the ICU. “We bought them a cake as their own children would have done. That’s why, we did not mention ‘Doctor’ before our names on the cake. We had a hearty talk to them about how their family members were waiting for them. To cheer them up, we got them talk to their family members over the phone,” he said. Dr Manoj said their motive was to induce new hope and desire to fight the disease with more courage and return home as healthy individuals. Another doctor said they had a satisfactory feeling seeing the illuminated faces of elderly women who were missing their homes and family members badly. Doctors said the lives of Covid patients matter to them too as they too get sleepless nights for days if they lose any patient during treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mothers-day-in-icu-for-elderly-women/articleshow/82559914.cms||Sat Singh

Ravi Chaudhary, a carpenter living in Jahangirpura, went to spend some special time at his lover, Bharti Bhojak’s house in Adajan when suddenly her husband Kamal returned home soon for lunch. Neither Chaudhary nor Bhojak had anticipated that on Monday afternoon and were in a shock thinking they will caught in the act. Fearing consequences, Bharti did not open the door immediately when Kamal knocked and was desparately seeking a place for Chaudhary to hide. But as the house had just one room and a balcony, there was no place to hide the secret affair, Chaudhary decided to jump off the balcony as it was only three floors. The scared woman also did not attempt to stop him. When she opened the door for her husband, her paramour jumped off thinking that he would sustain minor injuries only, a serious miscalculation that cost him his life. He fell on the concrete floor and sustained injuries to his head. Meanwhile, residents of the housing facility, who were witness to the drama, were shocked after Chaudhary failed to move. They called up 108 ambulance, but the paramedical staff declared him dead and informed the police. “The deceased was confident that he will survive the fall, but he misjudged while jumping and fell on his head,” said a police official. A case of accidental death was registered at Adajan police station on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/30-yr-old-man-jumps-off-3rd-floor-from-paramours-house-dies/articleshow/82558143.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar government to hire 2,580 MBBS graduates in rural areas||PATNA: The state cabinet cleared 13 government proposals including, the compulsory appointment of new MBBS graduates from nine government medical colleges in rural areas on contractual terms. The proposal moved by the state health department plans to create 2,580 posts for the compulsory deployment of the new MBBS graduates. The cabinet also cleared another major health department proposal to release Rs 1,000 crore to support the free vaccination programme against Covid-19 run by the state government. Further, the cabinet sanctioned an education department proposal to utilise Rs 5,500 crore from the state’s share to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), as the Centre's share is yet to come. The cabinet also sanctioned the release of Rs 1,716 crore from its share to make the payment to around 2.75 lakh teachers engaged under the SSA. The cabinet sanctioned the government’s proposal to allocate Rs 9,999 crore among local urban bodies per their population and area. Overall, the state government has received Rs 1,590 crore from the Centre for expenditure in cities with more than 10 lakh population under the Million Plus Challenge Fund (MPCF) scheme. Another chunk of Rs 8,309 crore has been received under the non-MPCF scheme. Further, the cabinet also cleared the government’s proposal to assist Rs 592.40 crore to the urban local bodies in expectation of the fund allotment recommended by the sixth state finance commission. The cabinet sanctioned an expected expenditure of Rs 117 crore for the free distribution of food grain among the ration card holding families, and under the Antyodaya scheme for May. The distribution will be done through PDS shops under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana. Later, state education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary thanked chief minister Nitish Kumar for expediting the release of Rs 1,716 crore through the state cabinet for payment of salaries to more than 2.75 lakh teachers of the state. Chaudhary pointed out that teachers working under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan are paid from grants released both by the central and state governments. But owing to the non-receipt of the matching share from the Centre during the second wave of the Covid pandemic, the teachers were not getting their salaries. The CM has taken note of the problems faced by teachers due to non-payment of their salaries and ordered has the release of the necessary funds from the Consolidated Fund of the state government. Consequently, teachers would now get immediate payment of arrears of their salaries for two months. It would be ensured that the payment is made before Eid. The minister said the government is sensitive to the problems of teachers and, they must also remain sensitive to the problems of students and extend their whole-hearted support in improving the quality of education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-to-hire-2580-mbbs-graduates-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82557501.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No relief for 70-year-old head monk accused of molestation||MUMBAI: A sessions court recently refused to grant relief to 70-year-old religious head, who was convicted and sentenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment (RI) for molesting a 19-year-old woman seeking spiritual remedy for severe anxiety in 2012.  The woman was suffering from anxiety due to her impending exams and the accused had molested her under the pretext of performing certain rituals. In 2017, a magistrate court found him guilty, after which he moved an appeal before the sessions court. The accused was also fined Rs 50,000. Upholding the lower court’s ruling, in a judgement copy made available on Monday, the sessions court said that “the miserable acts of the accused were diagonally in contrast to the great and respected philosophy and religious principles”. The accused had argued that following his conviction, the magistrate court did not give him the benefit of letting him off on a bond of good behaviour. Refuting this argument, the sessions court said, “The accused indulged in outraging the modesty of a college-going woman that too at the temple with which sentiments of many were attached. He himself was a head monk, who as noticed earlier was expected to abstain himself from sensual pleasures, sexual continence, etc.” The court further held that the accused indulged in “heinous crime of moral turpitude.” The court directed the accused to surrender before the magistrate court to undergo the sentence. The accused has the option of now filing an appeal before the Bombay high court. It was the prosecution’s case that on April 6, 2012, the woman and her family went to the temple. For the purported ritual, the accused took the woman to a room and closed the door. It was alleged that the accused closed all windows of the room and directed the woman to unfasten three buttons of her shirt. He then molested her. It was further alleged that when the woman pushed him and protested, the accused claimed that ‘ he was sucking her heat ’. After the accused made further advances, threatened to kill her and the woman subsequently managed to leave the room, she narrated the incident to her family. A fight ensued between the accused and the woman’s family. Cops arrived there and the accused was later booked in the case. The accused in his appeal denied the allegations. The woman had deposed in court and during the cross examination, she said that she had not sought psychological treatment for her anxiety. However, the court pointed out that the woman’s father had said that they had gone to the accused for the remedy as they worshiped him like he was god. “Thus, this entire evidence in fact reveals the deep faith of the informant (woman) and her father in the accused and it corroborates the prosecution,” the court said.

A government spokesperson said that 632 metric tonnes oxygen was supplied to refillers while 301 metric tonnes of lifesaving gas was provided to hospitals. “Availability of oxygen has improved in Varanasi, Lucknow, Prayagraj and Kanpur. On Tuesday, a train carrying eight tankers reached the state while Jeevanrakshak Express with 10 tankers was parked in Lucknow,” the spokesperson said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that oxygen should be distributed as per the needs of various districts. Other than Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Moradabad, special attention also needs to be given to districts with high infection rates and an action plan should be prepared for all districts on the basis of which oxygen would be distributed to them. The CM said there was the need to improve oxygen supply to patients in home isolation. “All districts must have a smooth supply of oxygen for home isolation patients,” he said. “In view of the report of oxygen audit, a balance in supply and distribution of oxygen should be made,” said additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal, adding that due to the audit, consumption of oxygen had reduced in some oxygen as wastage had been curbed. To increase availability of tankers, the government has also issued global tender for cryogenic tankers. Tankers are also being provided by the Centre and Reliance Industries. Chief secretary RK Tiwari has been directed to continuously monitor the setting up of oxygen plants. The sugarcane and excise departments have also been giving support in oxygen production and supply and work is on to set up at least one oxygen plant in all districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hosps-refill-units-receive-1011-mt-o2-cm-for-swift-supply-to-homes/articleshow/82562076.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Medical faculty members to resume protest||AHMEDABAD: Faculty members of medical colleges have decided to resume their protest and go on a hunger strike from Wednesday to press the government for their demands. Faculty members of six government colleges and eight GMERS colleges, who had called off their protest last week after getting a positive response from the state government, are of the view that they have been duped. Some members of GMERS doctors even held a token protest on Tuesday at Sola Civil Hospital. “We decided to call off our strike last week after a senior minister assured us of a positive response. But there seem to be some differences within the government as a result of which our demands have been rejected. Hence, we have decided to go on a hunger strike. We will also decide the further course of action on Wednesday,” said a faculty member involved in the matter. Many even held the opinion that the protests should continue till there was a written order by the government accepting all their demands. The Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) which represents about 1,700 professors and lecturers of six government medical colleges had held a strike recently to press for their demands, including a higher non-practising allowance in line with the 7th Pay Commission. Another demand was regarding abolition of contractual appointments. About 700 teachers of GMERS colleges also took part in the strike. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. GMTA had also demanded that medical college teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service. Citing a government resolution of 2017, GMTA also sought an increase in the cap on maximum monthly salary. Promotions of faculty members at GMERS colleges have been pending for many faculty members for a long time, too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-faculty-members-to-resume-protest/articleshow/82559945.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai to have O2 parlours, big cars will be used as ambulances||CHENNAI: As Chennai continues to remain a hotspot with nearly 7,000 fresh Covid-19 cases being reported every day, the Greater Chennai Corporation has decided to tweak its testing protocol for better triaging of patients, launch ‘oxygen parlours’ to support those with breathing difficulty, and use big cars as ambulances. Henceforth, all patients undergoing RTPCR test with symptoms such as fever, flu, loose stools, loss of smell and taste, and body pain will be given a medicine kit immediately without waiting for the result. This is to ensure that the patient isn’t left unattended till the arrival of the result and to avoid delaying treatment for those who may get a false negative. “Thirty-thousand such kits are already ready,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, GCC commissioner. For positive patients, their RTPCR test report will not be given to them. GCC zonal doctors will intimate the patients about the result. They will check the patient’s blood pressure, oxygen saturation and respiration rate. Based on this, medical advice on home isolation, admission to a covid care centre (CCC), or hospital will be provided. “This is to ensure that positive patients don’t travel and transmit it to others,” Bedi said. Only patients above 60 years of age will be asked to visit triaging centres in various parts of the city. As many patients face breathing difficulty, the civic body has planned to set up oxygen parlours across the city. As a first step, three parlours will come up in three regions of the city. These will be 100-bedded facilities with oxygen concentrators. About 2,700 concentrators have already been ordered, Bedi said. The facility will be used for patients whose saturation is around 90-92 but still need oxygen support, an official said. To provide medical advice to patients on home isolation, GCC will start telecounselling centres in every zone, employing final-year MBBS students. More doctors are also being hired to ramp up such infrastructure. To augment its ambulance fleet, GCC has planned to use big cars as ambulances and ensure that regular vans are used for serious patients. The covid care centre (CCC) at Chennai Trade Centre, which has 360 oxygen beds, has already started admitting patients, Bedi said. “More such O2 beds are being created in Communicable Diseases Hospital (CDH) and other places,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/all-symptomatic-patients-will-get-drug-kit-city-to-have-o2-parlours/articleshow/82559882.cms||Komal Gautham

The government had already released Rs 600 cr from the MLA local area development funds to finance the drive for the 18-44 age group. Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, PCC president and education minister Govid Singh Dotasra, deputy chief whip Mahendra Chaudhary, independent MLA Sanyam Lodha are among the MLAs who announced their decision to contribute a month's salary towards vaccination.
