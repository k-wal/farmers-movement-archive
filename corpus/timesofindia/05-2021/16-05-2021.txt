A total of 122 people arrived in England from Mumbai and Delhi airports between March 29 and May 2 infected with the "Indian" variant of Covid-19, known as B1.617.2, according to the latest Public Health England (PHE) technical report. The technical briefing, dated May 13, shows that between the same dates there were a total of 128 cases of this variant of concern, which was first detected in India, found in England amongst people "with known recent travel history to India". B1.617.2 was first detected in Britain in tests carried out on travellers arriving from India on the week commencing March 29. From March 29 up to and including the week commencing 19 April, 91 travellers infected with it entered England from Mumbai and Delhi. B1.617.2 is believed to be behind the massive rise in cases in India. By mid-April India was recording 200,000 cases per day and by the end of April the death toll in India surpassed 200,000. Yet India was not added to the UK’s red list until April 23. Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the UK red list on April 9. The UK has seen the number of cases of this variant of concern almost triple in the past week to 1,313 from 520 the week before. As of May 12 there have been four deaths from the variant in England, spurring UK PM Boris Johnson to warn that its spread could derail England’s goal to end its current lockdown on June 21. Between March 29 and May 2 a total of 69 people landed in England from Mumbai and 53 from Delhi who were infected with B1.617.2. In the week commencing 19 April, 30 infected travellers arrived in England from Mumbai and 14 from Delhi. In the week commencing 12 April, 16 infected travellers arrived in England from Mumbai and 10 from Delhi. At this time arrivals only needed to isolate at home for 10 days and take two tests, plus have a negative test prior to departure. Now, since India is on the red list, only those with British residency rights may enter from India and they have to go into a government-approved quarantine hotel. SAGE, the scientific body advising the UK government, in the minutes of its latest meeting, said that "it is highly likely that this variant is more transmissible than B.1.1.7 and it is a realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible". Chief medical officer for England Chris Whitty said the vaccine was still considered to be effective at preventing against severe diseases and death against this Indian variant but he was not sure if it would prevent mild illness and transmission. "We expect over time this variant will come to dominate the UK in the same way the UK variant did," he said. The majority of cases of the Indian variant are in London and the northwest. The army has been sent to hotspots such as Bolton and Blackburn to help with mass testing of residents where mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door PCR testing is being offered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/nearly-100-people-carrying-indian-strain-of-covid-19-arrived-in-england-from-india-before-india-was-added-to-uks-red-list/articleshow/82667356.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The brainchild of Reasi SSP Shailender Singh, the ambulance service will help the civil administration reach the remotest pockets of the district to ensure 100 percent inoculation. “A total of 16 troop carrier vehicles have been modified into police vaccination ambulances to supplement the health department and act as a force multiplier in the ongoing vaccination drive in the remote areas of Reasi district,” a police spokesperson said. The SSP has nominated an ASP as a nodal officer, while one DSP has been entrusted to coordinate the fleet of ambulances with the officers of the health department. “Besides the fleet of 16 vehicles, over 500 police personnel along with 5,774 Villager Defence Committee (VDC) members are already engaged in an awareness drive in the vaccination campaign throughout the district,” the spokesperson said. In addition, 131 police personnel are also deployed with the district administration for house-to-house mopping of Covid-19 positive cases by the composite teams of the health and the civil administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/troop-carrier-vehicles-to-be-used-as-vaccination-ambulances-in-jks-reasi-dist/articleshow/82667484.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

He emphasised the need for a regional peace initiative and a bigger role by Europe to "get Islamabad on board". "It is first and foremost a matter of getting Pakistan on board," Ghani said in an interview with Germany's Der Spiegel on Friday. "The US now plays only a minor role." About Pakistan's influence on the Taliban, the Afghan President said the neighbouring country operates an organised system of support. "The Taliban receives logistics in Pakistan, their finances are there and recruitment is there," he said. "The names of the various decision-making bodies of the Taliban are Quetta Shura, Miramshah Shura and Peshawar Shura (named after the Pakistani cities where they are located). There is a deep relationship with the state." According to Ghani, the European countries, especially Germany, "can do a lot" in the peace process with the Taliban. "Clear messages and incentives from Germany will help – and, conversely, they should introduce sanctions if the decision goes in a different direction than hoped," he said. "As Europeans, you should not see yourself as observers; you are a direct part of these events." Ghani described a future security agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan as the key to peace. He hastened to add that his goal was the neutrality of Afghanistan. "We don’t want a new protecting power, and we don’t want to be part of regional or international rivalries." The Afghan President said that peace would primarily be decided upon regionally and that "we are at a crucial moment of rethinking". Ghani’s remarks came a day after he met the Pakistani army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa in Kabul. He said Bajwa assured him "that the restoration of the Emirate or dictatorship by the Taliban was not in anybody’s interest in the region, especially Pakistan". The Afghan President said that Gen Bajwa also apprised him that some of the lower levels of the Pakistani military hierarchy still hold the opposite opinion in certain cases. President Ghani said that in any case, "Western diplomacy should stop coddling" the Taliban. He said the Taliban created the environment for all recent attacks, including the one on a Kabul school, and that the outfit hadn't yet cut its ties with al-Qaeda. Ghani expressed concern about the possibility of a civil war in the country as a result of the full withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, but reiterated that "it doesn’t have to come to that".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/after-us-exit-afghan-prez-wants-pak-on-board-to-avoid-civil-war/articleshow/82667526.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Get Bharat Biotech to share vaccine manufacturing tech with other WHO prequalified pharma cos: Ghulam Nabi Azad||NEW DELHI: Following in the footsteps of a string of Congress leaders including former PM Manmohan Singh, party president Sonia Gandhi and MP Rahul Gandhi, former Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday wrote to PM Modi and Health minister Harsh Vardhan with suggestions to ramp up vaccine manufacture in the country. All letters to the PM by opposition leaders have remained unanswered so far. Continuing with Congress called was its “opposition Raj Dharma” – to offer constructive suggestions – Azad, in his letter, sought the government’s push to ensure that Bharat Biotech shares the manufacturing technology for Covaxin with all WHO-accredited, prequalified pharma companies in India so that vaccine production can be ramped up. Pointing to 21 major vaccine manufacturing pharma companies with manufacturing capabilities in line with the bio-safety norms needed for vaccine production, the former Union health minister said 7 companies, including Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, are WHO pre-qualified. “I believe the Department of Biotechnology and ICMR have supported the development of the vaccine now being produced by Bharat Biotech…It may be worthwhile to have them share the technology with, if not all, the remaining WHO pre-qualified pharmaceutical companies. This will immediately increase the production of Covaxin manifold thereby instantly improving vaccination coverage,” Azad said. Azad also said government should consider re-hiring retired nursing and pharma staff for six months to a year on payment of last-drawn pay minus pension to accelerate India’s vaccination drive. Inaddition Azad also forwarded suggestions on equitable distribution of oxygen to states, and said government should MSMEs to manufacture pre-fabricated beds for hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/get-bharat-biotech-to-share-vaccine-manufacturing-tech-with-other-who-prequalified-pharma-cos-ghulam-nabi-azad/articleshow/82667804.cms||Swati Mathur
---||India||Oxygen crisis continues at Goa Medical College, 8 more dead||PANAJI: The dark hour between 2am and 6am claimed eight more lives on Saturday due to oxygen fluctuations at Goa Medical College, taking the toll of Covid patients dead due to the oxygen crisis at the premier government hospital to 83 during the past five days. While the GMC doctors were reluctant to directly attribute the deaths to an erratic oxygen supply, nurses, relatives of patients and volunteers confirmed to TOI that transitory dips in oxygen were noticed throughout the night. “We cannot directly say that this is the reason (interruption in oxygen supply) why they died. Most of the patients die because of Covid pneumonia and oxygen is an important part of the treatment,” said GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar. A log of dips in the central oxygen pipeline maintained by GMC showed that 13 wards reported a drop in oxygen supply, with the longest drop being recorded in ward 143 for a duration of 90 minutes. However, the availability of oxygen cylinders helped prevent a higher number of casualties, said medical staff. Among the few who did not make it through the night was a 53-year-old man, the sole breadwinner of the family, who lost his life around 2:50am. “I got a call around 1:30am saying that the oxygen saturation was dropping and was at 60%. At that point I lost hope,” said a family friend. “At 4am, my aunt died due to Covid at GMC. The previous night (Friday) something went wrong with the oxygen,” said another individual, who also lost his cousin a few days earlier. Bandekar said all critically ill Covid patients are referred to GMC and 160 of them are hooked on to ventilators. “But how to prove that interruptions have caused those deaths?” he said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the dip in oxygen supply could not be correlated with deaths. But on Tuesday, Rane himself had said as many as 26 patients had died due to oxygen shortage at GMC. He had said many more patients had died earlier too, and the high court should conduct a probe to find out why it was happening. The daily medical bulletin on Saturday said 58 Covid patients lost their lives over the past 24 hours with 33 of the deaths occurring at GMC itself. The deaths also took Goa’s Covid fatality count across the 2,000-mark, with doctors saying that this may still not be the peak of the second wave for Goa. Goa’s positivity rate, which remains the highest among states in the country at 42%, only serves to back up the fears of the doctors. The Union territory of Puducherry, at 42.3%, is just a sliver above Goa. After a strong rebuke from the Goa bench of the Bombay high court, the state government appears to have finally grasped the severity of the situation and has rushed through the installation of a 23,000-litre liquid medical oxygen plant, which has been pushed into trial runs within 48 hours of work commencing. On Wednesday, hearing a slew of PILs on Covid management and oxygen crisis, a bench of Justices Mahesh Sonak and Nitin Sambre had directed the state government to ensure that no more lives were lost due to the oxygen crisis. Goa Forward Party, which is one of the petitioners before the high court, also continued to keep the pressure on the BJP government. “Midnight murders continue. Another eight Goans have lost their lives leaving Goa broken and in despair. This serial killing of Goans has to stop. The government of Goa and chief minister Pramod Sawant must answer for this disaster,” said GFP president Vijai Sardesai. “The opposition can make tall claims, but I appeal to them to tell us if they have any suggestions to deal with the situation. This is not a simple situation to deal with,” said Rane. To try and reduce the load on GMC, health authorities have shifted 350 Covid-19 patients to the super speciality block, which has an independent medical oxygen plant. GMC relies on a tractor trolley system for oxygen replenishment, which is slow and cumbersome. Doctors said that the transitory dips in oxygen are because of the switch-over of the tractor trolleys. “I called around 3am and the on-duty ward staff said the non-invasive ventilators were beeping to show that the oxygen supply was dropping. However, they said they have backup cylinders and there were police personnel who would escalate the issue to authorities if the number of backup cylinders was below three. It wasn’t as bad as the earlier days,” said Conrad Barreto, one of the volunteers who have been helping out during the pandemic. A reduction to single digits in the number of Covid-19 deaths in the dark hour offered a silver lining for the state. At 3,512, recoveries outnumbered fresh cases and offered doctors and stakeholders some respite. The government officials said that the “statewide curfew” may be starting to show results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-crisis-continues-at-gmc-8-more-dead/articleshow/82668453.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||Delhi: People turned away as 12-week rule for Covishield dose kicks in||NEW DELHI: Two days after the Centre approved extending the gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks, many people in the 45+ age group who had booked their second dose on the CoWin portal got a rude shock. They were turned away from vaccination centres across the city on Saturday. They had no inkling of the change and the CoWin portal didn’t in any way reflect it. Arguments broke out at the vaccination centres with people who had completed 42-56 days after the first dose claiming they had not received any message or mail and should be allowed the second dose. The civil defence volunteers and other officials had a hard time convincing them that they had to go back. Dilpreet Kaur, a 65-year-old resident of Lajpat Nagar, whose daughter in the US had booked a slot for her, was quite distressed that she would now have to wait for almost a month for the second dose. She said senior citizens, especially those like her who stay alone, should have been allowed to take their second shot. The change has been brought about following a recommendation by the Covid Working Group, chaired by Dr N K Arora, which had been accepted by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19. It is based on the experience of the United Kingdom. Ambiguity over whether this was only an advisory ended when people turned up at the vaccination centres on Saturday morning. They were told that they would get the second dose only after they completed at least 12 weeks (84 days). The orders from the central government seemed to have travelled to the Delhi government with lightning speed, bypassing the CoWin portal. It showed no change in the status of people, including many elderly citizens, who had found a slot with great difficulty, travelled some distance and stood in queue. The Delhi government has been asked by the Centre to ensure that the second dose of Covishield is given at an interval of 12 to 16 weeks. This has been conveyed in a letter written to the chief secretary of all states and Union territories by the secretary, ministry of health & family welfare, Rajesh Bhushan. An immunisation officer in Delhi said officials and vaccinators have been asked to ensure adherence to the revised dosing interval. Civil defence officer Pratham Raj, posted at a Defence Colony vaccination centre, told TOI around noon that they had received the new guidelines in the morning and had since then with great difficulty turned away almost 50 senior citizens. School teacher Sonia Monga on duty at the centre said many complained of not receiving any prior intimation and insisted on being administered the second dose. Monga, whose job is to key in the data and issue certificates to those who are vaccinated, said they tried their best to explain to people that the website was no longer accepting entries for the second dose below 84 days. However, for those who had booked a slot, the booking was still very much there. The ensuing confusion caused delays and long queues. Businessman Manoj Sinha said this was his third day in a row at the centre. His wife explained that on the past two days, the centre had run out of vaccines and now they were being told that the guidelines have changed. "Getting a vaccination slot on CoWin is next to impossible. When we finally managed a slot for the second dose, we are being turned away. We should have at least received a message. So many senior citizens have risked driving to a vaccination centre during the pandemic and this could have been easily avoided," said Sinha. Across the city, at the state government-run Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital in north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar, retired defence scientist Manabendra Nath Sen, 81, and his wife, Sikha Sen, 74, had landed up for their second dose of Covishield which they had booked a week in advance. "We had taken the first shot on March 24. A seven-week gap between doses seemed like a good idea to enable us to stay immune for a reasonably long time, going by what we had read," said Sikha. Before setting out, they had rechecked on the CoWin portal. It showed the appointment. However, at the hospital, they were told they could get the second shot only after three months from the date of the first dose. "Now, my parents will have to wait till June 25 to become fully vaccinated. That's a long time. The least the government could have done was to send us a text message alerting us about the cancellation. The portal continued to show that the appointment was on even after we were turned back," said the couple's daughter, Jhilli Sen. Jhilli herself had taken the first jab of Covishield on April 1. Till Saturday night, the CoWin portal showed that her second shot was due from May 13 onwards. According to the revised rules, she would be eligible for the shot only after July 1. However, for those given the first dose on Saturday, the CoWin portal clearly indicated that the second dose could be given only after 84 days. The CEO, National Health Authority, R S Sharma told TOI that the change will get reflected on the CoWin portal from Saturday night. "Our advice to the states is that further on-site and online appointments will be with the new minimum period of 84 days. Those who have already booked an appointment for the second dose and the interval is less than 84 days will also be advised to book again. However, if they insist, they will be vaccinated," said Sharma. That assurance will need to be put to test now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-people-turned-away-as-12-week-rule-for-covishield-dose-kicks-in/articleshow/82669204.cms||Alok K N Mishra

The 7-day average of daily cases has fallen for 7 days in a row, the positivity rate over the past week has dipped below 20% and active cases have decreased by more than 1.5 lakh during this period. Deaths may stay high for some more time, although average daily fatalities have dipped in the last two days. The daily toll crossed 4,000 again on Saturday. Coronavirus: Live updatesIndia’s test positivity rate drops to 19.5%However, other indicators are looking positive although these may still not be accurately reflecting the massive Covid crisis in India’s rural landscape because of low testing numbers there. The seven-day rolling average of daily cases, a reliable pointer to the direction of the wave, has dropped by nearly 50,000, from 3.91 lakh on May 8 to 3.54 lakh on Saturday. In another welcome change, the national test positivity rate (TPR) has dipped over the last seven days. The TPR on May 8-14 was 19.5% as against 22.4% in the previous seven days, indicating a lowering of the infection rate. Detected cases fell even as number of tests increased over these seven days.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Taken together, these three parameters seem to tell a story of consistently decreasing infections in India over the past week. Numbers from the states bear this out. In the last seven days (May 8-14), as many as 22 states and Union territories out of 36 recorded a decrease in new cases as compared with the previous seven days. Of these, significant dips of more than 10% were seen in 12 states and UTs. Delhi led the way with a fall of 39% in fresh cases over the previous seven days, followed by Chhattisgarh (-31%), Uttar Pradesh (-29%), Bihar (-27%), Maharashtra (-21%), Madhya Pradesh (-21%) and Jharkhand (-20%).  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); At the same time, cases continued to surge in several states such as Tamil Nadu, which saw a 32% spike in fresh cases, Himachal Pradesh (30%), Assam (20%), Bengal (12%), Odisha (12%) and Punjab (11%). The pandemic was also on the rampage across the northeast with Tripura registering a 64% surge in cases, Meghalaya 57%, Manipur 45% and Nagaland 17%. The UT of Puducherry saw a 29% rise in cases during May 8-14. The Covid situation in rural India continues to be worrisome as lower testing may mean a high number of cases going undetected. The high death numbers will be a source of concern as well. In the first15 days of May, 58,540 deaths have been recorded in the country. That's 10,000 more than the deaths seen in entire month of April, which had recorded the previous highest monthly toll of 48,768.

Instead of the groom going to fetch the bride and then returning, which would have caused people — baratis — moving out twice, the brides came to their new home with less than five persons, wed the grooms and stayed put in the village. Tradition? Well, it had to be tweaked a bit keeping in mind the current crisis. Swala village, some 30km from Champawat town, with a population of around 350 people, was declared a containment zone on May 11 after almost 50 people tested Covid-19 positive. The villagers were not permitted to step out. However, two weddings, which had already been fixed, were allowed to be solemnised. Priyanka Binwal of Punabe village was to marry Prakash Bhatt of Swala on May 12. It was then quickly decided that the bride would go to the groom’s village and the matter would rest there. After getting the go-ahead from a district administration official, Binwal left for Swala with her father, mother and a priest. Together with the driver, a total of five people reached Swala. The small group was dressed for the occasion, their PPE kits slung over their fine clothes. Binwal stayed back, the four others returned to Punabe and into quarantine. A second wedding was solemnised on Friday in a similar manner. Ishwar Datt of Swala village was to wed Preeti Bhatt of Srinagar village, Lohaghat. After taking permission from the administration, Bhatt and her parents reached Swala and with the help of just a local priest concluded the ceremony. There was no fuss. Her parents are now in home isolation in their native village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-one-way-wedding-in-uttarakhand-red-zone-brides-come-to-wed-grooms/articleshow/82670092.cms||Prem Punetha

---||India||Overall Covid-19 situation stabilising, rate of decline in cases faster than in first wave: Centre||NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday said the rate of the current decline of Covid-19 cases is faster than was the case in the first wave, while the overall Covid-19 situation is stabilising, even as it cautioned against any laxity in containment measures and Covid-appropriate behavior. The health ministry said active cases in India have been declining while the number of recovered patients has increased. On Friday, the total active caseload stood at 36.73 lakh cases with a net decline of 31,091 cases from the previous day. Around 3.26 lakh new cases were recorded on Friday. The mixed nature of the Covid scene can, however, be gauged by the fact that despite a marginal decline in overall positivity rate to 19.8% this week, 316 districts still have an increasing trend in case positivity. The ministry's optimism is based on the number of high burden states with over one lakh cases coming down to 11 from 12 earlier this week as the active cases in Haryana dropped to below this threshold. Besides, many of the high burden states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh are also showing a steady decline in new cases. “Overall Covid situation is stabilising to an extent. In some states it is a clear pattern, in some there is still concern and some states are even showing increase in cases. We have a mixed picture in front of us but overall the situation is stabilising. We hope and we will work towards ensuring further stabilisation,” NITI Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. At the same time, there was less welcome news with Covid-19 infections now reaching tier two and three cities requiring an urgent focus on smaller urban and rurban centres and Covid management measures for rural India. “The country has managed it to a large extent, cases recovered and very fortunately the case fatality rate has been stable,” Dr Paul said, underlining measures to building testing and hospital bed infrastructure during the first phase of the pandemic. However, as the experience of most states and all big cities has shown, the infrastructure upgrade the Centre spoke was tested and found inadquate in responding to the surge of Covid patients requiring oxygen support and ICU beds. The urgent measures to commission and transport Oxygen were underlined by thousands of pleas for assistance on social media. “Much more can be done, should be done and will be done,” Dr Paul admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/overall-covid-19-situation-stabilising-rate-of-decline-in-cases-faster-than-in-first-wave-centre/articleshow/82670758.cms||Sushmi Dey

Currently, recipients are monitored for AEFI for the first 72 hours after receiving a jab. Dr NK Arora, member of the national AEFI Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee, said with more vaccines set to enter the market, monitoring for side-effects should be enhanced. He said that all AEFI data will soon be up on a public portal, a move many health experts have been calling for.

Currently, recipients are monitored for AEFI for the first 72 hours after receiving a jab.Dr Arora said out of seven crore vaccine recipients assessed so far, less than 0.5% cases have involved serious AEFIs. “We have submitted detailed analyses to the government. The data should be out soon,” he said. He said that longer monitoring durations is essential and has been the norm in many countries. “All states should now direct local authorities to develop a mechanism that will allow recipients to report side-effects for 28 days. This system should record such events — from public and private facilities — and update them on the CoWIN website,” he said. Many health experts have called for the release of AEFI data.

All knew, doctors were sounding caution, but all became somewhat complacent, leading to emergence of the crisis,” Bhagwat said. He was delivering the valedictory address at the “Positivity Unlimited” lecture series organised by Covid Response Team (CRT), an initiative of civil society with multiple stakeholders, including religious, spiritual, business, philanthropic and social organisations, to boost public morale. The Centre has denied that it took its eye off the risk of the infections rising again, and has, among other things, referred to PM Narendra Modi's warning to chief ministers at a virtual interaction he had with them on March 17. The RSS chief referred to the warning of a third wave and said people could defeat the challenge by taking it on unitedly. “There is talk of a third wave, but we will not be scared. We shall stand like a rock facing strong waves and win.” Suggesting that people should keep their minds positive, Bhagwat cited England's situation in World War II when national morale helped it to prevail against Hitler when everything seemed going against it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/people-govt-became-complacent-after-1st-wave-says-rss-chief/articleshow/82671704.cms||---

A total of 15 bills were passed by the legislative assembly in the recent budget session that concluded in the beginning of April. Of these, the governor has given his assent to all bills related to finance and other departments. A source close to the development said, "Normally, the governor’s office clears the bills in a short time, but the anti-love-jihad bill and six other bills are still pending the governor’s approval. The governor’s office has raised some queries regarding the anti-love-jihad bill, so there is apprehension in government that the governor might ask for reconsideration.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-guv-yet-to-clear-anti-love-jihad-bill/articleshow/82671774.cms||Kapil Dave

Currently, AIIMS New Delhi has 23 cases of mucormycosis with 20 of them Covid-positive. Many states have 500-1,000 cases of mucormycosis. Officials urged hospitals to strictly follow infection control protocols and avoid irrational use of steroids in Covid-19 patients, particularly at an early stage or in mild illnesses. “As Covid-19 cases are increasing, it is of paramount importance that we follow protocols of infection control practices at hospitals. It has been seen that secondary infections — whether fungal or bacterial — are causing more mortality and morbidity,” he said. He added the disease, mucormycosis, can affect the face, infect nose, orbit of eye, or brain, which can even cause vision loss. It can also spread to the lung. Officials advised regular monitoring of sugar level in infected patients as well as those with diabetes to avoid fungal infection. “Chances of fungal infection increase in the patients who are diabetic, Covid positive and are taking steroids. To prevent it, we should stop the misuse of steroids,” Dr Guleria said. According to Guleria, mucormycosis spores are found in soil, air and even in food, but they are of low virulence and usually don’t cause infection. “Even before Covid, this disease could be seen mostly in diabetic patients, transplant and cancer patients, but it was rare among public. Now a large number of cases are being reported due to Covid treatment,” he said, recommending close monitoring of blood sugar levels to prevent the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deaths-due-to-secondary-infection-mucormycosis-among-covid-patients-being-reported-from-states-aiims-chief/articleshow/82671885.cms||---

---||India||PM orders audit to check if ventilators allocated to states are functional||NEW DELHI: Taking serious note of some reports of ventilators lying unutilised in some states, PM Narendra Modi called for an immediate audit of the installation and operations of the life support machines provided by the central government. The PM’s directions came during a review meeting on Saturday and in the wake of the Centre writing to some states about the utilisation of the ventilators provided under the PM-Cares fund. Punjab said the machines were not working, a claim disputed by the Centre which said the machines had not been unpacked for a long time. The PM said a refresher training for properly operating ventilators should be provided to healthcare workers if necessary. The Centre has said that WhatsApp groups have been formed for state representatives and the companies that supplied the ventilators to ensure glitches are resolved without delay. Modi also instructed that testing needs to be scaled up, with use of both RT-PCR and rapid tests, especially in areas with high test positivity rates (TPR). PM said that states should be encouraged to report their numbers transparently without any pressure of high numbers showing adversely on their efforts. He asked for augmentation of healthcare resources in rural areas to focus on door-to-door testing and surveillance. A day after he warned rural India against rapid spread of infections, the PM directed that a distribution plan for ensuring oxygen supply in rural areas be worked out, including through provision of oxygen concentrators. Emphasising the importance of necessary training to health workers in the operation of such equipment, he also directed that power supply be ensured for smooth operation of such medical devices. The PM further said localised containment strategies are the need of the hour specially for states where TPR in districts is high. Emphasising on outreach the PM also spoke about empowering ASHA & Anganwadi workers with all necessary tools. During the meeting, officials said testing has gone up rapidly from around 50 lakh per week in early March to around 1.3 crore tests per week. They also informed the PM about the gradually decreasing test positivity rate (TPR) and increasing recovery rate. As per a statement, officials gave a detailed presentation on state and district level situation of Covid, testing, oxygen availability, healthcare infrastructure, vaccination coverage and roadmap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-orders-audit-to-check-if-ventilators-allocated-to-states-are-functional/articleshow/82671975.cms||---

While Shiv Mohan was driving the tanker, Bhagwan was sitting alongside him. They have been taking turns to keep the wheels running non-stop to carry the key medical aid to hospitals. 33-year-old Shiv has been driving gas tankers for the past five years. “I had never seen such a response from people, including policemen and officers. People are appreciating our work; two-wheelers and car occupants are stopping to salute us. You feel proud in these trying times. The number of hours behind wheels has increased in recent weeks because of the huge demand of medical oxygen,” he told TOI from Bokaro in Jharkhand. The two from Amethi in UP, who are working with Delhi-based Chaudhary Transport Company, were waiting at an oxygen generation plant in Bokaro to fill the tank and then they would drive down to Bhopal. They said the vehicle carrying oxygen tankers are not being stopped even at inter-state check posts, and government agencies and people are offering them water bottles and food at state borders. “We are getting everything when we need. We also feel that we are contributing something to country’s fight against Covid,” they said. The two said as there is less traffic on the roads they are able to cover 600 km per day and in urban areas, the police are helping such vehicles to get priority clearance. “Drivers of all other vehicles give us way on all roads,” Shiv said. Nearly 90% of the medical oxygen is being carried by tankers and other vehicles, while barely 10% is being transported in Oxygen Express trains. Meanwhile, the government has set up a sub-group to deal with the issues of oxygen tankers and drivers. It has advised transporters to deploy four drivers with every tanker to ensure their non-stop movement. There are also discussions whether government can give some incentive to oxygen tanker drivers, sources said. While drivers of oxygen tankers and other essential items such as medicines and grocery items are playing a key role during these critical times, little has so far been done for drivers of heavy commercial vehicles, who often face harassment from enforcement agencies and work in hostile conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-heroes-salutes-free-food-greet-oxygen-tanker-drivers/articleshow/82671996.cms||Dipak K Dash

Deaths continue toTOI found out that only 83 of the 320 ventilators that three medical colleges in Punjab received under the PM Cares scheme, were functional. And, out of these 83, as many as 48 were not put to use as they were repaired recently and doctors were apprehensive of their efficacy. In Bihar, almost half of the 109 ventilators sent to 13 districts are lying defunct because of lack of trained personnel. Sources in UP health department said about 20% of the 200 ventilators UP received are lying unused.

And, out of these 83, as many as 48 were not put to use as they were repaired recently and doctors were apprehensive of their efficacy. In Bihar, almost half of the 109 ventilators sent to 13 districts are lying defunct because of lack of trained personnel. “I am aware that ventilators are lying unused in some districts. That’s because of lack of technicians. We are getting staff trained,” said UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh. Sources said about 20% of the 200 ventilators UP received are lying unused. Karnataka health and medical education minister K Sudhakar said while six ventilators have been provided at each taluka hospital, many are lying defunct due to lack of trained manpower. Health officials revealed 80% of the 2,025 ventilators Karnataka received are lying unused. In Telangana, lack of trained staff at Mahabubnagar Government Hospital and Nizamabad Medical College has led to 30 ventilators lying unused in each hospital. And, states like Bihar, MP and Assam admitted they are still in the process of hiring speciality staff or training them to handle ventilators. In Odisha, doctors faced another problem. There were ventilators but no associated parts to run them — like nozzles and flow centres. Sample this: In Hallett Hospital in Kanpur, 34 ventilators are lying unused as there are no humidifier kits, which is essential to its functioning. In many states, doctors say failure to generate adequate oxygen pressure has left ventilators useless. Some states complain there aren’t enough ICU facilities in district hospitals. “In some hospitals, we need more space to install ventilators. Our health department is building the infrastructure,” said Assam director of medical education Dr Anup Kumar Barman. In Rajasthan, where only 500 of the 1,900 ventilators have been installed, health minister Raghu Sharma said they are apprehensive that they may malfunction while in use. “In about 300 ventilators installed initially, oxygen compressor and censor shut down,” said Sharma. While the Punjab government alleged that the ventilators sent under PM Cares were of poor quality, the Centre blamed Punjab hospitals, saying they were incapable of handling ventilators. In Rajasthan too, while the CM and his health minister blamed the Centre for “not taking care of the faulty ventilators despite requests during meeting,” BJP MP Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore tweeted: “Either these ventilators are not yet boxed or some of them have been given to private hospitals on rent. Is it right to give these ventilators on rent to private hospitals.” (With inputs from Chandigarh, Delhi, Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhopal, Patna, Bhubaneshwar, Jaipur, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kochi and Hyderabad)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-many-states-ventilators-lie-unused-defunct-as-netas-bicker/articleshow/82672053.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Guest cap due to Covid now, food scarcity then||AHMEDABAD: In this corona era, a cap has been placed on wedding guests, in part, because of hospital bed shortage; in the 1960s, cops ensured a similar pruning of guest lists because of, metaphorically, bread shortage. In the current pandemic, police have been gatecrashing wedding parties to enforce the 50-guest limit. Baaratis and hosts are booked for violations. Decades ago too, Gujarat and India had agonized over invitee selection owing to the rules invoked to tackle the food shortage that set in after the wars with China and Pakistan in 1962 and 1965. Various state governments were forced to make people scale down weddings and other events. People were told to be frugal to save grains. Paresh Jani recalls the wedding of his maternal aunt in 1963. “My aunt Sudhaben Trivedi’s wedding was planned with Ahmedabad’s Pravinchandra Rawal,” Jani said. “At that time, the maximum limit for invitees was 50. The wedding was at MM Khambhatwala Hall, which could accommodate about 150 persons.” Jani went on to say, “Our family had invited only a few people and not many were expected from the groom’s side.” In the end, Jani said, about 100 baraatis turned up and the arrangements fell short. “That was taken care of, but the main concern was a police raid,” he said. “We kept the hall’s doors closed. Since we had a couple of local politicians among the invitees, we remained untouched by the administration.” “In our wedding in 1962, my brothers agonized over the guest list as only limited people could be invited. Food was also not lavish. When my brother's daughter got married during Covid-19 recently with 50 guests in attendance, it brought back memories of the simplicity of my wedding,” says Lalita Patel, a resident of Junagadh. In the 1960s, if hosts wanted to invite more people than mandated for weddings and other events, special permission had to be obtained from the authorities. Back then, state governments had issued Guest Control Orders at different times restricting the number of guests for all events. A researcher, Tarangini Sriraman in her book “In Pursuit of Proof — A History of Identification Documents in India” elaborates on this subject. Assam, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Mizoram issued such orders in the 1960s and the 1970s. Certain foods could not be served at community events. She mentions that Assam permitted 25 guests for ordinary parties and 100 for weddings and funerals. Delhi, during the Emergency, placed the cap of 25 for all functions. In 1977, with the lifting of the Emergency, the guest limit was increased to 50 for weddings and 100 for funerals. Jammu & Kashmir had the Guest Control Orders in place as late as 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guest-cap-virus-rampage-now-food-shortage-in-60s/articleshow/82667601.cms||Saeed Khan

When they were busy working day and night to complete the order of making 2,500 oxygen cylinders, all the 140 employees received a mail instructing them to get retired by May 17. As per the decision of the central government on May 9, 2020, BPCL was closed. The 140 employees were asked to opt for voluntary separation scheme (VSS), failing which, the order said, they would be shown the door without being given any monitory benefits. However, as the entire state witnessed a dearth of oxygen cylinders in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19, the district administration took a timely decision. A proposal was sent to the state government mentioning that BPCL, given its expertise and infrastructure, should be allowed to manufacture the oxygen cylinders. After getting an approval from the ministry of heavy industry, the state government placed an order to Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) to supply 2500 oxygen cylinders. BHEL in turn, placed the order to BPCL to manufacture these cylinders, and also gave an amount of Rs 3.68 crore to the company. After getting the order, the employees of the company started working with a new energy as the order was to be completed within 21 days. “The workers were happy and were working with a new force to complete the order. When the company officials were waiting for the visit of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) team to get the required license for manufacturing of cylinders, this mail has landed,” said the employees’ leader, RLD Dubey. On May 13, BPCL chief general manager (CMD) Sunil Parvani received the mail that all the employees should get retired within a week without delay as per the instructions of the ministry of heavy industries. “If we are being shown the door, who is going to make these cylinders? Will someone tell us?,” asked Dubey. “There is no one to listen to our ordeal,” he added. Sources informed that once these employees are retired, the government wants to engage them on contract basis to get the order of cylinders completed. However, this is not acceptable to the workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bpcl-employees-given-notice-to-retire-by-may-17/articleshow/82668287.cms||---

The car in which the victims were travelling ran into a truck leading to the incident. Several persons including doctors staying in Surat who hail from Saurashtra have gone to their hometowns and nearby areas to serve those suffering from the pandemic. The trio that met with the accident early on Saturday morning had also joined such an effort. Ashok Godani (36), a resident of Olpad Road, Sanay Godani (27), a resident of Sarthana in Surat and Raju Gondaliya (42), a resident of Bhambhaniya in Bhavnagar district, had informed their families that they had left after finishing work. It is believed that the driver of the car lost control or had dozed off and ran into a truck on the highway. The driver of the truck ran away from the spot after the accident. He later appeared at the Warasiya police station in the evening to file a complaint. Ashok, a property broker, was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party and had contested the recent Surat Municipal Corporation polls. Sources said that he was involved in social work for quite some time. The trio was returning after setting up two isolation centres in Vavera village near Rajula and Selna village in Jafrabad, in Amreli district. Sanjay Godani was a relative of Ashok while Gondaliya was a cousin of Sanjay. “Ashok was very active and of helpful nature. He joined the movement by the Seva Group to set up an isolation centre in Saurashtra’s rural areas,” said Dharmik Malaviya, a friend of Ashok. Mahesh Savani of Seva Group has announced to support the education of both the sons of Ashok.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/3-covid-volunteers-from-surat-die-in-road-accident/articleshow/82664637.cms||---

The therapy is already in practice at PGIMS, Rohtak, and at each of the tertiary care hospitals in Gurgaon and Faridabad. The hospital is expected to get equipment by Sunday evening and it is likely to be made operational by Tuesday. Sources in chief minister office (CMO) said machines for this therapy had been procured for Rs 50 lakh through the CSR programme and the equipment had already arrived in New Delhi, and was now awaiting custom clearances. “At the same time, we have asked the company to provide trained staff for some period. Institute director Dr Jadish Dureja is a super specialist and expert in handling this system; hence, it would be easy to make the best use of it. Some medicos have been given training. Also, on-site training will be given by director and his team and the staff of the company,” said the official. If all goes well, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will launch the machine on Monday or Tuesday. At the same time, he will review Covid management at PGIMS and Kalpana Chawla hospital. Meanwhile, the vice-chancellor of Pt B D University of Health Sciences has been asked to prepare a detailed feedback of the system. This therapy is said to be quite effective for critically ill Covid-19 patients who have severe lung infection. “In fact, this support system is put to use when ventilators fail and lungs are damaged. This support helps a patient to have some recoveries. So far as review is concerned, results vary from person to person. From minimum five day to maximum four weeks, we can keep a patient on this system for recovery,” said Dr Dureja. “We have already started screening the patients so that we could start soon after it is installed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/soon-new-life-support-system-for-critical-covid-patients-at-karnal-hospital/articleshow/82670330.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Obesity big Covid risk factor for children & young adults||AHMEDABAD: As the current wave of Covid-19 swept many children and young adults in its fold along with their family members, it was revealed that the majority of those who needed ICU care and prolonged hospitalization had one factor in common – obesity or high body mass index. Dr Ankit Mehta, paediatric intensive care specialist at Zydus Hospital, said that a good 50% of the children treated in ICU during second surge of Covid-19 at the facility were overweight or obese. “We have treated 45 children for Covid in ICU and half of them were obese. This is a serious indicator of obesity being a significant risk factor for Covid in children,” said Dr Mehta. He said that in obese children, Covid-19 disease was seen as it recorded in adults. “The children had lung involvement with CT scores ranging from 6-18, one girl even had 100% lung involvement. They had to be treated as adults with Remdesivir, steroids and anticoagulants,” said Dr Mehta. Dr Pushkar Shrivastava, a paediatrician with Apollo Hospitals, said that while paediatric population doesn’t have other comorbidities associated commonly with adults, overweight kids and young adults do carry higher risk of Covid complications. “Severity has remained very low, but we do see complications such as multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) among kids and teenagers who recover from Covid,” he said, adding that it gets manifested with red eye, red lips, red tongue, swelling in the neck, etc. which requires hospitalization. Dr Nishchal Bhatt, a citybased paediatrician, said he recently got three children admitted, and all of them were overweight. “Several kids gained weight during pandemic months with decreased physical activities and increased screen time. They must be encouraged for light exercises which can be done at home,” he said. “The impact of Covid would be almost same in a 75 kg teenager and a 75 kg adult. We have seen rapid weight gains in the past few months, which is alarming in itself. Majority of the kids and young adults don’t require major medical attention, but due to high infectivity of Covid this time around, it’s always better to be on guard and consult a doctor if the child shows any symptoms associated with Covid,” said Dr Chetan Trivedi, an Ahmedabad paediatrician and executive board member of IAP for 2021||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/obesity-big-covid-risk-factor-for-children-young-adults/articleshow/82667728.cms||Radha Sharma

---||Mumbai||Devendra Fadnavis writes tit-for-tat letter to Sonia, pans state on Covid||MUMBAI: The state leads in Covid deaths and Covid cases. If the situation in Maharashtra improves, then the burden on the country’s medical infrastructure will reduce considerably, said opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis in a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi recently. Fadnavis said his letter was prompted by her letters to PM Narendra Modi and the statements made by other Congress politicians on the pandemic. “Perhaps certain issues have not been brought to your notice and through this letter I wish to apprise you of them,” his letter said. “If the total Covid positive cases in the country are considered, then 22% of these cases are in Maharashtra, which for several months was above 30%. Maharashtra accounts for 31% of the total Covid-related deaths in the country and 14% of the active cases,” Fadnavis said. Saying Covid was mishandled in Mumbai, he said Covid deaths were not being fully disclosed and not enough tests being conducted. “Under ‘Death due to Other Reasons’, while the rest of Maharashtra shows only 0.8% mortality, in Mumbai it is as high as 40%. Every effort is made to hide Covid deaths,” he said. State Congress chief Nana Patole challenged Fadnavis to write to PM Modi on his failure to tackle the pandemic. “It is clear that before writing the letter to the Congress president Fadnavis has not read the observations of NITI Aayog and the Centre on the steps taken by the BMC. The entire world has lauded the Mumbai model for tackling the pandemic, while Fadanvis is finding faults,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fadnavis-writes-tit-for-tat-letter-to-sonia-pans-state-on-covid/articleshow/82668312.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Crowds jostle outside vaccination centres||Vijayawada: Social distancing protocols have gone for a toss as hundreds crowd vaccination centres in Krishna district from the wee hours. Fear of contracting Covid-19 is driving many to get vaccinated, in contrast to the hesitancy in the initial days of the vaccine rollout. As large numbers of beneficiaries scheduled to take their second dose approach vaccination centres, the health wing is ensuring that queues are maintained outside the centres on the city’s outskirts and has started issuing number tokens. None of these measures, however, has been able to control the crowds. With hundreds waiting outside vaccination points, healthcare workers unable to control the crowd have taken the help of police. Outside Poranki High School on Saturday, a stampede-like situation was recorded on Saturday during the vaccination drive. Even as staff made mic announcements on maintaining physical distance, people in the crowd jostled each other to be the first in line. “We came here at 6.30 in the morning, by then around 120 members were seen waiting. There is no proper management to regulate the crowd and we are afraid of taking vaccines in this crowd. This is the third consecutive day that we are returning homes without taking vaccines,” said Lavu Ramiah, a resident of Poranki. Doctors say that huge gatherings outside vaccination centres will increase the risk of Covid-19 infection. “Taking a vaccine shot is very important, but one should not risk their lives. Covid-19 is rapidly spreading across India and we are increasing the risk by increasing rush at vaccine centres. Maintaining physical distance is key to preventing the spread of Covid-19. Everyone should behave responsibly,” said Dr Mohana, an anaesthetist from the city. Meanwhile, the district administration has started to supply beneficiaries tokens with time slots for Covid-19 vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/crowds-jostle-outside-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82665997.cms||Venu Lanka

Imtiaz said that the hospital will work as an extension of the Government General Hospital (GGH), which is just 200 meters away.  “Patient load at the government hospital has increased. Patients in severe condition from various parts of the state are coming to Vijayawada GGH which is a state Covid-19 hospital. To reduce the load on it we have established a 100-bed hospital with oxygen lines at Venue Convention. Doctors from top corporate hospitals will be allotted duties in this hospital. The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has arranged mobile toilets for the patients and the staff,” Imtiaz said. Meanwhile, the Krishna district administration announced cash prizes for Covid-19 patients who receive treatment at Covid care centres and recover. The collector said that seven care centres have been established across the district to provide quality treatment for Covid-19 patients, adding that many patients are willing to get treatment at hospitals rather than at care centres.  “In a bid to encourage patients to prefer Covid care centres we have decided to give three cash prizes every week to patients who get treatment here and completely recover. Rs 15,000 will be given as first prize, Rs 10,000 will be given for the winner of the second prize and Rs 5,000 as the third prize,” the collector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/temporary-100-bed-covid-hospital-in-vij/articleshow/82665859.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Doctors of NCR fight infection and personal odds to help Covid patients||Prayagraj: Amidst the raging Covid-19 pandemic, doctors too have been affected. Some have been infected while others have seen their near and dear ones contracting the infection. However, many of these doctors, including those employed in Prayagraj division of North Central Railways (NCR), continue to attend to their patients, many a time virtually, unmindful of their personal difficulties. Dr Pervez Ahmad, senior divisional medical officer (DMO)-Prayagraj and nodal medical officer of Central Hospital-NCR remained at the forefront of war against Covid and has been on his toes since the pandemic set in. He has attended and treated hundreds of Covid patients in the last two months and is running the Covid OPD of the hospital attending to average of 150 patients per day. Apart from his OPD hours, Dr Pervez is also attending around 100-150 telephone calls of patients a day. “It hardly matters whether the call is early in the morning or at midnight, his tone and enthusiasm is always very encouraging. His caring attitude towards his patients always touches everyone,” said a recently recovered Covid-19 patient treated by Dr Pervez. Dr Pervez’s father had to be admitted to SRN hospital owing to Covid related complications even as his wife and other family members also came down with Covid. But he continued his normal working at hospital and managed Covid clinic to the best of his potential with full dedication, shared principal chief mechanical engineer of NCR Kundan Kumar. Deputy general manager of NCR Mannu Prakash Dubey also termed him a real warrior. Principal chief signal and telecom engineer Arun Kumar expressed his gratitude for the care provided by Dr Pervez during his Covid isolation period. However, Dr Pervez brushes all praise aside. “Every doctor is doing what he/she can for the patients in these testing times and remaining true to the oath that they have taken,” said Dr Pervez, an alumnus of Manipal Medical College who after his OPD work for awareness generation regarding Covid regularly addressing railway staff and counselling them regarding dos and don’ts through webinars being organised by Prayagraj Division. Another such ‘soldier’ from NCR is Dr Ashish Agrawal, who is managing the health unit of Central Hospital located at Subedarganj. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, his OPD is witnessing 175-200 patients per day. Dr Ashish Agrawal, a paediatrician has managed hundreds of Covid patients in last two months alone. This is especially significant in the backdrop that he himself turned Covid positive and was forced to remain 20 days in home isolation recently, shared NCR CPRO Shivam Sharma. For three days, he was in critical condition. But during his home isolation period also, he was giving medical consultation to 60-70 patients per day on his mobile phone including Covid positive paediatric patients, he added. During this period, his elder brother who also was Covid positive turned serious with hematemesis (blood from gastrointestinal tract) and had to be admitted in hospital. Despite all odds on a personal front, he continued telephonic consultations to his patients and has now resumed his duties at his OPD. “Dr Ashish has always been calm while interacting with patients. He speaks humbly on telephone after letting us convey our complaint,” said a traffic inspector of NCR whose son was down with Covid related symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/doctors-of-ncr-fight-infection-and-personal-odds-to-help-covid-patients/articleshow/82668356.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doc among 4 booked in death certificate racket||MUMBAI: A doctor and three ambulance staffers were booked by the crime branch in a racket where death certificates were being issued without examining the patient. The case has been handed over to the Nagpada police who will investigate how many death certificates were issued in this manner. Crime branch sleuths received a tip-off that an ambulance staffer, Sunny Kavale, was facilitating the racket. An individual posing as a patient's relative called up Kavale, on the police's instructions, and said he was seeking a death certificate for the patient. Kavale asked for identity documents like an Aadhar card of the patient over WhatsApp. He got a certificate issued from a Chinchpokli based doctor, Sagar Inamdar. The certificate was issued without examining if the patient was dead or alive. The crime branch team led by inspector Jagdish Bhambal and assistant inspector Rajesh Patil discovered that Kavale would seek out relatives of patients near JJ Hospital. "Kavale lived in the JJ Hospital compound as his parents worked at the hospital. He would come across several relatives of patients who needed a death certificate to ferry the patient's body back to their hometown or for other formalities post death. He would then connect these relatives to the doctor," said an officer. A case was registered against Inamdar, Kavale and his two accomplices, Somnath Gaikwad and Dashrath Gurav, for cheating on May 13. Gaikwad and Gurav worked on ambulances with Kavale. The Nagpada police have issued notices to all the accused under the Code of Criminal Procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doc-among-4-booked-in-death-certificate-racket/articleshow/82668378.cms||Nitasha Natu

The drone can carry 10 litres of sanitiser in each flight. Singh started the sanitisation programme through the drone on Friday. He said efforts were being made to sanitise the district headquarters and its surrounding areas. “Two experts from south India have been specially called for sanitisation through the drone. Several slum areas in the town as well as some highrise buildings were also sanitised by the drones,” the MP said. He said PM Narendra Modi along with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and other NDA leaders are engaged in various welfare works during the ongoing pandemic. In this sequence, he, too, has made this unique effort. “Arrangements have also been made for oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators, which have been made available to the district administration,” Singh said. Meanwhile, on Saturday, CM Nitish made a virtual inspection of the dedicated Covid care centre in Aurangabad district through videoconferencing. The CM took information about health facilities, availability of oxygen, medicines, community kitchen and other other facilities at the health centre and gave necessary guidelines to the officials.

Officials in a Ludhiana hospital said they had roughly 10 to 12 patients with suspected black fungal infection. Dr Rajesh Mahajan, coordinator of Covid care at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) said,“We have five ICUs and in every ICU we have two to three such fungal infection cases. Since we get patients from across the state, roughly about 30% to 40% patients are from outside the district.” However, authorities at the civil hospital said they have not come across cases of mucormycosis. Senior medical officer (SMO), civil Amarjit Kaur said no such case has been reported at the civil hospital. Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) officials also said that no recent cases of black fungus has been reported in the hospital. An official said such cases are generally detected in the eyes, ENT or medicine departments. CMCH principal Dr Jeyaraj Pandyan said the test for mucormycosis is conducted at the hospital. Health experts said while cases of mucormycosis have been detected, they are number is negligible. “We did receive one such case recently whose relatives took the patient to Jalandhar. Though cases are there but the number is not large. It occurs in patients whose stay during Covid is long and they are administered steroids for longer duration because of a weak immune system. It can occur in any part of the body, including kidney, skin, sinuses and eyes but chances of it occurring in the lungs are more,” said Pulmonary care specialist Dr Gurpreet Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/suspected-lack-fungus-cases-in-ludhiana-but-not-in-large-numbers/articleshow/82670359.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Pune||Pune to get its share of rain as storm hits state today||PUNE: Wet weather is likely in the city, the impact of the approaching severe cyclonic storm “Tauktae” on Sunday with thundery activity, lightning and moderate rain, and heavy rain forecast in isolated areas in the ghat regions, IMD’s forecast on Saturday said. IMD has given a rain, thunder and lightning forecast for Pune till May 19, though the intensity is expected to reduce after Sunday. IMD had earlier predicted moderate spells on Saturday in the city owing to the approach of Tauktae, but officials said the city did not see much of an impact till Saturday evening as the system was moving slower than expected. After around 9 pm on Saturday, the city experienced a rain spell and gusty winds, a result of the approaching system. Masses of clouds were seen approaching the district, IMD said on Saturday night. "We expect moderate showers in Pune on Sunday. Unlike last year, when cyclone Nisarga edged into part of Pune in June, the same is unlikely for Tauktae so far as per its current track towards Gujarat shows,” Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune told TOI. An alert for Pune remained put till Sunday, including moderate rain (15.6 to 64.4mm) with isolated heavy (64.5 to 115.5mm) rainfall in the ghat areas, thunderstorm/lightening on Sunday. On Saturday evening, IMD predicted Tauktae to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during the night intervening Saturday and Sunday. “The path of the system is likely to be north-northwestwards and it is expected to reach Gujarat coast in the morning of May 18, cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18. The impact is expected to be more in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, with heavy rain in isolated places in Mumbai,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-to-get-its-share-of-rain-as-storm-hits-state-today/articleshow/82666717.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa crosses 2,000 Covid deaths, last 1,000 came in just 19 days||PANAJI: The devastating second wave of Covid-19 saw Goa cross yet another grim milestone of 2,000 deaths. While it took Goa ten months to cross the 1,000-death mark, the second 1,000 deaths came in just 19 days. “This time, the virus is more life-threatening. It is very virulent, infectious and transmits easily. We have seen that it is affecting the younger population and causes pneumonia commonly,” said Dr Rajesh Javherani of Victor Hospital, Margao. During the peak of the first wave in September, Goa recorded an average of eight deaths a day. This time, it’s over 50. Experts say that the situation has been exacerbated by the oxygen crisis and political one-upmanship between chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane, forcing several citizens and groups to approach the high court. Former IMA president Dr Samuel Arawattigi said there is full-blown community transmission. “We had community transmission during the last wave too, but not to this extent,” he said. “We had a good lockdown then. This variant is a different and very strong one. This is apparent in the severity in cases, as well as the change in symptoms compared to the last wave,” he said. After the first wave, the government, besides focusing on ramping up infrastructure, should have aggressively vaccinated the population, he said. “We wasted two months on frontline workers. Many were reluctant to take the vaccine, and slots were going empty. If there was aggressive vaccination in India, this would have helped us. It was not done, and now we are suffering terribly,” he said. Dr Pravin Bhat of Horizon hospital, Margao, said that although importance must be given to the economy, Goa didn’t lock down in time despite its neighbouring states, Maharashtra and Karnataka, doing so. “As a result, our Goan population is suffering now. This mutant strain is resulting in mass spread. We see families getting affected together and we don’t see the typical symptoms that we saw in the last wave anymore. This time it is more of backache, malaise, weakness, lethargy, and not just the classic fever and viral symptoms that we were seeing in phase one,” he said. More importantly, the younger population is getting affected and they’re worsening. “This is how the numbers have risen so quickly. The state doesn’t have the bed capacity or adequate oxygen to treat patients on an individual basis. The severity of cases during this wave is so high, too many require to be put on ventilators and high flow oxygen,” Bhat said. On Saturday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare ranked Goa, with a positivity rate of 42%, second in the country after Puducherry. The ministry also named North Goa among the districts that have seen a continuous rise in Covid cases over the past two weeks. TOI had reported that Goa has among the highest cases and deaths per million in the country. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, addressing reporters on Saturday, attributed this to better reporting in the state, adding that each Covid death was being accounted for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-crosses-2k-covid-deaths-last-1000-came-in-just-19-days/articleshow/82670389.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 48 child marriages stopped in April-December last year||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) was successful in stopping 48 child marriages in 33 districts between April and December, 2020. Out of this, a total of 18 child marriages were prevented in Bhilwara which was the highest followed by Sikar, Karauli, Tonk and others which had half a dozen cases each. Three days back, RSCPCR wrote to all the district collectors and SPs regarding this and asked them to ensure that no child marriages take place in the state. In April this year, the state home department issued guidelines for district administration to prevent such marriages and stated that the wedding invites should have the birth date of the groom and the bride to establish they are not minors. Control rooms have also been set up where information regarding child marriages can be given, but officials said till no one comes forward, it is difficult to find such cases. Out of the total child marriages prevented, the officials had to take legal action in eight while in the remaining incidents, they were stopped through dialogue. “Those who wish to give us information can call on the helpline number 1098 or on Whatsapp number 7733870243. The identity of the persons will be kept confidential to encourage them to come forward. Awareness needs to be created by the administration through social media, banners etc,” said an official of the child rights’ body. The guidelines were issued as May 14 and 26 are the auspicious dates on which the officials are expecting maximum number of child marriages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/48-child-marriages-stopped-in-apr-dec-last-yr/articleshow/82666738.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Kolkata||Netaji Indoor Stadium to turn into 200-bed Covid unit||KOLKATA: Netaji Indoor Stadium — the state’s largest indoor sporting facility — is set to be converted into a 200-bed Covid hospital by AMRI Hospitals within a fortnight. This makes it the third sporting arena in the city to be transformed into a Covid facility after Salt Lake stadium and Kishore Bharati Stadium. A stadium in Canning has also been converted into a Covid hospital last March. While AMRI took over Salt Lake stadium last week to turn it into a 100-bed hospital, Medica Superspecialty Hospital has been using Kishore Bharati as a 200-bed facility. Discussions with the government are at the final stage for the conversion and AMRI said it is working with PWD engineers to tide over a few ‘technical difficulties’ to set up the necessary infrastructural support for the makeshift hospital at Netaji Indoor Stadium. “It’s a huge facility and converting it into a hospital is a gigantic task. There are certain topographical hurdles that we have identified and are ironing them out with experts. But we expect the hospital to be functional in a fortnight,” said AMRI Hospital CEO Rupak Barua. “We need a liquid oxygen container to supply oxygen to the patients. Since we will have 200 patients, it will not be possible to procure individual cylinders since they are in short supply,” he said. He added that government authorities are assisting the hospital in procuring a container. Other infrastructure, like washrooms, too, will have to be worked upon, Barua said. Earlier this month, Medica Superspecialty Hospital set up a 200-bed hospital at Jadavpur’s Kishore Bharati Stadium. “We have a team of doctors, nurses and support staff who are doing an excellent job there. Occupancy has been 80% and, if necessary, we will take over more such facilities,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. The facility has ICUs, HDUs and oxygen-supported beds. Earlier this week, AMRI converted Lalit Great Eastern Hotel into a 195-bed satellite centre. The experience of running the Salt Lake stadium hospital, however, has taught AMRI a lesson. “We have realized that oxygen is the biggest challenge since supply is slow and consumption is very heavy. So, for the Netaji Indoor Stadium unit, we have decided to set up a centralized container,” said Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/netaji-indoor-stadium-to-turn-into-200-bed-cov-unit/articleshow/82666696.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Allahabad||Eid remains a low-key affair in city amid Covid devastation||PRAYAGRAJ: Even as Muslim families of the Sangam city celebrated Eid-Ul-Fitr at their homes, the festival remained a low-key affair this year, owing to the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The city wore a sombre look because of the number of Covid deaths witnessed recently. Moreover, people were cautious and did not step out, keeping in mind the dangers of the ongoing pandemic. Although during the days leading to the festival, a number of people did come out for shopping, Eid remained it was a low-key affair. Only a limited number of people arrived in all the major and small masques of the city. By and large, people remained confined to their homes/localities. Due to the restrictions in place, all the car parks, main markets of the city, cinema halls and malls were closed. The lockdown, thus, played an important role in minimizing gatherings. “We had prepared very few items as there were no visitors this year. I have lost a very close Hindu friend of mine. This is why we did not celebrate the festival with much enthusiasm,” said Shahab Uddin, a resident. The appeal made by the religious leaders of the both Shia and Sunni communities to celebrate Eid with simplicity also made its impact on the Muslims of the Sangam city. Imam-e-Juma (religious cleric) of Shia Jama Masjid (Chak, Zero Road), Maulana Hasan Raza, said, “Our entire society is one family, and hence, the loss too is collective. We stand with everyone, be it Hindus or Muslims, in these times of grief. We appealed to our Muslim brothers and sisters to celebrate Eid with simplicity, which they duly followed. We prayed to Allah to give strength to those who have lost their family members in this pandemic.” Likewise, secretary of Anjuman Hashimiya, Mashad Khan, said, “These are testing times and we tried to make everyone understand that humanity is one, and so is the suffering.” District president of Prayagraj Udyog Vyapar Mandal, Mohamad Qadir, said that the entire Muslim fraternity of the Sangam city followed the Covid guidelines during the festival and remained indoors. The prayers of Eid were performed in the houses, wherein people wished that besides giving peace and righteousness, may the kind Allah save the country from this pandemic.” “In these difficult times, we salute the spirit of all the frontline warriors, including doctors, policemen, administration, media personnel and sanitisation workers. Our prayers on Eid were especially for them,” said Qadir. Many Muslims did not purchase or wear new clothes this Eid. Even on social media, the message of caution was loud and clear as people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/eid-remains-a-low-key-affair-in-city-amid-covid-devastation/articleshow/82668406.cms||---

The core team is being formed anticipating the need for storing and using oxygen cylinders at the treatment centres in case of surge in patient load. Local bodies have been directed to pool palliative care nurses, para medical staff, health workers and retired health staff and even those registered at employment exchange. They will be trained and kept ready for deployment in first line treatment centres. “Oxygen has become an indispensable need during the second wave of Covid-19. Usually, it is given in hospitals and there is adequate facility and human resource there. However, steps are now being taken to provide oxygen facilities in CFLTC, CSLTC and domiciliary care centres (DCCs). Usually, this is managed by nurses and doctors and it will be difficult to get a technical team to manage it in first-line centres. Local bodies should train a core team for this purpose,” notes an order issued by LSGD ACS Sarada Muraleedharan. Safety measures for storage and management of oxygen cylinders in first- and second-line centres will be issued by the government soon. Muraleedharan said that with oxygen being crucial for critical cases, such facilities will be arranged and monitored in first- and second-centres as a transit facility before the patient is transferred to a healthcare facility. KILA director Joy P Elamon said that this is being proposed more as a futuristic move. “At present, DCCs do not require oxygen. However, if the cases surge, we need to equip our first- and second-line centres with oxygen supply. The core team will work as per the instructions of a trained doctor,” said Elamon. The doctor will decide upon cases where oxygen supply has to be administered, and factors like quantity, flow rate, time shall be monitored by the doctor. Helpdesk and tele-medicine facilities will be linked to first-line centres for this purpose. LSGD is also launching a helpline to ease the burden on DISHA with the huge increase in the number of Covid cases. Professionally trained personnel will be put in charge of the helpline to guide the callers and to allay their concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lsg-core-teams-to-manage-oxygen-at-covid-facilities/articleshow/82665265.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Pune||Curbs delay Temghar dam repairs, Oct deadline set||Pune: The non-availability of skilled workers due to lockdown-like restrictions in the state has delayed the repair of Temghar dam. The work had been scheduled for completion before monsoon. However, it has been pushed to October now. About 95% leakages in the dam’s wall have been plugged so far. The water levels in the dam were brought down to almost zero in March to assist the remaining 5% works. However, once the skilled workers returned to their native places following a spurt in Covid-19 cases, the work was pushed to a standstill. The irrigation department has now rescheduled the plan as works cannot continue during the monsoon months. Even as the work has been delayed, the authorities said that the dam’s wall is completely safe, and the structure can store 100% stock during the monsoon months. The dam, located about 50 km from the city, can store 3.7 TMC live water stock. An official from the irrigation department said, “The remaining work was scheduled to be finished in April and May, but the skilled manpower returned to their native places in March. The shortfall was about 250 workers. The pending work includes the shotcrete treatment, which involves filing of cement from the inside portion of the dam’s wall.” The remaining work will cost Rs25 crore and the state government has given a go-ahead for the spend. Pravin Kolhe, superintending engineer at the irrigation department, said, “We will reschedule the work post-monsoon. This will not escalate the project cost as the work is part of the contract, which has already been issued.” The dam site receives heavy rain of around 3,000mm during the monsoon. Therefore, it is not possible to continue with the work for. Although some work is pending, the dam’s wall is completely safe, and it can store water at its maxium capacity,” Kolhe added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-delay-temghar-dam-repairs-oct-deadline-set/articleshow/82666749.cms||Sarang Dastane

The man’s father suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away after learning about the death. Surajit Kerani (38) worked in a private firm and has a wife and a son. The family lived with his parents and Kerani went into deep depression after his parents tested positive for Covid. Locals said that after his mother’s condition turned critical, she was admitted to T L Jaiswal Hospital in Howrah’s Ghusuri. His father Tinkari (81) also tested positive for Covid and was undergoing treatment at home. “My husband was depressed for the past few days and expressed concern about his parents’ health. I tried to console him, but nothing worked,” said Kerani’s wife Rupa. Locals said the fear of losing his parents had a deep impact on Kerani. On Saturday morning, he went to his room and locked it. Rupa suspected something was wrong after he failed to open the door for a long time. She sought help from the neighbours and they broke open the door to find him hanging from the ceiling fan. The incident could not be hidden from Tinkari and the 81-year-old suffered a massive cardiac arrest, dying before he could be taken to a hospital. “He loved his parents and there is nothing wrong with that. But he did not even think what would happen to them if he was not there any more. He did not even think of me and our child,” Rupa said. Distraught with the incidents, she sought the state’s help to run the family. Local councillor Sudipta Chowdhury said they were trying to arrange help for the family. “I knew them for years. It is very unfortunate that Kerani ended his life like this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-ends-life-cov-ve-dad-dies-of-shock/articleshow/82666764.cms||Rupak Banerjee

Shalu Saini, 36, who runs an NGO 'Sakshi Welfare', has cremated 15 bodies so far. Saini and her three-member team not only perform the last rites strictly following the religious rituals, but also collect the ashes the next day to be immersed into the Ganga - all without any charges. They bear the expenses of the rituals as well. "A dead deserves utmost respect in our society and their bodies need to be accorded last rites with care. A Covid patient's death is the end of his/her painful struggle. They deserve respect and dignity. This is the only reason why I have taken up this task," Saini told TOI on Saturday. "We have put up a phone number on social networking sites and anyone in need can call us. We will help him/her with the cremation and the post-funeral rituals," Saini said. Saini cited instances when she and her team have witnessed close relatives staying away from the dead out of fear. They even avoid carrying the body and participating in the last rites, she said, adding, "They don't turn up at the cremation." The social activist also said that the Muzaffarnagar based NGO has enough PPE kits, face masks, gloves and funds to bear ambulance charges and other expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-woman-comes-forward-to-cremate-bodies-of-covid-patients-with-dignity/articleshow/82666758.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Allahabad||Emergency medicine dept to soon come up at MLNMC||PRAYAGRAJ: A new ‘Emergency Medicine Department” will be established at Motilal Nehru Medical College (MLNMC) soon and would start functioning from the next academic session itself in view of the fact that students enrolling in MBBS course from session 2022-23 will also have to study ‘Emergency Medicine’ as a subject as stipulated by the National Medical Commission (NMC). The college authorities have already sent a proposal to the state government for getting approval in the regard. “We have prepared a detailed proposal and the same has been sent to the state government for their final approval. We have also requested sanctioning of new posts for this proposed department in the MLN Medical College,” said principal, MLN Medical College, Dr SP Singh. The principal further informed TOI that students enrolling in MBBS course from session 2022-23 will also have to study ‘Emergency Medicine’ as a subject as stipulated by the National Medical Commission (NMC) — the regulatory body that governs medical education and medical professionals in the country. Noting the importance of the field of Emergency Medicine, National Medical Commission (NMC) had made this new department mandatory for all medical colleges functioning in the country from 2022-23 academic session. It had also issued a notification in this regard on October 19, 2020, laying down the particular manpower and equipment requirement, etc., so that the medical colleges could take necessary steps in this regard. As part of the exercise to set up this new department, facility of 30 additional beds would be added to MLNMC, including six beds having intensive care unit (ICU) facilities. One operation theatre and one plaster room would also be part of this new department, he explained. SRN Hospital, an associated hospital under MLN Medical College, presently has 1,400 bed capacity besides having its own trauma centre and several facilities of the college are being revamped and increased, especially in view of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. One post each of professor, associate professor and assistant professor has been sought by the MLNMC administration so that proper teaching work can be undertaken for this proposed Emergency Medicine department. At present, the MLN Medical College has 12 departments including Medicine, Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pulmonary Medicine, Paediatrics, Dermatology, Pathology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Social and Preventive Medicine and ENT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/emergency-medicine-dept-to-soon-come-up-at-mlnmc/articleshow/82668451.cms||---

The incident was reported to other senior police officers after a couple of hours when the video of the incident started circulating on social media. “The ASI has been arrested. An FIR has been lodged against him after being found in an inebriated condition. His medical examination was conducted in which it was proven that he had consumed liquor,” Mufassil police station SHO Neeraj Kumar said. He said another FIR has been lodged by the ASI against villagers for physically assaulting and injuring him. In the video, villagers could be seen thrashing the ASI in uniform and pulling down his shirt while the rest of the patrolling party members remained a mute spectator. Munger SP J Jalaraddi said the ASI returned to the police station and didn’t tell anything to his SHO or any other senior officers. “Even rest of the police team remained silent about the incident after returning from patrolling,” he said. The SP said DSP (headquarters) has been directed to conduct an inquiry into the incident. The SHO said the ASI was on a night patrolling duty. He said the incident took place around 5am. He said the ASI was returning to the police station after conducting night patrolling when he stopped three persons travelling on a two-wheeler at Mahuli. “They were not wearing helmets. Their movement in such a way was a violation of rules amid the pandemic and lockdown,” he said. The SHO said soon an altercation took place and the trio called up more associates at the spot. “More villagers reached there in support of the trio and started thrashing Prakash after pulling him out of the police vehicle,” he said. SHO Kumar said four out of the six persons who had assaulted the ASI have been identified with the help of the viral video. “Police are trying to identify the rest of the accused. All of them are from Mahuli village,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/munger-cop-thrashed-by-locals-held-for-consuming-liquor/articleshow/82666774.cms||---

The murder was committed in December last year and the body was thrown in Sariska forest. The woman and her paramour were produced before a court on Saturday and they were handed over to police for six-day remand on Saturday. While investing a missing case of a 25-year-old woman identified as Teena, wife of Sumit Ahir and four-year-old daughter Nandni, a police team on Friday found the woman in Udawala village in Manoharpur area of Jaipur rural. The woman was living with her paramour Prahlad Sahay (45). On inquiring about the daughter, Teena said that she was with her maternal grandparents. However, when the little girl was not found there, Teena was strictly questioned. She confessed that she had murdered her daughter by strangulating her on December 9, 2020. Her body was then thrown in Sariska forest. The daughter was critically injured after accidentally falling off the stairs while playing a day before the murder. The local doctor had referred her to Jaipur hospital, but Sahay was not ready to spend money on the girl’s treatment. The couple took back Nandni. At night they decided to do away with the girl. A wrong call on Teena’s mobile led to regular chatting, sharing pictures and it finally culminated in an affair. She eventually left her husband’s house with her daughter and began living with Sahay, a labourer in Jaipur rural.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mom-lover-held-for-minors-murder/articleshow/82666802.cms||---
---||Goa||GMC horror continues for fifth straight night: 8 deaths due to 02 supply woes in Goa||PANAJI: The dark hours between 2am and 6am claimed eight more lives on Saturday due to oxygen fluctuations at Goa Medical College, taking the toll of Covid patients dead due to the oxygen crisis at the premier government hospital to 83 during the past five days. While GMC doctors were reluctant to directly attribute the deaths to erratic oxygen supply, nurses, relatives of patients and volunteers confirmed to TOI that transitory dips in oxygen were noticed throughout the night. “We cannot directly say that this is the reason (interruption in oxygen supply) why they died. Most of the patients die because of Covid pneumonia and oxygen is an important part of the treatment,” said GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar. A log of dips in the central oxygen pipeline maintained by GMC showed that 13 wards reported a drop in oxygen supply, with the longest drop being recorded in ward 143 for a duration of 90 minutes. However, the availability of oxygen cylinders helped prevent a higher number of casualties, said medical staff. Among the few who did not make it through the night was a 53-year-old man, the sole breadwinner of the family, who lost his life around 2:50am. “I got a call around 1:30am saying that the oxygen saturation was dropping and was at 60%. At that point I lost hope,” said a family friend. “At 4am, my aunt died due to Covid at GMC. The previous night (Friday) something went wrong with the oxygen,” said another individual, who also lost his cousin a few days earlier. Bandekar said all critically ill Covid patients are referred to GMC and 160 of them are hooked on to ventilators. “But how to prove that interruptions have caused those deaths,” he said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the dip in oxygen supply could not be correlated with deaths. But on Tuesday, Rane himself had said as many as 26 patients had died due to oxygen shortage at GMC. He had said many more patients had died earlier too, and the high court should conduct a probe to find out why it was happening. The daily medical bulletin on Saturday said 58 Covid patients lost their lives over the past 24 hours with 33 of the deaths occurring at GMC itself. The deaths also took Goa’s Covid fatality count across the 2,000-mark, with doctors saying that this may still not be the peak of the second wave for Goa. Goa’s positivity rate, which remains the highest among states in the country at 42%, only serves to back up the fears of the doctors. The Union territory of Puducherry, at 42.3%, is just a sliver above Goa. After a strong rebuke from the Goa bench of the Bombay high court, the state government appears to have finally grasped the severity of the situation and has rushed through the installation of a 23,000-litre liquid medical oxygen plant, which has been pushed into trial runs within 48 hours of work commencing. On Wednesday, hearing a slew of PILs on Covid management and oxygen crisis, a bench of justices Mahesh Sonak and Nitin Sambre had directed the government to ensure that no more lives were lost due to the oxygen crisis. Goa Forward Party, which is one of the petitioners before the high court, also continued to keep the pressure on the BJP government. “Midnight murders continue. Another eight Goans have lost their lives leaving Goa broken and in despair. This serial killing of Goans has to stop. The government of Goa and chief minister Pramod Sawant must answer for this disaster,” said GFP president Vijai Sardesai. “The opposition can make tall claims, but I appeal to them to tell us if they have any suggestions to deal with the situation. This is not a simple situation to deal with,” said Rane. To try and reduce the load on GMC, health authorities have shifted 350 Covid-19 patients to the super speciality block, which has an independent medical oxygen plant. GMC relies on a tractor trolley system for oxygen replenishment, which is slow and cumbersome. Doctors said that the transitory dips in oxygen are because of the switch-over of the tractor trolleys. “I called around 3am and the on-duty ward staff said the non-invasive ventilators were beeping to show that the oxygen supply was dropping. However, they said they have backup cylinders and there were police personnel who would escalate the issue to authorities if the number of backup cylinders was below three. It wasn’t as bad as the earlier days,” said Conrad Barreto, one of the volunteers who have been helping out during the pandemic. A reduction to single digits in the number of Covid-19 deaths in the dark hour offered a silver lining for the state. At 3,512, recoveries outnumbered fresh cases and offered doctors and stakeholders some respite. The government officials said that the “statewide curfew” may be starting to show results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-horror-continues-for-fifth-straight-night-8-deaths-due-to-02-supply-woes/articleshow/82670409.cms||Bindiya Chari

While a vaccination camp was started in Bareilly city, two 50-bed Covid facilities have been set up at Joshimath and Ranikhet in Uttarakhand and civilians are also provided medical support at Army hospital in Bareilly. An official statement shared by an official from Indian Army based in Bareilly said that apart from setting vaccination camp in Bareilly, Indian Army has stepped in to establish 50-bed Covid care centres in remote hilly areas of Kumaon and Garhwal regions. The Indian Army formation of Uttar Bharat Area under the aegis of Central Command has set up two centres in Joshimath and Ranikhet. These Covid centres have all the required medical facilities to treat Covid patients. This step by the Army has not only helped the civil administration in dealing with Covid issues in remote hilly areas but also got much needed succour to the people in these areas. A senior Army official told TOI, “This initiative has drawn huge praise from all quarters especially from people in Joshimath and Ranikhet. We are also trying to set up two more centres at Berinag in Pithoragarh and Lansdowne. Apart from the hospitals, Covid vaccination camps have also been set up by Indian Army.” “We will open the facility from May 17. The district administration will provide PPE kits and medicine to patients here,” said Almora district magistrate Nitin Singh Bhadauria. Residents have welcomed the move as people from Ranikhet and Dwarahat, who now have to travel all the way to Almora for Covid-19 treatment, can now avail treatment here. The Covid facility in Joshimath was opened a couple of days ago and hasn’t admitted any civilians as of yet.

---||Pune||TOI busts fake news that claimed coronavirus pandemic was ‘planned’||Pune: The Covid-19 pandemic was planned years ago, said a message that was later certified as fake by the Times Verified initiative. The message made several false claims, including one that said health agencies had "predicted" the pandemic. But in reality, experts had run a research simulation to study what a coronavirus-triggered outbreak would look like. The false message also claimed a group 'Doctors for Education' had said the pandemic was planned. This group, reports said, is not a source of reliable information. Several such fake messages and misleading claims have been found circulating in local social media networks. The Times Verified initiative, which was launched on April 30, has helped bust over 300 such fake messages. Readers can submit forwards they receive to a panel of experts that has been assembled by TOI to verify information found floating on social media. Another message claimed Japanese Nobel Laureate Tasuku Honjo said the coronavirus was "not natural". Honjo, who shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with American scientist James Allison, later released a statement refuting the claims. Thousands of misleading and fake claims on the pandemic have been circulating on social media. Facebook said between March and April last year, it placed warning labels on nearly 90 million pieces of content because of their links to false claims and conspiracy theories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/toi-busts-fake-news-that-claimed-coronavirus-pandemic-was-planned/articleshow/82666848.cms||---

---||Mumbai||RT-PCR reports waived for cargo trucks to Maharashtra, but status checks at entry pts||MUMBAI: In less than 12 hours after scores of trucks supplying essentials were stuck at the Maharashtra-Gujarat border early on Saturday morning, the state government revised its guidelines regarding the “mandatory RT-PCR tests” for drivers and cleaners of cargo carriers entering Maharashtra with essential supplies. The new order issued by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte stated that the drivers and cleaners will be checked for temperature and any other Covid symptoms before entering the state from now on. Also the status of each person will be checked on Aarogya Setu before entry. TimesViewThe decision by the government to revoke the RT-PCR test for truck drivers/cleaners may have eased the ferrying of essentials across borders, but officials should still keep an eye for any driver showing Covid symptoms and deny him entry into the state. Transporters also must ensure drivers follow Covid norms such as wearing masks and getting their shots. In case of cargo carriers, not more than two people, and in case of emergency cargo carriers, not more than three peoplewill be allowed to travel. If anyone is found to show any Covid-like symptoms such as fever or display status in Aarogya Setu as “Not Safe” while entering the state, then they will be directed to the nearest Covid Care Centre, said the order. “It was a major issue as all trucks were stuck in a queue and those not carrying RT-PCR negative certificates were detained. This affected the supply chain and delayed the transportation of essentials on Saturday morning,” said Bal Malkit Singh of All India Motor Transport Congress. The transporters from AIMTC and also from Bombay Goods Transport Association made representation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and to senior bureaucrats, urging them to intervene .  “Following our representation to CM, we were informed that instructions were issued to to release all vehicles,” said Abhishek Gupta from BGTA. By noon, the trucks were released from Achad and Bhilad check posts on the Gujarat border. The May 12 guidelines had insisted on “not more than two people” to be allowed in cargo carriers. Also, truck operators entering from outside the state needed to carry a negative RT PCR test report that had to be issued not beyond 48 hours before the time of entry into the state.  “RT-PCR reports take 48 hours to be issued while cargo carriers from Delhi takes 72 hours to reach Maharashtra. Also, all south-bound vehicles coming from Rajasthan or Gujarat have to pass through Maharashtra. How will they get the RT-PCR test done en –route?” asked a transporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rt-pcr-reports-waived-for-cargo-trucks-to-maharashtra-but-status-checks-at-entry-pts/articleshow/82668480.cms||Somit Sen

Four patients were found with the symptoms of the dreaded fungal disease on Tuesday and that rose to six by Friday. Dr Sandeep Garg, nephrologist and renal transplant surgeon, said, “My patient was administered immunosuppressive agents after renal transplant so that acceptance level of the new kidney is ensured. In addition, he was diabetic and a post-Covid patient who had been administered steroids that further lowered his immunity, making him vulnerable to black fungus attack. We have informed the civil authorities about his death. There are five-six patients still with us who suffer from black fungus.” Mucormycosis, a fungal infection, is being found in Covid-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes and prolonged intensive care unit stay. In an advisory, the ICMR recently said the fungal infection mainly affects people who are on medication that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. Warning symptoms include pain and redness around eyes and nose, fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits and altered mental status, the advisory stated. Major risk factors for this disease include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression by steroids, prolonged ICU stay, malignancy and voriconazole therapy, the ICMR-health ministry advisory said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/59-yr-old-first-to-die-of-black-fungus-in-meerut/articleshow/82666801.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Goa||For a shot of hope, some do Tour de Goa to get vaccine slots||PANAJI: Grabbing the first available slot they could lay their keys on, a lucky few in the 18-44 age bracket were left with no option but to travel halfway across the state to get their first dose of the vaccine on Saturday. A total of 3,589 people were vaccinated with Covishield on the first day the government opened its vaccination slots for the below 45 age group. It was a 40-minute drive for Kenelem Lopes and his wife from Merces to their vaccination centre at the Government College of Arts, Sakhali. “It was worth it. The second wave is very bad with infections all around and we thought it best to get vaccinated as soon as possible,’ he said. It was a similar fate for two Margao residents who say they were lucky enough to get their jabs roughly 18km away in Ponda. Bambolim-resident Prajit Madkaikar didn’t manage an appointment at GMC which is a few metres from his home, but he got his jab at Mandur health centre. His relative from Porvorim, Sagar Malkarnekar, on the other hand, managed a slot at GMC. Never mind securing appointments at vaccination centres in their vicinity, members of the same family were unable to get slots together. “Height of Good Governance. I got an appointment for me at Sanguem and my wife at Cansaulim. Another friend gets in Canacona and his wife in Cuncolim. Tour de South Goa…” Taleigao resident and former BJP spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik tweeted. In another instance, two siblings aged 18 and 22 from Pilerne who were desperately trying to book appointments at a private hospital for the past few days said they were fortunate to get slots at two different centres—at Aldona and Chimbel—on two different days. “We didn’t have an alternative. If we wait for a centre closer to home, we may never get one,” one of the siblings told TOI. The beneficiaries were not impressed by the lack of social distancing at vaccination centres during the deadly second wave. The Margao urban health centre too was a scene of chaos outside. Lopes said they had to wait in a queue with over 20 persons ahead of them at Sakhali for over an hour, putting each other’s lives at risk of exposure with vaccination beginning over an hour late. “The waiting room for observation after vaccination was a classroom. Even with a single person per bench, there is not enough social distance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-a-shot-of-hope-some-do-tour-de-goa-to-get-vaccine-slots/articleshow/82670430.cms||Lisa Monteiro

With many of them facing several problems — mainly staff shortage and crowding whenever the shops open — those providing home delivery services said, while supply was not an issue, they were not able to cater to all orders coming in due to the present restrictions of keeping businesses operational until till 6pm. “All our shops have been closed since April 6. Last month, only 20-30% shops were able to provide proper home delivery while the rest were closed. Now, the number has gone up a bit,” Rajesh Deshmukh, the secretary of the Pune district Wine Merchants Association,said. However, TOI found there were many shops where home deliveries came with their own set of mandates. A representative of a Kondhwa said, while the minimum delivery order was Rs2,000, the liquor couldn’t be delivered to the doorsteps. “You will have to come down to the spot that we specify and pick up the delivery,” the representative said. Deshmukh said there had been incidents when the police stopped a liquor delivery executive and not allowed him to commute. “We had recent discussions with the police over this matter and instructions have been given not to stop delivery boys,” Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/barely-50-liquor-shops-in-pune-delivering-to-homes/articleshow/82666808.cms||Joy Sengupta

It is learnt that the LDF has decided to organize the function in the presence of selected 750 guests, at the Central Stadium here on May 20. At a time when the state has decided to extend the lockdown due to the high test positivity rate prevailing, the function organized for the swearing in ceremony should be avoided, said IMA state president P T Zachrias. It would be a great message to the people of the state and for the entire country if the swearing in ceremony is held in the virtual platform. The new government should be formed by setting an example for the people of the state on the need for preventing any kind of gatherings at this juncture, said IMA state secretary Dr P Gopikumar. The government should not ignore the fact that the lack of social distancing and not wearing masks during the election campaign was one among the main reason for the current spread in the state. At present the government is taking all its efforts to contain the spread and the lockdown is one among such step. However the government has to continue its efforts in bringing down the cases and hence the IMA is putting forward a humble request before the authorities to make the swearing in ceremony of the new government through a virtual platform, said the IMA leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/go-for-online-swearing-in-ceremony-ima-tells-govt/articleshow/82665275.cms||---

On Saturday, the administration received a call on its control room saying that a man, who worked as caretaker of an old woman who was a known Covid patient at Birring village, had died. The caller said residents suspected Covid infection as cause of death. The caller requested that the administration get last rites performed as the victim’s family was based in Bihar. At this, deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori ordered SDM Jai Inder Singh to ensure dignified last rites of the deceased. The SDM formed a team comprising kanungo Butta Singh, patwari Kulwinder Singh and others, who performed the cremation wearing PPE kits.

---||Patna||Patna hospitals log over 20 black fungus cases||PATNA: More than 20 persons have been diagnosed with the rare mucormycosis or black fungus in the state capital in the past one week after recovering from Covid-19. Mucormycosis typically starts growing from the nose, upper jaw, eyes and travels to brain. It becomes lethal if not treated immediately after spotting the initial symptoms. All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) has been treating 12 such patients, including two severely affected by this rare fungal infection. Both are in unconscious state. According to doctors, one patient had to undergo surgery, which was successful. AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said drop in immunity can trigger the symptoms of mucormycosis, which affects the facial areas such as nasal, eyes, jaws and the brain. “It can be life-threatening in diabetic patients, immune-suppressed individuals and patients having comorbid conditions. Black fungus (organism) is an opportunistic infection, which latches on to people having prolonged illnesses or are on steroids,” he said. “Covid patients undergoing oxygen therapy in ICU, where humidifier is used, are likely to get infected because of exposure to moisture. Severe patients on ventilator support during Covid treatment are also prone to the infection,” Dr Sanjeev said while pointing out the early symptoms -- pain in the nasal area, face, upper jaw, eyes, headache and nasal crusting. He added: “People need to watch out the early signs of black fungus and immediately get in touch with doctors for the treatment. Proptosis -- bulging or reddening of eyes, blurring vision — are the second-stage symptoms while the infection become serious as it travels through brain and the patient becomes unconscious.” Three patients are undergoing fungal treatment at IGIMS, two each in PMCH and two private hospitals in Patliputra area. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital-Patna (NMCH-P) also referred two patients with fungal infection to AIIMS-P. Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, medical nodal officer of Covid-9 at NMCH-P, said steroids, which is effective in treating Covid patients and helps in the treatment of inflammation in the lungs, also reduces the immunity and pushes the sugar level up. “It is believed this drop in immunity could be the reason mucormycosis. There are other likely reasons like use of high antibiotics on severe Covid patients, ICU and ventilator hospitalisation and non-sterilised humidifier,” he said. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the fungal infection affects those who turned negative after Covid infection, and it is mostly seen in patients with comorbid conditions like diabetes, tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C or kidney problem. “If any early symptoms are diagnosed, people should start taking anti-fungal drug -- fluconazole. If the infection travels to lungs then only it become life-threatening. So far, no death from mucormycosis has been reported in Patna,” he said. One mucormycosis patient was also operated upon at IGIMS on Saturday and discharged after successful operation. The experts advise diabetic patients to control their sugar level and those recovered from Covid to avoid the use of drugs indiscriminately. They should wash eyes and nose at regular intervals. Dr Ranjana Kumar, consultant ophthalmologist at Drishti Eye Care and Research Centre, said blood sugar management and proper protection from dust are important for recovered Covid-19 patients. “They need to be very vigilant about any neurological symptoms and pain in the facial areas,” she said. Dr Amit Kumar said the black fungus can affect other parts of the body as well because it travels from eyes, nose and mouth. “People need to maintain hygiene after recovery. Regularly wash nose and eyes with water,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/city-hospitals-log-over-20-black-fungus-cases/articleshow/82666852.cms||Faryal Rumi

The programme, run under the civic engagement-led Pune Platform for Covid Relief (PPCR), has already donated 500 BiPAP ventilators, thousands of oxygen concentrators. “Additional supplies have also been ordered,” the MCCIA said. The new initiative to have individual crowdfunding accounts for each district will help allocate supplies better, and also increase civic engagement for their districts, MCCIA said, adding that the individual platforms were being hosted on the crowdfunding page GiveIndia, with individuals in India as well as overseas having started to donate to the efforts. “Different individuals in each district are leading the efforts to raise funds for the platform. In Kolhapur, for example, the state minister and Congress leader Satej Patil is leading the efforts to promote the fundraising platformand in Latur, a BJP leader and some doctors are helping out. Some of the districts are already receiving donations from many people in India, and a lot of the donations are also coming from Indians residing abroad,who want to help out the districts,” said Prashant Girbane, the director-general of MCCIA. Girbane said as has been the modus operandi of the mission so far, the imported equipment would be placed in the hands of the respective district collectors for their discretion in distribution and deployment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mccia-opens-up-crowdfunding-platform/articleshow/82666865.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

This was the first cadaver donation after the second wave of the coronavirus gripped the city and the state.Paresh Shah, a resident of Dayalji Park Apartment in Adajan of Surat, suffered a freak accident as he stumbled and fell while coming down the stairs of his office building near Majura gate on May 12. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he was diagnosed with brain haemorrhage.“Shah was working as a manager at city-based Bothra Finance Ltd. Considering the Covid-19 situation and his age, he was advised by his office to work from home. On May 12, he along with his wife went to the office to withdraw his salary and while returning he suffered an unfortunate accident. “Shah was taken to a hospital where his CT Scans revealed that he had suffered brain haemorrhage and he was declared brain dead by a panel of experts the following day. When the hospital authorities informed us about the brain-dead patient we reached out to his kin and counselled them for cadaver donations,” says Nilesh Mandlewala, president of Donate Life, an NGO which works to encourage people for cadaver donations.“Family members of late Paresh Shah agreed to donate his vital organs to save lives of others. After receiving consent for cadaver donations, we alerted the State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) in Ahmedabad. SOTTO allotted Shah’s liver to Ahmedabad based CIMS hospital. Doctors said that two kidneys could not be donated as they were not fit for transplantations,” Mandlewala added. A special 280 km green corridor was created from Surat to Ahmedabad’s CIMS hospital to transport harvested lungs. The two corneas were donated to Surat based Lok Drishti Eye bank.“The family was ready to donate lungs and heart as well. SOTTO informed the Regional Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO) and apex body National Organ Tissue and Transplant Organisation (NOTTO). The lungs were allocated to a Hyderabad hospital and the heart was allocated to a Chennai hospital. But both the organs could not be harvested as no one from these two hospitals came to harvest it because of logistics issues,” Mandlewala said.Paresh Shah was survived by his wife Padma, sons Devang and Paritosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/brain-dead-surat-mans-organs-save-three-lives/articleshow/82665257.cms||---

---||Goa||Govt to take over admissions to 21 private hosps’ Covid beds||PANAJI: CM Pramod Sawant said on Saturday that the state government would take over the admission rights of 21 private hospitals so that Covid patients are not denied admission under any pretext. He said the government was forced to take this step since they didn’t reserve 50% of their beds for Covid patients despite being told. “The government will take over their admission rights,” he said. “The government will pay them. Deen Dayal Swashtya Seva Yojna (DDSSY) cardholders will be able to avail of Covid treatment in private hospitals for free.” The order will be issued on Sunday. On April 29, as the state’s daily Covid-19 case tally crossed the 3000-mark, the government ordered that all private hospitals should reserve 50% of their total beds for covid admissions. That would have made available 778 beds in private hospitals, but some dragged their feet and several others did not implement the order in toto, and threw open only a few beds. As public Covid acilities started getting full, patients were left on stretchers and trolleys, as the few beds available in the private hospitals were always taken. While the government will allot beds, Sawant said that management and administration control would be retained by the hospital. The government will appoint officers to take control of admissions. The step, he said, has been taken to see that Covid patients are not left without treatment. Goa Medical College (GMC), Sawant said, has a capacity of around 500 beds, but it was extended to over 900 with the huge rise in cases. “Nobody was denied admission in GMC,” he said. The CM said that they have received complaints about private hospitals raising exorbitant bills even as rates were capped by the government for Covid treatment. Some even declined to extend treatment under DDSSY. “There was an element of favouritism in admissions. They admitted only who they wanted,” he said. Endorsing the government’s decision, health Minister Vishwajit Rane said, “The decision was very much needed. Recently, a patient died at a private hospital. The bill as per DDSSY rates was Rs 3.5 lakh, but the hospital demanded Rs 7 lakh to release the body”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-take-over-admissions-to-21-pvt-hosps-covid-beds/articleshow/82670468.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Daddy daycare: Lockdown brings WFH fathers closer to kids||Rushing to find a seat in the 8.30 am local train has been replaced by prepping for online school but chartered accountant Abhishek Shah isn't complaining. The past year of working-from-home has also been a lesson in childcare for this millennial parent who juggles virtual office meetings with toilet training his three-year-old son, Saarth, or coaxing him to have his breakfast. "Post online school, we have a dance session on the sofa," chuckles Shah, who feels grateful to have witnessed all of his son's milestones-- from the time he uttered his first words to the present day when he can narrate entire stories-- firsthand. The lockdown, it seems, is extinguishing the cliche of the passive, perpetually-at-work father as several male work-from-home employees find themselves partaking in a variety of activities with their children-- be it origami or filming videos. Eventually, this could mean that a whole generation might just grow up without daddy issues. "There is a lot of evidence to say that a child's social and emotional behaviour would be better and more holistic when his or her father is actively involved," says psychiatrist Dr Sapna Bangar. Since March 2020, Jogeshwari's Kainaaz Irani has watched her seven-year-old daughter Shania's creativity blossom gradually as her husband Shahzad--who flies as cabin crew with an airline--has been spending entire days at home, training her in sketching and painting. He also becomes a deft supporting actor every time Kainaaz pretends to be unable to open the main door of their house--a parenting double-act that keeps their one-year-old son Shaun from stepping out during the lockdown. For some fathers, spending time with their children also meant brushing up on their own skills. "My eight-year-old son is very interested in Origami and I had to study several online videos to learn how to make things like paper animals," says Bangalore based techie Raj Shetty, who found himself going back online to learn more complex projects since his kid's demands started "escalating" quickly. Over these shared moments, Shetty discovered hidden aspects of his son's personality. "I realised that my son cared a lot about the underprivileged. He would inquire with me how they were managing the lockdown without money and who looked after them when they got sick," says Shetty, who knew that these questions would have been directed to his wife in pre-Covid times "because I would be away at work." Psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa has observed boys becoming more vocal with their fathers around. "Early education improves for younger kids when both parents are around, while for adolescents, interactions with their fathers are also about learning life skills and values," says De Sousa. Spending time together during the pandemic has also helped parents stay sane. Play-acting or filming funny videos with his seven-year-old daughter would help Pune based banking professional Ketan Kinikar forget work-related anxieties or the mounting Covid infections. "I was also amazed how easily she adapted to the new normal-- whether it was online school or playing indoors," says Kinikar. "Typically, the fathers' style of parenting is laidback as compared to mothers who may be pressed for time as they are multi-tasking," says Dr Bangar, adding that while mothers tend to be more protective, fathers tend to be more patient. Andheri's Tarana Puri would agree. Over the span of the lockdown, she has seen her husband, Amitabh, an administrative assistant at a foreign consulate, shed various inhibitions around things like dancing, in the bid to make their five-year-old daughter Shanaya cackle.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Salt Lake hospital, locked Posta facility to help ease Covid burden||KOLKATA: ILS Hospital Salt Lake has opened its doors to Covid patients, and so has Janakalyan Samity Baguiati (JKSB), which started a community-based Covid care centre. In addition, Ashram Bhiwani Walla Hospital (ABWH) in the congested Burrabazar locality has been converted into a 50-bed Covid facility. Located in the Posta area, ABWH had been shut for the past five years. It will start taking in patients from Sunday. “I was successful in convincing the hospital owners to utilize the infrastructure for Covid patients suffering due to lack of hospital beds and oxygen. We will offer oxygen support and medical help, apart from ambulances to ferry patients — who may turn serious — to Covid hospitals,” said Jorasanko MLA Vivek Gupta. While a reputable NGO has come forward to fund the operational costs, several locals have extended financial support. ILS Hospital Salt Lake has set up 40 beds for Covid patients, of which 12 are critical beds. “While two floors have been reserved for Covid patients, the other three floors will continue to cater to non-Covid patients. We have also taken up a hotel (Haveli) to act as our satellite unit with 25 beds,” said Debasish Dhar, group vice-president, ILS Hospitals. JKSB’s Covid care centre has been set up in a community hall with 25 beds, with Calcutta National Medical College psychiatry head Srijit Ghosh at the helm. The facility, which has oxygen support, was inaugurated by Rajarahat Gopalpur MLA Aditi Munshi on Saturday. “This unit will cater to mildly symptomatic patients. Such community-based initiatives should ease pressure off hospitals,” said Ghosh, who is also the president of JKSB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-hospital-locked-posta-facility-to-help-ease-cov-burden/articleshow/82666882.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Delhi||Three corporations in Delhi get Rs 1,051 crore to clear salaries||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Saturday released Rs 1,051 crore to the three municipal corporations to help them clear the outstanding salaries of their employees, many of whom have not been paid for the past few months. Making the announcement, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the municipal corporations were in a financial mess due to corruption and their incompetence. “It has come to our notice that the civic bodies have not been giving salaries to their employees during the pandemic. If they are unable to even pay salaries to medical staff, doctors and nurses who are putting their lives at risk to save people in these unprecedented times, it reflects poorly on them,” said Sisodia. He added that the government hoped that the civic bodies would not use the assistance for any other activities but to pay the salaries of the employees involved in Covid duty. The deputy CM claimed that the government itself was in a tight financial situation due to lockdown. “CM Arvind Kejriwal has ensured that, despite the scarcity of resources, Delhi government will aid and support all the dedicated frontline workers who are on Covid duty so that they are able to receive their salaries,” he said. Of the Rs 1,051 crore, Rs 366.9 crore will be given to East Delhi Municipal Corporation, Rs 432.8 crore to the north civic body and Rs 251.6 crore to South Delhi Municipal Corporation. “We have to make sure our frontline workers in the corporations are paid their due salaries on time,” said Sisodia. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed that, after a delay of 44 days, Delhi government had released the funds for the first quarter of the financial year 2021-22. “This fund should have been released on April 1, but the government delayed it, and even today, it has been released after lieutenant governor’s intervention,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-corpns-get-rs-1051-crore-to-clear-salaries/articleshow/82666965.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Delivery boys on toes to serve people amid pandemic||PATNA: With lockdown in place, online portals and e-commerce units are witnessing long list of orders these days. Those dealing with home delivery of goods said there has been a surge in demand for vegetables and groceries. Retail outlets across the city are either closed due to lockdown or have limited timeframe to do business. Delivery boys are braving pandemic to help people get essential items sitting at home. Sunny Raj, who works with a firm dealing with home delivery of groceries, said, “We try to ensure that people get their goods without delay. However, heavy rush sometimes results in delay in delivery of goods. People send lists of items through messages and we deliver their orders on time.” Another delivery boy, Suraj Kumar, said his payment depends on number of orders he delivers. “We also get incentives on meeting the target of fixed number of deliveries. Since the number of orders has increased manifold these days, we remain on our toes to make the deliveries on time.” Meanwhile, Rajan Shri, who works in a bakery, said the demand for food items and snacks has plunged due to the lockdown. Owner of the bakery said it has become difficult for him to pay the employees due to massive fall in sales. Naveen Kumar, owner of a supermarket, said, “Since we are allowed to do business only between 7am and 10am, it makes no sense in accepting online orders.” Abhishek Sultania, owner of a cafe on Exhibition Road said, “As we also provide the service of veg ‘thali’ to Covid patients, the time limit for delivery is from 9am to 9pm. The takeaway service for normal customers has been restricted due to the lockdown.” Sachin Singh, a resident of Ashiana Nagar, however, complained that online portals usually don’t have vacant slots for taking orders. “Other issues like missing or stale items are also there. However, we are left with no other option but to avail home delivery service,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delivery-boys-on-toes-to-serve-people-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82666956.cms||---

The district clocked 879 fresh cases which is the highest in UP for a day and followed by Gorakhpur at 801 while Lucknow recorded 617 and Ghaziabad 527 cases. Meerut also topped the death figures. In all, 19 deaths took place in the past 24 hours followed by Chandauli at 15 and Kanpur Urban 14. With 13,048 cases, Meerut also accounted for the highest number of active cases, followed by Lucknow (12,474), Gorakhpur (7,344) and Varanasi (7,162). Meerut chief medical officer Dr Akhilesh Mohan attributed the high number of cases to active case findings. “The reason for high active cases is because we have been aggressively involved in active case findings of symptomatic cases in rural areas and not waiting for villagers to come to us,” he said. Regarding the larger number of deaths, he said “LLRM Medical College is an L3 hospital where patients from other districts also get admitted and casualties are not necessarily from Meerut only.” According to the statewide data, in the past 24 hours, 12,547 fresh cases were registered, taking the active cases in UP to 1,77643 while 281 deaths were recorded. During this period, a total of 28,404 patients who recovered from Covid were discharged. The four districts that showed maximum impact in the onset of the second wave -- Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi and Prayagraj -- have mellowed down over the weeks and now show 12,474, 4701, 7,162 and 3,953 active cases, respectively. Just three weeks ago on April 21, these four districts were the worst affected. On April 21, the official figures showed Lucknow as having the highest number of active cases at 55,980 followed by Prayagraj with 16,432 active cases, Varanasi had 16,470 and Kanpur Urban 13,766 cases. In all, 54 deaths were reported officially in these four districts in a single day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-hotbed-meerut-tops-charts-in-infections-deaths-active-cases-in-up/articleshow/82666922.cms||Sandeep Rai

All these correspondents tested positive for Covid-19 during the first and second waves and succumbed to the disease. Telangana Recognized School Managements Association (TRSMA) demanded that state give ex-gratia of at least Rs 5 lakh to families of correspondents who lost their lives amid pandemic. The members of TRSMA said that they will also be extending a helping hand to the families of all these correspondents, who lost their lives in the last year or so. “We will be giving Rs 50,000 to each of these 70 families on behalf of TRSMA. The state should also do its bit for these families,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, TRSMA, adding that they will also be approaching the court to get relief under the Epidemic Diseases Act as well. He said that all these correspondents were under deep financial crisis as they did not get fees from students for over 14 months. “The state is partly responsible for their deaths as it never tried to help managements despite making several representations,” he said and added that at least the state should come to their rescue. In Telangana, there are about 10,000 private budget schools. According to the managements, most of these schools have 90% of fees due from parents for the academic year 2020-21 and 40% fee dues for the academic year 2019-20. They said that except for the class 10 students, a majority did not bother to pay the fee despite conducting online classes.

The woman living in Puna area of Surat city told police that her distant cousin had sent these pictures in December last year. They were in a relationship until she got engaged to another man from Amreli around two years ago, said cops. Her cousin used to take photos on his phone when the duo used to go out and also take screenshots of his phone during video calls. Just before her engagement, the woman was blackmailed by her cousin to call off the alliance otherwise and threatened to show these pictures to her fiancé. The woman went ahead with her engagement without telling anyone about the threat and her cousin too did not share any photos. However, on December 11 last year, the woman’s fiancé received photos on his phone from an unknown number. Since her cousin only had those photos, the woman had given an application to police, but did not insist on lodging a complaint as she feared that her reputation will be harmed in her community. “The woman changed her mind and approached us again on Friday to lodge a complaint after which we have registered an offence against the cousin and also an unknown person who sent the photos,” said a police official. The offence was registered for circulating obscene figures, defamation, criminal intimidation and under Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-sends-obscene-photos-of-cousin-to-her-fianc-booked/articleshow/82665267.cms||---

Police said at least two dozen criminal cases of heinous nature were registered against Babar with different police stations in Siwan. They said 19 cases against him are registered with Mufassil police station alone. He was evading arrest in a kidnapping case registered with Jamo police station in Siwan last month. Police suspect the Jamo victim had already been killed but the body could not be recovered yet. Police said Babar had also once worked for late don-turned-politician Mohammad Shahabuddin. Sarai police outpost in-charge Tanveer Alam said Babar was shot twice on both sides of his abdomen. “Police rushed him to Sadar hospital but doctors declared him dead,” Alam said. He said a commuter informed the outpost around 1pm that a person was lying in a pool of blood on the stairs of a building under construction on the roadside. “Babar’s bike was found parked on the roadside hardly 10 metres away from the spot. It seems he was shot at very close range after which the shooters fled. No one is the eyewitness. No gunshot was heard by anyone,” he said, adding police also failed to find any empty cartridge there. Alam said Babar had left home at Biduti Hata under Mufassil police station area in Siwan between 10 and 11am on Saturday. “His cellphone was not found from the spot. Police have got his number from the family and are working to get the call detail records,” he said. He said police suspect it a case of gang war. He said Babar had spent 5 years in jail and had come out in 2014. Meanwhile, Jamo police station SHO Ashok Kumar Dwivedi said one Mohammad Riyazuddin of Sarai locality had gone missing in the last week of April. “Riyazuddin was also accused in at least 14 cases of murder, loot and extortion. He had come out of jail hardly a month back after five years. Though his body has not been recovered yet, we strongly suspect that he had been murdered soon after the kidnapping,” he said. Dwivedi said Babar was one of the six prime accused in the case. “Babar and three more accused were still evading arrest. Probability is high that Riyazuddin’s associates eliminated him to take revenge,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/notorious-criminal-shot-dead-in-siwan-gang-war/articleshow/82667001.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||Jewellers in Ahmedabad get notices for income tax re-assessment||AHMEDABAD: Adding to their compliance burden during a shutdown imposed to curb spread of Covid cases, jewellers and bullion traders in various parts of Ahmedabad have received notices for reassessment of past income tax (I-T) returns — mainly during and before the demonetisation year. Jewellers suggest that at least 500 such notices have been issued to jewellers and bullion traders across the state. Many of the notices have been issued under Section 148 of the Income-Tax Act as part of which, the assessing officers may re-assess taxable income that might have gone under the radar. Some of the jewellers received notices in April-end or May first week when shops were shut in an effort to break the Covid chain. “They cannot open shops due to restrictions and by the time the relaxations are announced, they may end up missing the deadline to comply with the I-T department request,” said an Ahmedabad-based bullion trader. Despite several attempts, officials of Income Tax department could not be reached for comments on the number of notices that has been issued and the reasons behind it. Due to ongoing restrictions, most are in a fix on how to respond to notices. “An I-T notice was issued to me on April 20, with a re-assessment order for the year 2016-17. Even though the return was cleared, I will have to once again fish out all the past bills and submit them. This is sheer repetition of efforts. Moreover, it is not possible to respond in time as our offices are shut for the long haul,” said a city-based jeweller. Yet another bullion trader who also received such a notice, said, “We have provided all the documents as required. We were asked to re-verify transactions of 2015-16 i.e. a year before demonetisation. I have been asked to provide for old bills and we have done that. We hope this doesn’t get complicated further.” On April 24, the government had extended the date for issuance of notice to reopen assessment by tax officers, and for sending intimation of processing of equalisation levy till June 30.

A mother of two children, the 40-year-old used to earn Rs 3,000 a month working in two houses. But with Covid cases surging, people are unwilling to call her home. “Besides my wages, the families used to give me food too,” said Lata. “With no income, I haven’t been able to pay the rent of Rs 1,500 for my room, and providing my children two meals is now becoming difficult.” A joint survey conducted by National Domestic Workers’ Movement and Bandua Mukti Morcha among 480 domestic workers in south Delhi shows that only 37.5% of the domestic workers are still working and earning. Of those who still visit homes, most work for only an hour or two. Among the still employed workers, 36%, the majority, get paid Rs 31-60 daily. Only 1% are paid more than Rs 250. Bandua Mukti Morcha (BMM) recently wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Union labour and employment minister Santosh Gangwar requesting social security for these domestic workers. Nirmal Gorana, general secretary, BMM, said, “As domestic work falls in the unorganised sector and most of the workers have become unemployed, we requested the government to provide Rs 10,000 per month to each family. Their condition has worsened in the past 15 days. We have also demanded free rations for them.” Soni’s family has borne the brunt of Covid worsening. Life was slowly returning to normalcy after last year’s setbacks, but the spike since last month has stymied their restart. Soni said, “Last year, the sudden lockdown created severe hardships for us, leaving us idling at home for months. From the four houses I worked in, I was able to get work at two in 2020-end, but am jobless again.” Her neighbour, Savitri Devi, a cook, too had the same woeful tale of her employer asking her not to come after a family member tested Covid-positive for Covid. “Though that person has recovered, the family hasn’t called me back,” said Devi. Neha, 26, used to work at two houses in New Friends Colony. “After the weekend lockdown was announced in Delhi, both the families asked me not to come. One of them paid me Rs 1,500 in the last week of April, while I didn’t get my wages from the other house. My husband, who used to work as an office assistant, is also sitting at home,” said Neha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/63-domestic-workers-have-lost-job-since-pandemic/articleshow/82667022.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Linde India plant at Taloja supplies about 243 metric tonnes of oxygen daily to hospitals in the state.A metallic expansion joint in the plant worth just Rs 55,000 was the cause of the snag and is manufactured at Mehsana district in Gujarat. The spare part was airlifted in an overnight operation by an Indian Air Force plane from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and delivered to the Taloja plant at 4.30 am the next day.When the company informed district officials about the snag around noon on May 10, officials knew what was at stake and informed the state oxygen team. District officials were told that the unit that manufactures the spare part in Mehsana, would take around 24 hours to make it. Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari sought help from Mehsana collector HK Patel who asked the firm to hasten manufacture of the part. State officials were told it would take 48-72 hours to get the part delivered by road, which would have affected oxygen supply to hospitals.“I was told around 5.30 pm on Monday that the part must be got to Taloja quickly,” said state transport chief Avinash Dhakne who made 125 calls during the operation.While Linde officials informed that the spare part will be ready by 7.30 pm, the commissioner called up the joint secretary (air) at the Defence ministry and got in touch with top officials in the Union home ministry and Indian Air Force headquarters, who assured help.State officials also got in touch with the director of aviation in the state to put in place an alternative arrangement to transport the part as a standby. Later, the Air Force sent a plane from Delhi, which landed at Ahmedabadaround 8.45 pm. The Mehsana superintendent of police, Ahmedabad collector and Ahmedabad police ensured a trouble-free run to get the spare part to the airport. As final touches were to be made to the spare part, delivery was delayed, and it finally reached the airport at 12.45 am. The Air Force plane finally landed at Mumbai airport around 3.30 am on Tuesday. State Protocol Officer Ashok Salve, who was deputed to the airport, handled airport formalities. RTO officials were at the airport to transport the spare part which was finally delivered to the Taloja plant around 4.30 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-swift-op-helps-taloja-oxy-plant-bring-vital-spare-part-from-guj/articleshow/82668633.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

Also, they have sought permission to allow operation of charter flights in the sector to meet the heavy demand and to bring down the exorbitant fares charged by the airlines. “Hundreds of expatriates are currently stuck in Kerala and are finding it hard to get tickets to return back to Bahrain due to heavy demand in the route, especially as expats travelling to Saudi Arabia and UAE are using Bahrain as a transit after completing 14 day quarantine there. Also, the exorbitant ticket fares are making air fares out of reach of ordinary expats. The demand has triggered huge spurt in the fares from Kochi to Bahrain touching Bahrain Dinar (BD) 450 (Rs 87,000), whereas Air India tariff is BD 248 (Rs 48,000), which is unreasonable and unaffordable for an average earning worker,” P V Radhakrishna Pillai, president, Bahrain Keraleeya Samajam, said. He added that the inability of expats to reach Bahrain could also lead to loss of their jobs which would be another heavy blow for the NRKs who have been already hit hard by the pandemic. “Moreover, as of now Bahrain is the only option for thousands of Indian workers to go to Saudi Arabia and UAE who are proceeding to the countries after undergoing 14-day quarantine here as there are no direct flights to the two countries. The government should make efforts to revise the air bubble agreement in such a way that the cap on the number of flights and passengers per week is enhanced. Also, we request the governments of India and Bahrain to increase the number of flights per week by the two national carriers to destinations in India, especially to locations in Kerala,” he said. He added that currently expats in Kerala have to depend mostly on the very limited number of flights by Air India and Gulf Air to fly to Bahrain. Following the huge demand, one-way ticket fares of Gulf Air to Bahrain from Kochi has touched USD 2454 (Rs 1.7 lakh) as economy class tickets are not available in the sector this month while the average rate next month is around $1140 (Rs 80,000). UAE along with Oman had suspended direct flights from India on April 24 while the flights to Saudi Arabia were suspended much earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/nrks-seek-more-flights-to-bahrain/articleshow/82665331.cms||---

The morning time schedule -- 6 to 10am for urban areas and 8am to 12 noon for rural areas -- is unsuitable for many residents as by the time they get ready to go out for purchase of vegetables, the closing time appears on their watch. “The timings are a bit early as one has to do whole lot of work in the morning hours. And it is mostly over 9am while doing all this. Thus, it becomes quite difficult to reach the mandi and buy vegetables within the limited time period,” said Birendra Kumar, a resident of Chhapra town. Some vegetable vendors have demanded a change in the timing from forenoon to afternoon to facilitate their sale. However, Saran district magistrate (DM) Dr Nilesh Ramchandra Deore said the vendors have the option to sell vegetables and fruits throughout the day on pushcarts or carrying their items in basket in mohallas. Meanwhile, a vegetable vendor has been moving around in the Chhapra town by attaching an iron cart with a two-wheeler, thus making it a jugaad vehicle, which is prohibited as per the Motor Vehicles Act. “As vegetable markets are allowed only at selected places and it is quite difficult to push carts on the road, thus I got this jugaad vehicle made to move in the colonies easily. I also use a loudspeaker when I move in the residential colonies,” the vegetable vendor, Rajesh Kumar, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vegetable-vendors-rue-short-market-period/articleshow/82667036.cms||---
---||Surat||Mango farmers fear cyclone may cause serious losses||Surat/Rajkot: There are many who look forward to the scorching months just to take a bite of the quintessential summer fruit, Mango. But cyclone Tauktae apart from threatening widespread destruction may also hit the mango yield, its quantity as well as quality. The harvesting season of mangoes in the state has just begun. But the low pressure area created by cyclone Tauktae and its likely landfall in Saurashtra that can cause heavy winds and rainfall has the mango growers of the region worried. Farmers in south Gujarat are yet to pluck 75% of mango crop and they are already worried about the changing climate. Farmers say that if it just rains, there will not be much harm, but if it rains heavily with strong winds, there will be huge damage to the crop. Agricultural scientists have already forewarned the farmers. “We have issued advisory to the farmers to pluck as many mangoes as they can and sell them. If the cyclone results in strong winds then both the ripe as well as unripe mangoes will get hit,” said Dr C K Timbadiya, senior scientist and head of Krushi Vigyan Kendra of Navsari Agricultural University. “The major harvest begins after Akshaya Tritiya which was celebrated on Friday. But since the markets were also closed because of Eid and the weekend, farmers were going to start plucking over the weekend and next week,” said Vinod Desai, a farmer in Valsad who owns 5,000 mango trees. After Akshaya Tritiya, retail markets are flooded with mangoes which bring down the prices of fruit. However, farmers are worried that if the crop is damaged, they will not get a good price and the mango lovers will end up paying more. “Nobody prefers to buy mangoes that fall of the tree due to strong winds because they get damaged. So, we will not get good price. Also, since there will not be enough stock in the retail market, the vendors will increase the prices for end customer,” said Suresh Patel, a farmer from Navsari. Currently, Alphonso is sold in the price range of Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,800 per 20 kg, Kesar for Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 while Rajapuri for Rs 900 per 20 kg in the retail market of Surat. Usually, as the supply increases after May 20 the prices drop by Rs 200-Rs 300 per 20 kg depending on the quality of the fruit. The situation is no different in Saurashtra which is popular for its Kesar variety mangoes. There too farmers have not been able to harvest the crop due to changes in the weather over the last 20 days. Farmers already fear 40% loss in production due to unseasonal rain. The cloudy atmosphere and rains have caused damage to the crop, and it also didn’t allow fruits to mature. D K Varu head of department of fruit science in Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU) said that climate plays an important role in ripening of mangoes. “An ideal climate would a temperature of around 40 degrees Celsius with little or no humidity. But in last two weeks the humidity level remained high so the mangos did not ripen and farmers could not pluck them,” Varu said. According to farmers 70 to 80% crop is yet to be harvested and if the cyclone hits the state, it will cause huge damage. The Kesar variety of mango is cultivated in 25,000 hectares of Gir Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar districts and the average annual crop production is around 2.50 lakh tons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mango-farmers-fear-cyclone-may-cause-serious-losses/articleshow/82665356.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The DDMA has also requested people to call 0253-2317151 or 1077 (the disaster cell’s number) in case of emergency. Suraj Mandhare, the district collector and the chairperson of DDMA, on Saturday said: “Since the cyclone is likely to hit or pass over the coastal areas, it is likely to have an impact on the region on Sunday and Monday. People need to be vigilant. Even in the event of lightning, they should move to the safer locations.” “As far as possible, people must stay indoors when the clouds gather or a storm hits the region,” the collector added. As per the warning of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), unlike last year’s Cyclone Nisarg, which had entered Maharashtra from the Arabian Sea and struck deep inland causing damage even in Ahmednagar, the Cyclone Tauktae is likely to hit the coast area and move towards Gujarat. Citizens should ensure that they do not venture out in the middle of the storm. They should not believe in rumours. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has also warned citizens that if the winds affect the overhead infrastructure of the company and pose threat to life and property, then it would shut down the power supply, which would be restored only after assessing the damage. Deepak Kumthekar, the chief engineer of the Nashik zone, has urged the medical facilities treating Covid patients across the district to ensure that they have a back-up plan ready to ensure that the systems in the hospitals keep functioning. “The MSEDCL officials and employees will ensure that supplies to such places are normalized at the earliest. People can contact toll-free numbers 18002333435, 18001023435, 1912 or the control room number 7875357861 instead of calling up officers and interrupting the communication between personnel trying to restore normalcy,” Kumthekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hilly-areas-in-western-nashik-warned/articleshow/82663743.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

ECR general manager (GM) L C Trivedi has asked each division of the zone to expedite the drive as vaccination is the only solution to keep the deadly virus at bay or lessen its severity. ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said railways has put emphasis on the inoculation of its employees and their dependents. “Of the 81,635 railway employees in the ECR, 40,661 have already been vaccinated. This means around 51% of railway employees in the ECR have received their vaccine shots so far. We have targeted to achieve 100% vaccination target by mid-June,” Kumar added. Danapur senior DPO Surjit Singh said volunteers of the railway scouts and guides have been visiting employees’ houses in railway colonies at Patna, Khagaul and other places in the division to motivate them to take vaccine shots. Meanwhile, around 2,500 railway employees and other frontline workers of the ECR who had tested positive for Covid-19, are recovering fast.

---||India||Govt may not rush to reciprocate Ulfa (I) offer of suspension of ops||NEW DELHI: The Assam government and Centre may opt for a cautious approach on the unilateral, three-month suspension of operations announced by Ulfa (Independent) led by Paresh Baruah, and not rush into reciprocating the same by toning down counter-operations. Sources indicated that the security establishment is not willing to take chances, given the history of the outlawed outfit continuing with extortion and violent activities during a peace initiative in the past. Sources in the security establishment hinted that Ulfa(I) probably announced suspension of its military operations as it has been under tremendous pressure after allegedly earning public ire over abduction of three ONGC employees, all Assamese locals, from Sivasagar in the middle of Bihu festival last month. Two of the three abducted staffers were later rescued in an encounter launched by the Army based on intelligence provided by the Assam police. On Friday, a grenade blast in Tinsukia -- which agencies believe was either the work of some over-enthusiastic Ulfa(I) cadres or based on instructions given much earlier -- left two people dead, forcing the outfit to consider options to reverse the public sentiment. An official said Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s call on Thursday urging Ulfa(I) chief Paresh Baruah to abjure violence and come to the discussion table, may have given an “opening” to the outfit to announce the suspension of operations and using the current Covid situation as a ground was “public messaging”. Sources said it was not clear if Ulfa(I) had announced a mere stop to armed operations, or if this also covered non-armed activities such as extortion. “Suspension of operations makes little sense if extortion continues, as the latter gives the outfit financial muscle to buy arms and other military resources,” an officer said amid indications that the forces may sustain pressure on Ulfa(I) by continuing the crackdown on its activities, whether armed or non-armed, that come to notice. “But if Ulfa(I) were to announce a permanent suspension of all operations, including extortion, the government should be happy to reciprocate,” said a government functionary. In 2005, Ulfa had reached out to the government by constituting a group of civil society representatives called People’s Consultative Group to discuss its demands. The Centre reciprocated by holding 2-3 rounds of talks with the group. However, not only did Ulfa not abjure violence during this peace process but also insisted on making sovereignty for Assam its central demand. Central representatives were firm on holding talks within the Constitutional framework and when Ulfa failed to give a commitment on direct negotiations, the peace initiative was abandoned in 2006. Ulfa(I) head Paresh Baruah is currently lives in Ruili in Yunnan province of China, reportedly with the protection of the Chinese authorities. The Ulfa(I) cadres operate out of Assam and bases in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland districts bordering Myanmar. The strength of armed Ulfa(I) cadres is estimated to be around 100. Local youth, radicalised and recruited by Ulfa(I) via social media channels, via social media, assist these cadres in carrying out extortion, abductions and activities like lobbing of grenades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-may-not-rush-to-reciprocate-ulfa-i-offer-of-suspension-of-ops/articleshow/82672253.cms||Bharti Jain

Therefore, such senior citizens should be consulted about their need before randomly distributing breakfast, lunch and dinner,” the civic administration has said. On May 4, TOI carried a report on food wastage at Covid care facilities brought to the notice by some of the recovered patients, who were earlier admitted at Covid care facilities.Welcoming the intervention on the part of AMC, Anant Motale from NGO — Save Food Committee — said the facility managers should follow the instructions issued by the civic administration.“The unfortunate thing about wasted food at Covid care facilities is that it cannot be collected and donated to poor people due to the fear of contracting the infection. Therefore, it is an important duty of te AMC to keep a constant watch and avoid food wastage,” he said.As per official protocol, CCCs and other Covid care facilities offer breakfast to patients at around 8 am, followed by lunch at around noon, then tea by 4 pm and dinner at around 7.30 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/consult-with-elderly-patients-before-serving-food-amc/articleshow/82663798.cms||---

The members of the teachers’ union told TOI that several teachers are currently on Covid-19 duty and many of them have not been vaccinated against Covid-19 yet, therefore, the government should give some compensation money to the teachers, especially to those who fall ill or lose their lives on duty. “We demand the state government to declare the teachers on Covid-19 duty as frontline workers. The government should also hold Covid-19 inoculation camps for these teachers as most of them haven’t received vaccination doses. Besides, the state government should give a compensation amount to those teachers who either fall ill or lose their lives on duty. The teachers should also be provided with a cab service to reach the facilities they are deployed in,” said Sohan Singh Majila, general secretary of the state teachers’ association. It is worth mentioning that the Uttarakhand government has deployed teachers on Covid-19 duty to strengthen the fight against the pandemic. Also, the state-run schools are shut for the summer break till June 30. Thus, the teachers were available for Covid-19 duty. Meanwhile, the state education department has said that they will look into the demands of teacher associations and take necessary actions soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/teachers-union-ask-govt-to-give-teachers-perks-similar-to-frontline-workers-in-ukhand/articleshow/82665351.cms||Mohammad Anab

Officials said that the local health authorities failed to upload the central database on time. A considerable number of these deaths have been reported from the state-run hospital at Ambajogai, which was in the news recently for the deaths of Covid patients allegedly due to poor supply of oxygen. Beed district health officer Radhakrishna Pawar on Saturday said the local health authorities failed to upload the data to the central database in time. “The data in question was not submitted to the Indian Council of Medical Research in a time-bound manner. We have pulled up the staff concerned for the major lapse. There was no intention of hiding deaths as these causalities were already audited by the death committee,” he said. Elaborating upon the procedure of recording Covid deaths, Pawar said every hospital offering Covid care hasveen given an identity code and password to upload the data of cured and deceased patients. “The status of the patient needs to be uploaded within 24-hours of his/her discharge or death. The heavy work-load among other issues prevented the local staff concerned from updating such data in recent past,” he said, adding that more past deaths could get accounted in next few days. Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap said staff contracting Covid infection was one of the reasons behind the time lag. “Around 3-4% data entry operators and other technical staff engaged in the pandemic-related duty have tested positive so far. It affects the day-to-day uploading of data and, therefore, Covid death data could not get uploaded on time,” he said. The total number of casualties due to Covid had reached to 1,322 in Beed district by Friday, authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/174-april-covid-deaths-added-to-beeds-tally-now/articleshow/82663783.cms||---

International nurses undertaking the ‘Gateway to global nursing programme’ can gain job opportunities in the UK, USA, Canada, Ireland, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East as the countries come out of the Covid-19 pandemic and open their borders for healthcare staff. Nurses aspiring for a PG programme in Australia can get a student visa, which enables nurses from India to study and live in Australia. As a student, they can still work part-time for 40 hours a fortnight. An Indian nurse enrolling for a Master’s programme can bring their entire family on a family visa and all dependents can work full time in Australia until the Master’s degree is completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/oz-based-malayali-offers-scholarships-of-rs-10cr-to-nurses/articleshow/82665380.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Governor Acharya Devvrat withholds ‘anti-love jihad bill’ along with six others||GANDHINAGAR: Governor Acharya has not given his assent, yet, to seven important bills passed by the Gujarat assembly, including the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which was informally referred to as the anti love jihad bill by the state government. A total of 15 bills were passed by the legislative assembly in the recent budget session which concluded in the beginning of April. Of these, the Governor has given his assent to all bills related to finance and other departments. However, a few bills have not been cleared by him and these include the anti love jihad bill. The move on the part of the Governor has led to considerable discomfort for the state government. Key sources said the Governor has raised some queries about the anti love jihad bill. A key source close to the development said, “Normally, the Governor’s office clears the bills in a short time but the anti love jihad bill and six other bills are still pending approval of the Governor. The Governor’s office has raised some queries regarding the antilove Jihad bill, so there is apprehension in the government that the Governor might ask for reconsideration. Other bills are also under Governor’s consideration.’’ The Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was introduced and passed in the assembly, claiming to bring more stringent punishment against forced religious conversions through marriage. The amendment bill provides for up to ten years of jail for `fraudulent' or `forced' conversion by marriage. According to the government, the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021 sought to curtail “emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion”. The opposition Congress had voted against the bill, citing the possibility of misuse of the bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/governor-withholds-anti-love-jihad-bill-along-with-six-others/articleshow/82667102.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Delhi||Delhi government seeks 67 lakh doses of Sputnik vax||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has written to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for supply of around 67 lakh doses of Sputnik V, the Russian Covid-19 vaccine. Dr Reddy’s has commenced Sputnik V rollout in the country with the first dose being administered in Hyderabad on Friday. It is the first foreign-made vaccine being used in the country. “We have asked for 67 lakh doses each of Covishield and Covaxin and have also written to Dr Reddy’s, who are dealers of Sputnik in India, for nearly the same quantity of (Sputnik) doses,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday. “We have written to them but have not received a complete response as to how much vaccine they can provide,” Kejriwal added. Delhi is facing a shortage of vaccines and the availability is far below demands. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia earlier this week claimed that Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech has refused to provide additional doses requested by Delhi government. Underlining the significance of extensive vaccination coverage for fighting Covid, Kejriwal said getting inoculated was very necessary. Even the experience of the UK, the USA tells that if vaccination is carried out on a massive level, the effects of coronavirus can be curtailed, he added. “We are seeing that both the central government and the state governments are trying their best. As I understand, as and when the availability of vaccines increases, the vaccination drive will also catch its momentum,” said Kejriwal. Meanwhile, AAP MLA Atishi said that a fresh stock, including 1,73,760 doses of Covishield vaccine, arrived in Delhi for those above 45 years of age and healthcare/frontline workers. The Covaxin stock for the same category is left only for three days and Covishield’s stock for six days. For the 18-44 age group, Covaxin stock is over and Covishield’s stock is available for eight days. So far, Delhi has administered 43,67,243 individuals, out of which 10,08,620 have received both the doses. Atishi made a humble appeal to the Centre to supply sufficient vaccines for those in the 18-44 age group. “Like always, we are hoping that the Centre will supply a sufficient stock of vaccines at the earliest to Delhi. Fortunately, the Covid cases have been declining. However, it does not mean that the cases cannot increase now, or an impending third wave may not arrive in Delhi. Delhi has been one of the most severely affected states in the pandemic and is still grappling with the virus. It is my humble appeal to the Centre to supply sufficient vaccines, especially for those in the 18-44 age group,” the MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-seeks-67l-doses-of-sputnik-vax/articleshow/82667154.cms||AlokKNMishra

The best practices include offering 14-28 days leave to Covid-infected employees and 14 days to caretaker employees. In some cases, firstly caretakers need to utilize their sick leaves and then based on the need, paid leave given by the employer. “Some organizations are working with capable vendors to help in setting up call centres for employees. An emergency fund is allotted for the employees as a reimbursement on their medical expenses against the medical bills. Organizations are also planning for 3-6 months advance salary or part of salary to needy employees,” the official said. “Top-up on medical insurance help is provided by the organization. In case of top-up from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, 30% of the premium is borne by the employer and the remaining 70% premium needs to be paid by the employee,” the official said. In major towns, IT companies have procured oxygen concentrators in limited numbers to help employees in case of an emergency and provided it on a first-come-first-serve basis, he said. “Organizations have also set up helpline centres for employees and in some of the cases it’s available 24x7. Some have tied up with ambulance services to help employees immediately in case of an emergency,” the official said. Organizations are working with multiple organizations like Nasscom Foundation, BBMP and NGO to scale up the number of beds, oxygen concentrators and ICU facilities. Reimbursing the vaccination expenses for employees and dependents, publishing handbooks for their employees are two other initiatives many IT companies are doing, a Nasscom official said. Also, some of the Nasscom Deep Tech Club entrepreneurs and volunteers have come together to build a set of apps to help Covid patients and caretakers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/it-companies-plan-care-packages-for-employees/articleshow/82665415.cms||Shenoy Karun

The villagers swung into action after around six people, including a Kargil war hero, died in the last two weeks. It was inaugurated on Friday. “The facility does not have oxygen or ICU beds. Many ex-Armymen have contributed Rs 1,000 each to set up oxygen concentrators,” Rupesh Patil, a villager and district president of Sambhaji Brigade, told TOI on Saturday. The village, with a population of around 4,000, has a large number ex-servicemen and many serving in the Army, due to which it is called Sainik Girgaon. “We sought guidance from the district health officer for starting the Covid care centre. After taking permission from the authorities of Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Ashramshala, some renovation work was carried out and the facility established,” said Patil. Villagers unite to set up centreThe death of the Kargil war veteran due to lack of oxygen supply in a hospital in Kolhapur and expensive treatment in the city catapulted the villagers into action. “There was no covid care facility in the village. Around six people died in the village in the last two weeks as they avoided moving to hospitals in Kolhapur city due to the fear of hefty bills,” he said. Patil said the new facility in the village will also be available for people from outside Girgaon. “Ten days of treatment, isolation and food will be given to the patients free of cost at the facility. Mind and laughter therapy sessions will also be conducted daily. A full-time nursing facility will be provided along with visiting doctors.” District medical officer Yogesh Sale said the facility will be like an institutional quarantine centre for asymptomatic Covid patients and those with mild symptoms. “Many such centres are being set up by local self governing bodies so that villagers get first hand treatment,” said Sale. The district administration will provide technical and medicinal help related to doctors and nurses as and when required. However, the remaining things are to be taken care of by local self governing bodies. The administration has started Covid care centres at the taluka levels, where all types of beds have been made available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/village-of-sainiks-unites-toto-set-up-covid-care-centre/articleshow/82663833.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Ahead of the lockdown, citizens rushed to market areas to stock up essential items on Saturday morning. Laxmipuri, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation building, Bagal Chowk, Rajarampuri vegetable market areas in the city were crowded as the citizens came out to buy grocery and vegetables. Mahesh Jadhav, a vegetable seller, said, “As vegetable markets will remain shut, a large number of people came to the streets. As vegetables perish faster, we tried to finish that stock first by selling it at lower prices. From Sunday, we will provide door-to-door delivery. We support lockdown but the administration should help us financially or at least help us with foodgrains to survive.” The police force has been deployed to stop people from moving around without a reason.

---||Delhi||Centre asks Delhi to vax more frontline Covid workers||NEW DELHI: The Centre has advised Delhi to ramp up Covid vaccination to meet the targeted coverage of health and frontline workers. Delhi has administered first dose to only 78% of healthcare workers, whereas the national average for single dose vaccination coverage among healthcare workers is 89%. Similarly, while overall 82% of front-line workers have been vaccinated across the country, Delhi has vaccinated 80%. Many states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have more than 90% front-line workers covered with the first dose. The Centre’s advice came in the wake of the Delhi government accusing the Centre of controlling vaccine supplies. Besides, some states and UTs have also urged the Centre to extend the eligibility of front-line workers to cover those working in railways, banking etc. However, the Centre said the states are free to make such provisions through their direct procurement of vaccines. The Centre has been insisting upon states and UTs to improve the coverage of health and front-line workers on priority. An observational study among healthcare workers in New Delhi’s Apollo Hospital to evaluate the frequency of breakthrough infection of Covid-19 after vaccination shows only 1.64% of cases requiring hospitalisation, with none needing ICU admission and no deaths, further strengthening the case for vaccination. The findings of the study are under consideration for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal. “Studies indicate that Covid-19 vaccination does not provide 100% immunity even after full immunisation. However, our analysis demonstrates that even in cases where this immunity is not successful, vaccinations greatly reduce the number of serious Covid infections and rate of hospitalisation. It makes the case for vaccination stronger,” says Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-asks-delhi-to-vax-more-frontline-covid-workers/articleshow/82667195.cms||Sushmi Dey

While a senior minister has confirmed the news, the official order in this regard is expected to be released in a day or two. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “The state government will not hesitate in taking tough stands to bring down the cases of Covid-19 and save people. To this end, an RT-PCR negative report has been made mandatory for each individual attending a wedding, including the bride and the groom. The official order will soon be issued in this regard.” Earlier, 50 people were allowed in a wedding but taking into account the rising number of Covid-19-positive cases in Uttarakhand, the state government has restricted the number to 20 guests. The minister pointed out that the Covid-19 Curfew — which will remain in place in the state till May 18 — could be extended by a week. “We will soon hold a meeting and thereafter, an official announcement will be made on Covid curfew,” added the minister. Meanwhile, in a meeting with senior officials, CM Tirath Singh Rawat reviewed the Covid-19 situation in the state. The CM said that the availability of medicine kits should be ensured at all levels and the Covid-infected must be provided with necessary treatment.

---||Varanasi||BHU experts write to PM, send suggestions to combat third wave||Varanasi: A group of scientists and medical professionals from the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, working on Covid-19 has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggesting some specific measures to tackle the projected third wave and requested the PM to set up a virus surveillance centre in BHU. The experts, including Prof. Vijay Nath Mishra (neurology), Prof. Gyaneshwer Chaubey (zoology, molecular anthropology) and Prof. Abhishek Pathak (neurology), have been working on Covid-19 and claim to have published more than 10 international research papers on the subject. “Backed by our extensive study, we have some suggestions that can help tackle the expected third wave in India,” they said in the letter. “Our recent paper in the journal ‘Science’ conclusively shows that broken immunity wall was one of the main reasons for the surge of second wave,” said Prof. Mishra. In the letter dated May 12, the experts recommended monthly serosurveillance in hotspot regions like Mumbai, Delhi, Lucknow, Varanasi, saying it reveals the vulnerability of population towards infection. “In Varanasi, we noticed that as soon as the number of sampled people with antibodies dipped below 10%, more cases started to emerge,” said Prof Mishra. The experts further said their pilot study on patients who recovered from Covid showed that one dose of vaccine is enough to produce adequate number of antibodies, whereas those who were never infected need two doses. “Therefore, we suggest a single dose of vaccination to those who have recovered from Covid. This will save approximately two crore doses of vaccine,” they said. Prof Chaubey said the studies conducted in Israel, UK and the USA showed that even a single dose of vaccination effectively cut short transmission by 50-80%. “Therefore, we propose that the ratio in India for next three months for the first and second dose should be 70:30 followed by 60:40 in the following months,” he added. The group also stressed on the importance of virus surveillance in combating the deadly pandemic. “Virus surveillance is necessary and in North India, BHU can be a perfect centre for it. We have expertise but don’t have the required instrumentation. Hence, we request you to set-up a virus surveillance centre in BHU,” they urged to the PM in the letter. “We are fighting the virus with our full capacity and hope that recovery will improve significantly soon,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-experts-write-to-pm-send-suggestions-to-combat-third-wave/articleshow/82667185.cms||Binay Singh

They need to operate bank transactions regularly and, thus, welcome the move to keep banks open even if for limited hours. Nabin Chandra Dash, convener of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), West Bengal, told TOI that it would approach the state government for issuing special passes to bank employees so that they can commute. The SLBC has already written to railways for including bank employees in special trains like health workers. “During the last lockdown, the state government had co-operated with us, so it should not be a big problem,” he added. The Indian Banks Association directive says branches will now perform minimum activities like cash deposit and withdrawals, clearing of cheques, government transactions, remittances etc. The branches will operate with 50% workforce.

The hospital staff was abused and paver blocks were also thrown at them. Fortunately, none is reported to have been injured in the incident. Dr Jitendra Dhaneshwar, the nodal officer of the Bytco Hospital, said, “Somebody drove the car up the ramp that has direct access to the lobby of the hospital, despite the patients and relatives standing there and some on the beds in the adjacent areas.” The car damaged the glass at the entrance of the lobby of the newly constructed hospital and also the oxygen stretcher used for transportation of the oxygen tanks. Dr Dhaneshwar said that he had just left the hospital after the day-long duty and even before reaching home he was informed about the incident.

---||Dehradun||Have started giving ‘oxygen’ to 18-45, says Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had a slip of tongue on Saturday while speaking about the ongoing inoculation drive against Covid-19 in the hill state. Mistaking oxygen for Covid-19 vaccine, the CM said, “18 se 45 varsh ke navjawano ko oxygen lagna shuru ho gaya hai (The process of providing oxygen has started for people in the age group of 18-to-45 years).” However, he immediately realised the goof-up and clarified that he meant vaccines and not oxygen. Rawat made the aforementioned remark after inspecting a medical facility at Gopeshwar in Chamoli district. He also inspected the healthcare infrastructure in Rudraprayag district on the day and met with Covid-affected families. Meanwhile, the video of the CM's slip of tongue has now gone viral on social media platforms. This is not the standalone instance when the CM has stirred a controversy with his comments. Soon after taking oath as the Uttarakhand CM, he had announced that people coming to Haridwar Kumbh need not produce RT-PCR reports. The announcement disregarded the SOP issued by the Centre which made Covid-19 negative reports mandatory for Kumbh devotees coming from outside the state. Also, in one of his speeches, the CM had wrongly claimed that Kumbh Mela is held in Varanasi. The remark embroiled him in a social media storm. Besides, his comment on women wearing ripped jeans drew flak from around the nation. He had said that women who wear ripped jeans send out a wrong message to society. Subsequently, women across the country including many Bollywood celebrities had condemned the remark made by Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/have-started-giving-oxygen-to-adult-population-cm-rawat-makes-another-slip-of-the-tongue/articleshow/82665428.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Need dedicated vax portal for city due to snag in CoWin: PIL urges Bombay HC||Mumbai: Have a dedicated vaccine portal for Mumbai, a schoolteacher has urged Bombay high court, citing issues faced in booking slots on CoWin portal. “...CoWin portal is heavily ridden with numerous challenges which not only cause extreme difficulties but also extreme stress and mental trauma,’’ states the PIL by Yogeeta Vanzara who teaches at Bharda High School, Fort. Her petition says slots are shown “available at midnight and thereafter and yet booked within seconds of the same being offered to public.” CoWin requires login with a one-time password. Servers are unable to handle the load and after a long time when the password is received, vaccination centers are not displayed. On many occasions, centres are shown ‘not applicable’ and at once reflect as booked. If vacant slots are shown, the captcha code required to book the slot is not displayed or recognized by the system. “These difficulties are making it absolutely impossible for citizens to get a vaccination appointment in a hostile framework,” her PIL adds.The PIL, filed through her husband, advocate Rajesh Vanzara, informs that CoWin website has no facility to assist the disabled and does not indicate which centres are friendly for the wheelchair-bound “as a result of which extremely old patients or persons with physical handicap find it extremely difficult to choose a centre for vaccination”. Vanzara states that vaccines are administered in a “haphazard manner” whereby some citizens are permitted walk-in vaccination and those with appointment are deprived. Vanzara wants BMC to open booking slots only for centres where vaccines are available and a week ahead instead of wasting time of citizens on a daily basis. The PIL will be heard in due course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/need-dedicated-vax-portal-for-city-due-to-snag-in-cowin-pil-urges-bombay-hc/articleshow/82668892.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Police inspector remanded in honey-trap racket||AHMEDABAD: Additional chief metropolitan magistrate B H Ghasura on Saturday sent police inspector Geeta Pathan to custodial interrogation till May 19 after she was arrested for aiding a honey-trap gang. Currently posted as an inspector in Patan district, Pathan was earlier posted in Ahmedabad as inspector at Sabarmati Riverfront (East) and Women’s police stations. She was held on Thursday by city crime branch for allegedly helping a gang to extort money from at least five traders by threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases. She allegedly consumed sanitizer during custody which delayed her production before court by a day. Sources said that the police sought seven-day remand for the suspended cop on various grounds including the need to find out if there were more victims. This is because the police believe that there are many people who have not complained about the extortion, fearing defamation. Opposing the remand application, Pathan’s advocate Rafik Lokhandwala refuted the charges and submitted that enough evidence had not been placed to say that the inspector was part of the racket. He claimed that she was implicated on surmises and conjectures. He said there is no allegation that Pathan had either threatened, demanded, or received any money. He also argued that the fact she had consumed sanitizer to pressurize the police could not be considered grounds for remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pi-remanded-in-honey-trap-racket/articleshow/82667209.cms||---

He said since the central government took over the control of oxygen and medicine supply, it should have been distributed among states based on the number of active cases. But Modi government failed to do so, and Delhi and Rajasthan were at the receiving end.He said as against the requirement of 745 MT of oxygen, the state has been allotted only 360 MT which is highly insufficient.He said, “We had no dearth of money as people are coming forward to help, but the problem is lack of resources like oxygen and ventilators. If the ventilators there many lives could have been saved,” he said.Dotasra said the state Congress would launch a mass relief programme from May 21 on ‘Balidan Diwas’ of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He said Congress has been helping people during the pandemic through its control rooms at state, district and block levels since April 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dotasra-modi-behaving-like-pm-of-bjp-ruled-states-during-pandemic/articleshow/82668889.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

So on May 14, which was the first Friday after the curfew was put in place, the shop owners opened after a gap of four days and only for three hours (shops selling essentials are now allowed to open from 7am to 10am) and saw a huge rush of buyers. Ration shop operators have now requested officials to let the outlets be open on some other days as well, as the rush was putting both shopkeepers and buyers at risk. Ajay Porwal, a shop owner in Dharampur, said, “It’s tough to manage the crowd in a single day. The ration shops should be allowed to open for short durations at least thrice a week. In the present arrangement, maintaining social distancing is next to impossible.” Meanwhile, the Doon Valley Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal, a traders’ association, has also requested the government to sanction compensation for families of businessmen in Doon who lost their lives battling Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-days-once-a-week-not-enough-ration-shop-owners-demand-relaxation-in-shop-opening-timings/articleshow/82665434.cms||Abhijeet Singh

A total of 150 oxygen concentrators will be made available through TMC in a phased manner. The TMC runs two cancer hospitals — Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH) and Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre (MPMMCC) — in Varanasi. Both the units were inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 19, 2019. Director of HBCH and MPMMMCC Dr Satyajit Pradhan handed over the oxygen concentrators to the divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal at his camp office on Thursday. Chief administrative officer of the cancer hospitals, Madho Singh, deputy director of HBCH Dr. BK Mishra and assistant medical officer of Dr. Aakash Anand were present on the occasion. Spokesperson of the cancer hospitals Akhilesh Pandey said that the consignment was sent by the TMC, Mumbai to be used for the benefit of Covid patients of Varanasi and adjoining districts. Soon, 58 more oxygen concentrators would be handed over to the district administration, thereby contributing a total of 150 such equipment. Appreciating the contribution, the commissioner said that it would help a lot in making available oxygen in time to the Covid patients in Varanasi and other adjoining districts. The DRDO Covid Hospital, SSH and Trauma Centre of BHU Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and other government and private hospitals now have adequate treatment facilities for Covid in Varanasi. These oxygen concentrators will be used for timely delivery of oxygen to Covid patients at community health centres in the districts of Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Ballia, Chandauli so that their condition can improve promptly, he said. Deputy director of the Centre for Cancer Epidemiology and officer-in-charge of TMC Varanasi, Dr. Pankaj Chaturvedi said, “In the second wave of Corona, we saw that Covid patients needed medicines for better treatment, ICU beds and they are having problems due to lack of timely availability of oxygen. In such a situation, we decided that we should get help from Indian donors living abroad. In this work, Dr Naresh Ramarajan and Gitika Srivastava, the founders of Navya, have played a key role in collecting medical equipment from donors in the US. These medical equipment are now being transported to every nook and corner of the country.” According to him, apart from providing treatment to cancer patients, the TMC is also playing an important role in the fight against Corona across the country. Keeping in view, the increasing number of Covid cases across the country and the challenge of limited resources for treatment, the TMC led by the director Dr. RA Badwe started working on a war footing to contribute to the national efforts in fighting the pandemic. According to the TMC officials, under this arrangement, US-based NGO Community Partners International, Yusuf & Farida Hameed Foundation, Presbyterian Hospital in New York and other donors of Indian origin living in the US, as also Navya, an organization working with TMC to provide online cancer opinion, came forward to provide medical equipment to TMC. As a result, in a very short time, over 3,800 oxygen concentrators, three lakh N-95 masks and other medical equipment reached Mumbai by a FedEx 777 special cargo aircraft. These medical equipment are being transported to state government administrations and various hospitals across the country through TMC’s units such as, BBCI Guwahati, HBCH Sangrur, HBCHRC Visakhapatnam, HBCH Varanasi, MPMMCC Varanasi, ACTREC Navi Mumbai and TMH Mumbai. Prof. Girish Chinnaswamy of the department of paediatric oncology, TMH is playing a crucial role in coordination of the pan-India distribution activity of the equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/tata-memorial-centre-gives-92-o2-concentrators-to-admin/articleshow/82667217.cms||Binay Singh

In the last 28 days, 27 people have died, including eight due to Covid complications, in this village of 3,500 people. Health officials have conducted inspections twice, but are yet to figure out the reason for the fatalities. The latest death was reported at 7am on Saturday. The deceased, Sher Alam (38), was the 27th casualty since the spate of deaths began on April 16. Like many others, Alam did not have any illness or comorbidity. He died after complaining of severe chest pain. Every death creates fear among the 500 households. “Nobody is stepping out for groceries. The general shops remain closed even between the permitted time of 6am and 11am,” said Ashfaq Kaimkhany, a social activist based in Sikar, who is keeping tabs on the developments. Of all the casualties, eight had Covid and died because of complications while the rest did not have any symptoms, said the health office in Sikar. TOI repeatedly called up CMHO Ajay Choudhary and SDM of Lachmangarh Kulraj Meena for their comments but they did not respond. Health department surveys have ruled out possibility of community spread of Covid. Villagers have crowdfunded over Rs 20 lakh for vaccinationIts random sampling of RT-PCR reports has given a positivity rate below 10%, making it one-third of the state average. “Barring a few, the deceased were not related to each other. Unless a post-mortem is conducted, one can never come to any conclusion,” said a health department official. Locals have come forward to save their village from the unusual situation. The villagers have crowdfunded Rs 20 lakh for vaccinations.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Second wave grounds students’ study-abroad plans||AHMEDABAD: Jay Patel, an engineering student from Ahmedabad was set to pursue his postgraduate from a university in Adelaide in Australia in February this year. However, restrictions and consequent delay compelled him to defer his travel to Australia to July 2021. “I have begun with my course online from here itself. However, I am not quite comfortable with it. I won’t be able to go to Australia now as they have continued restrictions on entry of foreign students,” said Patel. With the second wave of infections and travel and other restrictions imposed by several countries, students aspiring to study abroad are in a fix. Explaining this, Anuj Parikh, director of a city-based foreign education consultancy firm, said, “Countries which have banned foreign students include the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Even Canada has temporarily shut its borders for foreign students but the visa process is still on. This has left most students in a fix as they are compelled to defer or cancel their foreign education plans.” Only ones to see the silver lining are students headed to the US. “Some 200 students who were affiliated with our consultancy firm have left for the US in the January intake. Those who still plan to go to the US are unaffected as restrictions have not been imposed yet on students who plan to go there to study. Even as the US government has announced a travel ban on India starting May 4, some categories of travellers including Indian students seeking to commence studies in American universities in the Fall semester of 2021, have been exempted,” said Parikh. Many students who were going to Canada are instead opting for online education but uncertainty continues to impact them. Preet Patel, an engineering graduate from Ahmedabad, said, “I had booked my ticket for May 12 but due to the travel ban I will have to reschedule. I will probably end up in July but the situation is way too uncertain. I will be attending half of my first semester online from India itself.” “Presently several students, who are travelling to the UK have to face cancellation of flights and are spending a huge amount for quarantine facilities managed by the government. Flights are operating on a limited basis as per government approvals,” said Ankit Mistry, operations head of a study abroad consultancy firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-wave-grounds-students-study-abroad-plans/articleshow/82667281.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Each of these students, who pursued various subjects, had to write at least two papers in January 2021 instead of July 2020 after the varsity postponed those exams due to severe Covid containment measures in the areas where the sub-centres are located. While all students who wrote exams in July have received their final results, the students from Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam are worried about their final results. They said that without the results they cannot apply for higher courses and job vacancies. “The exams were held in January, nearly six months since postponement, after much protest from the students who were affected. The varsity has assured that the results of all students, including those who took the exams in July, would be announced together and asked us not to worry. However, the results of students who took exams in July were announced by the end of January, while there was no intimation about our results. Over the last four months, we have approached the varsity many times but there was no update other than the assurance that it will be announced soon,” said a student studying in a college in Kottayam. Meanwhile, the varsity has cited pandemic and assembly polls as the reasons for the delay and said that the evaluation has already begun. “The exams were completed in February only and it took time to collect all papers and bring them to varsity. The papers have been sent for evaluation.

---||Kolkata||Relieved that fewer people would be infected over the next 2 weeks||Last year, I did resort to panic buying when the lockdown was clamped, stocking up staples, processed food, ready-to-eat and immunity-boosting products. It didn’t help much when the e-commerce outlets ran out of stuff. This time, I had a hunch about some curbs, in whatever form the government would deem, and was mentally ready for the curbs. Actually, as the number of cases surged, I knew that at some point or the other strict restrictions would be the only answer to easing the burden on the health system, which must be stretched. I am relieved that less people would be infected over the next two weeks at least. Having said that, I must confess that I did go on some kind of anxiety buying this evening, hours after the announcement came. I went to the local retail stores with a list of medicines. That’s the first thing that struck me, going by what we had experienced last year. My husband is a heart patient and needs his regular tablets. I ended up buying a whole month’s provisions, because I also have a hunch that the restrictions could be extended beyond May 30. Even as people will be keeping indoors, and staying safe, he, being a central government employee, will have to go out every day. Fortunately, the pandemic has changed our ways and we are now used to having goods delivered at our doorstep and ordering online most of the time. So, I am not panicking really, adept that I have become at handling the apps. We are also used to buying vegetables,and other daily essentials from the vendors who sit near our apartment. Not sure if they will be here sans any means of public transport. But these are individual sacrifices we all have to make for the larger common goal.

---||Nagpur||Vaccine availability should not be a state secret: Dr Vinay Nangia||The almost panic-like rush to get vaccinated and acute shortage of vials is a reality for India. Dr Vinay Nangia, a renowned eye surgeon who has also done a lot of research on epidemiology, says while there’s no magic wand to immediately change the current circumstances, transparent and long-term vaccination planning can help the government avoid a catastrophe. Dr Nangia believes vaccine manufacturers as well as state and central governments need to chart out vaccine production up to the next two years, its geographical distribution and then put this information in public domain. While talking to TOI, he says this is the best way to curb the panic among citizens and drive an efficient vaccination programme.Excerpts...Vaccine shortage is a reality, a problem accentuated by India’s population. Do you feel administratively things could have been handled differently?There are several planning parameters that need to be laid out bare in front of the community as we plan to protect ourselves. The GOI and the state governments should, through a detailed consultative process, provide a timeline of how many vaccine doses are likely to be available over the next 2-4 years. Who will manufacture which vaccine and how much. How much vaccine will be released to each state and how much to each district, city, taluka and village. All this future data must be put in public domain.So, being more transparent will help in controlling the chaos?This may be the first step to plan how many people we are going to vaccinate in how much time without the suspense of ‘when’, which is the biggest question on everyone’s mind. The percentage of people to be vaccinated over the next 6 months and over the next two years should be made public for each part of the country. Vaccine availability should not be a state secret. The more people know where they stand, the better it is.What role the vaccine manufacturers have to play in this process?Vaccine manufacturing is relatively an automated process with due precautions and safeguards. The vaccine manufacturers need to identify the dates on which they will release a particular number of vaccines to the relevant authorities, the GOI, the state governments and the private sector. The governments, on the other hand, need to inform the community the total number of vaccines to be provided to each district, each centre ahead of time, with very little guesswork.Apart from putting vial statistics in public domain, what strategy should the government be working on?We need to define what is “adequate vaccine coverage”. Is our target vaccination at 80% of the population or 100%. The government needs to define at what coverage will we as a community be safe. Also, are the lives of those who are unable to get vaccination a little less valuable. These are things which should be part of the government’s strategy for vaccination planning.Currently, it appears that majority of the people want to get vaccinated. Do you foresee that changing in the future once more vaccine is available?The United States has so far vaccinated 47% of its population with the first dose and 36% of its population with the second. India has vaccinated a little more than 10.2 % of its people with the first dose and 2.9 % with the second. The experience of the US tells us that reaching a coverage of 35% for vaccination is relatively easy and then the vaccine resistors and the naysayers seem to take over and the number of vaccinations tend to fall significantly. Now, the government needs to plan for such a situation developing in India too.While the pandemic’s second wave has ravaged many parts of India and government has fallen short of people’s expectations, do you believe that vaccination drive can redeem ourselves?Planned and efficient vaccination is the only redeeming parameter for us that may yet salvage our opinion about ourselves. The pandemic has taught us that we haven’t done so well. The scars of what has transpired in the hearts, minds and homes of many of us may not disappear quickly and may in fact never disappear. As the fifth biggest economy, we may not set the right tone when we suggest to the community that we may not have enough resources to purchase the vaccine. There should be complete clarity regarding this. It is pertinent that a master plan be created for the present and the foreseeable future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccine-availability-should-not-be-a-state-secret-dr-vinay-nangia/articleshow/82669009.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Accused Omvir and Pawan are both electricians working in the facility on a contractual basis. Additional superintendent of police ACB (Jaipur) Bajranj Singh said the duo had demanded Rs 1 lakh for a bed with all facilities from the complainant. According to the agency, the accused initially asked for Rs 10,000 advance from the complainant on Saturday. “The complainant was called at a particular place to hand over the amount. As soon as the duo received the amount, they were arrested,” said Singh. The agency questioned them on what basis they had promised a bed to the complainant. “Their phones have been seized and their houses raided to establish their link in the racket. We are also trying to figure out if they had provided beds to others in RUHS,” said the official, who hinted that without the help of senior officials at the hospital, both the accused were not in a position to offer a bed to anybody. Recently, a nursing staff of Metro Mass Hospital Ashok Kumar was arrested by police for accepting a bribe for providing a bed in RUHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-ruhs-staff-held-for-taking-bribe-to-provide-bed/articleshow/82669002.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Positivity rate more than 20% in 26 districts, Jaipur at 24%||JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s fight against coronavirus is facing a challenge as positivity rate reached a staggering 25% in total 13 districts in the state, despite the lockdown in the past six days. The overall positivity rate of the state between May 10 and May 15 has remained 23.60%. An official analysing the data said, there are seven districts in the state having a test positivity rate above 30%. Since May 10, when the lockdown was imposed, Sikar has emerged as the state’s new Covid-19 hotspot with 36% positivity rate, highest so far. As per the records, out of 8,287 fresh samples that were collected, 3,128 tested positive. It is followed by Ganganagar, where positivity rate is 35%. In Bharatpur, the positivity rate is 33%, while it has touched 32% in Alwar Positivity rate in Pratapgarh, Jaisalmer and Dausa is 32%, 31% and 31%, respectively. An official source said, “These districts have become infamous for mass public gatherings in recent days. The results are coming to fore. This is the reason the state government has enforced stricter curfews and more stringent lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus.” A health official explained a higher positivity rate is worrying as it suggests a higher prevalence of the disease. Explaining the test positive rate, he said, “This rate is the percentage of people who test positive for Covid compared to the total number of people who have been tested.” The test positivity rate in Jalore is meagre 4%, lowest in the state. As of May 15, 26 districts out of 33 have positivity rate of 20% or above. WHO says positivity rate should be lesser than 5% for effective containment of the pandemic. A source said, “The overall Covid situation may get better by May-end or June, only if people adhere to the guidelines. Otherwise, like other states such as Maharastra, the government will have no option other than extending the restrictions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/positivity-rate-more-than-20-in-26-districts-jaipur-at-24/articleshow/82668974.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt caps rates for hearse vans||New Delhi: After ambulances, Delhi government has now capped the rates for hearse van services too. It had come to notice last month that some hearse van operators in the city were charging exorbitant amounts. As per an order released in compliance of directions issued by Delhi High Court, the rates for hearse van facilities for Covid victims have been fixed at Rs 1,300 per trip for the initial 10 kilometres and Rs 100 per km thereafter. This will include the cost of transportation and services of the driver and attendant. The government has also fixed the maximum rate for the facility of body wrapping as per Covid protocol. It will be Rs 700 in addition to the transportation charges, the order states. In many cases, the entire family gets infected with the coronavirus and needs more helpers. For services of an additional attendant, a charge of Rs 500 has been fixed. “In case the services of an additional person are required by the family of a Covid-19 deceased patient to handle the body or wrapping of the body, the rate for the same would be Rs 500, which includes charges of safety gear to be worn by the additional person,” the order specifies. No extra charge for sanitisation will be taken by the vendor, the government has ordered. During the last 3-4 weeks, acute shortage of hearse van and ambulance services has been observed in the capital. In many cases, NGOs and social activists have come forward to help the distraught families. Jitender Singh Shunty, who runs Shaheed Bhagat Singh Seva Dal, said that they had received over 300 requests where families were unable to cremate the bodies. “While families were out of the country in some cases, members of the family of the deceased were themselves infected in many others. We livestreamed the last rites for such families,” he added. Meanwhile, to tackle the shortage of hearse vans, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has collaborated with Isha Foundation. Five hearse vans have been provided by the foundation for providing free services. “All these vehicles will be deployed at major Covid-designated cremation sites. The vehicles will help in transporting bodies from hospitals, Covid care centres and homes. A total of 13 vehicles are now deployed for this purpose,” said mayor Jai Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-caps-rates-for-hearse-vans/articleshow/82667380.cms||Paras Singh
---||Chennai||Coming forward to lend a helping hand||In This Hour Of Need, When People Are Searching For Hospital Beds For A Loved One, Daily Wagers Are Struggling To Make Ends Meet And Homeless Are Finding It Difficult To Get One Square Meal, It’s The Good Samaritans And Volunteers Who Are Making A Difference. Komal Gautham Speaks To Some Individuals And Groups About Their Crucial Role.Teaming up for medical helpAbout 10 days ago, Bhavana Rao, a 19-year-old student lost her father because she couldn’t find him a ventilator bed when his conditioned worsened after contracting Covid. While she is still battling with her grief, she realised that there are more like her who are desperately in need for a hospital bed. She wanted to help them and begun volunteering with the group – Chennai Cares, which is a collective of several city-based NGOs such as Bhoomika Trust, Banyan, Migrant task force, disability rights groups, media professionals, students and doctors. "A volunteer from the collective, Jenisha Rani spoke to me that night when I was desperately searching for a bed and reassured me that they would help me. That meant a lot to me. Even though I lost my dad, I thought the only way to honour him would be by helping others in need," she said. The group has been working for the past two months updating all the information regarding availability of beds, oxygen support, vaccination centres, screening centres and have helped about 2,000 people so far. This volunteer group of 70 people was just a team of 30 a few weeks ago."We ask people to fill a form and we send it to doctors and health experts who triage them. They suggest whether a patient requires a hospital bed or oxygen support. Then a team of volunteers who have details about hospitals, begin calling to look for a bed," said Jenisha Rani who is a HR professional. Even though her mother has Covid and is under home isolation, Jenisha is continuously working finding beds for people every day. The group was started as a Chennai rain relief during the Chennai floods. Slowly, they also got together for Kerala floods and when Covid struck in March last year, they decided to put out information and counter fake news. With many beginning to reach out to them for help, they began volunteering work. The requests which were about 15-20 per day became 200 per day last week.Music to heal and rescueWhen the mind goes numb, music helps to heal sometimes. This holds true for singer Chinmayi Sripaada, who has been using her online fan base to bring cheer and also help people affected by Covid.In the past two weeks she made 250 song dedications and performed at online corporate events and raised about `40 lakh including medical fees for four students. Last March, when requests to help people who were losing their livelihoods poured in, Chinmayi decided to do her bit. By June, she raised more than Rs1.6 crore. The money was directly to the individuals in need and NGOs, who used it for supply of food and sponsor of education. "It all started when a few drivers lost their jobs. Slowly many began calling to seek financial help. I have a good network of friends and NGOs. So I used my voice to help them. Also, with Covid comes isolation and loneliness. Birthdays and festivals were not being celebrated. So to make it special for people, I began wishing them on their birthdays and in return shared the contact of the person whom they could help," she said. This year with the second wave, many requests, especially for payment of school and college fees came in. "I have maintained a database of all those we have helped with each contribution accounted for. I only sing and the money goes directly to the beneficiary. Whether one contributes Rs500 or Rs5 lakh it means a lot to me as they are helping someone who is in dire need," she said. Lessons of giving back to the needyThis 38-year-old government school teacher knows what hunger means and how difficult it is to go to sleep with an empty stomach. That’s why when lockdown hit last year, when people were hurriedly stocking up, S Prabhakaran was noticed that the homeless in the city hardly had a chance at survival under the strict restrictions. And so he began distributing food to the needy and homeless.Working with Vanessa Peter of Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities, he began mapping the city’s homeless and started his food distribution journey. Born to a farmer in Tiruvallur district, Prabhakaran had studied in a government school and was dependent on the government’s noon meal scheme for his daily nutrition. Through his work he wanted to ensure that another child would not suffer in hunger. Major areas of distribution in the city include Parry’s and NSC Bose Road. The past two weeks have been busy for him, as he began reaching out to tribal communities in about 11 districts of the state. "First I used my savings to do this. Slowly, many friends and NGOs began supporting me and donating to the cause. My wife and I continue to cook meals for at least 500 people in the city. We use the funds to buy fruits, dry ration and vegetables for the poor. Since April we have supplied food and ration to about 18,000 individuals," said the teacher at KENC government higher secondary school in Manavalanagar, Tiruvallur. Inspired by him many of his colleagues have begun volunteering with him. Now they have begun sharing information on medical support, ambulances, oxygen beds and hospital bed vacancies as well on social media.Caring for the caregiversAs ambulances and patients queued up outside government hospitals in the city trying to get a bed or an oxygen cylinder, 41-year-old Srini Swaminathan noticed that neither of them had time to take a break to eat or drink. The ambulance drivers couldn’t get out for tea break as they were in queue and the attenders couldn’t leave the patients alone. So the private consultant for social development organization decided to tie up with local tea vendors and eateries.For the past two weeks, the group has been distributing tea, rose milk, butter milk, fruit mix and food packets to those who have to wait outside hospitals. "We have distributed about 3,000 tea and biscuit packets and about 1,000 food packets," said Srini. It all started with a cup of tea, explained, Srini. He was distributing food packets at Chennai central in March last year to guest workers from his own pocket after lockdown was announced. While doing so, he noticed that the workers wanted tea, but afford it. And the tea vendors at the stations were in tears as they had lost all business due to the lockdown. Connecting the two, Srini began paying the vendors to distribute free tea to the workers.This year, tea vendors Suresh Malaisami, Paramasivam, Marimuthu and food vendor Prem Kumar went to different hospitals to distribute tea, biscuits, chappatis and other snacks to frontline workers such as police personnel, nurses, ambulance drivers and patient attenders. Suresh said that he had just Rs776 in his bank account when Srini approached him. Prem Kumar had almost decided to shut his business and go back to his home town. But when Srini posted these stories online, many began contributing to the cause."I just keep track of the money transfers and take care of logistics," said Srini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/coming-forward-to-lend-a-helping-hand/articleshow/82661932.cms||---

In the extended lockdown and heavy rains, the vegetables will also perish, they averred. The hi-tech farmers had formed self-help groups to take up cultivation of high-value vegetables with the help of bank loans. They are not getting the price of even the previous lockdown season last year this time, due to lockdown. The farmers said that they are also not able to sell their vegetables in Tamil Nadu due to lockdown in both the states due to the spread of Covid-19. The harvesting had started from mid-April. They have demanded the government to procure the vegetables that was ready for harvest through the Kerala State Horticulture Development Corporation. They said even during last year’s lockdown they could produce 4,660 tonne of vegetables and sold it for Rs 9 crore. Before the lockdown, the vegetables were sold at Rs10 crore annually, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hi-tech-veg-farmers-in-dire-straits-due-to-lockdown/articleshow/82665475.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Just 15 sites in PMC limits & 8 in PCMC areas give jabs||PUNE: Increasing the interval between two Covishield shots may have deferred thousands of second-dose appointments in Pune, but the health department continues to grapple with the challenge of arranging enough Covaxin shots. On Saturday, just 15 vaccination centres were operational in the city, administering 100 second doses of Covaxin each, with a similar plan for Sunday. No Covishield doses were administered in PMC limits on Saturday, though scores of healthcare and frontline workers are due for their second Covishield shots. PCMC operated only eight centres, all administering only Covishield. District health department officials told TOI that the district had vaccine stock to last only till Sunday. A PMC official, on the condition of anonymity, said nearly 66,000 beneficiaries in the city were due for their second Covaxin dose. The civic body received only 3,000 doses on Thursday and no stock on Saturday. PMC will be able to vaccinate only 3,000 beneficiaries if it sticks to the same plan as on Saturday. “Vaccine availability is a major issue. We did not hold Covishield sessions on Saturday because we had no stock. We had received 3,000 doses of Covaxin a couple of days ago, and around 25,000 Covishield doses prior to that. All Covishield doses have been used up except for about 15 vials, which are insufficient for the number of people we have to vaccinate,” the official said. Each of the fifteen wards in the city had only one vaccination centre operational on Saturday. These sites were inoculating only those beneficiaries who had received their first Covaxin shot before April 15. A similar arrangement has been made for Sunday, and those due for second doses — having received first shots of Covaxin before April 17 — will be given priority, officials said. In Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, 1,600 Covishield doses were allocated — 800 each for both shots — for the 45+ age group. “We are currently running minimal centres on account of low vaccine stock. We don’t have any stock of Covaxin, and Covishield stock is only going to last for Sunday’s sessions,” a PCMC official said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the district has not received any vaccines from the Centre in eight days. “We had received about 9,100 Covaxin doses from the state’s kitty on Thursday. Before that, the state had sent 75,500 Covishield doses. It is uncertain, but we may get some stock on Sunday, though we have received no communication as to how many doses,” Dr Deshmukh. On Saturday, Pune district recorded the lowest vaccination rate in the past six days, at 6,365, health department data showed. The reason was vaccine shortage, said officials. Only 450 beneficiaries in the 60+ age group in the district got their first jabs, while 2,118 in this age bracket got their second shots. As many as 1,042 citizens in the 45-59 year group got the first shot, while 1,917 got their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-15-sites-in-pmc-limits-8-in-pcmc-areas-give-jabs/articleshow/82667389.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Rs 50L relief extended for cops & teachers who died of Covid||MUMBAI: With Maharashtra grappling with a second wave of the pandemic, the state government has extended to June 30, the Rs 50-lakh ex gratia for the families of its staffers, including schoolteachers and police personnel, who died on Covid duty. The scheme had lapsed on December 31, 2020. More than 220 teachers from civic, government and aided schools in the state have died of Covid-19, of which 200 deaths were reported in March and April, said Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad. TimesViewMaharashtra government’s decision to extend the time period of the scheme providing an ex gratia of Rs 50 lakh to the kin of government employees who died while on Covid-19 duty is a positive step. These frontline workers have been the footsoldiers in the battle against Covid-19 and many of them have lost their lives while on duty and supporting their kin is the least that the government can do. The state government should now ensure that the benefit under the scheme is received by the families and they are not made to run around completing paperwork.In Mumbai, 15 of the over 300 primary schoolteachers on duty at quarantine centres have succumbed to the virus. Teachers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have to do contact-tracing work, visit patients in home quarantine and double up as nurses and ward boys at quarantine centres. “Teachers are doing a lot of Covid-related work, but are not provided PPE kits,” claimed Darade, adding that the kin of teachers who died last year have still not received compensation. Primary schoolteachers complained that they have been work in Covid centres, while their colleagues from secondary and private schools have been spared on the grounds that they have too much academic work. Teacher unions have been asking the state to recognise the 25,000 plus teachers as frontline workers and get them vaccinated on a war footing. Meanwhile, DCP S Chaitanya, who is also Mumbai Police spokesperson, said that 115 police personnel, including 15 officers, have succumbed to Covid-19 in the last one year. “There is a definite increase in cases in the last few weeks and the department is taking efforts to augment health infrastructure for its staff,” he added. Two weeks ago, two Covid care centres in Kalina, and one each in Marol and Marine Drive were restarted for police personnel. In addition to ex gratia relief, families will be allowed to retain the service quarters till the date of retirement of the deceased cops. Maharashtra government had first issued the order of providing the Rs 50 lakh ex gratia assistance for its employees on May 29, 2020, and was effective till September 30, before being extended till December 31.

---||Kolkata||We are now used to ordering online and e-tailers are better equipped||I did go out shopping on Saturday afternoon to stock up some critical articles. I did check out at the local vegetable market and the grocery shop. Saw people massing inside and I dared not get off the car, fearing contagion. The new strain, I believe, infects more people. So I sent my daily help with a list, which included staples like dal, flour and rice in bulk. I also got other consumables like ‘dhanya’ and ‘mirchi’. I am now forcing myself to believe that we have enough to last two weeks. I wish the shops would be open in the afternoon and we could get fresh produce during this time. I am trying to reason with myself that we are now used to ordering online. I guess the e-retailers are better equipped than they were last year. They, too, must have been upgrading their system anticipating an imminent lockdown-like restriction because of the sharp rise in the number of Covid cases. So I am not panicking. At the same time, I must confess that there’s a slight tension — the fear that the latest curbs could stretch beyond 15 days. Children are at home 25x7 and their needs are more immediate. But I guess we will have to manage with whatever is available. The health system will collapse if the contagion chain is not broken immediately. Lockdown and restrictions are good to arrest the spread of the virus, but the government could have allowed essential shops to remain open in the evenings as well. Because of the limited hours to fetch essentials, shops will be more crowded and help spread the infection. My local kirana-keeper echoed the refrain, saying he was already finding it difficult to manage crowds around his small shop in the evening. I passed another grocery store. The billing counters were crowded and no social distancing norms were being followed.

---||Delhi||No bail for Tahir Hussain, court says he misused political clout to instigate northeast Delhi riots||NEW DELHI: AAP councillor Tahir Hussain used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning and instigating communal riots, a Delhi court said on Saturday while dismissing his bail applications in connection with two northeast Delhi riot cases. In a strongly worded order, the special court hearing riot cases said Hussain did not use his hands and fists but instigated rioters as “human weapons” who could have killed anybody. Additional sessions judge (ASJ) Vinod Yadav denied him relief citing the gravity of the offence and Hussain’s influence in the locality. The cases relate to gunshot injuries sustained by two men during the widespread riots in the city’s northeast area in February last year. “It is prima facie apparent that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration,” the ASJ said, adding that the allegations against Hussain are extremely grave in nature. “Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant, he cannot shy away from the fact that his building became the hub for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi,” the court said while hearing cases where two men alleged they sustained injuries after a riotous mob, which was pelting stones, throwing petrol bombs and firing gunshots from the terrace of Hussain’s house, fired upon them on February 25. “The spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a premeditated conspiracy. So, now when the applicant found himself up against the wall, he cannot pass on the buck by simply taking a plea that since he did not participate physically in the riots, he has no role to play in the riots,” the court noted. Dismissing the bail applications, the judge stated that Hussain permitted his house to be used by rioters to play havoc upon the persons of other community, indulged in terror funding and used persons as human weapons. The judge said that there is enough material on record to presume that Hussain was “very well present” at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community. It also cited “overwhelming evidence against him” adding that some suspicious money transactions had also been made from his bank accounts. It said the “apparent object of execution of such smaller conspiracy(ies) was to make the presence of a particular community felt, to create a rein of terror and to destabilise the law and order position, so that the central government could be made to succumb to their demands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-tahir-court-says-he-misused-political-clout-to-instigate-ne-delhi-riots/articleshow/82667424.cms||Abhinav Garg

These frontline workers have been the footsoldiers in the battle against Covid-19 and many of them have lost their lives while on duty and supporting their kin is the least that the government can do. The state government should now ensure that the benefit under the scheme is received by the families and they are not made to run around completing paperwork.In Mumbai, 15 of the over 300 primary schoolteachers on duty at quarantine centres have succumbed to the virus. Teachers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have to do contact-tracing work, visit patients in home quarantine and double up as nurses and ward boys at quarantine centres. “Teachers are doing a lot of Covid-related work, but are not provided PPE kits,” claimed Darade, adding that the kin of teachers who died last year have still not received compensation. Primary schoolteachers complained that they have been work in Covid centres, while their colleagues from secondary and private schools have been spared on the grounds that they have too much academic work. Teacher unions have been asking the state to recognise the 25,000 plus teachers as frontline workers and get them vaccinated on a war footing. Meanwhile, DCP S Chaitanya, who is also Mumbai Police spokesperson, said that 115 police personnel, including 15 officers, have succumbed to Covid-19 in the last one year. “There is a definite increase in cases in the last few weeks and the department is taking efforts to augment health infrastructure for its staff,” he added. Two weeks ago, two Covid care centres in Kalina, and one each in Marol and Marine Drive were restarted for police personnel. In addition to ex gratia relief, families will be allowed to retain the service quarters till the date of retirement of the deceased cops. Maharashtra government had first issued the order of providing the Rs 50 lakh ex gratia assistance for its employees on May 29, 2020, and was effective till September 30, before being extended till December 31.

This, the health watchers say, could lead to many cases going unreported, thereby, increasing the possibility of transmission of the virus in lack of contact tracing. Anoop Nautiyal, member of Social Development for Communities Foundation (an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 scenario in Uttarakhand since its outbreak), said, “Our Covid-19 testing figure is plummeting every week. According to the health department data, we tested 2,78,206 samples for Covid-19 in the 59th week of the pandemic. This dropped to 2,15,281 sample tests in the 60th week of the pandemic. Further, in the 61st week of the pandemic, we only tested 1,97,908 samples for Covid-19. Notably, in the 61st week, less than 30,000 Covid-19 tests were conducted per day on six out of the seven days.” He stressed that the constant dip in testing is a matter of grave concern and the health authorities must look into this. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand's cumulative Covid-19 case tally shot up to 2,83,239 after 5,654 fresh infections were recorded in the hill state on Saturday. The state also recorded 197 more Covid-related deaths, taking the toll of the virus to 4,623. Among the new Covid-19 cases, a maximum of 1,423 infections were recorded in Dehradun, followed by 464 in Haridwar, 384 in Udham Singh Nagar, 405 in Tehri, 482 in Pauri, 51 in Rudraprayag, 339 in Almora, 428 in Uttarkashi, 246 in Pithoragarh, 215 in Chamoli, 42 in Champawat and 138 in Bageshwar. “The state has recorded more than one lakh Covid-19 cases (1,02,718) and 1,934 related deaths in the last 15 days. The positivity rate has been 21.1% in this duration," added Nautiyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dip-in-covid-testing-in-ukhand-a-cause-of-concern-say-health-watchers/articleshow/82665490.cms||Ishita Mishra

The two tankers of Oxygen Express with 40 metric ton liquid oxygen departed from Durgapur on May 14 and reached Gorakhpur on May 15 at 12.10 at Gorakhpur’s Nakha Railway station and in the presence of Gorakhpur’s senior administrative officials the liquid oxygen decanting was done,” he said. The liquid oxygen was safely carried for the people of Gorakhpur and nearby areas and the oxygen express containers reached Gorakhpur without any delay and covered 840 km in only 12 hours. Apart from this, 3 oxygen Express tankers with 120 metric ton liquid medical oxygen have already reached NER’s Madho Singh railway station which was supplied in Varanasi and nearby areas, he added. “With 40 MT liquid medical Oxygen and local production of oxygen, sufficient oxygen for three days is now available for Gorakhpur and nearby 15 districts. Modi Chemicals and RK Oxygen in GIDA were producing 2000 cylinders of oxygen but with 40 MT liquid oxygen supply, 8000 oxygen cylinders would be filled per day. In only 12 hours we got liquid oxygen with Oxygen Express and without oxygen express it would have taken more time.” DM Gorakhpur, Vijyendra Pandiyan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/oxygen-express-reaches-gorakhpur/articleshow/82667404.cms||---

In the state, the BMC in Mumbai and the PMC in Pune have expressed interest to purchase vaccines from global suppliers. But health experts have said that unless these international vaccines are given permission to be deployed in India, they cannot be used in states. Dr Arora said the inclusion of new groups in the Covid-19 vaccination programme has put pressure on vaccine manufacturers. He said existing manufacturers will have to increase current capacity and new entrants will have to add to production estimates. This week, the BMC — Asia’s richest municipal corporation — became the first local body in India to float a global expression of interest to buy vaccines. Officials said interested suppliers will have to submit their bids by May 18, and they will be opened the same evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/global-orders-for-vax-may-not-work/articleshow/82667492.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Covid-19: 17 Maharashtra districts help average daily tally decline from pre-lockdown days||PUNE: Maharashtra has witnessed a 25% drop in the average daily Covid-19 infections, primarily driven by the decline in active caseload in 17 districts of the state, as compared to the figures during the week before the lockdown-like restrictions were imposed. Pune is among the 17 districts that have registered a reduction in the average daily cases as compared to the pre-lockdown week. “All the districts that had registered a high number of infections are showing a declining trend,” state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said. “Pune had registered a negative growth of around 8% last week. This week, it has registered a negative growth of 23.47%,” he said. “Maharashtra has seen an overall 25% reduction in daily cases as compared to the pre-lockdown week. “This means that the stricter regulations have yielded results,” he said. The lockdown-like restrictions were imposed in the state on April 15, which have now been extended till June 1. The state has assessed the average daily cases of two weeks — May 1-7 and May 8-14. “The districts that are yet to show a decline in infections will be the focus for the coming two weeks,” he added. At Friday’s weekly Covid review meeting in Pune headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the same issue was raised and it was decided to continue for now with the existing restrictions, besides emphasizing on stepped-up testing and contact tracing. Pune district is now conducting 3 lakh tests per million as against Maharashtra’s 2.34 lakh tests per million population. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said the overall positivity rate has been around 20-21% and the aim was to further reduce it with a special focus on the rural areas. In Pune district too, the Pune municipal areas have witnessed a decline in case since April-mid. It was followed by the higher recoveries, which helped bring down active infections in the district, health officials said, adding that testing has been ramped up in the rural areas, due to which more cases were coming to fore. State technical adviser Dr Subhash Salunkhe said the positivity rate should ideally be below 5%. “The lockdown-like restrictions have helped, but still there is a long way to go,” he said. An official said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would have a direct interaction with collectors of the districts, which continued to witness high positivity rate in Maharashtra, next week. The Centre on Saturday said Maharashtra was leading the list of states where the number of active cases has declined the most in a 15-day period starting May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/17-dists-help-average-daily-tally-decline-from-pre-lockdown-days/articleshow/82667396.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Markets vow to follow rules but fear crowding due to shorter hours||KOLKATA: Community markets will remain open only for three hours in the morning—7am to 10am—for the next two weeks from Sunday. Members of several market committees met on Saturday evening to work out a plan to avoid crowding inside markets and instruct traders to follow the guidelines. Several markets, which also have sari shops that can operate from noon to 3pm, will keep the gates open till late in the afternoon. “All shop owners have been instructed to strictly follow the guidelines. If they sell groceries, vegetables or milk and bread, they must shut down by 10am. Shops selling saris and other garments will open only at noon and shut by 3pm,” said Gouranga Pal, a member of College Street Market Traders’ Association. All KMC markets will also have to follow the state guidelines and down their shutters at 10am. Special vigil will be maintained on major civic markets, such as Kankurgachi, Maniktala, College Street, New Market, Lansdowne and Gariahat. “Any deviation from the norms will lead to penal action,” said a KMC market department official. Earlier, the state government had allowed community markets to stay open from 7am to 10am and then again, from 3pm to 5pm, which was later revised to 5pm to 7pm. Many market committees felt the shorter hours allowed for purchasing essential commodities might lead to panic buying or hoarding, which might not cause crowding but also create a demand-supply mismatch. On Saturday evening, most central Kolkata markets spilled over with people trying to buy before the restrictions came into effect from Sunday morning. “Everybody comes to markets to buy essential goods and that obviously leads to crowding. There are also shop owners, their employees, labourers and drivers in the markets. So, community markets are not the safest places because social distancing is not very easy to maintain. If the government curtails business timing, it will add to crowding and spread of the virus,” said the president of a market committee in south Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/markets-vow-to-follow-rules-but-fear-crowding-due-to-shorter-hours/articleshow/82667494.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Jaipur has an active caseload of 51,000 as of May 14 with 90% quarantined at home. In several cases, entire families are down with Covid and are depending on food from others. Homemaker Shashi Sharma has started an independent initiative of providing free meals to families which are down with Covid. She has been delivering 10-15 meals per day in areas such as Mahapura and Chitrakoot with the help of her husband Avadesh Sharma. “Five months ago, when my family suffered the infection, I realised how difficult for families to manage two meals a day. I then thought of doing something but didn’t realise that soon we will be facing a more severe second wave. I just circulated my number and have been getting request from the people/families,” said Sharma, who is providing meals for the last 45 days. The Abhyutthanam Society, a body working for the Right to Education Act (RTE), has converted its functioning into providing food to home isolated and hospitalised Covid patients along with the homeless. “The food has been set by a dietician and is prepared in well-equipped kitchens at Jagatpura and Kanodiya College. So far, the group is providing meals to 475 Covid patients in the city and it is home delivered by 25 volunteers in four and two-wheelers,” said Pranjal Singh of the society. United Muslim Aid, a group of organisations united to provide relief to the Covid patients, is providing 300 food packets during lunch and dinner at Rajasthan University of Health Sciences. “A pure vegetarian food is prepared for patients and their families at the state’s biggest Covid centre RUHS. Here, we have formed a station where food is kept and people have been asked to pick for their patients,” said Naim Rabbani, founder of UMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/individuals-ngos-deliver-food-to-people-down-with-corona/articleshow/82669093.cms||---

Miraculously, the 69-year-old mother of Pravinbhai Thakore, a constable at Vagdod police station, fought her own battle valiantly and won in just 10 days. After total 12 days of hospitalisation in Sariyad of Sarsati Taluka of the district, she was back home. Thakore fell critically ill on April 26 and had to be shifted to the Sariyad corona care centre which had begun functioning recently. “On admission, we found that her HRCT score was about 20, which meant 80 per cent of her lungs was infected and this brought her oxygen level down to 60 per cent. We had to inject her remdesivir and administer oxygen continuously for five days. With necessary injections and medicines, we also gave her physiotherapy which finally resulted in her miraculous recovery,” said Dr Mitheshbhai Prajapati. Her son was all praise for the caretakers at the hospital and said, “My mother escaped from the clutches of death thanks to prompt treatment from the doctors and good care from the nurses at the centre.

A senior police officer said Delhi Police had moved an application before the court to issue a non-bailable warrant against wrestler Sushil Kumar and six others who have been identified as suspects in the alleged murder. The application was approved on Saturday, the officer said. The wrestler who died was 23-year-old Sagar Dhankad. He and two of his friends, Amit Kumar and Sonu, were brutally assaulted allegedly by other wrestlers inside the stadium in northwest Delhi on the night of May 6. According to police, the brawl took place over vacating a flat in the Model Town area. The victims had alleged that Kumar was present at the spot when the clash took place. Police are raiding Kumar and his associates’ possible hideouts to arrest them. According to cops, the brawl involved Kumar, Ajay, Prince Dalal, Sonu, Sagar, Amit and others. A case was registered under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act at Model Town Police Station. Dalal (24), a resident of Jhajjar in Haryana, was arrested a day after the murder.

Towards resolving some of them, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) is holding a meeting with officials of water resources departments of both states on May 25. Official sources said that the board is likely to finalise water allocations to both the states for 2021-22 year beginning on June 1 and also discuss the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project taken up by AP. While the KRMB and the Telangana government are insisting on inspection of RLIP, the AP government is opposing this as it wants its objections on Telangana projects are resolved first. The KRMB’s last meeting (virtual) was held on March 9, but ended abruptly due to technical glitches. Though it was decided to hold a meeting within two to three weeks, it did not happen due to second wave of Covid-19 in the country. Now, the board will allocate water for irrigation purposes and also meet drinking water requirements of both the states. Both the Centre and KRMB are unhappy with Telangana and AP as they have not submitted detailed project reports (DPRs) of various projects taken up and completed in their respective states. The authorities are likely to seek DPRs from the states and the issue of finalisation of jurisdiction of KRMB is also expected to come up for discussion. Telangana has often expressed reservations over KRMB’s jurisdiction. The issue of allocation of funds for the KRMB is likely to come up for discussion at the meeting. As per the agreement, both the governments have to share KRMB budget every year. For 2021-22 year, the board has reportedly indicted its budget at Rs 18 crore but both Telangana and AP have not released the funds. In the previous financial year 2020-21, the board sought Rs 8 crore and only Telangana released its share. “The amount is required for installing telemetry, pay salaries and meet other expenses along with shifting of KRMB office to Visakhapatnam if okayed,” official sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/krmb-meet-on-may-25-to-resolve-t-ap-water-issues/articleshow/82667479.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kanpur||Ex-IAS booked for misleading tweet on floating bodies in Ganga||Kanpur:A former bureaucrat turned activist has been booked by the Unnao police for allegedly making false propaganda against the state government by tweeting a seven-year-old photograph of human bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be recent ones spotted in the river in Ballia. In an FIR lodged at Unnao Sadar Kotwali police station, the 1982-batch former IAS officer, Surya Pratap Singh, has also been accused of claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the Ganga banks at Unnao using JCB machines and without performing last rites as per Hindu rituals. Police said the case against Singh was lodged on May 13 following several complaints made by locals of the district. Police said, the ex-IAS officer had tweeted the picture of floating bodies and wrote in Hindi, “Tairati laashon aur ukharhtee saanso kaa UP model (The UP model of floating bodies and gasping breaths).” Inspector Sadar Kotwali Dinesh Chandra Mishra said, “The case against Singh has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Information Technology Act, Disaster Management Act and UP Public Health and Epidemic Diseases Control Ordinance, 2020 for his said tweet.” Elaborating over the FIR, the inspector said the case against Singh was registered on the complaints by various city locals. He said that the locals also accused Singh of exaggerating the issue and claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the riverbank for which JCB machines were used. He also accused that the dead were buried without performing their last rites, which is an insult to the Hindu religion. He further said the complainants also accused the former bureaucrat of mocking at the state government wherein he stated that is this the Yogi model of governance where the living ones fail to get the treatment and the dead ones their last rites. “By making such an irresponsible tweet, he vitiated the atmosphere of the district. Also, during preliminary probe, the tweet was found to be misleading with old pictures of Unnao which he referred to as that of Ballia,” Mishra said and added, “The Social Media Cell of the Unnao Police found that the photograph tweeted by Singh dated back to January 13, 2014, in which around 100 bodies were seen floating on the Ganga in Unnao’s Pariyar Ghat.” Meanwhile, the ex-IAS officer, countering the registration of FIR, in a fresh tweet on Saturday morning at around 9:17 am, said, “Today, another case has been lodged by Unnao police against me. Unnao police claim that the tweet made by me was a misleading one. The Yogi government had given me two FIRs as a gift in the past two days. I have been booked under 153, 465, 505, 21, 54 and IT Act 67, which is a reward for me for exposing the UP Model. I just wanted to know were there no bodies floating in river Ganga in Unnao?

While a few leaders have shot off letters to the Congress high command on Eatala episode and supported the former minister, some leaders like P Kaushik Reddy have questioned senior leaders for backing him. TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy have spoken in favour of Eatala and how he was being victimised by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. Party leader from Huzurabad, the assembly constituency represented by Eatala, P Kaushik Reddy is openly calling the former minister a ‘land grabber’. Kaushik Reddy, who is being touted as a Congress candidate in the event of a bypoll in case Eatala quits as an MLA, has also been issuing various statements against Eatala. While Kaushik Reddy has been levelling charges, Eatala has been meeting Congress leaders, including CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and Dasoju Sravan. Apart from Revanth, party MLC Jeevan Raddy and MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy have been supporting Eatala and alleged that the CM should order a probe into land grabbing charges against other ministers. Former MP Ponnam Prabhakar sent a letter to Uttam and Telangana affairs incharge Manickam Tagore seeking a clarity on Congress stand vis-a-vis Eatala. On the other hand, Kaushik Reddy denied hobnobbing with the TRS and said he would not leave Congress. Karimnagar district ministers Koppula Eshwar and Gangula Kamalakar, who targeted Eatala soon after he was ousted from the cabinet, have gone silent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/infighting-in-t-congress-over-support-to-eatala/articleshow/82667490.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Eatala alleged that his supporters are being harassed and threatened with false cases. “Like a flock of sheep attacked by foxes, Huzurabad elected representatives are being targeted by the minister and forcing them to issue statements against me. They are threatening the elected representatives that they won’t be paid bills for the works taken up in their areas,” he said. Kamalakar on Friday held a meeting with chairpersons of Huzurabad and Jammikunta municipalities in Huzurabad assembly constituency, represented by Eatala, along with councillors, elected sarpanches, MPTC and ZPTC members. Eatala claimed that though some leaders are issuing statements against him under duress, they are very much with him in his fight. The former minister said he is undeterred by such moves. “Stop playing such cheap tricks and instead focus on treating Covid-19 patients. When AP was united, some leaders resorted to such attempts and failed,” he told TRS leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-trains-guns-on-gangula-says-focus-should-be-on-covid/articleshow/82667500.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The incident came to light when the youth tweeted about the incident, tagging the DGP and minister KT Rama Rao. Venu’s father said his son, who works in Hyderbad but was had come home due to illness, was guarding the crop as no labourers were around. As he was guarding the crop, two policemen in civilian outfit approached and questioned him as to why he was not wearing a mask. They then called the sub-inspector who rushed to the spot and started beating up Venu with a plastic pipe. The cops then took Venu to the police station where they allegedly threatened him. They then took his signature on a blank paper and sent him home. Locals staged a protest over the incident and demanded the SI’s expulsion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youth-beaten-up-by-si-for-not-wearing-mask/articleshow/82667510.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Must extend side-effects monitoring to 28 days after vaccination: Top official||PUNE: All states should monitor vaccine recipients for Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) for 28 days, a top public health official has said. Currently, recipients are monitored for AEFI for the first 72 hours after receiving a jab. Dr NK Arora, member of the national AEFI Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) committee, said with more vaccines set to enter the market, monitoring for side-effects should be enhanced. He added that all AEFI data will soon be up on a public portal, a move many health experts have been calling for. Dr Arora said out of seven crore vaccine recipients assessed so far, less than 0.5% cases have involved severe AEFIs. "We have submitted detailed analyses to the government. The data should be out soon," he said. He said that longer monitoring durations was essential and was the norm in many countries. "All states should direct local authorities to develop a mechanism which will allow recipients to report side effects for 28 days. This system should record such events and update them on the CoWIN website," he said. Many health experts have called for the release of AEFI data. They said that publicly available information on side effects can help reduce vaccine hesitancy. All the Covid-19 vaccines are new and experts said extensive follow-ups are needed with recipients to look for unusual adverse events. There are five types of AEFIs: vaccine product-related reaction, vaccine quality defect-related reaction, immunisation error, immunisation anxiety-related reaction and coincidental event. It's the job of the national AEFI committee to determine the type of event a recipient has suffered from. Earlier this week, the Centre said the country can expect to have 25-30 crore doses available per month with international vaccines arriving too. "The companies will be carrying out bridging trials with 1,500-1,600 volunteers at different sites for Johnson and Johnson and Novovax. These trials will be carried out even as the vaccines are being utilised," Dr Arora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/extend-side-effects-monitoring-to-28-days-top-official/articleshow/82672864.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Gurgaon||After positive response, Gurugram plans more drive-ins||GURUGRAM: Just like the first, the city’s second drive-through vaccination site also witnessed a large turnout for the 300 Covaxin doses that were available with vaccinators at Ambience Mall on Saturday. More drive-throughs will be held. Officials indicated these sessions would mostly be administering Covaxin, which has a shorter recommended gap between two shots. Exclusively for those 45 and above who needed to take their second dose of the Bharat Biotech vaccine, for which the second shot window begins after 28 days, people began driving in early morning. With an estimated 600 cars queuing up, the number of people who eventually had to return without a shot would be about the same as the number of people who got it. The drive-in works on the first-come, first-served principle. “The response has been tremendous as people prefer to get vaccinated in their cars, which limits their exposure. We are now emphasising on Covaxin second doses since the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield has been increased to 12 weeks,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “We are going to organise another drive-through vaccination site at DLF Cyber Hub on Sunday for the second dose of Covaxin. We will administer 200 doses of Covaxin to those aged above 45 and above there.” On Saturday, a total of 4,678 people were vaccinated at 43 session sites across the city. Of them, 3,660 were aged between 18 and 44 years, while 894 were above 45 years and above. Moreover, 52 healthcare workers and 72 frontline workers were also inoculated. “I reached the vaccination site at 9.30am and got the jab around 1.30pm. There were around 150 cars ahead of me,” said Nikhil Alva, a resident of Ambience Island. Others who queued up at the vaccination centre said that there should be a mechanism to know as to how many doses are left at the session site. “I got my first dose of Covaxin on April 3. As soon as I got to know about the drive-through vaccination facility, I decided to get the second dose from here,” said Vinod Agarwal, a resident of Sector 56.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/more-drive-ins-likely-to-focus-on-covaxin/articleshow/82669282.cms||Vishakha Chaman

They also said the two trading zones would continue to operate throughout the next 15 days to ensure regular supply to retail markets. Posta and Burrabazar are the biggest wholesale hubs for grains, flour, rice, spices, oil and other essential commodities. In a meeting with the representatives of the markets on May 10, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had urged the traders to make people in the state did not face any food crisis. “During our meeting, we had promised the chief minister that Posta market would continue to operate during this pandemic and that we would see to it that the city did not face any food crisis. The Posta market will stay open even during the days of restrictions. We have enough stock for the coming days and much more is in transit,” said Biswanath Agarwal, secretary of the traders’ association in Posta. But wholesalers are worried about keeping back labourers and drivers, who form the backbone of the market in transporting and shifting goods. Last year, more than half of the workforce had returned to their villages in neighbouring states as soon as the lockdown was announced. “This time, we are providing them with food and arranging for their accommodations so that working in the market is not disrupted. We are also distributing masks and sanitisers. As soon as the government starts giving the first dose of vaccine, we will organise a camp and get all of them vaccinated,” said Chandan Chakraborty, president of the traders’ association. The association has also started checking temperature of drivers bringing goods from other states. “Almost all shops in the market are opening daily. In the next few days, we will have to see whether retailers can visit the market or not because public transport is suspended. Even several drivers and labourers might go to their native places,” said a wholesaler.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/posta-burrabazar-have-enough-stock-more-to-come-in-traders/articleshow/82667513.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted on 4,500 volunteers aged 18 years and above, the health regulator said. The study request was made by Precis Farmacêutica, Bharat Biotech’s partner for Brazilian market. Volunteers will be given two doses, 28 days apart. The Brazil leg of the trial will take the total number of volunteers in Covaxin’s global study to around 30,800. Anvisa said that before granting the study authorisation, it analysed data from previous stages of product development, including non-clinical studies in vitro and in animals, as well as preliminary data from ongoing clinical studies. The results obtained so far have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for the vaccine candidate, it said.

---||Mumbai||Goa, Kerala get 2 oxygen tankers each from Maharashtra||Mumbai: Maharashtra has come to the rescue of Goa and Kerala during their oxygen crisis. In the wake of an urgent message from the Centre, the state government has provided two oxygen tankers each to Goa and Kerala. Maharashtra has a total of 323 tankers for transportation of oxygen. “We have supplied 18 MT oxygen to Goa, while two empty tankers, with a total capacity of 28.5 MTs, have been given to Kerala for transportation of oxygen. For Goa, it is only one-time supply of oxygen, while our empty tankers will remain with these states,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI. The official said more than 75 persons had died in Goa in the last week due to shortage of oxygen, while Kerala too was facing a more or less similar situation. “In view of specific instructions from the Central government, the state government stepped in and asked transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne to make arrangements for oxygen tankers. Accordingly, oxygen was provided to Goa, while empty tankers were dispatched to Kerala. Though we have given oxygen to Goa, it will not have any adverse impact on the requirement of oxygen within the state,” the official said. A senior Food and Drug Administration official said Maharashtra requires nearly 1,700 MT oxygen for an estimated 55,000 patients, and the state is just able to meet its oxygen requirements. “For Goa, it was one-time supply. Our daily requirement of oxygen is 1700 MT and we have been able to manage the situation. Barring a few districts, we are not facing any shortage,” the FDA official said. Elaborating on the daily oxygen supply, the FDA official said currently, 125 MT comes from Gujarat, 130 MT from Bhilai, 50 MT each from Karnataka and Orissa, while 1,350 MT comes from domestic production. “Karnataka was supplying us 130 MT, however, following directions from the Centre, it was reduced to 50 MT,” the official said. The FDA official said CM Uddhav Thackeray had drafted an ambitious ‘Mission Oxygen’ policy for providing oxygen to hospitals across the state. “We expect that as per the new policy, we will produce at least 3000 MT of oxygen in a time-bound manner. We have roped in all the district collectors for the purpose. They have been asked to set up oxygen plants in each district,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/goa-kerala-get-2-oxygen-tankers-each-from-maharashtra/articleshow/82669273.cms||---

Instead of the groom going to fetch the bride and then returning, which would have caused people — baratis — moving out twice, the brides came to their new home with less than five persons, wed the grooms and stayed put in the village. Swala village, with a population of around 350 people, was declared a containment zone on May 11 after almost 50 people tested Covid-19 positive. However, two weddings, which had already been fixed, were allowed to be solemnised. Priyanka Binwal of Punabe village was to marry Prakash Bhatt of Swala on May 12. It was decided that the bride would go to the groom’s village. After getting the go-ahead from a district administration official, Binwal left for Swala with her father, mother, a priest and a driver. Binwal stayed back, the four others returned to Punabe and into quarantine. A second wedding was solemnised on Friday. Ishwar Datt of Swala village was to wed Preeti Bhatt. Bhatt and her parents reached Swala and concluded the ceremony. Her parents are now in home isolation in their village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/when-wedding-is-a-one-way-traffic-in-ukhand-containment-zone-brides-come-to-wed-grooms/articleshow/82664046.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Dehradun||Haridwar: No record of 65 deaths at Haridwar Covid hospital||DEHRADUN/HARIDWAR: The Uttarakhand state health department has issued a notice to Baba Barfani Hospital in Haridwar -- set up as a dedicated Covid healthcare centre (DCHC) to cater to patients during Kumbh -- for hiding details of around 65 patients who died during treatment there between April 25 and May 12. State Covid control room head Abhishek Tripathi said the lapse is being viewed "extremely seriously" by the health department and an explanation is being sought from the chief medical officer (CMO) of Haridwar district as well as the hospital officials. Sources told TOI that a total of 75 deaths took place at the hospital since it became operational from April 1, when the Kumbh officially started in Haridwar. However, data of only 10 deaths was shared by the hospital with state Covid control room authorities. Asked about it, Anshul Singh, the IAS officer who's currently the nodal officer of the hospital, said, "It is being investigated how it never reached the control room. "He added: “We were sharing the data with the CMO, district administration as well as Kumbh Mela officials on a regular basis. The lapse probably happened as the doctors who were uploading the data were from UP and they went back to their original postings as soon as the Kumbh ended on April 30. By the time the new doctors could get the log-in and other details, there was delay in uploading the data. But we never hid the deaths.” Singh said, "Of the 65 deaths at the hospital during this period, 90% were critical and needed ICU but due to unavailability of ICU beds, we were providing them with high-flow oxygen and they died in need of intensive critical care which is not available with us. Patents admitted were mainly locals from Haridwar district." The hospital was initially started as a 500-bed Covid Care Centre (CCC) but was later revamped as a DCHC with 120 beds, all connected with oxygen. Meanwhile, taking note of the delay in sharing data of Covid deaths by many hospitals in the state, secretary (health) Amit Negi issued a circular on Saturday for all hospitals --private and government -- asking them to ensure proper and regular data sharing with the state Covid control room or else face action under the Epidemic Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/65-patients-admitted-at-haridwar-covid-facility-towards-end-of-kumbh-died-in-need-of-critical-care-but-deaths-never-recorded/articleshow/82664034.cms||Ishita Mishra

Locals started protesting against the demolition of the old bridge before a new one is constructed. Some residents in the area were in favour of demolition of the old bridge. A team of SMC officials and elected representatives visited the location recently when locals complained about water logging in the area. A survey found that due to the Madhav Baug bridge, water from the rivulet gets blocked leading to waterlogging in the area. “The level of the bridge is low and it is a private bridge constructed by the developer in the area. It is blocking the rivulet water leading to waterlogging in the area,” said an officer in Limbayat zone, SMC. He further said that when SMC team went to inform locals about the demolition of the bridge, they started to protest as it is used by over 6,000 people. “Some are in our favour,” said the officer. Meanwhile, protesting locals claimed that SMC should have started construction of the new bridge first. “If the existing bridge is demolished, what will people do this monsoon? We will have to take a longer route to cross the rivulet. Monsoon will start soon, but the new construction will not take place then,” a local resident alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/parvat-patia-residents-protest-demolition-of-bridge/articleshow/82665613.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Legal experts find recent judgment against SC stance on ‘live-in’ relationships||Chandigarh: The recent decision of the Punjab and Haryana high court refusing to grant security to a runaway couple living in a “live-in” relationship has spurred outrage among the lawyers and the civil rights activists. In its order dated May 12, Justice Anil Khsetarpal of the HC had held that if directions for the protection of a runaway couple, living in “live-in relationship,” is granted, the social fabric of the society would get disturbed. “Petitioner No 1 (girl) is barely 18 years old whereas petitioner No 2 (boy) is 21 years old. They claim to be residing together in a live-in relationship and claim protection of their life and liberty from the girl’s relatives. In the considered view of this bench, if such protection as claimed is granted, the entire social fabric of the society would get disturbed,” Justice Kshetarpal had observed while refusing to grant any protection to the couple. In this case, the couple had claimed to have been living in a “live-in relationship” without marrying each other and had moved the high court to protect their lives from the girl’s disapproving family. According to the lawyers and rights activists, such orders are in complete disregard to the law laid down by the Supreme Court that has recognized live-in relationships and also jeopardize the life of a couple under threat from their relatives. According to senior advocate Anupam Gupta, the order passed by Justice Khsetarpal is in violation of judicial discipline. The live-in relationships were clearly recognized by the apex court way back in 2010 in Veluswamy’s case and again in 2013 in Indra Sarma’s case. “By disregarding the law laid down by the SC, Justice Khsetarpal has chosen to express a contrary view in a summary one-liner. Apart from being legally indefensible, his view is socially and culturally retrograde,” reacted the lawyer. Rohit Sud, former secretary of the Punjab and Haryana high court bar association, said the issue before the judge was to see the threat to the life and liberty of the couple and not to decide about the legality of their relationship. “Another important issue, in this case, is what the couple would do if they do not have enough resources to approach the higher court for security and would be forced to live in constant fear of their relatives who are against their relationship,” Sud added. Another HC lawyer, advocate H S Bath said that on merit, it is an illegal order because the couple had asked for protection of their life and liberty and had not asked for the certificate of their relationship. “Their relationship may be immoral but the court’s job was to see the legal point not the morality,” Bath added. Advocate Lekh Raj Sharma, former chairman of the state bar council of Punjab and Haryana, said that the protection to the couple could not have been denied in this case. “They may have true apprehensions regarding the threat to their life and who will be responsible if tomorrow something has happened to the couple. The court has caused a major legal injury to the couple,” said Sharma. HC a safe haven for runaway couples The cases of runaway couples are being entertained by the Punjab and Haryana high court since October 2002 when the then Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana high court, Justice BK Roy set the precedent by granting protection to every runaway couple who approached the HC. In July 2012, the HC had empowered the deputy commissioners (DCs), superintendents of police (SPs) and the district and sessions judges to protect the life and liberty of these couples, whenever approached. However, the couples still are approaching the HC. In a majority of the cases, the petition is filed by the girl fearing a threat to her life for marrying a boy of her choice. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, around 100-120 cases by runaway couples seeking protection were heard by the HC daily. Even during the restrictive hearing of cases during the pandemic, around 20-25 such cases were being heard by the HC benches via virtual hearing. Notable cases of runaway couples >In the Manoj-Babli case, the couple had married in a Chandigarh temple in April 2007 and procured protection orders from the Punjab and Haryana high court. However, in June 2007, the couple was dragged out by the accused from a crowded bus and murdered for marrying in the same gotra. In this case, the police provided for the couple’s protection by the HC orders, had abandoned the couple > On a local khap’s diktat, Ved Pal of Haryana’s Kaithal district, who had married Sonia in May 2011, was lynched. In this case, the warrant officer of the high court was also injured by the relatives of the girl’s family, when he went to protect the couple >In April 2012, a lesbian couple from Punjab’s Bathinda district fleeing their families moved the HC and sought protection from their relatives. In this case, the HC directed the Bathinda SSP to look into the threat perception of the couple and provide protection, if necessary >In February 2010, a couple from Haryana’s Jind district, who had married against the khap norms, were chased and thrashed by their relatives in the high court premises. At that time, the girl was pregnant and had been given protection by the Chief Justice on her mercy appeal.

---||Nagpur||Drive-in vax turns walk-in on Day 2 as NMC allows spot regn||Nagpur: The twin drive-in Covid-19 vaccination event, which began with fanfare on Friday, became a walk-in on Day 2. Like in some other cities, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) too had got state permission to inoculate people arriving in vehicles and it set up the facility in the parking lot of Glocal Square Mall (Sitabuldi) and VR Mall (Rambagh). Though online appointment was mandatory, the NMC allowed those who walked in to take the jab. “Despite online appointments, we were made to wait in a queue. No preference was given even though I requested the staff at Glocal Square Mall,” said a beneficiary. According to NMC officials, many walked in after parking their vehicles and no separate lines could be formed. “Since vehicles cannot be parked on the Glocal ramp, the four-wheelers were stopped on the ground floor. To save their time, we asked beneficiaries to register first, go back to their vehicles and then drive in for the jab. But they preferred to stay back. So we arranged chairs, drinking water, tea, biscuits for the senior citizens,” they said. Meanwhile, the NMC will be able to continue inoculation of 45-plus citizens on Sunday as it managed to procure doses from zilla parishad (ZP) which has sufficient stock. Until evening, this was uncertain. Going by more than double the number of people who got vaccinated on Saturday, the drive-in plan seems to have clicked. The NMC is now exploring at increasing the venues. Totally 281 were administered the vaccine at the malls — 150 at Glocal and 131 at VR Mall. On Friday, correspondingly it was 105, 85 and 22. As per the NMC record, 53 at Glocal and 14 at VR Mall were from the 45-59 age group. Also on Saturday, the NMC resumed administering the first dose of 45-plus at 99 centres. This had taken a hit till May 12 due to lack of doses. As many were in the waiting, the civic body allowed the second dose on May 13 (14,519). The number of beneficiaries declined to 9,548 on May 14 as the central government increased the gap from 6-8 to 12-16 weeks for those availing Covishield. On Saturday, the number of beneficiaries surged to 14,468 — 7,523 1st dose and 6,945 2nd. As the NMC was left with only 5,000 doses on Saturday, its chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar talked to ZP officials and managed to get 7,000 doses of Covishield and Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drive-in-vax-turns-walk-in-on-day-2-as-nmc-allows-spot-regn/articleshow/82668928.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Restaurants ready with delivery fleet||KOLKATA: With stricter restrictions ready to be imposed on the city from Sunday to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, restaurants across the city are getting ready to continue their home-delivery services and expect it to do better than last time. While most have released a majority of their employees, core teams have been retained to serve at the kitchen and to deliver food. Several have created their own delivery teams to supplement the services provided by delivery apps. “Last year, when it happened, we were concerned but our delivery sales were quick to pick up and we could sustain,” said Shiladitya Chaudhury, founder-director of Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2. He added they were “all geared up to deliver all over Kolkata”. “We have added new bikers to our fleet. We are expecting the home delivery and online sales to fetch us about 40% of usual business.” Mocambo on Park Street, too, has employed a set of its restaurant workers to deliver food on bikes to all corners of the city. “While we continue to partner with delivery apps, we have created our own set of delivery people. There is no area restriction,” said Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari. Trincas on Park Street, too, has introduced its own delivery service. “Buyers can order on apps or call us for delivery. We expect our sales to be around 40% of normal times,” said Aminia director Kabir Azhar. Smaller eateries that depend on apps are, however, staring at an uncertain fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurants-ready-with-delivery-fleet/articleshow/82667552.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Curbs necessary to break virus chain, say experts||KOLKATA: Doctors and health experts appealed to citizens to make a small sacrifice by staying indoors and adhering to restrictions, announced by the government on Saturday to stave off the healthcare crisis that the state currently confronts. “Please stay at home. Do not step out unless it is a life and death situation. This is a life and death situation right now. It is imperative that everyone understands the gravity and stays home. If you absolutely must step out, wear a proper mask in the proper way and maintain physical distancing. Only if we are able to manage these restrictions on movement of people will we be able to emerge from this crisis,” said pulmonologist Sivaresmi Unnithan. While the restrictions will not reduce infectivity, it is aimed at breaking the chain of infection and slow down the active case load that has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure. Hospital beds and ICUs are full, oxygen cylinders aren’t available in the market, medicines are out of stock, and doctors and nurses are fatigued. Though the government and private hospitals have been constantly ramping up bed capacity for three weeks now, the sharp rise in case load has meant that additional beds have got filled up in no time. “This is the only way to temporarily break the chain and give relief to the healthcare sector that is completely saturated. Usually, such restrictions happen in blocks of two weeks because that is the period by which an infected person will either recover or go into ventilation. If we can stop the infected people from mixing with others, the chain will be broken. New infections will decline and fewer hospitalisations will be required,” explained surgery professor Diptendra Sarkar who is part of the SSKM hospital’s Covid management team. A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had revealed that one person can infect 400 persons in a month. By introducing curbs for a fortnight, the number of infections can be half or 200. While such restrictions can break the chain, internal medicine consultant Sibabrata Banerjee acknowledged it is a double edged sword as it could also drive the poor to desperation and absolute disregard for health and safety. “Community medicine does not support very stringent restrictions because they hurt the poor and drive them to further poverty. So it is a delicate balance between life and livelihood. We have reached such a point in this pandemic that this unfortunate measure is necessary,” Banerjee explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curbs-necessary-to-break-virus-chain-say-experts/articleshow/82667517.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The incident occurred at Kachpura, under Kanchanpura police station, shortly after groom Neeraj Kumar set out for his bride-to-be's home in a nearby village with members of his extended family and other guests, numbering around 30. "Seeing two vehicles entering the village, which had been targeted by dacoit gangs before, some in the wedding party thought they were under attack and started running. This led the approaching police team to suspect the people trying to flee were the criminals they were looking for. Amid the confusion, the cops opened fire and the elderly woman got hit," an official said. Dholpur police said they had no prior information that their counterparts from Agra would enter the village in search of a dacoit gang. The wedding procession, too, was being taken out discreetly because of the prevalent Covid-induced restrictions on events and gatherings. After news of the firing reached Kanchanpura police station, the UP cops were stopped from crossing the inter-state border. Sources said the police team was detained at Kanchanpura till Saturday and that SP Kesar Singh Shekhawat interrogated them. There was no official confirmation of the outcome of the probe. "It is likely that they will be booked for firing without provocation and violating the rule of informing the local police before carrying out any operation," Hotam Meena, head constable of Kanchapura police station, said. UP police and Neeraj's family have lodged complaints against each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/up-police-chasing-dacoits-attack-raj-wedding-party-1-hurt/articleshow/82669295.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur district likely to be in safe zone post second wave: Experts||NAGPUR: The Nagpur district has suffered the worst phase of Covid-19 in April with near two lakh cases and 2,000+ deaths. Though new cases have been declining since last 10 days, the caseload as on May 15 was 4,62,110, which is near 10% of district’s estimated current population. As per the state government’s vaccination data, 11,79,065 residents of Nagpur district have received at least one jab till May 14. This accounts for near 23% of district’s population of 49 lakh. So, near 33% have developed protection against Covid-19 either by vaccination or antibodies formed after contracting the disease. Going by these numbers, the district is likely to be one of the safe zones in Central India once the second wave is over and even if the predicted third wave hits the region. Experts too are quite sure that Nagpur will be fairly protected against Covid-19 from here on. As per the national Covid tracker of the central government, Nagpur is among the top five districts in India where near 10% population has tested positive for Covid-19. In Nagpur, 9.92% population had tested positive till May 8. Gurugam (9.92%) is the only district to surpass Nagpur by some decibel points. Pune (9.63%), Bengaluru (9.47%), and Bametara in Chhattisgarh (9%) were the other districts among the top five. Also, it’s estimated that unreported cases are at least double of the official figures. The data from the first serosurvey also suggests near 50% seropositivity in Nagpur district. This implies near 50% population of the district will have developed protection against Covid-19 by May end. “This is a well-identified phenomenon. The regions witnessing a huge spike in the initial phase remain fairly protected in the next wave,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. Dr Shinde gave example of Mumbai. “Mumbai, especially Dharavi area, had witnessed huge number of cases in the first phase when even vaccine was not available. The same region is showing less cases in the second phase. The entire Mumbai region recovered from the mega surge within a short period and its curve is significantly down now,” he said. Epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte said that cases might come from parts of the district where positivity is still low. “I can say with confidence that Nagpur city (NMC area) will be fairly safe in the next wave if it hits at all. There might be some rural parts of the district where infectivity is less. That part might report cases and deaths if not covered by vaccination in the next few months,” said Dr Thatte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-dist-likely-to-be-in-safe-zone-post-second-wave-experts/articleshow/82667528.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

State Covid control room head Abhishek Tripathi said the lapse is being viewed “extremely seriously” by the health department and an explanation is being sought from the CMO of Haridwar as well as the hospital officials. Sources told TOI that 75 deaths took place at the hospital since it became operational from April 1, when the Kumbh officially started. However, data of only 10 deaths was shared by the hospital with state Covid control room authorities. Asked about it, Anshul Singh, the IAS officer who’s currently the nodal officer of the hospital, said, “ The lapse probably happened as doctors who were uploading data were from UP and they returned to their original postings when Kumbh ended.” He said, “Of the 65 deaths, 90% were critical and needed ICU. Patents were mainly from Haridwar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-record-of-65-deaths-at-haridwar-covid-facility/articleshow/82672553.cms||Ishita Mishra

The government had said that it would provide firewood for non-electric crematoriums but other expenses were allegedly not being paid. “We had cremated some bodies that GHMC brought earlier but they have not paid us. We are collecting Rs 8,000 per cremation. GHMC officials said they will give firewood but due to the heavy load, staff salaries and other expenses should also be met. We are service-oriented but maintenance needs funds,” said V Raj Kumar of Amberpet Crematorium. Similarly, a member of the Puranapul Crematorium Management Committee, T Umamahender said that the crematorium conducts funerals of around 10 to 12 bodies of which six to seven are of Covid-19 victims.  “In April we used to cremate 20 to 30 bodies, half of them could be Covid-related. Now, deaths have come down in May. We collect only Rs 3,500 and rest is funded by Agarwal Seva Samithi. We are not accepting unattended or abandoned bodies. Once in a month or so Satya Harischandra Foundation sends us unknown bodies. We are doing it free for them. We don’t take any help from GHMC,” he said. “In some places, they are charging Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 per cremation. As per the estimates, each cremation will cost around Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 . We have cremated around 15 bodies of Covid-19 victims and have requested government to allot certain space in existing GHMC crematoriums so that we can conduct the cremations,” K Rajeshwar Rao of Satya Harischandra Foundation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-crematoria-refuse-abandoned-bodies-over-payment-issues/articleshow/82669401.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Soon, drones to go from eye in the sky to doc on the fly||From being the ‘Eye in the Sky’ to monitor people during lockdown in Covid times, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), popularly known as drones, are now transforming into carriers of life-saving Covid-19 jabs and medical supplies to far-flung places of the world. Even in Telangana, pilot projects are about to commence as part of efforts to devise a system for efficient transportation of vaccines and medical supplies, especially in remote areas where logistics remains a major challenge. Telangana has recently received permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to operate drones ‘Beyond Visual Line of Sight’ (BVLOS) for its ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project for a year. The approvals come at a time when India is struggling to ramp up its Covid-19 vaccination programme. The `Medicine from the Sky’ project was launched in late 2019 in partnership with the World Economic Forum (WEF). The EoI, that was released during the Centre and Telangana government’s joint biennial aviation event, Wings 2020, to invite participants for this study, received 16 applications, of which seven were selected to undertake drone flights as part of this project. Among the seven players, Hepicopter, Dunzo Med-Air Consortium, Airserve Initiatives and Blue Dart, among others, have received permission to start BVLOS drone flights as a pilot project and these entities are gearing up to start the trials soon. Prem Kumar Vislawath, the co-founder & CEO of Hyderabad-based startup Hepicopter said it is the first time in India that drones will be operating BVLOS which is why they are currently customising drones for healthcare delivery-use cases. "These drones are different from the regular ones because they carry different types of temperature controlled boxes, used for storing medical supplies, and will fly long range," he explained. Hepicopter plans to use two drones during the pilot. Hepicopter 1.0 is a multi-rotor wing battery-powered drone with a payload capacity of 10 kg. This drone can transport four boxes at a time with each box having a capacity to carry up to 10 units of blood and over 500 doses of vaccines. Hepicopter 2.0 is a landing rotary-wing, gasoline-powered drone with a payload capacity of 5 kg. This drone can ferry two boxes at a time that can carry up to 1,000 doses of vaccines. "During the trial phase, each drone would carry a combination of dummy vials and regular vaccines and the performance would be recorded in detail. This data would be used to guide further policies regarding full-scale adoption. The trials are expected to begin in the first week of June," he explained. Even S Vijay, chief operating officer, Skye Air Mobility, that is partnering two entities that have been selected for this project, said they will be deploying a battery-operated quadcopter model drone which can carry up to 2 kg payload and deliver up to a radial distance of 30 km. "He said the major challenges faced by drone companies delivering medical supplies BVLOS are safety and security concerns by aviation regulators and security agencies," he said. Ketan Kulkarni, CMO and head of business development, Blue Dart, said there are a lot of safety features such as collision avoidance and detect & avoid systems that have to be kept in the drones used for medical deliveries. "The whole idea is to enable a safer flight in the BVLOS environment. Besides, the drone will also be integrated with UTM (Unmanned aircraft system traffic management) support functions, allowing the local ATC to view the real-time telemetry of the drone, thus ensuring safer skies," he explained. Even the payload box is customised with real-time payload health tracking system, thus ensuring that the required temperature is not breached during the travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/soon-drones-to-go-from-eye-in-the-sky-to-doc-on-the-fly/articleshow/82668833.cms||Swati Rathor

The Covid hospital here has 52% beds unoccupied, there is an additional stock of oxygen and Covid deaths have almost halved (40% to 50% decline). Two special campaigns — ‘Chikitsa Aapke Dwar’ and ‘Mera Ward-Mera Gaon-Mera Jila’ — by the district administration, started almost a month ago, are now showing results. Medical teams that had gone door-to-door in the entire district and covered almost every household, had identified 13,512 persons with ILI (Influenza-like-illness) in the primary stage itself, which played a significant role in checking the virus spread. These people were given medical kits, strictly quarantined at homes, thus avoiding the unnecessary rush in hospitals. This enabled serious patients to get admissions and accessibility to oxygen and ventilator beds, without sufferings in queues. “In most of the cases, people do not report that they are infectious immediately and after four to five days, when oxygen levels drop in their bodies, things go beyond repair. We launched the campaigns with the motive to identify the virus at preliminary stage and treat the patient without delay,” Suresh Kumar Ola, Dungarpur collector said. During the campaign, migrant population too was targeted. They were home quarantined, treated for minor ailments and monitored regularly. The administration also roped in activists,officials and public representatives including panchs and sarpanchs to counsel people to refrain from holding marriages and any kind of functions to avert the possibilities of congregations of people that could trigger the contagion. Another intense survey was completed in four days to cross check the data collected. “It was a herculean task but our team did it. Total 838 teams reached out to every single village, co-ordinated with core committees, sarpanch, ward panch, ANMs and covered 3,01,779 homes and surveyed 16,32,569 people. Thirty officers were made in-charge for the task to cross-check the accuracy of the surveyed data,” the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/active-dist-admn-reins-in-covid-deaths-in-dungarpur/articleshow/82669350.cms||---

The high court bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave this interim decision to the state’s roads and buildings (R&B), forest department officials while hearing a petition filed by Peddy Reddy Uday Krishna of the NGO, Vata Foundation. The state had entrusted the task of expanding the road at Gandipet to the R&B and forest departments and had permitted the concerned authorities to fell as many as 244 trees to pave way for the expansion of this stretch of road which is just over a kilometre-long. It was reported that there 286 trees on either side of the road of which the felling of 244 trees was deemed essential to complete the expansion of the road. The petitioning NGO then came forward to translocate the trees and urged the state and its authorities to allow it to undertake the translocation instead of cutting down the trees indiscriminately. The high court bench directed the state and its concerned departments to take a decision on the NGO’s representation within a week. “Till then, do not cut the trees,” the bench directed and adjourned the case to June 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-felling-of-trees-at-gandipet/articleshow/82669037.cms||---

On Saturday, it reported 1,957 cases, the lowest daily count in the last two weeks. Goa has now over 30,000 active cases. The fatality count rose to 2,057 with 58 deaths. The state registered a marginal improvement in the recovery rate that rose to 76% as 3,512 people were cured. Of 58 deaths recorded on Saturday, 33 died at Goa Medical College (GMC). Following a meeting with an expert team of doctors, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the Goa government is working on additional treatment protocols that have been followed by the Karnataka government. Under the guidance of Dr Anoop Amarnath, the member of State’s critical care support team, the usage of Baricitinib for treatment of covid patients has been approved. “It is to be administered orally from the fifth day of symptoms along with Remdesivir. It has prevented patients from reaching the breathlessness stage, and proven effective in preventing a Cytokine storm,” said Rane. Goa Medical College dean Dr S M Bandekar said Karnataka has found that oxygen consumption among Covid-19 patients is very high due to the “double mutant” strain detected in the second wave. “That’s why they have changed their protocol and added Baricitinib to their treatment protocol,” Bandekar said. The drugs work fantastic in reducing Cytokine storms and lungs are protected. “It has been decided to use this protocol for patients here so that their oxygen requirement will be less, lungs protected and they will be cured faster,” he said. A cryogenic tank of 20,000-kilo liters that would provide oxygen to GMC was commissioned on Saturday. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said it is the third such tank installed in the state. “It was shifted in three days and commissioned,” Sawant told reporters. The arrangement would do away with GMC’s reliance on oxygen supplied through trolleys, to meet a multi-fold rise in consumption of oxygen due to the huge rise in Covid cases requiring hospital admissions. Maharashtra has also come to the rescue of Goa and Kerala during their oxygen crisis. In the wake of an urgent message from the Centre, Maharashtra has provided two oxygen tankers each to both states. Maharashtra has a total of 323 tankers for transportation of oxygen. “We have supplied 18 MT oxygen to Goa, while two empty tankers, with a total capacity of 28.5 MTs, have been given to Kerala for transportation of oxygen. For Goa, it is only one-time supply of oxygen, while our empty tankers will remain with these states,” a senior bureaucrat from Maharashtra told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lowest-daily-count-in-last-2-wks-recovery-rate-improves/articleshow/82671224.cms||---

This was meant for children to deal with mental health issues. Till date they have received nearly 3,000 calls from parents as well as children to seek help for problems like stress, anxiety, addiction to mobile phones etc. While in the first two months, the number of calls was limited to a few hundred, the number spiked drastically after March 21. The helpline called Umeed also known as Mental Health and Pyscho Social Support Plus (MHPSS +) helpline can be accessed by using the toll-free number 0141-4932233. Ramakanta Satapathy, manager, child protection, Save the Children, Rajasthan told TOI, “The number of calls increased due to spike in Covid cases and while in January, the situation had become somewhat normal, it became bad after the first two months. This helpline was launched as a pilot project so that children or their parents can talk about their problems. The benefit of this helpline is that the child commission is involved thereby making government intervention possible if required.” While there were variety of issues behind the calls, a number of them were regarding use of mobile phones, difficulty in sleeping, problem with concentrating on studies and at times even boredom. A total of 980 callers from different age groups were provided counselling against their concerns in Covid-19 pandemic. “During lockdown, many children faced stress and mental health issues, but they could not get vocal about it due to certain reasons. The aim of this helpline is to help children come forward with their problems and we will help in resolving the issues,” said Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-helpline-gets-3k-calls-since-jan-many-queries-on-phone-addiction/articleshow/82669315.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

The situation is especially grim in the rural areas. To check the virus spread in the villages, the district police and administrative officers are carrying out flag marches in the villages of the district to spread awareness among the villagers. The authorities also took action using drones against people violating the lockdown at many places in cities. The situation in the villages is very alarming, with a large number of people succumbing to the virus. In the last seven days, there were more than 4,000 positive cases and 31 deaths here, while the actual number of deaths is said to be much more. The district and police administration have started intensive efforts and door-to-door campaigns, providing medical kits at people’s houses. On the initiative of SP Ajay Singh, the police and district administration officers carried out flag marches to make villagers aware about the Covid guidelines. During the march at Sam, Dabri, Kanoi, Damodara, Chaitral, Moolsagar and Amarsagar, people were directed to remain at home and follow the guidelines. Hospitals and Covid care centres in the villages were also inspected and directions were given to the officials concerned. On the other hand, following the directions of district collector Ashish Modi, zonal officers on Friday visited the allotted areas. They inspected the Covid care centres and held door-to-door surveys. Zonal officers advised the panchayat group monitoring committees not to organise mass marriages, social and religious functions and asked them to play an important role in following the rules. They reviewed the arrangements at Covid care centres and also looked at the system of distribution of medical kits distributed to the patients with ILI symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/infection-rate-35-in-jaisalmer-police-flag-march-in-villages/articleshow/82669362.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad: Volunteers help people book vaccination slots on CoWin||SECUNDERABAD: In a bid to help people register themselves for the Covid-19 vaccination, a social activist has designed a registered card. After the government made registration on the CoWin app mandatory for those who want to get inoculated, many are finding it difficult to book a slot. To aid people overcome this problem, Cantonment-based social activist G Shravan prepared a Covid vaccination registration card. Sravan and his colleagues distribute these cards to all those who are eligible to receive vaccination. The cards contain details like name, family members, community, phone number, Aadhar etc. The next day they will collect these cards and feed these details on the app to book slots.  “Educated people, who use smartphones can register themselves on the portal. However, we noticed that many don’t know how to book a slot. So, we launched a drive on Saturday and distributed these cards at Rajalingam Garden, Laxminagar and Gandhi Colony. Once we collect the details we will book a slot for them,” said Shravan. J Anand Rao, a judicial department employee and resident of Gandhi Colony, said that this initiative is quite helpful and it would also serve as a medical record. Meanwhile, Shravan and his team visited 300 houses in ward no.IV to distribute these cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/volunteers-help-people-book-vaccination-slots-on-cowin/articleshow/82667567.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Now, focus shifts to villages as corona infection holds rural areas in its grip||JAIPUR: The pandemic is now taking rural areas in its grip. Patients from villages are reaching Covid hospitals in cities when their condition deteriorates causing fatalities. Now, the state government has chalked out a strategy to strengthen healthcare facilities and early transportation of serious patients from rural areas to hospitals at district and division level. The pan is to identify Covid cases at an early stage. In a door-to-door survey, the government identified 7 lakh influenza-like illness cases in the state. The auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) of the areas will distribute medicines and encourage patients with ILI symptoms to get treatment from Covid consultation/care centres. Strengthening the healthcare facilities for Covid patients in rural areas, the state government has set up a Covid consultation/care centre at community health centres at block-level. A senior health department official said, “At each Covid consultation/care centre, ambulance facility will remain available round the clock. Collectors have been directed that if government ambulance is not available, they can hire private ambulance on rent for transportation of serious patients to district hospital or hospital attached to medical college. The facility will be free of cost to the patients in rural areas.” The Covid consultation/care centres (CC/CC) will be useful in providing early treatment and early transportation of patients. The CC/CC will have OPD and IPD for Covid patients. A control room has also been set up at block-level in the state. The health department is conducting door-to-door survey in rural areas. The health department officials said that they have found 7 lakh patients with ILI. The ANMs of the respective areas are keeping an eye on the health of the people in their respective areas. The teams conducting door-to-door survey help the suspected patients to reach CC/CC where medical check-up of the patient will be done. In case the patient is found fit for home isolation, they will be provided with medical kits. If they are mild symptomatic, they get admitted to CC/CC. If any of them is found suffering from severe symptoms, they will be rushed to district hospital or hospital attached to medical college by ambulance. The first round of door-to-door survey has been completed and now the health department and panchayati raj department is planning for second round of survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-focus-shifts-to-villages-as-corona-infection-holds-rural-areas-in-its-grip/articleshow/82669423.cms||---

---||Kolkata||E-tailers boost infra for faster service||KOLKATA: With online shopping and doorstep delivery of goods, including food, being exempted by the government to bridge the demand-supply gap of various necessities in households, e-commerce and delivery entities have readied themselves for reaching the consignments faster in Kolkata and beyond. The e-commerce business has seen robust growth during the pandemic with a sharper rise of demand for warehousing space in the city. To serve their long clientele well during the restrictions, all the e-commerce units have been emphasising on stocks. Not only households, even businesses are now majorly dependent on e-delivery. “With our restaurants being shut for a long period, our survival now hinges on food delivery apps,” said Basant Singh of New Paunjabi Dhaba in Behala.  Most e-commerce and delivery entities have ramped up their infrastructure, in terms of hiring across logistics, supply chain, customer care and engineering division. Spencer’s, Big Bazar, Easy Day Clubs have already revamped their home-delivery of garments and electronics, while a few others are waiting for more clarification from the state. “We have experienced similar restrictions elsewhere in India and accordingly, increased our capacity. We have reduced the time lag in delivery substantially. During the pandemic, we have managed to sail through, with our contactless delivery and online payment reducing the risk of the virus spread,” said a senior official of a Kolkata-based e-commerce giant. Kolkata, due to its strategic location, is a major warehousing hub of the eastern belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-tailers-boost-infra-for-faster-service/articleshow/82667595.cms||---

---||Goa||Seawater rise in Canacona causes panic among locals||Poinguinim: As an effect of cyclone Tauktae, rough sea conditions prevailed on Saturday with waves pounding the coastline at Palolem, Colomb, Galgibaga and Agonda, causing minor damages to several seaside properties, including restaurants. In places like Galgibaga, the beach stretch was almost entirely submerged in water. Fishermen were seen running helter skelter, abandoning their fishing gear. Seawater also entered some residential areas along the coastline. Heavy sand erosion was also witnessed. The incident occurred on Saturday between 1pm and 2.30pm and an orange alert had already been sounded by the meteorological department, cautioning residents of the nearby areas. Due to the swelling of the sea, rough waves were seen hitting the shore, where even retaining walls in some of the areas could not offer any resistance to the rampaging waves. Owners of seaside properties could only watch helplessly as the waves left their properties damaged. “The retaining walls we had erected simply washed away into the sea,” said chairman of Canacona Municipal Council Simon Mario Rebello. The high tide, when this damage occurred, rose to a height of over three to four metres. While some residents said they had witnessed such swelling of the sea before, others panicked as the water began to gradually swell. Some elderly men from the native Pagi community said that more extreme weather events are being witnessed in recent years along the Canacona coast as compared to some decades ago. They attributed the excessive sand erosion being caused on Saturday to the coast being plundered by largescale sand excavations in recent years. They said this had led to the sea coming more inland and damaging retaining walls and other coastal structures. Canacona mamlatdar Vimod Dalal said that only unconfirmed reports of minor damages have been received so far and no official complaints have been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seawater-rise-in-canacona-causes-panic-among-locals/articleshow/82669402.cms||Albert Fernandes
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Crowding by food delivery agents a cause of concern||CHENNAI: Crowding outside restaurants by food delivery agents has become a cause of concern as in many places, the agents wait without any physical distancing and some of them do not wear masks properly increasing the risk of spreading the coronavirus. With food delivery agents being allowed to function through the day and some coming in touch with customers while delivery, it is pertinent for authorities to issue strict guidelines for them, say residents.  Last year, food delivery agents were allowed to deliver groceries and meat. This year, they have not been delivering groceries, but deliver from meat stalls. “There are several photographs in newspapers and on social media of food delivery agents flouting physical distancing norms outside restaurants. There is a chance of them becoming asymptomatic carriers and infect their friends and family and also their customers too,” said P Gokul, a resident of Velachery. A food delivery agent acknowledged the crowding at some small restaurants as there are not enough facilities for them to wait, especially during afternoon when it becomes difficult to wait under the sun. “Some restaurants keep water outside. But, we cannot expect the same everywhere and also we get incentives based on good ratings, so we try and deliver as quickly as possible,” he said. Residents said the civic body should hold a meeting with restaurants to ensure that food delivery agents follow Covid protocols. “We need everybody’s co-operation in fighting the pandemic including the public. The eatery owners should take onus to ensure that such crowding does not happen outside their restaurants. We will instruct our zonal teams to regulate the issue,” said a senior civic body official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/crowding-by-food-delivery-agents-a-cause-of-concern/articleshow/82667569.cms||---
---||Goa||Only temple rituals at this year’s Lairai zatra||Bicholim: The famed zatra of Goddess Lairai in Shirgao, Bicholim, will see only the rituals being observed at the temple this year on Sunday to mark the event. Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit on Saturday inspected the security arrangements at various entry points leading to Shirgao village to ensure that no crowds gather for the occasion on Sunday. Due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pandit has issued instructions to the managing committee of Shree Lairai Devasthan to suspend the zatra festivities this year and only conduct religious rituals in the temple precincts, closing the temple for the general public. Accordingly, police officials have been posted at the entry points leading to Shirgao. Meanwhile, the ‘Dhonds’, who are considered as the pious devotees of Goddess Lairai and who play a central role in the zatra rituals, began observing their annual fast on May 12. The Dhonds fast and observe several restrictions leading to the zatra day. About eight Dhonds came together at Chinch Bhatwadi to observe their fast. “We started the fast taking all precautions as per Covid SOPs,” said Shekhar Naik, one of the Dhonds. In Bicholim taluka, Dhonds usually observe the fast on open grounds, near water springs or lakes by gathering in groups. But this year, due to the Covid crisis, only few Dhonds have come together and are observing the fast. During the fasting period, the Dhonds observe strict rituals for five days and bathe seven to ten times a day. This five-day festival is a different experience, said Ladu Kerkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/only-temple-rituals-at-this-years-lairai-zatra/articleshow/82669436.cms||---
---||Chennai||Amid Covid wave flood of youngsters reaches out||CHENNAI: It was the death of a Covid positive journalist in UP that prompted Bhargavi Kumaran and her friends to start their own initiative to help patients and their kin find access to resources during the pandemic. Today, the group of 350 volunteers works round the clock to ensure people in need find timely help. "The journalist had put out a series of tweets asking for oxygen, and it chronicled his last minutes. That totally shook us. My friend Sumaya then sent a list of leads from where you can source oxygen and that’s how the initiative kicked off," says Bhargavi, a second year computer engineering student at VIT. The 19-year-old says the group gets many leads on social media about availability of hospital beds and oxygen, which volunteers then verify, feed into their database, and finally circulate on social media. "We also get requests from people all day, and try and help them with verified city or state specific information," she says. As the second wave of the pandemic sweeps the country, young, digitally-savvy Indians are at the forefront of the battle, helping people find access to doctors, and hospital beds, sourcing oxygen, delivering groceries and helping the needy. For technology has become key to relief work during the pandemic. "Young people today are more aware and socially conscious. Fifteen years ago, starting a non-profit was rare. But now, school students are doing it," says Dr Prahalathan K K, co-founder of the non-profit Bhumi, adding that 99% of its volunteers are aged below 30. Having a force of digitally-savvy volunteers has also made a huge difference as a lot of the relief work involves verifying information, and connecting people and resources, he says. "Volunteers now have access to smartphones but, with some people we are trying to reach, it’s a challenge. So, in 2020, we had a missed call helpline for daily wage labourers as many couldn’t afford to recharge phones or make calls," says Prahalathan. The social media wings of the volunteering groups play a key role. For, with so much information awash on social media, volunteers have to work overtime to verify leads so the correct information reaches people. "The social media team works 24x7. We go to bed at 1am and are again working by 6am," says Bhargavi, who began the initiative on April 20. Smriti Suresh has also been virtually volunteering four to five hours a day to help connect people with resources. "I had worked with Chennai Volunteers (CV) in December 2020, teaching young girls English. So, when they reached out to me and asked if I would help with Covid relief work, I immediately agreed," says the 22-year-old biotech graduate. At CV, volunteers work to verify information related to food, oxygen supply, useful links, helplines, pet care, doctors, counselling and transport services. "If a patient or family is sick and worried, we don’t want them to have to call many numbers to figure out where they can get help, so we verify all the information and post it on social media, and on WhatsApp groups," says Smriti. With WFH schedules, many are able to virtually volunteer. "I am coordinating the supply of groceries to orphanages and shelter homes across India," says Ganesh Kumar J, 27, a digital marketing analyst, who volunteers with Bhumi. "We have volunteers in various cities, who get the requirements from the homes, verify it, and send it to me. We identify local vendors who can supply it, raise funds and ensure that the groceries are delivered." With the pandemic, support to many of these institutions has waned, he says. "In Chennai, we are supporting 70 orphanages," says Ganesh, who devotes at least 10 hours a week to virtual volunteering. Younger volunteers are trying to help in their own way. Rohan Mecheri, 16, has been trying to create awareness about social distancing and distributing masks since the first wave began. "I have done a couple of fundraisers and raised about `9 lakh, with which I bought 1.5 lakh masks. N-95 masks were distributed to frontline workers while surgical masks and reusable cloth ones were given to people in old-age homes, orphanages and to destitute women," he says. He has also conducted Zoom sessions about the importance of wearing masks and social distancing. "I usually do it for orphanages and old age homes," he says. However, it can be stressful for volunteers as they are constantly exposed to people in distress. "The first few days were tough. We kept having to take time to process everything mentally. But now we are able to cope. And if anything distressing happens, we ask the volunteer to take a break," says Bhargavi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/amid-covid-wave-flood-of-youngsters-reaches-out/articleshow/82667597.cms||Priya Menon

S Ashok, who earns Rs 20,000 per month, is spending about half of his salary to help the poor. Though he himself finds it hard to make ends meet with his paltry salary, he never flinches from reaching out to people in their hour of distress. “Many are struggling to get one square meal. I want to do my bit for them,” said Ashok, who distributed veg biryani to the attendants of Covid-affected and the needy in and around Gandhi Hospital on Friday. He said that he had to spend about Rs 5000 to buy essentials to get the food prepared. “In the coming days, I want to distribute eggs for breakfast as they are healthy,” he added. A resident of Nacharam, Ashok said that he believes in ‘Manava Seve Madhava Seva’ (service to humanity is service to God) and added that his heart swells with contentment when people wear a smile on their faces Explaining what motivated him to help the poor, he said that he is a member of Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Samithi and received a message encouraging everyone to reach out to the needy during the pandemic. “After seeing the message, I felt that I should do something to help people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paltry-salary-but-a-big-heart-to-feed-the-needy/articleshow/82667600.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The figure is 25% down from 367 recorded between April 16 and April 30. In the past 30 days, the highest daily death toll was 27 on April 18 and April 25, whereas Friday’s toll of 12 was the lowest. Analysis of mortality revealed that in the past 30 days, the mortality rate remained 0.5% for both fortnights, as cases also recorded a dip from 72,952 to 54,102 during this period. The city’s mortality rate was the lowest among the four major cities as Rajkot recorded 1.8% mortality rate from May 1 to 15, followed by Vadodara (1.1%) and Surat (0.9%). Gujarat on Saturday recorded deaths of 95 Covid patients, the lowest in 29 days. It was also the first below-100 death toll in 28 days. Compared to the past 3,000 deaths, the mortality rate slowed with the last 1,000 deaths recorded in nine days. The state had recorded 6,001 to 7,000 deaths in just six days. Share of the areas outside eight municipal corporations – concentration of the majority of the urban population in the state – has increased slightly in the fortnight. Compared to share of these areas at 45% from April 16 to 30, the share increased to 54% in state’s death tally. “As mortality rate has remained the same, the only explanation of dip in deaths is dip in daily cases. There are no studies so far on the impact of new strain or pandemic on different age groups. More studies are required across the state to reduce mortalities,” said a city based public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-records-25-drop-in-deaths-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/82667777.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Allocate area in cremation, burial grounds for all faiths’||MARGAO: With the rise in Covid mortality rate, crematoriums, cemeteries and kabrastans across the state are also witnessing their resources stretched thin. This has also led to instances of Covid bodies being prevented from being cremated or buried. Dr Anthony Rodrigues, who has been spearheading the movement for according dignified funeral for all, underscored the need for the managing committees of all graveyards to earmark certain spaces within their facilities for persons professing any or no faith. Following a petition by Rodrigues to the Margao Municipal Council, the civic body had in August 2016 passed an order making it incumbent on the managing committees of cemeteries, crematoriums and burial grounds within the jurisdiction of Margao municipality to demarcate some portion of the existing facility “for any person professing any faith or to arrange for a separate common burial ground within the cemetery/crematorium.” The MMC order had pointed out that as per Goa Municipalities Act, 1968 under Section 322A read with Schedule X & sections 246, 248 & 249, it was the statutory obligation of each municipal council to provide for last rite facilities. Rodrigues said, “There can be no better time than this for religious bodies to allow their graveyards to be used for people of all faiths, or for those professing no faiths,” Rodrigues said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/allocate-area-in-cremation-burial-grounds-for-all-faiths/articleshow/82669462.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Government steps in as caretaker racket takes over hospitals||MARGAO: Tressy, responding to an advertisement in a local newspaper seeking the services of a patient caretaker in a Covid hospital for Rs 45,000 per month, immediately contacted the numbers mentioned and jumped at the offer. Soon enough, she found herself placed at the South Goa district hospital, Margao, tasked with taking care of a seriously-ill patient. However, six days into her job, she realized she was duped when she was paid a paltry Rs 1,000 through GooglePay, and when she asked for her allowances as promised, she was asked to leave the job. The patient’s family, too, was shocked. They had engaged the caretaker service firm for Rs 15,400 for a seven-day package (Rs 2,000 per day and a daily allowance of Rs 200) and had paid Rs 3,000 to them as advance. Tressy contacted the patient’s family and narrated her woes, but by then, the agent’s mobile numbers were found to be switched off — the only contact person of her employers. Both Tressy and the patient’s family suspect they have been victims of a much larger racket, as several instances of such nature have also come to light of late. While this is the case at the South Goa district hospital, the situation is no better at Goa Medical College (GMC), Bambolim, leading patients’ kin to suspect an organised syndicate at work on a larger scale. Eye witness accounts say that the caretakers at GMC charge and work as per their fancy. “I was charged Rs 4,000 for round-the-clock caretaking duties. But the catch lies in the night shift. At night, these caretakers also take other patients under their care and charge exorbitant rates, ending up making big money. People are fleeced like anything for everything at the hospital,” Arun told TOI. Sharon, who lost her father while undergoing treatment at GMC, spoke about how touts have intruded into the hospital, and how attendants grab patients’ regular meals. “These days, there are touts lurking outside hospital premises to trap innocent victims, and the common man is ready to pay any amount for the comfort of their loved ones,” she said. “Usually, meals are served by Sodexo (caterers) at a fixed time and delivered at the door of the wards on trolleys. However, as soon as the trolleys arrive, there have been a couple of instances where attendants rush towards them and grab the meals which are meant for patients. This way, the meals for the patients are delayed, and sometimes even denied.” Taking cognisance of such malpractices and with an objective to prevent fraudulent activities, the authorities have taken steps to formulate a uniform policy for patient attendant/caregiver. Nodal officer of South Goa district hospital Prasanna Acharya, said the SOPs will be implemented once the government accords its approval. Acharya told TOI that to the extent possible, only family members of critical patients are allowed to serve as caretaker. “However, in case it’s required, in exceptional cases, private caretakers can be allowed on payment, which will have a cap of about Rs 2,000 per day. The reason for disallowing caretakers is that since they remain with patients, it’s likely that they may contract the infection and spread it,” Acharya said. The proposed SOPs have a provision for registration of caretakers. “There should be proper safety gear used by caretakers when inside wards,” he said. “They should leave the hospital premises upon the patient’s discharge or death, and stay in isolation for at least 10 days. Private caretaker agencies should not be entertained within hospital premises. The proposed policy provides for proper scrutiny of caretakers in the interest of the safety of patients and hospital staff, as also security of patients’ belongings and hospital property.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-steps-in-as-caretaker-racket-takes-over-hospitals/articleshow/82671378.cms||---

While appealing to the citizens to use the water judiciously, he assured that there will be ‘no water cuts’. The mayor along with house leader Satish Kulkarni, the superintendent engineer Sandeep Nalawade and other officials visited the dam to assess the water situation. “During the last meeting I was told that there was water shortage and hence we visited the dam today to assess the situation,” the mayor said. “It was during my last term as deputy mayor, in year 2012-13, we had water in the dam but the rains failed till August. I didn’t not want same thing to happen this year and hence visited the dam with the officials,” he said. The mayor also pointed out that the water storage was slightly lower than the same time last year, but added that the rains are going to approach on time and hence there was not need of the water cuts. “The rains are scheduled on time. The water is enough to fulfil our needs till July 31. So we have said that people should use water judiciously even if there were no cuts,” the Mayor added. The Gangapur Dam Complex with Gangapur, Gautami-Godavari and Kashyapi Dams put together have 3,234 million cubic feet (mcft) 39% of the total capacity of 9,350 mcft as against the 3848 or 41% of water during the last year. “The water from Kashyapi Dam is being brought in Gangapur Dam and that collectively puts us at safe level,” said the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/use-water-judiciously-no-need-for-cuts-nashik-mayor/articleshow/82863888.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Tipplers queue up at off-shops before ‘dry days’; home delivery allowed||KOLKATA: Tipplers in the city, who have run out of their liquor stock, will have to solely depend on home delivery for the next 15 days. An excise department official confirmed all liquor off-shops will remain shut till May 30, going by the circular issued by the state. Bars or on-shops in the city have already been shut since May 1. “All off-shop owners are free to deliver liquor to homes through apps or they can do so themselves if they want to,” said an excise official. The city has 350 bars (on-shops) and over 1,500 off-shops and country spirit shops . The total figure in Bengal is over 7,000, taking bars and off-shops together. There might be the option of home delivery of liquor but people made a beeline for off-shops on Saturday afternoon, even before the establishments opened at 5pm, so that they could stock up for the next fortnight. Serpentine queues could be seen at many shops with buyers leaving with cartons of bottles and cans. A leading retailer, who has multiple off-shops in the city, however, said home delivery was not a very lucrative option. Also, delivering liquor home by shops and not through apps meant major logistics problems, he said. “Most leading apps have withdrawn from the liquor home delivery system. The only major e-commerce player still doing it is Swiggy. The sales from home delivery is not even 20% of our counter sales on a normal day,” he said. Last May, following state nod, Swiggy, Zomato and Hip-Bar had enrolled for home delivery of liquor. The state beverage corporation, the wholesale liquor arm of the state, had also introduced an app for e-tailing of liquor. Bevco officials, who have been instructed to keep their warehouses open for limited hours from Monday to supplement the e-commerce of liquor by off-shops, said there was adequate stock as liquor sales had been low over the past two weeks, following closure of bars and restricted timing for off-shops. “We have stock for 14-15 days in the warehouses, even if the demand is normal. But the problem for retailers could be to organize logistics,” a Bevco official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tipplers-queue-up-at-off-shops-before-dry-days-home-delivery-allowed/articleshow/82667627.cms||---

Stating that it strongly condemned the act which, it said, amounts to defamation of nurses and doctors, the Association has demanded that the chairman tender his apology for his “inhuman” act. “Such acts will create wrong impression in public minds about nurses and frontline warriors,” president of the Associaton, Kuntal Kerkar, said in the police complaint. “(Doctors and nurses) will have difficulty in carrying out their normal duties in the hospitals in Goa. We being frontline warriors, nobody has a right to treat us in this manner.” The society’s chairman had written to a doctor residing in its residential complex pointing out that doctors and nurses treating Covid patients in her hospital were residing in the flats without giving any intimation to the society, “thereby violating the society’s bylaws.” The letter had pointed out that society members had raised objections to these doctors and nurses residing in the building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nurses-group-files-police-complaint/articleshow/82669483.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: NRI turns ambulance driver to ferry Covid-19 patients||HYDERABAD: Young Tarun Kappala, an NRI, who returned from the USA, has converted his car into an ambulance with oxygen facility to ferry Covid-19 patients to hospitals without charging a penny. He not only takes the patients to hospitals, but also ensures that they get the admission. Tarun turned an ambulance driver after one of his friends was charged Rs 34,000 by an ambulance service provider to take a Covid-19 patient to hospital. In the last one week, Tarun had made about two dozen trips to hospitals ferrying Covid-19 patients and providing them oxygen support till they get admission. He spends time with every patient he ferries to the hospital till admission formalities are completed. "I got the idea to help Covid-19 patients when one of my friends was charged about Rs 34,000 to transport the body of his aunt, who succumbed to Covid-19. On an average, people are charged Rs 8,000 to Rs 35,000 and this figure might go to crazy heights when it's transporting between cities or states. But, I do it for free," Tarun told TOI. Tarun worked with Deloitte in the USA before returning to Hyderabad. He is currently the technical project manager at SpringML in the city. His mother is recovering from brain stroke and his sister takes care of her when Tarun is out on rides carrying Covid-19 patients. Recalling an incident, he said he was transporting an elderly woman, who is a professor from a very well-known college, her husband died of Covid-19 and her son was in the ICU. She was positive too, and stable on oxygen. She couldn't go see her husband for the last time because of unavailability of ambulances on weekends. "I just go and stand next to an emergency ward to see if someone needs help. This is how I found her family, which needed a ride. I went to pick her up. I became emotional when the elderly woman said God sent his angel so that I could see my husband for the last time," Tarun recalled. He said his friends in the US from an organization called Ethne had raised money to purchase a van, which was converted into a makeshift ambulance to help transport Covid-19 patients or bodies,”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nri-turns-ambulance-driver-to-ferry-patients/articleshow/82667611.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Pune||110 medical cadets graduate; pressed into Covid-19 duty||PUNE: A total of 110 medical cadets, including 21 women cadets, who graduated from the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) on Saturday will immediately start duty at 31 Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) Covid centres across the country. These designated Covid hospitals treat patients from the Armed Forces personnel as well as the civilian population in their areas. “The preparatory period for the commissioning of this graduating batch has been curtailed from four-five weeks to only two weeks, which were utilised to specifically prepare these young doctors to work in a Covid care setting. The medical cadets have also completed the American Heart Association (AHA) certified course in BLS (Basic Life Support) and ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) training,” said AFMC authorities. “All aspects and difficulties that doctors faced on Covid duty have been thoroughly explained. The course also covered executing standard operating procedures in extremely adverse working conditions,” said a senior official from the college, on the condition of anonymity. “These young doctors would be a big help — ever since the armed forces hospitals became available to civilian Covid patients, the workload on frontline doctors increased tremendously. These fresh graduates would able to work in flexible shifts as well,” the officer added. The cadets were commissioned by Lt Gen Nardeep Naithani, Commandant AFMC, in a brief ceremony at AFMC. Ninety-four cadets were commissioned into the Army, 10 in the Indian Air Force, and six in the Indian Navy. In his commissioning address, Naithani said the batch had the unique distinction of graduating together with a 100% success rate. He reminded the graduating batch that they were joining the medical profession at a difficult time for the country. “Use your knowledge and skills to provide the best possible care to patients as you join the nation’s battle against Covid-19 as Covid-19 warriors,” Naithani said. The commandant awarded trophies, medals, and prizes to cadets for outstanding achievement in academics and all-round performance. Medals awarded The President’s gold medal for the best all-round graduating cadet, as well as the Kalinga trophy and the Director General Armed Forces Medical Services gold medal for best academic record during the MBBS course, were awarded to Vinita Reddy.

One such patient is Baban Dadhe, who despite being 70 years old and in stage four of cancer recovered from Covid-19, that too without getting admitted to any hospital. His wife Kalpana too was infected but both managed to recuperate with the help of medicines given by their family doctor Dr Saurabh Prasad, who is a cancer specialist. With all their three children staying outside the city, there was no one to look after the elderly couple. “I have been following a strict lifestyle and going for regular morning walks, doing yoga, pranayam coupled with meals since last many years. Additionally, I am regularly consuming neem, basil and gourd, which boosted my immunity,” the septuagenarian said. Dadhe, a former range forest officer (RFO) in the state forest department, was diagnosed with prostate cancer about five years back. The doctors told him that he is in the last stage and would not be able to survive for more than a year. “That time, he told the doctors that he would prove them wrong and would live beyond one year with the help of ayurvedic medicines. He never missed yoga and other routine even for a day. It helped him to sustain for all these years,” his son Mangesh, a government employee working in Mumbai, told TOI. Dadhe, a resident of Narasala in Dighori, wasn’t perturbed when the doctor on April 15 told him that he was Covid-19 positive and needs hospitalization as his oxygen levels were down. The doctor warned him that he should get admitted considering his stage four cancer. “He, however, told them that he would prefer home isolation where he would be more comfortable. He asked the doctor to prescribe medicine that can be consumed at home. He and my mother strictly followed the home isolation norms,” said Mangesh. Even after recuperating fully, Dadhe wears a mask even at home as per the government’s recent guidelines and takes full care. Being a former forest officer, he loves to be among the natural environment and spend most of his time gardening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/70-yr-old-stage-4-cancer-patient-defeats-covid-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82669516.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Former commissioner CCP Sanjit Rodrigues and a founder member of Panjim Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), at St Inez alerted the society. Volunteer Sanchita Banerjee Rodrigues got in touch with the TOI reporter to find out the exact location of the dogs and sent a vehicle within half an hour to GMC to rescue them. “The pups are around two and a half months old. They have been kept in quarantine because we don’t know what diseases they could have. Many get Parvo with the first rains and this could wipe off the PAWS shelter in three days’ time. They will be dewormed and watched for over a week after which we will start posting videos for their adoption,” Sanchita told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/animal-welfare-society-rescues-pups-at-gmc/articleshow/82669535.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Macro benefits of microgreens||CHENNAI: The spotlight over the past year-and-a-half has been on immunity, and the latest to make it to the diet plans of the city’s health-conscious are shoots. Microgreens, which are fast emerging as nutritional value-adds, are basically the seedlings of vegetables and herbs harvested around two weeks after germination. They are literally the micro versions of the plant, harvested when they are just one or two inches in height. While microgreens are easy to grow at home, for some like Yamini Yagnamurthy, they’ve also grown into a business this past year. Yagnamurthy’s Stomato Farms was started on the terrace of her home and has now expanded into a climate-controlled farm laboratory, where everything from red cabbage, basil, and all kinds of radish is grown to cater to the demands of her increasing customer base. "You just need good quality seeds, the right soil mix, a few trays, water and light. It takes a little dedication, and precision to nurture them," says the urban farmer. Vidhyadharan Narayan, a social worker, launched his microgreen business a few years ago. The 65-year-old says that earlier his customers were hotels, cafes and food bloggers, the pandemic has brought him a flow of individual subscribers. "Most of them are young and health conscious," says Vidhyadharan, who harvests Sakhi Microgreens from a 100sqft space in his house, earning `25,000 a month. "Microgreens and sprouts pack a nutritional punch," says Subramanian K S, director, research, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. "When a seed germinates, it needs energy. During this initial burst of growth, the seed puts all its nutrients and energy into the developing seedling. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, fats into fatty acids and carbohydrates into simple sugars. So at this stage you get the most out of the plant’s nutrients, vitamins, and minerals," he says. As the plant continues to grow, says Subramanian, the nutrients are exhausted. "The sooner you eat the microgreen, the more nutritious it is." Microgreens are high in nutrients and low in fibre, developing only as the plant matures. Microgreens are usually ready within a fortnight of planting the seed, says M S Vignesh, an M Tech researcher at Sathyabhama University and co-founder of Indian Organiko which supplies microgreens on a subscription basis. "We recommend that customers consume them within three to five days to get the most out of them nutritionally," he says. Research says the levels of vital nutrients, including vitamin K, vitamin C, lutein and beta carotene, all of which help fight inflammation and build immunity, are higher in microgreens than in the mature leaves of the same plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/macro-benefits-of-microgreens/articleshow/82667629.cms||Kamini Mathai

The facility was inaugurated remotely on Friday, with the MCCIA office at Senapati Bapat Road hosting the centre. There are also plans to set up a digital presence for the centre as well as sub-branches in the region to ensure greater access. “The facility will be available to anyone in the agricultural sector, who plans to export their products overseas. As per the last figures recorded, India’s share of agricultural exports in the world was very low. There is a need to improve that, and, despite Maharashtra’s share in agricultural exports from India being disproportionately high, we have set up this centre to increase agricultural exports,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCIA. The centre, which will bring in expertise from current agro-exporters, serving and retired state and union government officials, will help exporters on all aspects of the ‘farm-to-fork’ chain of agro-exports, Girbane added. The process includes export registration, market assessment, standards of recipient countries, and adjustments required to match those standards, the kind of logistics involved in the operation, among other issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/now-open-agro-export-facilitation-centre/articleshow/82665809.cms||---

Officials in AMC said that barring two days, when an average of 16,000 people in this age group were vaccinated, the daily average of vaccination was about 7,200 only. According to 2011 Census the city has a population of 24.92 lakh in the age group of 20 to 44 years, and with the addition in the age group of 18 to 20 officials say the total in 18-44 age group, as on date, could be around 30 lakh. Only 1.30 lakh from this age group have been vaccinated in the last fortnight, but the figure may be higher by about 20,000 said AMC officials, as many residents booked slots in districts and got vaccinated in centres on the outskirts. An AMC official said that there was a rush from the city to centres even in Sanand and Shela to get vaccinated. AMC officials said the city was battling a shortage of vaccines for 18-44 age group and no more than 7,200 persons could be vaccinated on most days. “It was expected that the vaccination in this age group would increase as the government had deferred the vaccination in the 45-plus group. About 12,000-14,000 vaccines were used daily for the 45-plus group, and these slots were expected to be diverted to 18-44 age group. But this has not happened. Even on Friday and Saturday, only 7,600 were vaccinated in 18-44 age group,” an AMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-4-in-18-44-age-group-vaccinated-in-first-fortnight/articleshow/82667786.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Wholesalers have begun offering heavy discounts to exhaust the available stock of perishable commodities, but almost 500 tonnes of vegetables could end up in bins as the market will remain closed on Sunday. The authorities at the wholesale market usually source an additional quantity of vegetables on Saturday in view of the shutdown on Sunday. This Saturday, about 5,000 tonnes of vegetables arrived at the market, but 50% remained sold. S Chandran, secretary of Federation of Wholesale Vegetable Market Associations, said that about 20% of unsold vegetables including brinjal (eggplant), ladies finger (okra) and tomato may go waste. “Last Saturday (May 8), nearly 99% of the vegetables that arrived were sold out, while it was 80% during the previous Saturday. But, the sudden announcement over slashing the working hours for retail stores led to traders decreasing their purchase on Saturday,” he said. At the market Koyambedu, beetroot was available for Rs 8 per kg, cabbage cost Rs 4 a kg, while carrot was sold for Rs 15 a kg. The retail traders, who account for a majority of the buyers at the market, did not buy excess vegetables fearing that they might not be able to sell them due to the reduction in timings, he added. Besides, the number of small vehicles used by retail traders to buy vegetables fell by 1,000 from an average of 4,000. S S Muthukumar, president of the Koyambedu Semi Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association, said the number of retail traders has also reduced. “There were 15,000 people at the market on Saturday against the average of one lakh in pre-Covid times,” he said.

The India meteorological department (IMD) had warned about deep depression over the Arabian Sea intensifying into a cyclonic storm likely to cause disturbances in Goa during the weekend. The sea was tumultuous with high waves, water running towards the land and eroding the shore. Migrant families working for the local fishing community were seen at the shore and their kids playing where the waves crashed at the shore. On Friday evening, thunderous rain along with gusty winds disrupted power supply for many hours. Junior engineer Govind Bhatt attached to Carmona sub-station said that incoming supply from Maharashtra and Karnataka failed due to heavy thunder, lightning and high speed winds. Power to Salcete coastal villages, which was shut-off at around 6pm, was restored at 9.30pm in some areas and at midnight in other places. Sub-divisional magistrate Dattaraj Desai, additional collector Sanjit Rodrigues and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team visited Varca, Benaulim and Colva beaches to take stock of the situation and warned the people and the fishing community against venturing into the sea. Colva PI Anand Shirodkar said his personnel are already on high alert and teams are patrolling the beaches and villages too. Deputy director of fire services Nitin Raikar, who was part of the team visiting the Salcete beaches, said his personnel are all geared up and since Friday evening, they have been answering huge numbers of calls of clearing roads and branches falling on houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fierce-winds-heavy-showers-power-cuts-hit-salcete-coast/articleshow/82669608.cms||---

The hospital has already put to use 30 of its beds for treating Covid-19 patients. Goencho Avaaz is demanding that the other half of the hospital, which activists claim will be privatised, be also utilised to manage Covid patients. “RTI documents obtained by social activist Parushuram Sonurlekar has shockingly exposed Godinho’s plans in the past to privatise this hospital built at taxpayers’ cost,” said Fernandes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/utilise-entire-chicalim-hospital/articleshow/82669657.cms||---

Speaking on behalf of Delhi University professor Hany Babu, and Fr Stan Swamy, both in Tajola jail, Navi Mumbai, Jenny Rowena, wife of Hany Babu, said in a videoconference call that he was not given proper treatment before his vision started to get affected. “It took so many calls from the lawyers to get the jail superintendent to talk about it... We had to go to the press that he was sent to JJ hospital jail. He could not take medication as he cannot see properly and had to use soiled water.” She said in jail people test Covid-negative until they are taken outside and tested. She asked the state for intervention and release prisoners of Bhima Koregaon case on bail. Fr Stan Swamy’s friend Fr Joe Xavier said, “ A few days ago he told me he had a cough and fever and there is only one ayurvedic doctor treating us.” Lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj’s friend Smita stated that “she has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and she has been living in unhygienic condition for three years. She has several difficult new problems in jail itself.” Taloja prison superintendent Kaustubh Kurlekar denied the allegations, “Fr Stan Swamy does not have any covid symptoms. So, question does not arise to get his Covid test. As each accused in Elgar Parishad case are kept in a separate cells, the allegation of social distancing not being maintained is false... The jail hospital has sufficient medical staff and doctors to take care of inmates falling sick.” He added that the district administration has assured to begin vaccination drive for the inmates, and even those without Aadhar card will be vaccinated. “We allow kin of inmates to send medicines as per prescription. But we verify details of the person bringing medicines and get these checked with our doctors before giving to inmates.” (input George Mendonca)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/situation-bad-in-jails-release-all-elgar-case-accused-demand-kin/articleshow/82669664.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is also eating into the hard-earned savings of many middle-class families, leaving them near bankrupt. Left with no option, they are now seeking help from crowdfunding platforms. In the last week, tens of requests have gone up on platforms such as Impact Guru and Milaap, among others to raise funds ranging between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. “My dad, a retired BSNL employee, is currently on a ventilator and we don’t have any more money left to spend on his treatment,” Boddu Ramu told TOI adding that the family had already spent Rs 20 lakh on the treatment of three of his family members, including himself. Ramu’s father is undergoing treatment at a hospital in B N Reddy Nagar. “I wasn’t even aware that my father was hospitalised as I was in ICU battling for my own life when he got admitted. When I was discharged, I realised that we have no funds left,” said Ramu adding that he used to donate for various causes on crowdfunding platforms and decided to use the same option for his father’s treatment. Ramu said that his family has the state government insurance scheme, Aarogyasri, cover, but were forced to spend all the money they had from selling a piece of land and his father’s retirement savings for treatment. “All we want is to save his life. We had struggled to get a ventilator bed, we are trying hard to raise money to ensure that his treatment is not interrupted,” said Ramu, a BPO employee, who could raise little over 3.6 lakh for his father Ramesh’s treatment through Milaap. The same is the case with the number of families, who had to pledge everything, borrow from friends and families, and even from strangers to fund their loved one’s treatment. “My husband is suffering from Covid and severe lung infection. The treatment is costing us 15 lakh and we need funds to continue the treatment,” said Pooja Sinha, who is seeking funds through Impact Guru. Her husband is currently hospitalised at a corporate hospital in Gachibowli. Till now, she was able to raise about 10 lakh from 591 donors. Likewise, K Sai Kumar was able to raise 4.3 lakh for his brother K Ajay’s Covid-19 treatment, who is on a ventilator at a hospital in Langar Houz. He needs 10 lakh to pay a major chunk of the bill so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-dries-up-savings-many-seek-crowdfunding/articleshow/82669665.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The body reached New Delhi in a chartered aircraft on Saturday evening and Union minister V Muraleedharan, along with Israel’s deputy envoy Rony Yedidia Clein, paid their last respect to the deceased. Subsequently, it was sent to Kochi in an Air India aircraft and was kept at the airport for a few minutes for political leaders to pay homage, before it was taken to Idukki. PT Thomas MLA, Dean Kuriakose MP were among those who were present at the airport. The funeral will be held at 2pm at Keerithode Nithya Sahaya Matha Church on Sunday, Soumya’s relatives said. Soumaya’s sister-in-law Sherly Benny, who is in Israel, is still in a state of shock and said she has been spending sleepless nights in the city of Ashdod that has come under constant bombing. Speaking to TOI from Israel she had said on Thursday she was awakened by the continuing rocket attacks and was forced to find refuge in a bunker. “I moved to a bunker attached to the building to save my life. When we hear the siren we will move to the bunkers immediately,” she said.  “The house where Soumya stayed did not have a bunker on its own. She was waiting for the daughter of an elderly woman under her care. The attack took place just when an ambulance reached to pick her up,” she said. Sofi Mathew, another sister-in-law of Soumya who is in Kerala now, said: “I had worked as a caregiver in Ashkelon in Israel for over 13 years. The rocket attacks are something common in Israel and underground bunkers have been constructed in homes and in public spots. When they hear the alarm, everyone moves to the bunkers. Soumya was taking care of the bedridden elderly woman and that is why she could not move quickly to the bunker to save her life.” Meanwhile, Soumya’s family members said Israel embassy officials have informed them that they will visit them on Sunday 11am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/body-of-nurse-killed-in-israel-reaches-hometown/articleshow/82665835.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Nagpur||Mucor cases testing time for surgeons & specialists||Nagpur: The surge in mucormycosis cases is giving sleepless nights to specialists who are burning the midnight oil to treat patients reporting in post Covid scenarios. Some surgeons and specialists are at the operation theatre non-stop from 6am to 2am. Many doctors are also at the receiving end of irate relatives’ wrath over lack of enough live-saving medicines. Some ENT and dental surgeons say they haven’t seen such large number of cases in their career. Even neurosurgeons are facing similar situation. Head and neck cancer surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar said he starts surgeries at 6am and calls it a day only around 2am. “As medicines are not available now, the surgeries have nearly come to a halt. We are getting a lot of queries from doctors and relatives if they can admit their patients at our hospital. On Saturday, we performed only one surgery as the patient promised he will get the medicines. The surgeries are time consuming,” he said. Dr Kothalkar said he has been performing 5 to 8 operations beside conducting regular rounds of hospitals since over last two months. Dr Sandeep Anjankar, vitreo retina surgeon, said the injectable part does not take more than 5 to 10 minutes. “But our aim is to save vision or at least ensure the eyeballs remain intact. Those who came early were saved of vision loss. Our workload has increased manifold as patients of black fungus get admitted anytime and we have to rush at odd hours to see them at different hospitals,” said Dr Anjankar, who has also teamed up with Dr Kothalkar. Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram, neurologist and president of Tropical Neurology Group, said they haven’t seen so much cases in their lifetime as they have seen in one month. “In my four decades, we rarely came across such large number of cases,” he said. Indian Dental Association (IDA) president Dr Girish Bhutada said an oral maxillofacial surgeon is among the five specialists who are part of mucor surgeries. “Now, dental surgeons are the first to detect mucormycosis,” he said. Early reporting of patient and early diagnosis by the dentist reduce the complications. IDA secretary Dr Poonam Hudiya said some cases are getting treated on OPD basis but lots of surgeries are taking place daily. “IDA has issued guidelines to treat all symptoms as indicative of mucormycosis and initiate proper diagnosis,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mucor-cases-testing-time-for-surgeons-specialists/articleshow/82669615.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Based on the outcome of the review, the next course of action will be determined,” the company said in a regulatory filing to BSE late on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-in-talks-with-bharat-biotech-to-scale-up-covaxin-production-dbt/articleshow/82667734.cms||---
---||Kochi||State to set up detention centres for foreigners||Thiruvananthapuram: The government has initiated procedures for setting up detention centres for foreign nationals in the state, in the wake of an instruction from the high court. Foreign nationals arrested in crime cases and for other rule violations will be housed in these centres before they are deported after completing the legal procedures. The plan to set up such centres was kept in abeyance in the state in the wake of strong protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Any such move would have been seen as a pro-CAA move by the government, especially at a time when it had been a staunch critic of the CAA. The latest state government move is based on a high court instruction in an appeal by two Nigerian nationals who were arrested and housed in the Viyyur central prison in a case registered by the Guruvayur police.  The court had observed that the foreign nationals are continuing inside the prison indefinitely and the government has done nothing to implement its directive of 2015. “Even now no detention centres are created by the state government. I again say that this is a sorry state of affairs... I direct the additional chief secretary, home affairs, state of Kerala to do the needful in this regard, within six months, and file a compliance report before the registrar general of this court,” Justice P V Kunhikrishnan had said in his order on December 18. On April 9, the same bench had issued another order saying that no policy decision is necessary to find a temporary detention centre and instructed the authorities to earmark one within 30 days. Following this, the state police instructed Thrissur city police chief R Adithya to find a temporary facility at the earliest, who then earmarked a house for the same. There are three foreign national presently housed in the Viyyur prison –– two from Nigeria and one from Myanmar. While the Myanmar national is awaiting deportation, the Nigerians have been granted statutory bail. Meanwhile, the social justice department has begun preparing the proposals for establishing the detention centres so that the subject is included in the interim budget expected in June-July. In 2015, the Centre had instructed all states to set up temporary detention centres for lodging the foreign nationals who have been tried in the country for various offences and are awaiting deportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-to-set-up-detention-centres-for-foreigners/articleshow/82665853.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Nagpur||No data on death of Mucormycosis patients in district available yet||Nagpur: Mucormycosis among Covid recovered patients has already taken a “sizeable toll” in the district but a specific figure is yet to come out. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, several deaths have taken place at homes after the patients took discharge against medical advice. Such deaths have not been reported so far. Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, member of the Covid task force, said once the data is compiled the earlier deaths too may be included. The district collector and health department are compiling data on the number of mucormycosis patients in hospitals, past discharges and deaths. It is being done to frame a standard protocol and uniform guidelines for treatment of the disease with the help of a committee of experts and Covid task force. Special emphasis will be on usage of anti-fungal drugs of Amphotericin B family (liposomal, deoxycholate and lipid Emulsion) which are in short supply. District guardian minister Nitin Raut, who had chaired a review meeting in presence of divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and district collector Ravindra Thakare and members from medical fraternity, has issued instructions to ensure the drugs are not black-marketed. “A committee of doctors would decide on the judicial use of the crucial anti-fungal drugs on patients as per their needs,” he said. It’s learnt, Raut has instructed Thakare to ensure the poor population is given treatment at the government hospitals as they cannot afford the costly drugs being used in private hospitals. Meanwhile, Thakare has issued a letter to the pharmaceutical stockists and distributors to update the sales and purchase of Amphotericin B and other crucial drugs like posaconazole and isavuconazole with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at 11am and 8pm daily. The collector has started uploading details of sales and purchases of the anti-fungal drugs from May 1 on the official website. FDA joint commissioner Vijay Kose too has issued a similar letter to the stockists, distributors, depot owners and retailers to furnish details of the sales and purchases of the anti-fungal drugs twice a day. The collector and FDA joint commissioner have warned stakeholders against sending patients’ kin on a hunt by issuing a prescription even when no such drugs are available in the market. Senior pharmacist Murli Kewalramani of Suresh Medical said hopefully some anti-fungal drugs would arrive in the city next week “but the demand is so high that it may or may not be sufficient for the rising number of patients”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-data-on-death-of-mucormycosis-patients-in-district-available-yet/articleshow/82667741.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||15-day lockdown to cost Tamil Nadu nearly Rs 2,900 crore||CHENNAI: The 15-day complete lockdown, which was intensified from Saturday, will cost the state government at least Rs 2,900 crore in revenue. It may have a partial impact on the government's expenditure in the event if the intensified lockdown is extended beyond May 24. To compensate the revenue loss, the government could effect a revision in liquor prices, which has not been hiked for the past one year, say financial experts. Usually, Tasmac liquor shops and registration offices would have collectively contributed revenue of nearly Rs 2,500 crore in 15 days. Of this, property registrations account for an average of Rs 500 crore. The loss of the registration department is based on the three months’ revenue through land registrations. Since February, property registrations brought in an income exceeding Rs 1,000 crore every month. Losses through royalty from mines is estimated to be another Rs 25 crore for a fortnight, according to official sources with the mines department. Fuel stations are said to be witnessing a drop in sale of petrol and diesel by about 70% to 75%. The corresponding VAT and other service taxes loss for the state is at least Rs 386 crore in 15 days. The losses on VAT and service taxes is for approximately 3,675 fuel stations of the 4,900 fuel stations functioning in Tamil Nadu, which records an average sale of about 1.5 lakh litres of petrol and diesel per month. City-based fuel station dealer Suresh said the volume of sale in petrol and diesel now was just 25% to 30% of the normal sale. Former state chief internal auditor and ex-treasurer of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees Union A Mohan said about 60% of government revenue receipts is spent towards salary, pensions and those relating to government’s administrative expenditure. The remaining 40% goes to various welfare measures. Noting that the major spending for the present government will be for public health and sanitation, he said, “The immediate partial impact will be on public health because there could be no major expenditure during this period in the other sectors.” Tasmac is the only source of revenue post lockdown. “After lifting the lockdown, there could be an increase in liquor because that will not lead to a public outcry. If the government is going to increase taxes on fuel that will become an issue,” he said. Liquor prices were revised twice in 2020 including increasing 15% on excise revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/15-day-lockdown-to-cost-state-nearly-rs-2900-crore/articleshow/82667736.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

Speaking to TOI, Ticlo said the health minister should take responsibility for oxygen supply at GMC as Covid victims are dying there because of supply issues. “If the health department is not functioning properly then the health minister should be blamed. Can we go to GMC and instruct them there? If we are told to go to GMC, then we will take responsibility,” the MLA said. Ticlo pointed to the lack of trained technical personnel deployed at GMC to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to Covid patients. Referring to how the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner had managed the Covid situation there, Ticlo accused the health department of mismanagement of the situation in the state. Meanwhile, he praised chief minister Pramod Sawant for doing everything possible to resolve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-must-take-blame-for-deaths/articleshow/82669757.cms||---
---||Kochi||Nandu helped them live in face of fear||Kozhikode: Nandu Mahadeva, whose fight against cancer gave hope and inspired many patients, succumbed to the disease on Saturday. He was 27. Hailing from Bharathanoor in Thiruvananthapuram, Nandu, as he is commonly called, breathed his last at the MVR Cancer Centre and Research Institute near here at 4am. The nonchalance displayed by him in taking on the disease with a smiling face and the efforts made by him as lead organizer of Athijeevanam, a social media collective of cancer patients, gave confidence to hundreds of cancer patients to take on the disease without losing heart. He sang songs and gave motivational speeches to light up the lives of cancer patients and was hugely popular on social media. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, Union minister of state for external affairs, V Muraleedharan among others joined hundreds of people in paying tributes to Nandu and offered their condolences. Nandu was diagnosed with bone cancer on April 1, 2018, and had to amputate his left leg during treatment at Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. But the resolute fighter in him began a new journey from then on which made his life a symbol of not giving up. In a Facebook post soon after the diagnosis, Nandu had written, “The disease of cancer has started to have a liking for me. But I am not going to consider it as a malady. I will treat it as a common cold,” he had said. Over the next one year, he travelled over 30,000 km including a trip to Oman and attended over 100 public programmes and went to the houses of cancer patients confined to their beds to inspire and cheer them up. He had climbed the 950-metre high Panchalimedu hills on his crutches and also undertook a pilgrimage to Pazhani Hills by climbing the 1008 steps of the hill shrine. When the disease relapsed in October 2019, and spread to lungs, he didn't lose heart and had said that his motto was that ‘Life has to be fought and won’ and added that success in life lies not in never falling but in rising after the fall. Nandu was open about his battle with cancer and updated every development in his fight to the Athijeevanam group. Nandu’s family, who had been running a catering firm in Thiruvananthapuram had been staying in Kozhikode for the last two years for his treatment at the MVR Cancer Centre. The funeral was carried out at West Hill crematorium in the morning. Nandu leaves behind his father Hari, mother Lekha and siblings Ananthu and Saikrishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nandu-helped-them-live-in-face-of-fear/articleshow/82665866.cms||---

---||Delhi||For many, volunteers turn saviours with free oxygen||New Delhi: When 49-year-old, Covid-positive Archana Bhatia’s oxygen level started dipping, her family members frantically started searching for a bed in hospitals. Despairing at not finding a bed due to the lengthy waiting list in the hospitals, there was some relief when the family came to know about the free distribution of oxygen concentrators. Bhatia’s son, Keshav, remembered, “I approached Delhi Arya Pratinidhi Sabha after learning that the organisation was distributing oxygen concentrators. I got the device without much hassle. My mother’s oxygen had gone down to a precarious 65, but has now improved to 90 and we are grateful to the Sabha for this.” Other hapless people like Keshav have received help in the form of oxygen support from the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha. The organisation has received 50 oxygen concentrators from north America and another 100 are set to arrive soon. Apart from oxygen support, the Sabha has been assisting people with the items required for cremations to give their loved one a dignified send-off. Beside this, the Sabha is providing food packets to people recovering from Covid at home as well as the families of patients in hospitals. Members of the organisation who are based in north America started a campaign called ‘Save a life, help India breathe by adopting an oxygen concentrator’ to raise donations to procure oxygen concentrators. Vishrut Arya of the Sabha in north America told TOI, “After the Covid cases soared in India, we decided to step up our activities to support our community. We got in touch with our people to understand the ground situation. Then we started our campaign after finding many patients were in dire need of oxygen. We will continue to extend our support based on the requirements of Covid patients.” He added they were also arranging an ambulance for Covid patients in Delhi. Vinay Arya, general secretary, Delhi Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, said, “We started the Covid relief work 15 days ago but only recently began distributing oxygen concentrators. A needy person has to fill a form on our website and we provide the device.” Sukhvir Singh, another Sabha member in Delhi, said, “When Covid-related deaths multiplied, many families could not conduct funerals properly. To help such families, we formed two teams of volunteers and they visit crematoriums and provide items for the rites. They also step in when family members of the deceased are unable to come to the cremation grounds.” Delhi Arya Pratinidhi Sabha has set up a centralised kitchen in R M Arya Girls’ School in Raja Bazar to prepare food packets for distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-many-volunteers-turn-saviours-with-free-oxygen/articleshow/82667768.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||Tortured in CID custody: MP Raju||Vijayawada: YSRCP’s rebel MP from Narsapuram, K Raghurama Krishnam Raju, who was arrested on the charge of sedition on Friday, has accused CID sleuths of custodial torture. The MP showed his swollen foot to the VI additional junior civil judge court in Mangalagiri before whom he was presented on Saturday. The MP’s lawyer moved a petition alleging that Krishnam Raju was beaten on his legs while he was in custody. The MP was arrested from his residence in Hyderabad on Friday and brought to the CID office in Mangalagiri for interrogation. The judge, who initially rejected the remand report filed by the CID, referred the MP to a corporate hospital for treatment. This is perhaps the first incident involving a VIP in recent times that the court has rejected the remand report submitted by the police. Later, the judge accepted the revised report and sent the MP to hospital for treatment. He will be in judicial remand till May 28. After full recovery, the MP will be sent to jail. In her order to the CID, the judge, K Aruna, referred to the complaint of Raju that prior to his going to sleep at the CID office on Friday night, around five persons covering their faces with handkerchiefs entered the room at around 11 pm. “They then tied his legs with rope, among them one person beat him with a stick and second person beat him with a hard rubber stick on feet,” the judge narrated Raju’s claim in the order. After which, Raju was asked to walk on the floor and then they again thrashed his soles around four to five times. This time when Raju was unable to walk, they went away. After observing Raju’s foot, the judge ordered the superintendent of Guntur GGH and Ramesh Hospital to examine his injuries in presence of his Y category security. The court also asked the medical officers examining the injury to make a record of the injuries or marks of violence and ascertain as to what time they were inflicted. Earlier, the AP high court dismissed the MP’s petition seeking bail and directed him to approach the CID court for bail. The MP once again moved the high court on Saturday night seeking protection and stating that he feared for his life. He also alleged that CID officials had physically abused him. A division bench of AP high court heard the petition. The counsel representing Krishnam Raju claimed before the magistrate court that there were injuries on the MP’s body. His lawyer Kavuri Gopinath also said that the police had prevented them from going to court. He said the situation was such that police permission had to be sought to go to court. In its FIR against the MP, the CID stated that they had taken suo motu action based on an inquiry report submitted by a DIG-rank officer. The report accused Krishnam Raju of making ‘hate speeches’ on various media and social media channels. The FIR also mentions that two vernacular TV channels were booked for airing the speech of the MP. The report summarises that Raju did not just restrict to fair criticism of the government but made ‘every attempt’ to create hatred and disaffection towards the government. “Not only has he done this through his words, but also used visual gestures of face and hands to provoke his followers to take up violence,” the FIR stated. Raju is also accused of particularly targeting a caste and a community and trying to stoke hatred against them by portraying the government of being favourable towards them. Raju was arrested from his residence in Gachibowli, Hyderabad, on Friday afternoon while he was celebrating his birthday with his immediate family members. He was then brought to the CID headquarters in Mangalagiri where the medical examination took place. CID officials booked Raju under Sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 505 (incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence) r/w 120B (criminal conspiracy) IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tortured-in-cid-custody-mp-raju/articleshow/82669716.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

However, so far, the state government has not got any major commitment either from the Centre or the two vaccine manufacturers. Against last month’s order of 2.50 crore vaccine doses, the state government has got commitment for just under 11 lakh doses for May, which is very less against the demand. In the 18-45 age group, the state government will have to vaccinate close to 3.50 crore citizens, which is a big challenge. For the 45-plus age group, the Centre has assured to provide free vaccines. The Gujarat government will have to spend over Rs 2,000 crore for procuring vaccines to inoculate persons in the 18-45 age group in the state. The 2.50 crore doses for which orders have been placed, will cost Gujarat government around Rs 800 crore. The state government will require around 6.50 crore doses for vaccinating persons in the 18-45 age group in two rounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-requests-centre-to-expedite-vaccine-supply/articleshow/82667790.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Chandigarh||Six months at Delhi borders: Farmers to observe May 26 as Black Day||Bathinda: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has decided to observe May 26, when the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders will complete six months, as “Black Day.” Also, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will complete seven years of prime ministership the same week. He was elected leader of the parliamentary board on May 25, 2018 and assumed office on May 30. Farmers have given a nationwide call to people, especially farmers, to put up black flags on top of their houses, on their vehicles, in their fields and on their business establishments. Protesters have also urged people to burn effigies of the Narendra Modi government across the country while adhering to Covid protocol. On November 26, farmers from Punjab and Haryana reached the borders of Delhi demanding repeal of the contentious farm laws and have been protesting since. The decision was taken on Saturday after meetings of Punjab’s farmer organisations on May 13 and that of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Friday. Farmers have also decided to start making their presence felt in Uttar Pradesh, where state assembly elections are due in a few months. However, they are yet to finalise a strategy for this. Senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, on Saturday, claimed, “As the Narendra Modi government is sitting on the farm laws, forcing farmers to withstand the elements to protest, we have decided to observe May 26 as ‘Black day’ to lodge our protest against this government, which has turned deaf and blind.” He also said that farmers were waiting for an invitation from the Central government to resume dialogue for the past nearly four months. The last round of talks with Central ministers was held on January 22. Rajewal claimed that the attitude of the Union government towards farmers was “unmasked” when it sharply increased prices of fertilisers. Though the price hike was put on hold for some time as there were elections in five states, prices were hiked after the elections. “Prices of diesel are also being regularly hiked but on the other hand, this government is enacted drama of providing assistance to farmers under PM Kisan,” he alleged. The farmer leader added that due to the high input costs, farmers are losing Rs 1,000 per quintal of wheat. ‘Hike sugarcane price to Rs 350/qtl’ Apart from taking on the Central government, farmers’ organisations of Punjab have also decided to take on the Punjab government on prices of sugarcane and dues amounting to Rs 600 crore which are pending towards of sugarcane growers and private sugar mills. Farmers have asked the state government to enhance the price of sugarcane from the present Rs 310 per quintal to Rs 350 per quintal, at par with Haryana and make mills clear dues. If the government did not comply with their demand, they said a front would be opened against the state government soon. Farm leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Jangvir Singh, Manjiot Singh Rai and Mukesh said dues of Rs 350 crore are pending towards public sector sugar mills and Rs 250 crore towards private sugar mills. Farmers will wait for some times and will start the struggle to get the pending amount and price hike, they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/six-months-at-delhi-borders-farmers-to-observe-may-26-as-black-day/articleshow/82669711.cms||Neel Kamal

S Krishnayyar of Srirangam is among those feeding Covid-19 patients as well as abandoned people for the past few weeks. “Our service has been extended to people in containment areas who cannot freely move out. We hand over the food to the corporation staff there and ask them to distribute it,” says Krishnayyar who offers packed variety rice to about 2,500 people in several areas. Visually challenged people in Nagamangalam and Narikurvar people in Devarayaneri are among the recipients of the food. “People deprived of their livelihood accept the food. It gives us great pleasure to us help them with contribution from donors,” he says adding that they can be contacted on the mobile number 9944006688.

Telangana people make a dash to Maha and Karnataka to get vaccinated||HYDERABAD: Many Covid 19 patients from neighbouring states have been rushing to Hyderabad for treatment when they fail to find a hospital bed in their region. But the trend is in reverse when it comes to vaccination. Many people from Telangana, aged between 18 and 44 years, have been going to Maharashtra and Karnataka to get vaccinated. This unique form of ‘vaccine tourism’ has been noticed in Mancherial, Jagityal, Adilabad, Peddapalli, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Kamareddy and Sangareddy districts for the past past 10 days. Some are even renting vehicles to cross the border. All these districts are 100 to 150 km from the Maharashtra and Karnataka borders. The Telangana government had planned to start vaccination for those between 18 and 44 years from May 1. But because of a shortage of vaccines, it halted the drive for the younger lot and focussed only on those in the 45 and above category. On the other hand, both Maharashtra and Karnataka have started vaccinating those below 45 years. Sources, however, said they are not getting many takers among the younger lot in the smaller towns especially in border areas. It is these slots that people from Telangana are filling. Sironcha in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra is about 110 km from Mancherial. Similarly, Mahur in Nanded district is about 80 to 100 km from Adilabad. Zaheerabad in Sangareddy is about 30 km from Bidar town in Karnataka and around 110 km from Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jab-well-done-t-people-make-a-dash-to-maha-and-karnataka-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/82669755.cms||Koride Mahesh

Multiple individuals whose samples tested positive were not contacted by the health authorities to check their status and test the contacts. However, those tested by the government are being monitored. The surge in fresh infections have made private labs do more home collection. Although test results were shared in less than 24 or 48 hours, those who tested positive were not tracked by the local body authorities like earlier. Usually, if a sample turns positive, the labs will alert the centralised Covid control room through which the local body authorities will contact the patients. The officials will insist on either getting hospitalised or stay in a Covid care centre or remain in home isolation depending on the severity of the infection. Primary contacts will be asked to visit the nearest PHC for screening. However, such mechanism did not cover those who got tested through private labs. “Five days since I and mother tested positive, we did not receive any calls from health officials. We isolated ourselves as the symptoms were mild,” said a 26-year- doctor from Cantonment who got tested by a private lab. Another 37-year-old man from Ponmalaipatti said he was not contacted by the health officials for contact tracing. People said that they preferred private labs as home swab collection service is offered. “We will insist that private labsupload the details of positive cases every day. At times, patients are also giving wrong contact information, making the tracing difficult,” a senior health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-contact-tracing-done-for-tests-in-pvt-labs-results-not-uploaded-daily-says-trichy-corpn/articleshow/82669737.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Kochi||Kerala: Mpeda patents its mud crab hatchery technology||KOCHI: Mpeda-RGCA has patented its mud crab hatchery technology with the controller general of patent, design and trade marks, Govt. of India, for 20 years from 2011 to 2030. The hatchery technology for mud crab (scientific name-Scylla serrata) has been developed by the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture (RGCA), the research and development arm of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (Mpeda). Mpeda chairman K S Srinivas said, “It will go a long way in meeting the seed requirement of farmers who intend to undertake diversified species for aquaculture instead of concentrating on shrimp farming alone.” Keeping in view the huge demand for mud crab, especially in South East Asian countries, Mpeda had initiated a pilot project for mud crab seed (known as crab-instar) production during 2004 and subsequently made the commercial hatchery for the first time in India during 2013 with the capacity of one million per annum. Due to its growing demand, the seed production capacity of RGCA’s mud crab hatchery has been increased to 1.4 million per annum. Dr Emilia T Quinitio, an eminent scientist from Aquaculture Division of International Institute known as Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Centre (SEAFDEC), Philippines, had extended the consultancy service till 2013 to RGCA. Since then, the technology has been standardized by the RGCA’s scientists within a short period. The Mpeda chairman said that the major achievement lies in increasing the survival rate of crab instar from 3% world record to seven 7%. Further, the hatchery unit is designed in such a manner that all sections are under one roof with complete bio-security measures.

Trichy rural police led by the superintendent of police A Myilvaganan deployed the drone for use in its five divisions – Lalgudi, Jeeyapuram, Musiri, Manapparai and Thiruverumbur. A senior police officer said that they started using the drone in the busy areas. “As of now, we will use the drone a day in one division. The idea is to have an overview of the situation. The facility helps us identify the areas where the violators are galore and take action accordingly,” the officer said on Saturday. Police also said that incidences of gathering in public places were low. On the contrary, the movement of public on two-wheelers was higher in the rural areas than the urban areas. In such scenarios, the use of drone played a good role in keep surveillance on them, said the officer. In a statement, superintendent of police Myilvaganan said that the rural police had so far booked and fined 16,262 people for not wearing masks since the lockdown was imposed. A total of 608 were penalised for not maintaining social distance. Police also pressed into service 800 personnel and 300 home guards into duty. The rural police kept a tight vigil in 20 entry points of the district. Police also identified 84 vantage points and intensified the security there. Two-wheeler patrols in 30 places and four-wheeler patrol in 15 places were deployed across the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-rural-police-deploy-drone-for-surveillance/articleshow/82669733.cms||---
---||Nagpur||After Genetek, FDA wants more cos to make Amphotericin B||Nagpur: The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Nagpur, which has given nod to Genetek Lifesciences Private Limited in Wardha to manufacture Amphotericin B, wants more pharmaceutical companies to follow suit. Genetek, now waiting for ingredients to arrive from abroad, would manufacture Amphotericin B Emulsion which is expected to hit the markets in another three weeks’ time. Costing barely 25% of liposomal Amphotericin B, Genetek’s Ampho emulsion would have a price tag of around Rs1,200, said its managing director Mahendra Kshirsagar. The FDA is facing an uphill task after three crucial anti-fungal drugs of Amphotericin family (liposomal, deoxycholate and emulsion) went out of stock in the backdrop of a sudden spike in mucormycosis cases. It has started approaching the pharmaceutical companies to explore whether they have adequate capacities to manufacture the anti-fungal drug. With only one company in Maharashtra is so far manufacturing the drug, FDA and district administration were left a helpless lot after the black fungus infection started affecting Covid recovered patients in large numbers. “The only company which manufactured Amphotericin B in Maharashtra has started increasing its production. The product had never seen such demand in the past as it is experiencing now,” said an FDA official. “There are around half a dozen pharmaceutical companies in Vidarbha who can manufacture the drug. We are approaching them,” he said and added, “Genetek’s production will take some load off the demand but the approval has been granted just now.” Khirsagar said Ampho emulsion is much safer than deoxycholate (also known as conventional Ampho) and its toxicity is minimum. “Deoxycholate has become redundant. Its safer to use Emulsion which is also cheaper than liposomal variety,” he said and added, “We also have the capacity to manufacture even liposomal, but it’s very costly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-genetek-fda-wants-more-cos-to-make-amphotericin-b/articleshow/82667757.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chandigarh||Panel to probe ‘bill-before-body’ charges||Mohali: Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has ordered an inquiry into the allegations of relatives of a Covid-19 victim that a private hospital refused to hand over the body without clearance of bills and of overcharging. A three-member committee of sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and senior medical officer (SMO) have been asked to submit a report within 24 hours. Paramjit Singh suffering from pneumonia owing to Covid-19 had been admitted to the hospital in Zirakpur on April 26 . On May 10, the patient’s family had taken “LAMA (left against medical advice) from the hospital to transfer the patient to a private hospital in Chandigarh”. “But the Chandigarh hospital could not manage to take the patient. In the meantime, the patient’s condition deteriorated and was retained in the same hospital. He died on May 14,” the complaint had said. The attendants had claimed the patient was not given proper care and accused the hospital of raising an exorbitant bill. An attendant also had a heated argument with a hospital employee in which an LED TV was broken. They had alleged the hospital refused to give the patient’s body unless the bill was settled. The hospital had denied any substandard treatment and the bills were according to the norms. A local SHO had rushed to the spot on receiving the complaint. The body had been handed over to the patient’s family and was cremated the same day. The DC said, “Fleecing patients will not go without consequences.” He said no hospital should wrongfully confine any patient, or body of a patient, treated in the hospital under any circumstances. “If a hospital denies giving the body before settlement of bills, it is illegal, and action shall be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panel-to-probe-bill-before-body-charges/articleshow/82662572.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Attendants of home isolation patients too have tough task||LUCKNOW: Ankur Srivastava (55) had not got even an hour’s sound sleep for three weeks after three of his family members tested Covid-19 positive on April 12. After failing to get hospital beds, the Gomtinagar resident, with only his son by his side, had to perform the Herculean task of nursing patients at home, managing household chores, queuing up daily for oxygen refill and running errands. Like Srivastava, many families, who have been forced to keep critical patients at home for want of hospital beds, are fending for themselves, performing multiple tasks all alone, leaving most of them physically and emotionally drained. The three patients at Ankur’s house tested negative on May 5, but he still shudders while recalling the horrifying 23 days. “While 75-year-old father was gasping for breath on April 12, I was frantically calling hospitals and my son Vihaan ran from pillar to post to arrange an oxygen cylinder. A doctor friend dictated to me on the phone how to set up oxygen support at home and prescribed medication. Wife (54) and daughter (24) who had mild symptoms isolated themselves in a separate room,” he said. But, the struggle had just begun. While Aknur looked after the patients, Vihaan spent all day outside getting medicines, oxygen refill and groceries. As the domestic help stopped coming, the duo also was burdened with cooking, washing and cleaning. Even after the exhaustive day, they took turns in night to grab four hours sleep at the most, to monitor patients without break. “We survived only on bread and milk for some days, but when the doctor advised a balanced diet, I requested relatives to home deliver meals, but only one agreed. The rest were scared to even leave the tiffin at the doorstep,” said Ankur. Smriti Sharma (36), had to double up as a nurse and housekeeper for two weeks after her mother Vineeta (63) tested Covid-19 positive on April 19. Her brother, Vivek (30) spent most of the day queuing up for oxygen refill, getting medicine and running errands. They isolated their father, Jagmohan (68), to keep him safe.  The siblings lost considerable weight due to loss of appetite and scanty sleep. The Tiwari family in Aliganj also underwent similar ordeal after the head of the family Arun,66, a retired teacher, was diagnosed with Covid pneumonia on April 12. When they could not get a bed in a hospital, Arun’s son Shreyash made arranged oxygen at home. Friends helped by providing drugs, and masks and other essentials. The nightmare ended when Arun tested negative on April 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/attendants-of-home-isolation-patients-too-have-tough-task/articleshow/82669763.cms||---

With the lockdown underway and the spread of Covid-19 intensifying, the residents were made to depend on private suppliers for drinking water and for refilling the tanks. Residents of LIC Colony on the Medical College Road behind the Thanjavur passport office said that Thanjavur Corporation suspended the water supply a few weeks ago as part of some work proposed under the smart cities mission. The existing pipelines were modified so as to ensure all households get equal quantum of water in equal pressure. Although the civil work was completed in a couple of weeks, the corporation is yet to restore water supply to hundreds of households in LIC Colony. The absence of corporation water has made residents approach service providers amid the pandemic.  “We will expedite the pending work at the earliest to restore the water supply,” P Janaki Raveendran, commissioner, Thanjavur Corporation, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/lack-of-water-supply-adds-to-thanjavur-folks-woes/articleshow/82669758.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man seen on CCTV assaulting 5-yr-old adopted girl, neighbours approach cops||Mumbai: A video of a man assaulting his five-year-old adopted daughter on the building staircase has gone viral on social media and was tagged to the Mumbai police, seeking immediate action on Saturday. Based on the information, an inquiry has been launched at DN Nagar police station and officials are recording statements of residents at Ratnasamuh Housing Society on Juhu Link Road in Andheri (west). Building residents had approached Child Helpline a week ago after which the man’s family, along with the child, left the building and returned only on Saturday. On May 15, filmmaker and social activist, Ashoke Pandit, tweeted to Mumbai police: “...This man who has adopted this girl child physically & mentally abuses her & abandons her in the building compound all alone for hours. He has gone underground since @CHILDLINE1098 is investigating. Pls make this video viral. @MumbaiPolice @CPMumbaiPolice. Please help”. “I learnt about the incident after the building resident informed me. The man was seen brutally thrashing his adopted daughter for no reason,” Pandit told TOI. Senior police inspector Bharat Gaikwad said they are inquiring based on the Twitter complaint they have received. “Statements of residents will be recorded,” he said. On Saturday, no FIR was registered. The video had been captured on November 16, 2020, in the CCTV but noticed only on May 2 by building resident, Amit Mohite, has gone viral with over 3,600 views and was retweeted more than 216 times. Building resident Yogesh Pingulkar said the video of assaulting and abusing the minor was captured in the motion-sensing security camera installed by one of the residents, Amit Mohite, of the same society for his security. “Mohite, while deleting his data of the CCTV, came across the video. After discussing with another resident Raaju Anarkat and Pandit we took advice from Child Helpline and their team visited the building on May 7 but the person had left the building then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-seen-on-cctv-assaulting-5-yr-old-adopted-girl-neighbours-approach-cops/articleshow/82669762.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||After plasma donation, an FAQ to clear doubts||NEW DELHI: Sneha Gogia lost her father to Covid-19 a few days ago. She decided then that she would donate her plasma as a tribute to him since he was a regular blood donor. Having recovered from Covid a few months ago, Gogia donated her plasma and posted a picture along with FAQs related to plasma donation. She wanted to encourage recovered people who were hesitant about donating the antibody-rich plasma. A corporate employee in an e-commerce organisation, Gogia was thankful to her company for giving her the information she needed for going ahead with her intention to donate plasma. “I enrolled for a donation and they registered my details,” said Gogia. The entire process was smooth, and she took a video of it to post on her social media profiles and to forward it on WhatsApp. “I also created an FAQ page with answers for a lot of general queries that people have about plasma donation,” said Gogia. Nalini Menon too donated plasma two weeks ago having fully recovered from Covid in February. “The reason why I did this was to help someone I know who needed plasma. I mentioned this on social media.” She noted that many people were not keen to donate plasma. “The process takes a lot of time and many people are concerned they might get re-infected in the hospitals or while travelling,” said Menon, an HR executive. Hoping in a similar way to motivate potential donors, Dr Sharang Madab posted about his act of donating plasma on his Facebook wall. “Plasma donations could save lives. When I found someone looking for a donor, I went ahead and assisted them.” According to Dr Aqsa Shaikh, associate professor of community medicine at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences & Research, Jamia Hamdard, hesitancy about donating plasma rises from the fact that some people take a few months to fully recover and complain of fatigue for more days. “Hence they avoid giving plasma fearing that this will debilitate them further,” said Shaikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-plasma-donation-an-faq-to-clear-doubts/articleshow/82667799.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

With doctors insisting patients on frequently checking their SpO2 (Oxygen saturation) level to identify anomalies, substandard pulse oximeters in the market showing faulty oxygen level readings are making the infected population panic and approach hospitals. Medical professionals opined that pulse oximeters help people tested positive to monitor the oxygen saturation in the blood. With the SpO2 reading of 95 and above identified as ideal, any reading below 90 requires hospitalisation. There are over 3,000 persons under home isolation across the Trichy district. With the price range of pulse oximeters varying between Rs 1,300 and Rs 1,750, most of the households with senior citizens are equipped with the device. Doctors said there are several cases approaching them with false low oxygen saturation level readings, mostly because of the substandard pulse oximeters. “Many patients in a panic over poor oxygen saturation level are approaching us but our devices record a safe saturation level,” Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, emergency physician said. The faulty readings further burden the hospitals and doctors reeling under shortage of beds. T Karthikeyan, a resident of Trichy said the imported pulse oximeter he bought for Rs 1,600 was giving abnormal readings which were found to be wrong by similar branded devices. Medical professionals said people looking for a pulse oximeter must buy a device, similar to the one used in most hospitals. “We will request district administration to stop the sales of substandard imported pulse oximeters available in the pharmacies. Unwanted fear should no be induced,” M Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/faulty-pulse-oximeters-scare-people-under-home-isolation/articleshow/82669753.cms||Deepak Karthik

Officials of the administration during a meeting with the District Development and Panchayat Officer (DDPO) asked him to prepare a list of schools, anganwadi kendras and dharamshalas in each village to convert them into isolation wards in case of need. The DDPO was also told to prepare a list of Covid patients in rural areas and find out the ratio based on their population. Serious patients belonging to the village would be shifted to these isolation centres from hospitals following their recovery. Deputy commissioner M K Ahuja has directed Panchkula and Kalka sub-divisional magistrates to submit daily reports to his office. All school teachers, anganwadi, ASHA and health workers at community health centres and primary health centres and health volunteers and sarpanches have been told to work in this direction. The administration would provide a financial assistance to the village according to the amount sanctioned by the Haryana government a week ago to set up temporary isolation centres in rural areas. On Thursday, the DC under Sections 9 and 11 of Punjab Village and Small Town Patrol Act 1918 ordered sarpanches to assign duties to youngsters to ensure all villagers and people coming to the village were following Covid-19 protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-villages-having-10-cases-to-get-isolation-centres/articleshow/82662620.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The villagers swung into action after around six people, including a Kargil war hero, died in the last two weeks. It was inaugurated on Friday. “The facility does not have oxygen or ICU beds. Many ex-Armymen have contributed Rs 1,000 each to set up oxygen concentrators,” Rupesh Patil, district president of Sambhaji Brigade, told TOI on Saturday. The village, with a population of around 4,000, has a large number ex-servicemen and many serving in the Army, due to which it is called Sainik Girgaon. “We sought guidance from the district health officer for starting the Covid care centre,” said Patil. The death of the Kargil war veteran due to lack of oxygen supply in a hospital in Kolhapur and expensive treatment in the city catapulted the villagers into action. Patil said the new facility in the village will also be available for people from outside Girgaon. “Ten days of treatment, isolation and food will be given to the patients free of cost at the facility. Mind and laughter therapy sessions will also be conducted daily. A full-time nursing facility will be provided along with visiting doctors.” District medical officer Yogesh Sale said the facility will be like a quarantine centre for asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. The district administration will provide technical and medicinal help related to doctors and nurses. However, the remaining things are to be taken care of by local self governing bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-6-deaths-in-14-days-maha-villagers-set-up-covid-centre/articleshow/82672603.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Black fungal infection is caused by a group of molds called ‘mucormycetes’, which is present in the air and causes complications when an ill patient inhales these, which then spreads into the sinus cavities, lungs and chest cavities. Ranjan said government is collecting information about import of the medicine from neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Dubai. “The drug is in short supply across the country. RMSCL, despite that, has floated an EOI (expression of interest), which will open on Monday for generic medicines. In a parallel manner, we also contacted many branded drug suppliers. Many suppliers showed their reluctance because of the Centre’s order (May 11) to regulate it. Despite that one vendor agreed and we placed the order on Friday night,” said Ranjan. “There is a substitute drug for liposomal amphotericin B and it is called Posaconazole. The experts at SMS hospital have given approval for this drug and we will be procuring this as well. There’s one more substitute drug called isoconazole,” he added. In view of surge in the number of positive cases in the state, medicine kits are being distributed to patients with ILI (Influenza like Illness) symptoms. Meanwhile, orders have been issued by RMSCL for weekly supply of medicines from the pharma companies through short-term limited bids for the purchase of essential drugs including Azithromycin, Paracetamol, Levocetirizine, Zinc Sulphate and Ascorbic Acid. “There was a spike in demand for these drugs after the order was issued on May 4. After we observed an exceptionally high demand for these drugs (which was not observed earlier on a single day), we floated an expression of interest (EOI) - including both rates and deliverables – in terms of a week, meaning the amount medicines that can be supplied by a vendor per week,” said an official. “On May 12, we finalized and placed the order. So under exceptional circumstances, the government has allowed us to go for direct contracts and other possible ways of saving lives. The drugs will be procured from multiple suppliers/vendors at multiple rates. But, through weekly supplies we will cater to the needs of the state and it will be increased accordingly,” he added. “In this exceptional case, if the vendor which supplies drugs at the lowest rate doesn’t show up or delays in supply of drugs, we will go for those vendors who will ensure early supply of medicines even though the rates are high,” he added. Box Health min writes to Harsh Vardhan, demands more drugs Jaipur: Health minister Raghu Sharma on Friday said that the state is in urgent need of 50,000 vials of liposomal amphotericin B and he has written a letter to nion health minister Harsh Vardhan in this regard.

I also feel exhausted and ambushed. Is this really happening?” sighs Radhika Bapat, a slight young woman, her thoughts restlessly vacillating. In other times, these are questions that she would have been fielding to help others battle their anxiety and fear. But for the first time in her career, Bapat, a clinical psychologist, found herself experiencing the same emotions alongside them. What was gnawing at them was also gnawing at her. One of the hardest parts of being a therapist — in high demand during the pandemic — has been the parallel experience of helping too many clients cope with crises that they have been going through themselves. Bapat says her caseload was manageable last year. “People were dealing with shock and threat but were more careful and responsible. This year we’re mostly dealing with panic and grief.” By March this year, Bapat had become her own client, a woman on the verge, who could barely fight the urge to turn away clients or terminate therapy. “A part of me feels like asking all those who have been consciously irresponsible to just not approach me for therapy. ‘If you can be reckless, you asked for it’ is the underlying thought.” The blurring of boundaries too, took its toll. While telepsychiatry became the new normal in the pandemic after the central government allowed it for the first time last year to help people access therapy from their home, the overwhelming nature and volume of the crisis evolving through the two waves meant therapists had to mitigate not just emotional impact but also assist in emergencies. A report by the Telemedicine Society of India in February recorded an increase of about 302% in online mental-health consultations. Psychiatrist Syeda Ruksheda described how she had been stretching herself thin. “I was working seven days a week, trying to squeeze in as many consultations. Even during time-off I was doing webinars. Then came the celebrity suicide. Given the stigma and misinformation around it, it felt we were fighting another battle. In the second wave a lot of my patients are positive and because I’m a doctor, everyday someone will request help with a bed or oxygen. Dealing with our own household chores, taking care of our kids and trying to be there for our patients, started taking a huge toll on some of us,” says Ruksheda recounting the time that she was enraged when someone gifted her a basket of groceries. “I got mad thinking of the increased workload of sorting and sanitising it. I recognised my need to be responsible about my own feelings.” Therapists also rue the loss of tools they would normally use to help themselves or their clients cope. For Bapat, yoga classes and her son having his friends rather than just her satisfying his needs, were her panacea. “A simple thing like advising someone whose family is triggering them to go out for a walk or drive, I can no longer offer,” said Ruksheda, also strapped for her quarterly “me-time” breaks. Besides dealing with the swell in demand, there have been financial troubles to boot with some offering their services pro bono while struggling to earn a living. “Many clients are requesting discounts or are unable to pay. It’s hard if you’re a therapist with no other sources of income,” explained Bapat. To beat the burnout — or compassion fatigue — mental health professionals have been seeking therapy to examine their own emotional state. For Bapat it was about choosing between her clients and her sanity. “On one hand, you know their problems are real and the distress palpable but when your phone is continuously buzzing with SOS messages or you’re added to a WhatsApp group without consent it’ gets too much to take.” In March, she took help. “To deal with children who had lost their parents to Covid. I needed help to process that life was unfair,” says Bapat, for whom finding the right therapist was like a matrimonial match. “It helped me get things off my chest and have someone external to me, be objective about it.” Syeda fell back on her network of therapist friends. “We’ve bonded with each other more than ever because of necessity. For instance if we notice someone’s sounding a bit off on a messenger or at a webinar, we reach out. And most of us are comfortable talking and venting to each other.” Kedar Tiwale, consultant psychiatrist with the Fortis network of hospitals says that the “buddy system” — of having a go-to person that could be a mentor or a colleague — inculcated during mental health training — is reaping dividends in the pandemic. “A lot of people from the medical fraternity have been reaching out from across states for one-on-one candid talks. It’s allowing us to recalibrate what we are going through and help our clients in the process.” Last month, Bapat decided to gamify an initiative to support practising psychologists by dedicating her Tuesdays to help fellow therapists “vent” while urging them, in turn, to do the same for another mental health worker. The initiative has now snowballed with the Asian American Psychological Association offering free psychological first-aid to healthcare frontline workers in India including therapists. Attending such “vent out” sessions is helping psychologist Saba Jamwal recognise signs of a burnout. “Initially I thought it was going smoothly until screen time increased, backaches became prominent and my entire family got Covid. I got back to seeing clients in a week but with the second wave my emotions overlapped with the grief, anger, helplessness and fatigue that my clients were feeling,” says Jamwal who sought therapy two months ago. “Peer supervision is helping me process what’s happening within me.” Besides taking a pause to examine their own emotional competence, small restorative activities — cultivating healthy bedtime habits, journaling or quitting messaging groups to “escape the infodemic” — is helping them rise to the occasion. Ruksheda says: “We have to enforce on our own selves, what we tell others. There are very few of us out there and we need to be collectively okay to help others heal.” Bapat agrees. “I see us running an ultramarathon and to make it to the finish line, we have to keep at it, slow and steady.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/care-for-carers-mental-health-professionals-fight-anxiety-fatigue/articleshow/82669780.cms||Mohua Das
---||Chandigarh||Leave hostels, PU urges students||Chandigarh: After several hostel cleaners, attendants, gardeners and mess canteen workers had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last few days, Professor S K Tomar, dean student welfare (DSW), has appealed to hostellers to return to their homes to break the chain of Covid. Tomar said PU has already issued an advisory twice that hostel residents should go back to their families for their safety and health latest by Saturday. “To break the chain of infection, it is again advised that those who are still staying in hostels should go back to their homes as early as possible,” he said. The authorities said administrative block, vice-chancellor office and some other departments will be closed for a few days. The office of the DSW on the request by warden of girls’ hostel (GH) 2 (Laxmi Bai), contacted the health authorities with a request to conduct testing of staff, mess workers and residents of GH1 and GH2. The tests would be done on Sunday. A total of of around 50-55 people are still staying in hostel numbers 1 and 2. This includes 34 students. Seven out of total staff of 18 in GH 2 have tested positive since the mid of April. Officials said an attendant who had tested positive on Friday had come in contact with many hostel staffers, canteen workers and residents of a hostel. She also came in contact with protesting students on May 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/leave-hostels-pu-urges-students/articleshow/82662665.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||DU students turn Covid warriors, do their bit to help those hunting for care resources||New Delhi: Even though managing classes in the pandemic is no easy feat, students of Rajdhani College have taken up another mantle of being Covid heroes in between classes. As a part of their ‘Yuva’ society initiative, students are verifying information and coordinating with people on Twitter and Instagram, looking for plasma, oxygen cylinders and ambulance services. Colleges are trying to do their bit to provide assistance to all those in need, as many Delhi University teachers are suffering from the viral infection and several have even succumbed to it. Rajeev Giri, principal of Rajdhani College, stated that the students’ efforts will be appreciated once the college reopens. “Right now, the college is reimbursing the students for their expenses on making calls and using the internet, as we know it is no easy task for them as well.” Many colleges have set up helpdesks through their NSS units. Shivaji College principal Shiv Kumar Sahdev stated the college has been filtering information on plasma, medicines and all such essential items required by people in these times of trouble. “We have been collecting, and verifying information and have shared it with many,” the principal said. Shivaji also has a vaccination centre for those above 45 years of age that came up after the college approached a nodal officer for it. “Our college also has a 24x7 health centre that is open to all. The doctor at the centre is helping out hundreds of people through tele-consultation,” said Sahdev. The college has also asked for a vaccination centre for 18-44 age group on campus. At Kamala Nehru College, a helpdesk called Lifeline is collating data about emergency services, and has assigned students and faculty the task of searching hospital admissions. “We have also planned post-Covid counselling for students,” said principal Kalpana Bhakuni. “The death of a varsity faculty was one of the reasons for starting the helpline. These students have seen a lot of pain in their families and with friends.” The college has also written to LG Anil Baijal, the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for a vaccination centre on campus. It has also partnered with the Centre for Holistic Development to provide assistance to Covid patients and those who have lost their kin. Mamta Sharma, principal of Aditi Mahavidyalaya, said that her college has provided a quarantine camp to 75 CRPF officers who returned from election duties in West Bengal. “We have also collaborated with ILBS to encourage plasma donation,” she said. While colleges are doing their bit, many in DU are unhappy with the university’s approach related to the health facilities at the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (VPCI). In a letter to the vice-chancellor PC Joshi and other members of the VPCI governing body, Executive Council members JL Gupta and Seema Das stated that “there is an urgent need to revamp the facilities available at all medical centres and more particularly, at VPCI.” There have been demands in the past to convert the institute into a Covid-specific centre for students and faculty of DU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-students-turn-covid-warriors-do-their-bit-to-help-those-hunting-for-care-resources/articleshow/82667830.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Lucknow||Staff crunch at KGMU: Kin double up as attendants, wade into Covid risk||LUCKNOW: Wearing only gloves and a facemask, Ravi Singh takes care of his 42-year-old sister who was admitted to KGMU after testing Covid-19 positive. “She is in ICU and family members take turns to be with her to monitor her condition, help her to the toilet and do sponging. The staff only helps in administering intravenous drugs,” Ravi said. Contrary to the claims of KGMU authorities that only family members of those patients who have turned asymptomatic are at times allowed to go near them, TOI reality check found that many families, like that of Ravi’s, are nursing their Covid-19 patients in most of the wards in the hospitals associated with the university. Generally, a family member remains with the patient while others stay in the waiting area or rain basera for arrangement of medicines. This arrangement exposes the attendants to the risk of catching infection and passing it on to others outside. No family member is provided PPE kit and they have to buy masks, gloves and face shields on their own. “The quality of food for the patients and attendance is satisfactory. However, toilets lack sanitation. Most of the medicines are given by the hospital, but at times when it is not available, we have to buy from the market in Chowk,” said Ravi. “Nobody from the staff has asked us to be on the bedside of the patient, but nobody stopped us either. We have to come and attend our patients because no staff is around to help them with toilet needs, cleaning and even provide drinking water. I presume the situation is due of shortage of staff,” he added. Virendra Awasthi, whose 56-year-old wife with severe chest infection is under treatment, said doctors and staff make sure that the attendant is wearing the mask. “We also monitor oxygen levels and inform resident doctors on duty if it falls.” Similarly, family members of DS Tripathi (80), who died recently after battling with the virus for 15 days, took care of all his needs during hospital stay. “I stayed in the night and my wife during the day. We used to do all the cleaning work as well. Once my wife had to call a sanitary worker to clean the soiled bedsheet, he charged Rs 300 for that,” said Tripathi’s son Manav. KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said, “Sometimes relatives are allowed in the wards if patients need special care. However, the permission is given only when the patients turn asymptomatic.” He added that this practice would also be stopped. However, a senior professor said KGMU had increased the number of Covid beds to more than 900 without considering shortage of staff in view. “The staff crunch was there even in ordinary times, which aggravated after nearly 25% of workers, including doctors, nurses, ward boys and sanitary workers got infected. Although more employees are being recruited through outsource, they need training before deployment in wards,” he added.

---||Nagpur||Doctors racking brain for workable combo in absence of Amphotericin B||Nagpur: The sudden shortage of Amphotericin B family (Liposomal, Deoxycholate and Lipid Emulsion) has pushed medical experts to brainstorm over alternative therapies through different combinations of drugs to tackle mucormycosis in Covid-recovered patients. Posaconazole, an add-on drug which is many times prescribed during discharge, is also in short supply. The doctors have already been trying different combinations as Amphotericin B family of drugs had got gradually exhausted from the shelf of chemists. Now, it’s reliably learnt that a group of senior doctors and Covid task force are brainstorming over forming a treatment protocol and guidelines for mucormycosis. Sources stated the committee would try to formulate a guideline regarding the usage of drugs as per mild, moderate and severe cases. This is the protocol for the anti-viral drug Remdesivir too. The government is also likely to take a decision to regulate the drug’s use. Dr Prashant Nikhade, president of the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Doctors’ Association, said patients cannot be made to wait for the Amphotericin B crisis to get over as the fungal growth is quick and life-threatening. “We need to explore the options of using drugs like Posaconazole or Isavuconazole. Amphotericin B will remain the primary line of treatment. Isavuconazole is part of the Azole derivative (Triazole). Though the efficacy of Isavuconazole is not as high as Amphotericin B, it will keep the fight on,” he said. Like Nikhade, several other doctors too shared their experience stating Azole blocks the synthesis of the Ergosterol which is an important component of the fungal cell. ENT specialist Dr Samir Thakare of New Era Hospital suggested yet another Triazole derivative — Itraconazole — saying that it may be used as treatment cannot be stopped. “Though Itraconazole does not have a promising role, we have limited options in the absence of the key drug,” said Dr Thakare. Well-known physician Dr Mohan Nerkar of Seven Star hospital said Posaconazole and Isavuconazole are merely add-ons but can be administered to the patients if the primary drug (Ampho) is not available anywhere. “The drugs like Voriconazole, which acts better on Aspergillus, can be used too in mucormycosis as a compromise,” he said. Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, top pulmonologist and a member of the Covid task team, suggested the use of Caspofungin as an alternative. “We have to explore the uses of both mono and combination therapies,” he said. Several experts are now also suggesting the use of Echinocandins which are the relatively new class of anti-fungal agents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-racking-brain-for-workable-combo-in-absence-of-amphotericin-b/articleshow/82667828.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Gurgaon||Cops hunt for 25 suspects for rape of Delhi woman in Palwal forest||Gurgaon: A 22-year-old woman from Delhi was lured into a forested area by a man who had promised to introduce her to his parents and allegedly raped by 25 of his friends through the night and next morning. The woman, who approached police nine days later after she had gained enough strength, said in her complaint that she had met a man named Sagar (23) on Facebook in January this year and exchanged numbers with him. The woman works as a domestic staffer in Delhi and has been staying in the capital for the past four years. After months of talking over the phone, Sagar allegedly proposed marriage to the woman and told her he would like to introduce her to his parents in Palwal’s Hodal village. He insisted that the woman come to Hodal and talk to his parents directly. It was on May 3 that the woman travelled all the way to Hodal and met Sagar. But instead of taking her home, Sagar took her to a forest in Ramgarh village. His brother Samundar and a group of his friends were having liquor near a tubewell there. As soon as Sagar reached there with the woman, the others waiting there pounced on her and took turns to rape her the whole night. The next day, she was taken to a scrap dealer, identified as Akash. There, too, she was allegedly raped by five men. As her condition deteriorated, the five dumped her near the Badarpur border and fled. It took the woman nine days to recover from the trauma. On May 12, she approached Hassanpur police station and lodged a complaint of gang rape against Sagar and 24 others. The woman told the cops since she was unwell, she couldn’t file a police complaint all this while. A case was registered against the 25 accused under sections 365 (kidnapping), 376D (gang rape), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. Hassanpur police station SHO Rajesh said they had arrested Sagar on Friday and hoped to nab the others after questioning him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cops-hunt-for-25-suspects-for-rape-of-delhi-woman-in-palwal-forest/articleshow/82646098.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rampant use of life-saving steroids in Covid patients trigger black fungus, says experts||JAIPUR: Once considered as a life-saving drug for Covid, steroids are now becoming infamous for causing Mucormycosis among patients even after recovery. Indiscriminate use of steroids in Covid treatment has given rise to a new challenge for the health authorities, Sawai Man Singh Medical College has claimed. While deciding to set up a separate ward and an out-patient department for treatment of Mucormycosis, which is also known as ‘black fungus’, Sawai Man Singh Medical College on Saturday told all the chief medical health officers and principal medical officers across the state that Mucormycosis was emerging as a major concern due to indiscriminate use of steroids in Covid treatment. Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje also expressed concern on it. “#BlackFungus is a new disease happening in#Rajasthan. Liposomal Amphotericin B 50mg Injections & Posaconazole 300mgtablets are needed to treat this. Request Govt. to procure these at theearliest so that people don’t have to buy it for exorbitant prices on the blackmarket,” Raje tweeted. A video conference of officials of health department was held on Saturday on the issue. “Irrational use of steroids and Remdesivir elevate sugar levels in patients and reduces immunity, which give rise to mucormycosis cases. Steroids should not be given in first week of Covid infection as it is the time when virus replicate. Steroids should be given in second week of infection, which is a period of inflammation. Patients requiring oxygen support should be given steroids,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College and head of panel for Covid treatment in the state. Bhandari informed the health department officials in districts on the importance of judicious use of steroids to prevent Mucormycosis. Since cases of Mucormycosis are getting reported, Bhandari said they would set up a separate ward and OPD for such patients where doctors of different specialties such as ENT, ophthalmology,neurology surgery will check the patients and decide the line of treatment of the patients. “In some Mucormycosis patients, we haveto take tough decisions such as removal of eye or jaws or any other part of organ, which is affected due to fungus. But no treatment works until we remove the dead, necrosed tissue or involved part by conducting endoscopic debridement/orbital clearance. In severe cases, removal of cheek bone (maxillectomy), removal of eye (orbital exenteration) has to be done,” said Dr Pawan Singhal,professor (ENT), SMS Medical College. Besides, some ENT private hospitals wrote to health department to ensure availability of Liposomal Amphotericin B50mg Injections & Posaconazole, which are not easily available in the market, which is why, the treatment of the patients has become difficult and they have no other option left except conducting surgery for removal of eye, jaw or other affected organ. “The most important reason for this sudden spurt has been the poor blood sugar control further aggravated by the use of steroids during treatment for Covid. Mucormycosis is difficult to diagnose early, as patients often present with nonspecific symptoms such as nasal stuffiness in early stages and postnasal drip followed by dark blood-tinged or purulent rhinorrhea, sinus tenderness, headache, fever and malaise. As the infection involves the eyes, patients develop swelling over the eyes and face associated with numbness, blurring of vision or doubling of vision, protrusion of eyeballs, and loss of vision in the end stages,” said Siddharth Bharadwaj, a private vitreoretinal surgeon who is dealing with such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rampant-use-of-life-saving-steroids-in-covid-patients-trigger-black-fungus-says-experts/articleshow/82667827.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

---||Hyderabad||How effective is plasma therapy? Not a magic cure, say docs||Hyderabad: How effective is convalescent plasma therapy in Covid-19 management? While researchers say there is no significant difference, city doctors treating Covid-19 patients expressed mixed opinions. Some doctors said it is useful only in the first week of illness. A recent research published in ‘European Journal of Internal Medicine’ after six randomised clinical trials involving 1,226 Covid-19 patients revealed that there was no significant difference between convalescent plasma and standards of treatment in mortality among patients. It also said there was no significant difference in halting the progression of illness among patients, who were given plasma therapy. Dr Pavan Gorukanti, director of Yashoda Hospitals, said: “As the clinical trial research on plasma therapy’s effectiveness in Covid-19 treatment is still in nascent stage, it is probably useful for moderate patients, particularly early in those who are infected. Plasma therapy should be best left to the discretion of physician after considering various stages of the disease and a patient’s underlying condition and potential comorbidities.” He said it needs to be balanced by small risk of potential complications like transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and other transfusion-related reactions, particularly among the elderly who are weak. “It is definitely not a magical cure that some sections of the public seem to think. Probably at best, it would be an adjunct to the standard treatment,” he observed. Plasma therapy is being pushed aggressively in the city. The Telangana Plasma Donors’ Association itself has done 6,000 plasma donations. Association president Gudur Narayana Reddy said: “We saw success with good antibodies present in recovered patients who donated their plasma for patients for the use of convalescent plasma therapy. One of my family members (a heart patient with comorbidities) recovered with treatment along with plasma therapy,” he said. According to Dr Jagadeesh, senior physician, Medicover Hospital, the plasma of a recovered patient contains antibodies which help the patient fight against the pathogens. “This has helped many people to recover faster during the pandemic,” he added. Dr K Subba Reddy, chief intensivist of Apollo Hospitals, said convalescent plasma is useful in the first week of illness if it is moderate, requiring hospitalisation and oxygen. “ICMR-PLACID trial and other trials did not show benefit if it is given in the late stage (second week). For patients on HFNC, BIPAP, ventilators and very sick patients with multiple organ failures, plasma won’t help,” he explained. He further said, “In the first wave, a lot of people used it thinking plasma was a magic bullet. But in the second wave, it is used only in a very selective group of patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/how-effective-is-plasma-therapy-not-a-magic-cure-say-docs/articleshow/82667834.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Lucknow||9 more black fungus cases at KGMU||LUCKNOW: Nine more cases of black fungus infection — mucormycosis — were reported at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) on Saturday taking the tally to 17 since March. Among the nine cases, three patients have been referred from other hospitals after being diagnosed with the black fungus infection, while five developed the complication at their homes. One patient developed symptoms during treatment at the IDH ward of KGMU. With the nine new cases, the number of mucormycosis patients undergoing treatment at KGMU right now has gone up to 13. Of these, seven also have Covid-19, while others had recovered from the novel coronavirus infection and are admitted in the post-Covid ward, including one in intensive care unit, for black fungus treatment. KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said that barring the patient in ICU, all others are stable. A senior faculty member told TOI that the patient in ICU has undergone a surgery in which ENT experts removed all the dead tissue. Mucormycosis, a rare infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes, affects the sinuses, brain, and lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetics or severely immunocompromised individuals. In Covid-19 patients, it generally occurs due to weakened immunity after prolonged use of steroids, said doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nine-more-black-fungus-cases-at-kgmu/articleshow/82669810.cms||---

In Jodhpur, a woman diagnosed with the deadly fungal infection had her eye extracted early this week and 4-5 more such cases are under observation at MDM Hospital. Senior professor of ENT at SN Medical College, Bharti Solanki told TOI that mucormycosis has come up as a new threat to the doctors. “We have 3-4 suspected cases under observation and a detailed report of these patients is awaited,” said Solanki. She said they are gearing up to deal with the threat and have been working on drafting a treatment protocol for this. A meeting was held regarding devising strategy to deal with the threat of mucormycosis at MDM Hospital on Saturday. “We held a meeting and have constituted a task force comprising a microbiologist, ophthalmologist, general physician, neuro-physician and otolaryngologist (ENT). This task force will come up with a protocol for the treatment of mucormycosis and undertake required preparations at the hospital,” said Mahendra Aseri, superintendent, MDM Hospital. Confirming the steady reports of the fungal infection in Jodhpur and surrounding districts, joint director (medical & health-Jodhpur Zone) Jogehswar Prasad said that complaints of symptoms were being reported from the past few days. “We are observing the situation, but confirmation of their suffering from mucormycosis would only be determined after a clinical report,” he said. Alok Gupta, HoD, medicine, SN Medical College, said that indiscriminate use of oxygen and steroids has led to steady reporting of the cases of mucormycosis in post-Covid patients this time. “Many patients stressed on oxygen and steroids this time, mostly at home and thus, without knowing about proper precautions in use of humidifier (liquid) with oxygen and instead of using saline or distilled water, they mostly used normal water, without proper sterilization of the bottle. This produced fungus in the bottle, which entered through an oxygen pipe into the patients’ body,” he said. He said that other factors making the patients’ vulnerable are weak immunity post recovery and high blood sugar levels and added that only early diagnosis is the cure of the fungus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/black-fungus-spreads-its-tentacles-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82667819.cms||---
---||Delhi||ABVP plans drive to help slum residents||New Delhi: Delhi state unit of ABVP has announced “the biggest screening drive” as part of Covid relief to be initiated from Sunday, in the city’s slum areas. During the drive, called ‘Mission Aarogya — Sarve Santu Niramayah’, student members of ABVP will go door-to-door in around 100 Delhi slums to screen people for Covid-19 symptoms using temperature guns and oximeters and encourage them to register for vaccine. According to ABVP, the drive aims to prevent the spread of coronavirus in various slum areas of Delhi. “It has been observed that by early detection of Covid-19 and taking immediate precautions, the need for hospitalisation reduces. Due to lack of awareness, despite having Covid symptoms many people are not taking it seriously. Thus, initiating this drive becomes all the more important,” the outfit said. It said that after the volunteers screen people, they will encourage those with symptoms to get themselves tested. “Suspected Covid patients will be urged to isolate themselves to avoid further spread of the virus to their family members,” the outfit said. Sidharth Yadav, state secretary ABVP Delhi, said that “all the karyakartas will put on PPE kit and maintain appropriate physical distance during the screening process. A corona kit consisting of sanitisers, masks, multivitamins and PCM has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by medical experts for treatment of mild-Covid patients. The kit will be provided to those suspected or found infected, to aid them during home isolation.” Yadav said that ABVP plans to visit every household in around 100 slums of Delhi where the functionaries will be divided into 25 teams, each comprising five members. The activists will also conduct a sanitisation and vaccine awareness campaign. “ABVP has selected 130 volunteers for this campaign and it also appeals to the students to join them in their collaborative efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19,” said Yadav. He said that ABVP is starting this campaign to break the chain of the virus and curb its spread substantially. “Our karyakartas know the risk involved but are still keen to discharge their responsibility towards the society. We have served around 4,000 people in this second wave of Covid in Delhi and shall continue to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/abvp-plans-drive-to-help-slum-residents/articleshow/82667832.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa Government to use tech to check on home isolated||PANAJI: With most Covid patients opting for home isolation, the state government is making efforts to put Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) in place so that it would be easier for authorities to keep a check on various parameters like oxygen levels and body temperature, among others. A senior health official said that the system has been implemented in many states and will be implemented in Goa too. The official said that through the system, automated calls will be made to the Covid patients in home isolation and they will be asked to share details on various health parameters. The officer said that the system will help the state government compile the data of Covid patients and if there is any anomaly, immediate attention will be given to the patients so that there is no delay in further treatment. A senior officer said that this will also help in classifying the areas based on the inputs from patients. “Once this system starts, it will be helpful even in reducing hospitalisations and also deaths due to delay in treatment,” the official said. The state government has recently set up call centres in each taluka to monitor the health status of Covid-19 patients who are under home isolation. For Pernem, the centre has been set up at the Government College of Arts and Commerce; for Tiswadi, at the office of the directorate of art and culture, Panaji; for Sattari, at the Industrial Training Institute; and for Bicholim, at the Shantadurga Higher Secondary School. A senior government official said that each call centre has around 30 personnel trained by doctors of the district health services and deputed to source updates from patients under home isolation. A representative will call each patient and record information on basic parameters, SPO2 level and the symptoms the patient may be having. The format for the same has already been provided by the DHS. Later, data obtained from the patients will be uploaded on a portal developed by DHS. This data analysis will be carried out in order to ascertain the severity of the symptoms and classify patients into the category of red zone. Based on inputs received from DHS, patients will either be told to get themselves admitted into a Covid hospital or act as per the advice of DHS doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-use-tech-to-check-on-home-isolated/articleshow/82671536.cms||---
---||Delhi||Bhima Koregaon: Relatives call for release of accused||New Delhi: In a Zoom meeting on Saturday, kin and friends of the Bhima Koregaon prisoners demanded that they be released soon because Covid had put their lives in prison in jeopardy. Speaking on behalf of Delhi University associate professor Hany Babu, currently in Taloja jail, Navi Mumbai, Jenny Rowena, his wife, said he had not received proper treatment for his eye infection. “He cannot see with one eye. It took so many calls from the lawyers to get the jail superintendent to even take him for a check-up. We had to go to the press for the jail authorities to send him to JJ Hospital. My husband can barely see the medicines he has to take and there is only soiled water available,” said Rowena. She alleged that when tested in the jail, the inmates are testing negative. Outside, they test positive. Father Joe Xavier spoke for his friend Father Stan Swamy, also in Taloja jail. “Stan has an enormous ability to tolerate pain without complaining,” he said. “In the last six months, he did not complain at all till a few days ago when he told me he had cough and fever. There is only one ayurvedic doctor treating the prisoners.” He added, “My sense is that Stan is reaching a breakpoint. I appeal to the state to release him and allow us to take care of him,” said Xavier. Sudha, friend of incarcerated lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, pointed out that the latter had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and yet had been living in unhygienic conditions for three years. “Her family has no information on her treatment. This is wilful neglect by the authorities,” claimed Sudha. Taloja prison superintendent Kaustubh Kurlekar denied the allegations being made on Saturday and said, “Father Stan Swamy does not have Covid symptoms. Also, there is abundant clean water supply for inmates and jail staff.” Kurlekar added, “At present, only 10 undertrials are Covid asymptomatic, none of them from the Elgar Parishad case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bhima-koregaon-relatives-call-for-release-of-accused/articleshow/82667835.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Diabetes ups patients’ black fungus risk’||LUCKNOW: Uncontrolled diabetes is the commonest risk factor for acquiring black fungus infection or mucormycosis which is surfacing in Covid-19 patients in UP and many other states during and after recovery and is leading to further complications, said experts at a virtual educational programme for faculty members across 52 medical colleges on Saturday. The online event, hosted by Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, aimed to prepare the work force to prevent patients from falling prey to the infection while informing them about the relevant treatment protocols. SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman said, “Mucormycosis is an uncommon, opportunistic invasive fungal infection which occurs in immunosuppressed patients. Uncontrolled diabetes is the most common risk factor for acquiring this infection. These fungal spores are present in the air, soil and on decomposed debris and gain entry into sinuses and lungs by breathing contaminated air. Covid-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes, undergoing treatment with steroids are at heightened risk of the infection.” The infection can be successfully managed and treated with a multi-disciplinary approach and the role of microbiologist, ENT specialist, ophthalmologist and diabetologist is crucial to achieve successful outcomes, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/diabetes-ups-patients-black-fungus-risk/articleshow/82669843.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Hosps ramp up hygiene measures, keep close watch to prevent mucormycosis||Nagpur: Hospitals witnessing rise in cases of mucormycosis caused by black fungus among Covid recovered patients are adopting a slew of precautionary measures, clinically and hygienically, to tackle the disease. The hospitals, despite many of them having own team, are planning to rope in experts to meet the rush expected in the coming days. Going by the theory of ‘hospital acquired’ infection of mucormycosis among Covid patients by ‘opportunistic fungal spores’, the hospital managements and the clinicians are using ‘dry oxygen’ and air purifiers, keeping close watch on sugar levels and using steroids ‘judiciously’ . Dr Anup Marar, one of the directors of Orange City Hospital Research Institute, said their administration is using methylene blue for oxygen humidifiers bottles and isotonic saline nasal washes twice daily for all admitted Covid patients. “Our clinical team is keeping strict vigil on the blood sugar level along with austere use of steroids,” he said. Dr Jay Deshmukh of Sunflower Hospital said all patients and staffs have been strictly advised to wear double masks. “We are ensuring the patients perform Betadine gurgles. Close watch is being kept on whether the blood sugar level is within prescribed limit and diabetic patients are put on insulin,” he said. “The patients are getting infections at home and not hospitals,” said Dr Deshmukh and added, “Besides our own team, we also have additional experts on panel who can provide their service on calls.” According to Niranjan Joshi, spokesperson, Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, ‘dry oxygen’ is being used because water is one of the reasons behind mucormycosis. “We have centralized unit from where oxygen is supplied to the patients. There is a stringent protocol in place to ensure ‘proper air exchange’ at the premises to ensure the right balance of humidity is maintained. We have proper and timely monitoring and maintenance of air handling unit (AHU) to maintain right air exchange,” said Joshi. “We only use disposal tubing for nasal oxygen supply and environmental rounds are undertaken twice a month to maintain high standard of hygiene,” he said. He also said clinicians are following strict sugar control and appropriate use of steroids. “We also keep a high degree of suspicion while treating for early detection of mucormycosis by our infection disease specialist,” said Joshi. Dr Vaibhav Agrawal, consultant internal medicine and core member of the Covid care team of Wockhardt hospital, said the bio-medical team of their institution ensures high standard of air quality and used distilled water humidifiers. “Clinically, we ensure the blood ferritin level and sugar are kept under close surveillance as both of these are conducive for the growth of the mucormycosis,” said Dr Agrawal. “If we use immunosuppressant drugs like Tocilizumab, then we ensure the antifungal medicines are given as prophylactic,” he said. Dr Avinash Gawande, medical superintendent of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), said the in-charge of oxygen ensures the ports are cleaned frequently and after use. “GMCH already has a distilled water plant from where the humidifiers or the oxygen flowmeters are filled,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hosps-ramp-up-hygiene-measures-keep-close-watch-to-prevent-mucormycosis/articleshow/82667843.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chandigarh||Centre sanctions 20 ventilators for city||Chandigarh: The central government on Saturday sanctioned 20 ventilators to the city, with UT adviser Manoj Parida saying the move will help “tremendously in treating critical patients and save lives”. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had asked the Centre to examine providing more ventilators to Government Multi-specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. During the resumed hearing of the case related to Covid management in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, amicus curie Rupinder Khosla had emphasised the need for more ventilators in GMSH. He had submitted that only six ventilators were functional at the moment and GMSH was facing difficulty in view of large number of patients pouring in for medical help. After Khosla’s submission, the high court in its order had said, “The government of India may examine the possibility of providing more ventilators to GMSH-16, as the same is centrally located and patients normally approach the hospital in the first instance. As regards the need for supporting staff, the issue may be examined by the secretary, health. If it is found that more staff is required in this emergency situation, he is at liberty to recruit the same on contract basis, in case a provision to this effect exists in the rules”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-sanctions-20-ventilators-for-city/articleshow/82662883.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Lucknow||Grads get life lessons from mentors’ professional lives||Lucknow: In view of the current situation, Indian Institute of Management- Lucknow on Saturday held its convocation online for the first time since its inception. The ceremony in 2020 had been cancelled. At IIML’s 35th convocation, 646 graduating studentsreceived their degrees. Addressing the students, chairman of Boston Consulting Group Janmajeya Sinha shared six life lessons which he had learnt from his mentors during his professional stints at various organisations. The first, he said, was from former executive director of Reserve Bank of India Satynand Bagai—to pay a genuine compliment to someone, which Sinha said, is a difficult task. “One needs to observe the person closely and find something praiseworthy. One must compliment directly, not once but persistently. This simple act will lead to a permanent space in the heart of the receiver,” Sinha said. The second lesson was the importance of being accountable and backing the team while the third was about being true to oneself. “Be thoughtful when you seek favours from the wrong people. They can come back to haunt you,” Sinha said. On leadership, he said, “Acknowledge your mistake. Tell the other person that they did the right thing.” He then spoke of owning a problem and showing care and affection. “Always remember, to whom much is given, from them much is expected,” Sinha said, adding as the last lesson that students need to choose how they associate with their institute. “Either you say that you are from IIML or become a part of the second category where the institute will say that you are from IIML,” he said. Director Prof Archana Shukla highlighted the accomplishments of students, alumni and faculty in the academic year 2020-2021. The year, said Shukla, helped the institute achieve a massive digital transformation. IIML has also established a centre for public policy, which aims at advisory, training, stakeholder dialogues and research, she said. Chairman of the board of governors N Chandrasekaran said, “Not everything is dark and bleak...A much needed digital push arrived. Sustainability is now at the core. Importance of public safety has been recognised and together, these will create new job opportunities and avenues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/grads-get-life-lessons-from-mentors-professional-lives/articleshow/82669898.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Tamil Nadu police recently busted a network, including doctors and paramedical staff, involved in selling remdesivir injections in open market at exorbitant rates. On Thursday, the Chennai police arrested six people for smuggling 205 vials of remdesivir from Bangladesh to India. Calling such people “anti-social elements,” the chief minister said the government had got information that oxygen cylinders, remdesivir and other medicines to treat Covid-19 were being sold at unusually high rates in black market. “Persons involved in such activities will be detained under Goondas Act,” Stalin said in a statement. “While the government was making every effort to save lives, there were certain forces working against people’s interest,” he said. Stalin said his government had been working relentlessly to import vaccines, distribute remdesivir, operate medical oxygen manufacturing units of the state and address grievance calls of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/goondas-case-for-black-marketing-of-covid-medicines-o2-in-tn-cm/articleshow/82667844.cms||---

An OPD and special ward will be set up for such patients at Chandrapur GMCH. So far, the district has reported 34 patients of the deadly fungal infection. All cases are from private hospitals and 21 of them have been operated.“All patients developed the disease post Covid treatment. Diabetic patients who have recovered from Covid are more prone to getting the fungal infection. Out of 34 cases in district, 32 patients are diabetic,” said civil surgeon and Covid incident commander, Dr Nivrutti Rathod. Rathod claimed that a district level task force has been formed to track and take remedial measures towards rising cases of mucormycosis. A separate OPD and 20 bed special ward is being established for mucormycosis patients at GMCH and ENT department. “However, there is acute shortage of injection needed for treatment of such patients. They need these injections for 15 to 21 days and treatment goes on for six weeks. Express orders for supply of the injection is being placed to deal with the situation,” said Dr Rathod. Guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Saturday took stock of the situation. He directed the officials to immediately place proposals for procurement of remdesivir and injection needed for treatment of mucormycosis, besides other medicines. Wadettiwar also called upon the higher-ups in FDA on phone to ensure speedy supply of necessary medicines. He directed the health officials to take measure to ensure that sugar level of patients should not rise after recovering from Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/34-cases-of-mucormycosis-reported-in-chanda/articleshow/82667846.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Hyderabad||Blood thinner demand rises thick and fast||HYDERABAD: With an increasing number of vulnerable population between the age group of 30 and 50 contracting Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, prescription for long term use of anticoagulants (blood thinners) has increased. Also, the newer strains of Covid-19 currently circulating are believed to result in an upswing of blood clot related problems in patients. Four out of every ten patients are likely to develop clots now, say doctors, and unless preventive measures are taken, they may land in an emergency situation. As a result, anticoagulants during and after Covid-19 treatment are being increasingly prescribed by doctors. “While we have been using blood thinners since the first wave, unlike the first wave when more patients above 60 years of age were seen, this time the 30-50 years old age category is more affected. Many of these patients are already on blood thinners, while some with high risk factors once put on anticoagulants might need to continue it for long term,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, superintendent, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS). “Blood thinners are an important part of the treatment protocol but whether it is used long term or not depends on the risk factors of the individual,” added Dr Khan. The need for usage of blood thinners, meanwhile, stems from the fact that the Covid-19 virus causes formation of blood clots. The reason for blood clotting in Covid-19 is totally different from the general case as the virus itself causes it. With more clots being formed especially in the blood vessels of the lungs, it leads to pulmonary embolism (blockage of one of the pulmonary arteries) and strokes. “The reason that many Covid deaths were occurring during the first wave were found to be due the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels of the lungs. With several studies in Europe having proved this, anticoagulants were included in the treatment to prevent the clots,” added Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary for Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rise-in-anticoagulant-prescriptions-as-covid-patients-develop-blood-clots/articleshow/82667850.cms||Amrita Didyala

In the purported video, constable Jitendra Kumar Chauhan, a resident of Shamli district, who was deployed with dial 112 PRV in Pilibhit, could be seen continuously crying and accusing ill-treatment by the police department responsible for the extreme step he was taking. The constable, who was driving a car, later shot himself dead near Ghazipur Mughal village in Barkhera area about at 3.30 pm, said police. Chauhan is survived by his wife Sarita, also a constable posted at Bisalpur police station in Pilibhit district, and a two-year-old son. Pilibhit superintendent of police Kirit Kumar Rathod in a statement released by his office, however, denied the harassment charge. The constable had, possibly, taken the extreme step due to matrimonial discord, stated the SP. According to police sources, Jitendra was on his way home on leave when he committed suicide. The SP said, “Jitendra had taken leaves earlier this month, yet his leave was approved. He was just told that he could postpone his leave as nearly 20% of the staff was already on leave. He had certain disputes with his wife that senior officers attempted to resolve. We don’t find any other reason. Besides, Jitendra had never made an official complaint against anyone in the department. We are, however, investigating the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-cop-accuses-dept-of-ill-treatment-posts-video-on-fb-before-shooting-himself-dead-in-pilibhit/articleshow/82664684.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kolkata||On their own again, households stare at a tough time||Kolkata: Most of the households spent the whole of Saturday making arrangements to tide over the initial few days of the restrictions. Lack of maids, cooks, caregivers for the elderly at home was the most talked-about points. There are many seniors who have now hired help to do their routine shopping of milk, bread, poultry, fruits and vegetables, because they have stopped going out. Many of them were contacted so that they could stock up afresh. Alo Paul, the 68-year-old wife of a retired BSF officer living in Kasba, is once again preparing to take on all the household chores like cooking, washing dishes and clothes and cleaning the house. Her maid and cook, would manage to come by auto after train services were suspended. “But now even that will not be possible. I am really tense for my wife,” said her husband Suhrid Chandra Paul. Ashoke Mukherjee and his wife, who live in Salt Lake, have decided to live on boiled eggs, rice and potatoes for the time being as their maid, cook and driver have all excused themselves. “I will have to depend on our young brigade of our complex to get the essentials,” Mukherjee said. Some people with children at home have heavily stocked up on ready-to-eat food. Ritesh Sarkar, who lives on Amherst Street, has bought 5kgs of bacon and salami. “I am lucky with fresh fruits and vegetables because I live close to Koley Market,” he said. Even business Akash Bhatia seemed happy that he lives near Garia hat where getting essential items won’t be a problem. Many housing complexes have made arrangements with chains like Sufal and Haringhata to come at a specific time so that residents can pre-order and get their supplies delivered at the doorstep  Most complexes were, however, prepared to face the curbs ever since the partial restrictions was announced early May. Take the case of South City where arrangements have been made for more than 100 employees to stay on campus, said Manoj Gupta, president. At Siddha Pines, groceries and day-to-day requirements have been bought for all employees who are staying back 24 hours on campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-their-own-again-households-stare-at-a-tough-time/articleshow/82666158.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man acquitted of murder after 5 years in jail; ‘cop created proof’||MUMBAI: Observing that the investigating officer “created evidence”, a sessions court recently acquitted a 29-year-old driver who has spent five and a half years in jail for allegedly murdering a man who stalked his wife and who had even attempted to rape her. The court refuted the cop’s claims that after the murder, the accused, Shriniwas Lakka, walked into the police station in bloodied clothes, handed over a sickle and confessed to the brutal murder. The court relied on CCTV footage recovered from the Chunnabhatti police station to find the details and timings mentioned in the arrest and recovery of the weapon memos contradicted the visuals from the footage. A panch witness who was present when the accused was arrested denied seeing the weapon in his hand, contradicting claims made in the arrest memo. The victim, Manoj Sarkanya, was left with 26 wounds that led to his death. The court also found while the cops had stated the clothes of the accused were seized and sealed at 8.20pm, the CCTV footage showed the accused in the same clothes even at 10pm. The court said with the victim’s blood being available with the cops before 10.20pm, the time the spot examination was completed, the possibility of smearing it on the clothes could not be ruled out. “More so, when the CCTV footage shows that the police has created false and fabricated documents,” the court said. It was the prosecution’s case that the victim and the accused were neighbours. It was alleged that for around six to seven months in 2015, the victim had been stalking Lakka’s wife. It was further alleged despite Lakka’s demands to stop the harassment, the victim continued with his behaviour. The prosecution said on December 22, 2015, when the accused found the victim alone, he attacked him. Among the witnesses were the victim’s mother who claimed before the court she was an eyewitness. The court, though, did not find the woman’s testimony to be trustworthy after she revealed in her cross-examination she had not informed the cops about the role of the accused when she first met them at the hospital where her injured son was taken. The woman made the claims only 24 hours later. Her other son too told the court his mother had never informed him it was the accused who had attacked him when she called him. The court said the prosecution’s failure to examine the victim’s wife who was also cited as an eyewitness and could have corroborated the mother’s claims, was fatal to its case. The wife of the accused deposed as a defence witness and said on the day of the incident, the victim tried to sexually assault her at her home and also flashed her. She said after she raised an alarm, people gathered. When the accused tried to flee, a mob chased him armed with a knife, a sickle, a chopper and brooms. The woman said when her husband returned home, she told him about the incident, prompting him to go to the police station to lodge an FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-acquitted-of-murder-after-5-yrs-in-jail-cop-created-proof/articleshow/82664732.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Lucknow||Bombay HC lauds Uttar Pradesh model of Covid control||LUCKNOW: The government on Saturday said that its model of Covid control has come in for praise from the Bombay high court. Referring to directions issued by the court on Saturday, a UP government spokesperson said that the court “looked convinced by the model adopted by the state government to save people and children from corona infection in Uttar Pradesh”. The model refers to a decision by chief minister Yogi Adityanath to increase the number of paediatric ICU beds in UP after experts have suggested that children may be at a greater risk in the third wave of the pandemic expected later this year. A statement issued by the government stated: “The Bench of Bombay High Court comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta and Justice Girish Kulkarni had taken cognizance of the news reports about this model of UP regarding the treatment of children. It asked the Maharashtra government to consider doing so there.” A spokesperson added that the CM gave instructions to arrange for 50-100 paediatric beds in all major cities of UP. These beds will be especially for children above the age of one month. The beds will be small in size and have railing on the sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bombay-hc-lauds-up-model-of-covid-control/articleshow/82669963.cms||---

Pharmacy shops in Ramdaspeth, Dhantoli and Sitabuldi are feeling the pinch as patients from neighbouring states have ‘stopped coming’. Himanshu Pande, promoter of Universal Medical and Surgical Shop, said, “After lockdown, patients from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are simply not coming here. Go and look at the non-Covid OPDs in Dhantoli where doctors are sitting idle. There’s literally no footfall and a majority of us are now operating at one-third of the non-Covid revenue.” Pande, who is also an executive member of Nagpur Druggists and Chemists’ Association, added, “We are keeping our shops open because we come under the essentials category. The situation is very grim financially as the actual sales are not happening.” Vinod Balani, promoter of Jai Baba Medical Store, said a majority of people come only for enquiries. “All the important Covid medicines are now government regulated but still people flock to enquire. Our non-Covid medicine sale has literally collapsed because of the absence of patients from other states. Even locally, patients are not visiting doctors due to fear of the infection. So, the regular flow at medical shops has also stopped,” said Balani. At Gandhibagh, the hub of stockists, the scene is not so different. Here, pharmacies located right opposite the biggest child hospital and government-run Daga Hospital are struggling. Murli Kewalramani, promoter of Suresh Medical, said, “We are operating at 40% of previous year’s revenue base for non-Covid medicines. The seasonal rush, caused by infections due to the change in weather, is not visible this year. This time of the year there would a huge demand for medicines related to cough and cold, diarrhea etc.” Kewalramani, who has been operating the shop since 1973, added, “The entire antibiotics revenue stream has collapsed for all of us.” Standalone shops which are not near any major hospital say they are sustaining at the ‘bare minimum’ level. Ajay Srivas, promoter of Ajay Medical Shop, said, “Half of my business is mostly dependent on regular clients who are on perpetual prescriptions for BP, thyroid, diabetes etc. The sale of vitamin tablets had increased in March and April, but even that has dropped sharply since the last one week.” Another medical shop owner, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Due to the restrcitions, neither children nor many adults have stepped out of their homes in March and April. This has led to a lower rate of seasonal flu infections and hence, negligible demand for medicines. This, combined with the vanishing MP and CG patients, has brought about a tough time for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sale-of-non-covid-19-medicine-plummets/articleshow/82667873.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Daily Covid-19 cases dip by 14% in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: Daily Covid-19 cases have started declining by 14% since May 9, prompting many to speculate if the city has crossed the peak that had been projected to be reached on May 15 according to various mathematical models. PGI director Prof Jagat Ram too had recently said that by mid of May, the city might see a peak and then a steady decline. However, public health experts are in no rush to call it as the flattening of the curve. “It is too early to say that the peak has arrived. We are seeing a decline and attribute it to the lockdown across the Tricity. There has to be lot of restriction to reduce the numbers from the daily 800 figures to at least 400 a day. Then we can say that the curve is flattening,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. On Saturday, the city reported 660 new cases, including eight deaths, taking the positivity rate to was 19%. Despite the decline, Chandigarh’s positivity rate from May 8 to 14 remained 25.7%, the ninth highest in the country. Ten states have a high positivity rate of above 25%. These are Puducherry, Goa, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Andhra Pradesh. Testing has declined from 3,120 to 2,948 tests per million per day in the city. “It has been a week now that the daily cases are reducing slightly. We need to wait and watch. The number of deaths have been almost steady. So, we need to be alert,” said a public health expert. He said, “Until the cases decrease in the adjoining states of Haryana and Punjab, one can then feel relaxed with the reduction in the cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/peak-over-daily-cases-dip-by-14/articleshow/82666239.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Patna||Patna: Pappu Yadav alleges conspiracy, writes to DMCH superintendent||PATNA: The Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) authorities on Saturday stopped the preparations to send former MP and JAP(L) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav to Patna after he wrote a letter to the hospital superintendent to provide him medial treatment there instead of conspiring with the government to kill him. In the letter, he urged the DMCH superintendent to refer him to Delhi if his treatment for kidney stone was not possible there. Pappu alleged that some senior government officials were conspiring against him. He urged the superintendent to work as per the medical board’s direction and not on any minister or district magistrate’s advice. Sources said the government authorities had made all preparations for Pappu’s transportation to Patna. Pappu was arrested on May 11 on the court order for continuously not appearing in the trial of a 32-year-old kidnapping case lodged against him with Murliganj police station in Madhepura district. DMCH superintendent Dr Mani Bhushan Sharma said Pappu was to be taken to IGIC in Patna, but it was cancelled as he suffered from slipped disk Friday night. “He had acute pain and was given medicines. In such a situation, problems will aggravate if he is made to travel,” he said. Sharma also said he was not working under any pressure. He also said given his health condition, Pappu could not be kept in a jail. “He has obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, kidney stone, heart ailment, varicose veins and several other problems. He was sent for an MRI at a private hospital on Saturday, but could not be accommodated inside the machine due to body mass,” Sharma said, adding he could refer Pappu only to a higher government medical institution in Bihar and not outside it. Meanwhile, JAP(L) state president Raghvendra Singh Kushwaha said their leader apprehends threat to his life. “There are lack of facilities at DMCH. Pappu wanted to be shifted to Patna or Delhi. However, we came to know that authorities were suddenly planning to take him back to Birpur jail on Saturday, after which he wrote the letter,” he said. JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said if Pappu has any complaint, he must approach the court as he is in judicial custody. “He is being treated at a government hospital on the court order. His priority should be to get himself treated and stay away from politics at present,” he added. JD(U) spokesperson Suheli Mehta also said his matter is completely legal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pappu-alleges-conspiracy-writes-to-dmch-superintendent/articleshow/82666259.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Deserving candidates are forced to wait for long as the decision will be taken about them only after the curfew ends. Anamika Gurud after losing her husband Nitin Gurud in December 2020 has been waiting for the jobs on compassionate grounds since then. “I am told that my issue was put in the executive council. However, the corona curfew played a spoilsport as the meeting could not be organized after that,” said Anamika. “I am waiting for the day the curfew ends so the witness process would start again,” she said. As the situation about her is yet to be cleared, Anamika has launched a YouTube channel on cooking recipes hping to earn some bucks. “It is a small effort. The channel has been liked by several people. If it goes like this soon, I may start some earnings,” said Anamika. Same was the situation with Saima. She had lost her husband Khalil earlier this year. “I think the process has been started but the corona curfew has turned out to be a big obstacle. I am hoping that the process will resume soon,” said Saima. The EC had taken up the issue in the previous two meetings. “The decision was to be taken in the following meetings but the Covid has stopped the process as of now,” said a senior official of the university without quoting his name. When contacted, BU’s registrar HS Tripathi said that 8 such cases were discussed before the curfew was imposed due to corona. “Out of them 4 has been appointed. Process was on for the rest of the cases but the curfew was imposed that has stalled the process. Once the situation clears we would be able to make decisions about other cases also,” said Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/candidates-suffer-as-bu-halts-jobs-under-compassionate-ground/articleshow/82667901.cms||Ramendra Singh

Mercury is expected to be on the rise till then, along with a few spells of pre-monsoon thundershowers. Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at the Patna Meteorological Centre, told TOI on Saturday that monsoon is likely to make normal entry in Bihar this year. “The normal date of onset of southwest of monsoon in Kerala is June 1. Accordingly, the monsoon onset in Bihar is also expected around its normal time of June 15-18,” he said. He also said cyclone Tauktae in the Arabian Sea is also supporting the advancement of southwest monsoon in the region. “Any deviation from expected monsoon onset in Bihar may depend upon movement of the monsoon current in the Bay of Bengal. Monsoon enters Bihar and northern plains after forming a curve in the Bay of Bengal,” Sanjay said, adding that overall monsoon rainfall is likely to be slightly less in Bihar as compared to rest of the country. As per the meteorological observation over the last few decades, southwest monsoon normally enters Bihar through the northeastern districts of Purnia and Kishanganj around June 10-12 and takes another two to four days to cover the entire state. Monsoon has been making delayed onset in the state in most years at least over the past two decades. Last year, IMD announced the onset of monsoon in Bihar on June 13, the earliest entry of the rain-bearing clouds into the state this decade (2010-2020). Also, IMD in 2020 revised the normal onset and withdrawal dates for southwest monsoon in Bihar and most parts of the country this year. The revised onset date for two representative stations at Patna and Gaya is June 16 against the earlier date of June 12, while for Chhapra it is June 18 against the earlier date of June 13. Meanwhile, mercury is expected to rise steadily till the onset of monsoon in the state. The maximum temperature surged up to 40 degrees C on Saturday. Patna meteorological centre has predicted the maximum temperature to remain in the 36-39 degrees C range at most places in the state over the next five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-likely-to-enter-state-around-june-15-18-met-office/articleshow/82666328.cms||Piyush Tripathi

According to health officials, there are 146 beds at Jind civil hospital, but 160 are being treated there at any given point of time. TOI visited Jind civil hospital on Saturday and around 10 patients, including women, were being treated outside the emergency ward. They all were on oxygen support. “I brought my 55-year-old uncle from Kandela village as his oxygen level dropped to 55, but we didn’t get a bed. We were left with no option but to bring a bed. I made a request to doctors to start his treatment on wheelchair and the team started his treatment promptly on seeing his deteriorating condition. Meanwhile, I arranged a charpaai from our village, which was around 10km from the civil hospital. With oxygen support, my uncle’s oxygen level reached 86, hopefully he will be better soon. Doctors are dedicated but there are no beds and facilities in government-run hospitals. There are lots of differences between claims and ground-level situations,” Pardeep Kumar, an attendant of patient told TOI. Senior medical officer doctor Gopal Goyal, said, “This is the only multi-speciality government run hospital here.

ESI Hospital and CMCH have 100-litre and 200-litre plants. We are advising private hospitals to use oxygen judiciously and reduce consumption, learning from government hospitals,” he said. ESI Hospital found that oxygen saturation increases from 91 to 95 when Covid patients are in the prone position, thus reducing the need to give them more oxygen, the minister said. He met representatives of private hospitals and visited Kovai Medical Center and Hospital (KMCH), in between inspecting ESI and CMCH to understand oxygen requirements. War rooms to combat Covid-19, similar to the one in Chennai, will be set up in Coimbatore, Salem and Trichy, the minister said. “The war rooms will have minute-to-minute updates on beds available in hospitals, so that infected people and their relatives just need to phone to find a bed or help. This will reduce the stress of finding beds.” The state government has received five lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin to vaccinate people between 18 and 45 years, Subramaniam said. “We have begun mass vaccination in Chennai. We hope to receive 10 lakh doses soon, and will distribute to districts including Coimbatore. Tamil Nadu has paid Rs 46 crore advance for 15 lakh doses,” he said.

Devala town and Kinnakorai in Kundha taluk recorded the highest rainfall at 137mm and 100mm, respectively, for the 24 hours that ended at 7am on Saturday. Cherangode recorded 72mm rainfall during the period followed by Pandalur (56mm), Kundha (39mm), Ooty (34mm) and Coonoor (31mm). District collector J Innocent Divya said officials were monitoring Kundha and Devala areas. Officials are monitoring those areas. “As a precautionary measure, 57 residents of Devala and Cherangode have been shifted to two relief camps, as their houses were located on low-lying areas.” She said disaster management plans were in place in the district. “If the heavy rain continues, people living in low-lying areas will be shifted to nearby relief camps, which are ready for use.” Most of the uprooted trees were small and they were removed from the roads immediately. “There is no damage to houses in rain-related calamities in the district so far,” Divya said. A National Disaster Response Force team, meanwhile, landed in Ooty on Saturday to render their service in relief works. The team comprises 25 personnel headed by inspector Ganesh Prasad. They would assess the areas in the district and camp in vulnerable locations. The district has set up a control room with toll-free number 1077, which is functioning round the clock, to help the rain-affected people.

ESI Hospital and CMCH have 100-litre and 200-litre plants. We are advising private hospitals to use oxygen judiciously and reduce consumption, learning from government hospitals,” he said. ESI Hospital found that oxygen saturation increases from 91 to 95 when Covid patients are in the prone position, thus reducing the need to give them more oxygen, the minister said. He met representatives of private hospitals and visited Kovai Medical Center and Hospital (KMCH), in between inspecting ESI and CMCH to understand oxygen requirements. War rooms to combat Covid-19, similar to the one in Chennai, will be set up in Coimbatore, Salem and Trichy, the minister said. “The war rooms will have minute-to-minute updates on beds available in hospitals, so that infected people and their relatives just need to phone to find a bed or help. This will reduce the stress of finding beds.” The state government has received five lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin to vaccinate people between 18 and 45 years, Subramaniam said. “We have begun mass vaccination in Chennai. We hope to receive 10 lakh doses soon, and will distribute to districts including Coimbatore. Tamil Nadu has paid Rs 46 crore advance for 15 lakh doses,” he said. Hundred beds should be set up at Codissia Trade Fair Complex for patients to undergo Ayush treatment and 700 beds for Covid-19 patients, the minister suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-oxygen-shortage-in-coimbatore-minister/articleshow/82667936.cms||Pratiksha Ramkumar

This curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) was ringed by researchers of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) at the Point Calimere bird sanctuary in Vedaranyam in 2018. It was spotted this April-end at the Kovalam creek on the city’s outskirts by K V R K Thirunaranan who sent a photograph to the BNHS. “The BNHS authorities confirmed to me that the bird was ringed in 2018 by their deputy director S Balachandran, who is based at Vedaranyam,.” Thirunaranan said. The bird was on its way back home after wintering in Vedaranyam when it was sighted in Kovalam creek near Chennai, Balachandran said. This was its third migratory trip, he added. Curlew sandpipers, which are waders, have been categorized as near- threatened species globally as their population has declined, Balachandran said. During the 1980s, the BNHS used to ring thousands of these birds every year. At that time, the waders’ population was good. “Many of them used to be caught by narikoravas, from whom the researchers have recovered the rings,” Balachandran said. “Now, the population of waders has come down mainly due to absence of mud flats in estuarine ecosystem across the globe. Many estuaries turn bone dry during summer, which will not allow the formation of mud flats. This is one of the major causes for the decline in waders’ population, said Balachandran. Ornithologists say that of late curlew sandpipers do not return home directly by instead fly to Australia and then go home, flying several thousand kilometers more. However, the one that was sighted near Chennai could have come from Vedaranyam only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/winged-visitor-flies-6000km-for-third-year-in-a-row-to-keep-its-date-with-vedaranyam/articleshow/82667947.cms||P Oppili

Even as the summer is at peak when their business blooms, the seasonal business has failed to take off yet. As the countdown for monsoon has already started, scores of those depending on the juicy business will have to wait for yet another year for their business to rev up. Ramesh Sahu, a nimbupaanee vendor, spent major part of his life earning small sums by selling the Bhopal’s favourite summer drink. However, now his business has no fizz. “We were still counting losses incurred last year. I was pinning hopes on business revival this year when there were chants of winning over the Covid in the country. All my wishes ended with the curfew imposed in April this year,” said Sahu. Hoping for a brisk business this year, Sahu had made additional investment this year to make up for the last year’s losses. “I have been in this business for decades. I was hoping that this year I would make double profit . If things continue this way, I will have to explore newer ways of livelihood at this age,” said Sahu. The unorganised sector has no association or pressure groups to raise their demands. “This business is entirely season-based. Most of the vendors who are into this business are those who run other small businesses in other seasons. Biggest challenge for them is that they do not do other business except selling lemon water in summers. As the entire business has collapsed the situation of such vendors is also bad,” said Raju, another vendor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/another-year-same-woes-lockdown-takes-the-fizz-out-of-lemon-soda-biz/articleshow/82667935.cms||Ramendra Singh

When announced in April, it was scheduled to be completed in about 20 days. With the highest weekly positivity rate till the last week of April, Tikamgarh had recorded 47% weekly positivity rate. Even neighbouring Niwari had recorded a 27% weekly positivity rate. There were a large number of coronavirus-affected patients in the region who battled for their breath. Many died gasping for want of oxygen. A complete lockdown has gradually brought down the positivity rate in the last15 days. “This may be the reason why the officials seemed to have ignored the work for the oxygen plant,” said a resident of Tikamgarh, whose relative had reportedly passed away last month because of oxygen shortage. Two oxygen plants were proposed and one of them was to be set up at the district hospital. Some construction work has taken place but there are no machines or equipment installed. For the past few days there was no progress in the work, sources in the district administration said. Though the district collector did not respond to repeated calls and text messages, he had spoken to the local media about the issue. Subhash Kumar Dwivedi, the collector, said, “ Directives were issued for the urgency in setting up of the oxygen plant. We will not allow any delay in it.” On Saturday there were 79 new cases of coronavirus infection in Tikamgarh while the number of active cases in the district were 900.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/o2-plant-yet-to-come-up-in-tikamgarh/articleshow/82668012.cms||---

The necessary supply is expected shortly,” he said. Dean of SRT Medical College and Hospital at Ambajogai Dr Shivaji Sukre could not be reached for knowing time-line of mucormycosis-related deaths and surgeries, among other details. Meanwhile, Beed civil surgeon Suryakant Gitte said that the district civil hospital at Beed has one suspected case of mucormycosis. “One 40-year-old patient has developed possible symptoms of mucormycosis. The presence of the disease would be confirmed only after specialist doctors examine him,” he said. A section of health experts has already observed that the rising cases of mucormycosis in Covid-19 patients are prevalent largely because of the increased use of steroids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/4-deaths-due-to-mucormycosis-at-ambajogai-hosp/articleshow/82664844.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Corona wiping out rural population, government indifferent: Samajwadi Party||LUCKNOW: Attacking the BJP for ‘untrue claims’ of having controlled the spread of Covid-19 in the state, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said the government is looking the other way while the virus is wreaking havoc in the rural areas. “A sense of terror has enveloped the villages where people are dying in quick succession and there is no one to look after people suffering from symptoms similar to Covid-19 infection,” Akhilesh said while lambasting the ministers who have been made incharge of districts and asked supervise treatment and hospitalisation of the people suffering from the infection. Akhilesh said the seriousness with which the ministers are discharging their duties can be gauged from the fact that the minister incharge of Meerut recently visited the district but remained put at the Circuit House. “He remained at the Circuit House for two hours and left without bothering to visit a single hospital to find out if the people were getting the medical help that the government had promised,” he said, adding: “This only goes on to show how insensitivite the government and its ministers are towards the miseries of the people.” The former UP CM said reports suggest that the level of infection is seven times that of the cities in Gonda villages. Recently, of the 119 people who tested Covid-19 positive in Gonda, 105 were villagers. “In chief minister’s home district of Gorakhpur, the administrative officers are more focussed on fudging statistics rather than offering relief to the people,” he said. The SP chief claimed that 46,000 people in rural areas of Gorakhpur are suffering from fever, cough and other symptoms of Covid infection. “However, in order to cover-up their failure, the government has put the figures at 764,” he said. Citing instances to substantiate his claims of the situation in Kanpur villages, Akhilesh said 35 people died within a fortnight in Chaubeypur village while another 13 died within 11 days in Ghasra and 7 in Peepli villages as well. “This is not all. In Parsaha village, 24 people died in a month while another 26 people died in Kyara village of Bareilly,” he said. Citing the death toll in villages of western UP, Akhilesh said in Bulandshahr eight people died in Basi village while another 20 died within a fortnight in Nakeel village of Madanpur. In Muzaffarnagar, 12 people died in Soram village, the SP president said. It is time for the government to understand the misery and pain of the people in the villages and help them with proper medical care, he stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corona-wiping-out-rural-population-govt-indifferent-sp/articleshow/82670059.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Vice-chancellor Prof Tariq Mansoor had urged the director of ICMR on May 9 to thoroughly investigate the Covid-19 strains prevalent in an around the varsity following the death of several staff members, including 16 faculty members and 10 retired professors, to ascertain the possible factor for the high infectivity rate of Covid-19. Professor Haris Manzoor Khan, chairman, department of microbiology and principal investigator, AMU’s viral research and diagnostic laboratory, said, that 90% of the samples sent for testing had B.1.617.2 lineage referred to as ‘double mutation variant’, which was first identified in Maharashtra on October 5, 2020. He said, “Among the 20 samples sent for investigation, 18 had B.1.617.2, which is a subtype of the main virus — B.1.617 circulating in the second wave of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh.” However, other two samples — one had the B.1.1.7 lineage which is 40-80% more transmissible than the wild type SARS CoV-2 and was first detected in the UK and another had the B.1 lineage which was responsible for outbreaks in 2020 mainly in Italy that later spread to the rest of the world. WHO has termed it ‘variant of concern’ because of its higher transmissibility and reduced neutralization from preexisting antibodies. B.1.617 has a higher growth rate than other circulating variants suggesting a potentially increased rate of transmission. According to AMU administration, active campaigns have been undertaken in the university to mitigate the problem of Covid-19 infection in the form of aggressive mobilization for vaccination, emphasis on the importance of social distancing, washing of hands or sanitizing them regularly and wearing face masks and going outdoors when absolutely necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-strain-not-new-double-mutant-says-csir-in-report/articleshow/82664839.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The growth rate of a disease, in this case Covid-19, is its natural progression recorded by the day. The weekly growth rate is assessed on the basis of a seven-day average of new cases collated over the last 14 days. or better assessment of Covid-19 situation and to improve containment strategy, the weekly score is divided into four categories. A growth rate of 50% or more (denoted in red colour) indicates rapid growth in new cases. Growth rate in the range of 20-50% speaks for moderate growth (denoted by orange). Similarly, when the growth rate is in the range of 0-20%, low growth is recorded (flagged in yellow colour) and when it dips to sub-zero level, it speaks for negative growth (green). “UP’s seven-day moving average of new cases is in green zone. The criteria is a crucial indicator of pandemic activity and speaks for sustained decline in Covid-19 cases. It also suggests that UP is heading towards safe zone,” said principal secretary, medical education, Alok Kumar-II. While the data means a lot for surveillance purposes, the message for people remains the same. “The numbers in no way show that the risk of infection and its complications is gone. People must continue to follow restrained behaviour and adhere to prevention protocols in individual and social interest,” he added. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said new cases were falling while recoveries were going up for the last two days. The number of Covid-19 tests remain the same. “As a result of the trend, the state is left with 1.77 lakh active cases as of now. This is almost 42% less than the peak figure of 3.1 lakh recorded on April 30,” he said. Meerut and Gorakhpur remained the top contributors of new cases. Irrespective of the declining trend, deaths continue to remain a cause for concern for the authorities. As many as 593 people died due to infection in the last 48 hours taking the total casualties to 17,238.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/weekly-growth-rate-of-corona-cases-dips-to-sub-zero-level/articleshow/82670090.cms||Shailvee Sharda

P Kandasamy, state secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam, said the rain would help farmers plough their farmlands and prepare for summer cultivation, especially if they had cultivated cover crops for green manures. “It will definitely encourage earlier cultivation of kharif crops like groundnut at Kinathukadavu and pulses in other parts of the district. But this unexpected rain could be detrimental to the late harvesters of turmeric.” With the depression in the Arabian Sea turning into a cyclonic storm, weather experts have forecast heavier rainfall on Sunday. “Coimbatore will record more than 20mm rainfall on Sunday,” said a regional meteorological department official, who didn’t want to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-rain-to-lash-district/articleshow/82668014.cms||---

The colleges from Aurangabad having affiliation with Batu have hailed the move stating that it would help students as well as institutions in overcoming pandemic-related challenges, including shrunk semesters. MIT principal Nilesh Patil on Saturday said that the new syllabus has given 25% weightage to self-study. “The 25% syllabus does not need formal teaching as such and students can grasp it on their own with little mentoring.

Activist R Raveendran, who is also a senior member of the Residents Awareness Associations of Coimbatore, was one among the duped. He said a man, who introduced himself as a representative of Cipla, which produces remdesivir, had taken advantage of his desperation to buy or source the antiviral drug for his nephew. Raveendran had paid the scamster an advance of Rs 10,000. Raveendran said he had received a WhatsApp message, which looked like from Cipla, with a 24-hour toll-free number of 8851968173 to be contacted for remdesivir. “It was just when my nephew was prescribed the antiviral drug, which was in short supply both in hospitals and medical stores. When I contacted, the man on the other side said the vials will be delivered directly to the hospital, without any dealers and distributors. He also asked for the patient’s Aadhar card, hospital address and CT report, to sound convincing.” Raveendran said the charge was quoted at Rs 5,000 per dose. “I needed six doses and I was asked to transfer an advance amount of Rs 10,000 through G Pay, which I did. The G Pay account was also in the name of Cipla. When I didn't receive the drug, I realized the account belonged to an individual, and not Cipla.” Raveendran has brought the incident to the notice of Cipla. “I didn’t lodge a police complaint as I didn’t want to step out during the pandemic. But I don’t want others to get duped.” When TOI contacted the number, a man named “Akash” answered the call. He quoted Rs 7,000 for a dose and later agreed for Rs 6,000 after a bargain. He demanded advance payment of 30% of the total cost. When reporters alerted health minister M Subramaniam about hospitals prescribing remdesivir, despite no actual evidence of its effectiveness against Covid-19, he said the state was getting around 7,000 doses a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/activist-falls-for-remdesivir-scam/articleshow/82668028.cms||---

The Annadhanapatty police identified the deceased as K Gopinath, 31, of Maankuttai area, his wife G Pavithra, 29, and daughter G Nanditha, 5. A police officer said Gopinath was working with a bakery in the city, while his wife was a homemaker. He said it was Gopinath's mother K Sengamalam, 60, who first saw the couple hanging from the ceiling of their house. “She went to visit them on Saturday evening. She knocked on the door several times, but there was no response from inside. She waited for around 30 minutes and peeped through the window gap only to see her son and daughter-in-law hanging from the ceiling.” She immediately alerted the Salem city police. Subsequently, Annadhanapatty police inspector Ramesh and team rushed to the spot and broke into the house. “We found Nanditha dead on the floor. The couple seemed to have strangulated her after feeding her food laced with poison,” the officer said. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Gopinath was suffering from breathlessness since May 9. “He was taking treatment at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital. Gopinath was looking upset after his health deteriorated,” the officer said. The Annadhanapatty police have registered a case and initiated inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/couple-kill-daughter-commit-suicide/articleshow/82668059.cms||---

Chouhan said that due to the increasing number of patients in several districts, it would be necessary for the state government to extend the corona curfew so that the infection spread can be arrested. Nath assured Chouhan that the Congress party stands with the government and every decision made by him in this hour of crisis. Nath told the chief minister that the government should take all necessary steps required to check the coronavirus spread and Congress will stand by him. He also cautioned Chouhan that the situation is turning abysmal in the rural areas. The former chief minister told Chouhan to ramp up healthcare facilities, required resources and equipment and provide treatment to the rural population on a war-footing, a Congress release said. He also asked the chief minister to take immediate steps to increase testing across villages. Nath told Chouhan that rising cases of ‘black fungus’ disease is also a matter of grave concern. “Already, there is a shortage of medicines required for the treatment of ‘black fungus’ and there are reports of black marketing of drugs. The government should take immediate steps to curb black marketing of vital medicines”, he said. He also told Chouhan to give priority to vaccination. Later, Nath spoke to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and urged him to ease restrictions on treatment of patients from MP. “People from Sheopur go to Kota and Sawai Madhopur towns in Rajasthan for CT scans and testing. But recently, patients were being stopped from entering Rajasthan”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-briefs-nath-on-covid-situation-in-mp/articleshow/82668088.cms||---

The incident took place Thursday night at Sajkuhi village under Tamia tehsil of the district. Local police received a tip off that despite lockdown due to Covid-19, a marriage ceremony was being performed at Sajkuhi village where more than 200 people were present, said sources. Teams of district administration, which included tehsildar Tamia, Manoj Chaurasia and Tamia police station in-charge Priti Mishra, reached the spot. Sources said that when administration teams sought to stop the function and initiated action for violation of Covid-19 norms, locals attacked the team with stones and sticks.

While tech-savvy persons did not lose time in booking the slots at desired vaccination centre, most people were stuck in understanding how all centres were already booked to capacity. Those who are unaware of computers and internet, and people with no internet facility, did not even attempt. As CoWIN and Aarygya Setu apps did not work smoothly, majority of slot bookings were made through web version of the CoWIN. Many people could not understand why their nearest vaccination centers were not being shown for booking. A youth, Bhupender Bhardwaj, said, “I had made a commitment to myself that I will get vaccinated on the first day of vaccination on May 17. Now, it looks like it may take many months to book a slot due to limited slots and high demand. None of my friends or relatives could book a slot.” In Himachal, panchayats are helping people in registration for the vaccine, but vaccination slots are required to be booked by the people themselves. Vaccine will be administered only to those who have booked a slot. Each designated vaccination centre will inoculate 100 beneficiaries every Monday and Thursday, when only 18-44 age group will be allowed. Booking for the slots will be possible only two days in advance in different vaccination center each time. Frustrated people kept calling each other for help. Some asked friends to register a slot for them, but everybody knew by the evening that available slots were booked in the morning and that they were wasting their energy all day. “I will be ready with a laptop and fast internet this Tuesday for the booking of slots on Thursday for me and my brother. I know lakhs of others will be trying at the same time. I tried hard on Saturday morning, but did not get OTP for at least 30 minutes. When I was searching for the vaccination centre, it took a long time and I was automatically signed out of the session,” another youth, Rakesh Sharma, said. Himachal has received 1.07 lakh doses of Covishield for vaccinating the 18-44 age group. Vaccination sessions will be held on May 17, 20, 24, 27 and 31. A total of 1,070 sessions have been scheduled in all 12 districts of the state. As vaccination drive for 18+ is slow, it may take months for many people to get the first dose despite attempts to get it immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tech-savvy-book-vaccine-slots-in-hp-others-hope-for-next-time/articleshow/82670140.cms||---

The hill retreat has been witnessing a steady spike in the daily caseload for the past 10 days, even as the district administration stepping up its efforts to contain the virus spread by enforcing the total lockdown and other standard operating procedures strictly. As per the official data, 10,677 of the 12,339 people who were tested positive for the viral infection till date have recovered in the district. However, the steep rise in new cases has brought down the recovery rate by nearly 6% to 86.5% from 92% over the past two weeks. The number of active cases in the district now stands at 1,603. They are being treated at various health facilities, including government and private hospital, and Covid care centres.

Besides attending to critical patients, they are also operating ventilators, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) machines. The facility has only nine technicians to manage 84 ventilators, 22 BiPAP and 32 HFNC machines and they work in three shifts daily. Only three technicians work at a time which is grossly inadequate. A senior doctor at SNMC said, “Doctors have been working for over 12 hours since the first week of April. Due to lack of support staff, they are providing medicines to patients and also working as technicians to manage the ventilators, BiPAP and HFNC. Not just the Covid care centre, they are somehow managing the situation in the post-Covid, emergency and other wards too.” According to the official records, SNMC has a 345-bed Covid care facility which is divided into two units. Ideally, 150 nurses are required to run the facility. However, only 54 are on duty. It needs 100 trained medical sanitation workers. But only 50 are available - 15 are not trained. At least 50 trained technicians are required but only nine are present. Amid the surge in infection, the health department has increased the number of doctors at the Covid care centre. The two units are managed by 24 senior doctors, 16 juniors and 10 interns. Thirty final-year MBBS students are also serving the Covid patients with mild infections. At least 60 doctors are required at the centre at a time, according to an estimate. Meanwhile, SNMC is running short of medical equipment used to treat critical patients. On Saturday, the hospital ran out of stock for the Bains circuit and non-ventilation mask for BiPAP. The patients' caretakers were asked to arrange for the equipment, sources said. SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said, “It is true the required human resources should be more. But, we are ensuring that patients do not suffer. Our doctors are working very hard and ensuring the best possible treatment." The SNMC principal added, "I am personally interacting with patients and guiding the course of treatment along with senior doctors. The issue of shortage in medical equipment has been taken up with the state government. Fresh supply is likely within the next 2-3 days."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/staff-crunch-docs-turn-technicians-to-operateventilators-bipap-and-hfnc-at-snmc-in-agra/articleshow/82664936.cms||Deepak Lavania

A diabetic, she was recently treated for Covid-19. She was diagnosed with Mucormycosis or black fungus and has now lost one eye. While the nation is pressings its resources into the fight against Covid, black fungus is targeting patients who have recovered from Covid. The fungal infection of the nose, sinuses and eyes can prove fatal if it reaches the brain. Dr Prahlad Duggal, who heads ENT and head neck surgery (HNS) at a private hospital in Amritsar has operated upon over 30 such patients since the Covid pandemic hit last year. He explained, “This disease is not new, but it is rising among Covid patients because excessive use of steroids elevates sugar levels and suppresses the immunity of patients, leading to loss of vision and death in some cases.” However, steroids are an important part of treatment. Dr Duggal observed, “As only drugs with proven efficacy in Covid are steroids, these are being used in a majority of patients. The lifesaving drugs used in Covid treatment are inducing the growth of this black fungus, which spreads to sinuses present in the facial bones, leading to destruction of these bones and disfigurement of various kinds. It is really painful to see the young and old losing their facial structures, eyes and many dying despite treatment.” Read AlsoWhat is Black Fungus: Do's &amp; Don'ts, symptoms &amp; treatmentNEW DELHI: With cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus infection, on the rise in states like Maharashtra and Delhi, the Union health ministry has issued a list of dos and don'ts for recovered Covid patients who could be experiencing the symptoms. In a separate press statement, the Union healthHe said that the low immunity of Covid patients gives the fungus an opportunity to grow. Raised blood sugar levels provide an ideal environment for establishment and fast growth of this fungus, which quickly spreads to the nose, face, eyes and brain. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for diabetic patients suffering from Covid-19 to keep their blood sugar strictly under check. Those who survive this fungal infection are losing their teeth, jaws, eyes and many facial bones, Dr Duggal warned. Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by fungi of the order, Mucorales. Those who are immunologically and metabolically compromised usually fall prey to this opportunistic black fungus which destroys the facial bones, invades eyes and brain and is frequently fatal. “Diabetic patients with uncontrolled sugar who are obese are also more likely to fall prey to this fungus. Early detection and quick treatment holds the key and there is a need for people to be aware that any vague headache or facial pain, eye symptoms like pain, redness and swelling should be immediately reported to an ENT doctor, who will evaluate and examine for early signs of this disease. A high degree of suspicion should also be there with the doctors who are treating Covid-19 patients and any nasal, facial or eye complaint should not be ignored because early intervention is required in these patients,” said Dr Duggal. Both medical and surgical treatment is required in these patients and these run side by side. Endoscopic and open surgeries along with antifungal drugs are used for treating these patients but despite aggressive treatment, many suffer permanent disfigurement of face, loss of vision and may eventually die even after winning their battle against Covid-19. Dr Duggal suggested that the health authorities dealing with Covid-19 in the state issue strict guidelines to Covid treatment centres to keep a watch for Mucormycosis infection among Covid-19 patients, especially those who are diabetic. “There is a need to incorporate the protocols for steroid use in Covid-19 treatment with short-term and long-term blood glucose monitoring. Efforts should be made to create awareness among the public and physicians about the early signs of this fungal disease to stop this epidemic of ‘Black fungus’ during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. Experts believe that given the high cost of treating Black Fungus, there is a need for the government to step in to check hoarding of the anti-fungal medicines and to provide financial assistance to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/black-fungus-complicating-covid-battle/articleshow/82674391.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Agra||Hema Malini bats for foreign medical grads on Covid duty||AGRA: Member of Parliament (MP) from Mathura Hema Malini has urged Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to allow foreign medical graduates to treat Covid patients without going into formalities of clearing the mandatory Foreign Medical Graduates Exam (FMGE). This, she said, was necessary to tackle the unprecedented upsurge of Covid-19 cases in the state and country. Malini told TOI, “Several foreign medical graduates want to work in Covid wards and they can be very helpful during the pandemic. The (UP) CM has assured me he will consider my request. I spoke to the (Union) health minister, too, in this regard and am hopeful to get a positive reply.” In her letter to the UP CM, Malini highlighted that “there is a dire need of doctors in view of the prevailing Covid situation across the country. I request you to allow them to work as a large number of such graduates are available in almost every district". Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, member, National Medical Commission, said that India needs to mobilise all its human resources including services of a large number of foreign medical graduates, which are at least one lakh in number. They are sitting idle because of non-clearance of the exam. “It looks like the pandemic will go on for a while and there is a need to allow these doctors to work for Covid patients due to the huge gap between demand and availability of doctors in the country,” Singh said. "If the government can allow final year MBBS students to treat Covid patients, why not foreign medical graduates?" Several IFMS (Indian Foreign Medical Students) are running a campaign on social media and approaching politicians to raise their voice to the government. The IFMS Welfare MCI Gurukul Trust has also written to the Government of India stating that IMFS will provide their services for free during pandemic for a year, which would help the country save nearly Rs 4,500 crore. Nearly 100 MPs/MLAs/ministers have written to GOI in support of IMFS so far. Dr Kishan Kumar from Gujarat, who passed out from TVER state medical university in Russia, told TOI, “We are ready to work for free for one year in Covid ICUs provided permanent registration/one time exemption from FMG exam is given to us.” Kumar pointed out that the government has allowed many BHMS/Ayush/homeopathy paramedics and nurses, along with medical interns, to work in Covid hospitals and also given them a stipend. “And here we are ready to work without any salary if needed. Government should consider our demands,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-mp-hema-bats-for-foreign-med-grads-on-covid-duty/articleshow/82664896.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Officials privy to the investigation said Anshu Dixit walked 50 steps from his high security cell to shoot Muqeem Kala and then reached another cell to kill Merajuddin. Asked how Dixit managed to find his way out, an official said the cells of all inmates were opened for some time every morning to allow them attend the call of nature and perform other chores. The committee formed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath to look into the incident also found that 15 CCTV cameras were not working and deputy jailors were not there on duty. Administrative lapses were also detected on the part of jail superintendent and jailor on duty after which they were suspended. Senior jail officials told TOI that Nirman Nigam was informed about dysfunctional CCTV cameras but it could not be changed due to coronavirus curfew. Explaining the absence of deputy jailors near the high security cell, officials said both of them were suffering from the novel coronavirus and jail authorities were trying to increase manpower in the prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dy-jailors-missing-from-duty-15-of-35-cctvs-dysfunctional/articleshow/82670115.cms||---

Just like every other day, she had purchased about 3kg flowers for Rs 1,500 on Friday night and gave them to the workers to make flower strings. Her hopes of selling them the next morning and use the proceeds to pay the workers, manage household expenses and reinvest in the business were shattered by the government’s decision to keep the venders off the streets from Saturday. Being the sole breadwinner of the family, Ranganayaki has no idea what to do with the flowers or how to manage the expenses.“If the government had announced the decision in advance, I would not have bought the flowers and instead saved the money for household expenses. The state should have given us one more day at least to close the sales. Now, both my investment and the flowers have gone waste,” said Ranganayaki, a street vendor for the past 10 years.The story of 48-year-old Subramani, who sells vegetables on Thadagam Road and Marudhamalai Road, isn’t any different. He had purchased vegetables worth Rs 7,000 just a day ago. “I had sold vegetables worth Rs 1,500 on Friday. While I was confident of selling the remaining vegetables on Saturday, the announcement left me numb. Now, I have no other option but to use the vegetables for my household purposes, distribute them to my friends and families, and feed the remaining to the cattle.”Explaining that he had spent most of his savings to buy the vegetables, Subramani said they were all daily wage labourers and their earnings weren’t often sufficient to meet their expenses. “Giving us a day’s time would have at least helped us clear the stock and make enough money to manage the expenses for the rest of the month.”Like Ranganayaki and Subramani, hundreds of street vendors in the district are affected by the government’s sudden move.P Mani, president, district roadside and pavement vendors’ welfare association, said the move had badly hit the street vendors, who had not only lost their livelihood but also savings. “We are not against the lockdown as we completely understand its necessity. The government shouldn’t have hurried the decision.” Welcoming the government dole of Rs 2,000 per family, he said many of them had taken the Union government’s loan of Rs 10,000 last year and been repaying that in instalments. “Our financial burden will reduce if the government could extend the repayment period. It should also take steps to assist us financially.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/curbs-on-street-vending-badly-hit-livelihood-of-hundreds-in-district/articleshow/82668054.cms||Nivedha Selvam

R Gopinath, Salem west incharge of the BJP, also came down heavily on police and other government officials for not taking any action against the DMK cadres for flouting the standard operation procedures.

The function was attended by collector S A Raman, MP S R Parthiban and Salem North MLA R Rajendran. Gopinath said he had seen a few photos and videos of the event on social media. “In the video, the MP, MLA and the collector were surrounded by more than 200 DMK cadres, while distributing the cash. Police officials, who were supposed to control the crowd, did not take any action.” He said the state government should avoid conducting such events during the pandemic. “Instead, it can deposit the amount to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.” Poomozhi, president of Tamil Nadu Makkal Urimai Katchi, meanwhile, requested the government not to make the distribution of grocery items kit that is scheduled on June 3 a grand affair. “Considering the pandemic situation, the chief minister should order his party cadres not to assemble in large numbers at the distribution centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-cadres-flout-social-distancing-guidelines/articleshow/82668095.cms||Senthil Kumaran

Completing the rituals before a priest and parents in double quick time, all they said was that they'll stay together for life. Bride Preeti Tiwari, 22, said the intention was to send a larger message to society that the evil of dowry and expensive weddings should be avoided and “cut to size” during Covid times. Keeping things simple, would-be couple Pushpendra Dubey, 28, and Preeti, a high school pass-out from neighbouring Hardoi district, accompanied by their parents, arrived at Patna Devkali temple in Kalaan bereft of any wedding finery. Attired in a white shirt and trousers, Pushpendra looked the private school teacher he is while Preeti donned her mother’s hand-me-down red sari. In the presence of the priest, Daya Shanker Tiwari, and their parents, they took seven steps around the “garbhagriha” (sanctum sanctorum) housing the Shivling and took the seven vows of marriage. In 20 minutes, they were man and wife. Pushpendra, who accepted a copy of the Ramayana as the only gift from Preeti’s father, told TOI, “My wife and I have taken the first step and we urge others to do the same.

Upadhyaya’s brother-in-law and former block pramukh, Rameshwar, also joined the party with her. Talking to mediapersons, Seema said she joined BJP as she was influenced by its ideology. She had contested the zila panchayat polls against her sister-in-law (devrani), Ritu Upadhyaya, who was BJP’s official nominee from ward 14. While Seema is wife of former cabinet minister Ramveer Upadhyaya, Ritu is the wife of former MLC and MLA Mukul Upadhyaya. Seema had won the zila panchayat member’s post twice in 2000 and 2005 before successfully contesting parliamentary elections from Fatehpur Sikri on a BSP ticket in 2009 against Congress’s Raj Babbar. State vice president of BJP, Brij Bahadur told TOI, besides inducting Seema Upadhyaya and her brother-in-law, the party had revoked the suspension of 11 party members, including the former’s son, Chirag Upadhyaya. They all were expelled from the party on April 14 for “indiscipline” and for supporting opposition candidates in the panchayat polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bsps-ex-mp-joins-bjp-in-hathras/articleshow/82664981.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||As cities ‘stabilise’ in Maharashtra, Covid cases & toll in peri-urban, rural areas a concern||MUMBAI: Covid-19 is raging in the peri-urban and rural areas of many districts in Maharashtra even as cases have dipped or plateaued in cities adjoining them. At least 32% of the state’s daily detections are now coming from rural areas, while some districts are seeing up to 80% deaths from rural parts. Municipal corporation areas in 17 districts are now recording fewer cases than their neighbouring semi-urban or rural pockets. Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli, Aurangabad, Latur, Nanded, Akola and Amravati have seen cases declining in their corporation areas but surging in rest of the district. Experts say a similar trend was seen in the first wave: cases started with cities, then travelled to tier-II cities and semi-urban areas before reaching villages. Ahmednagar is one of the districts witnessing the transmission away from corporation limits. On Friday, areas outside the corporation recorded 2,958 cases and a dozen deaths compared to 245 cases and two deaths in city limits. Similarly, while 128 cases and 13 deaths were detected from Solapur corporation limits, the rest of the district saw 2,070 cases and 59 deaths. In Kolhapur too, most daily detections are from areas outside the city; on Friday, the city added 310 cases and four deaths while rest of the district saw 1,211 cases and five deaths. Civic surgeon of Amravati Dr Shyamsundar Nikam said 80% of daily deaths are now from rural areas of the district. Rural regions and villages not affected in the first wave have been hit hard in the second, said Solapur civil surgeon Dr Pradeep Dhele. “Worry is people in villages stay home and reach hospitals when they are critical,” he said. The case fatality rate of smaller districts is a cause of concern already. The weekly death rate as on May 11 of Nandurbar and Nanded was over 5%, while Latur and Osmanabad had over 2.5% - the state’s average being 1.3%.   A technical advisor to the government, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, said it was worrying that a higher share of cases was coming from less urbanised areas as that has a direct impact on mortality. “Kolhapur, for instance, has a mortality rate of 3.2%. Even districts like Sangli have a high mortality rate because smaller towns or rural areas, which lack good medical infrastructure and trained manpower, are contributing to fatalities,” he said. Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’ surveillance officer, confirmed 30-32% cases are now coming from rural areas. “We have decentralised Covid care centres and started them at village level,” he said. District health officer of Chandrapur Dr Raj Gehlot said 38% of deaths in the district are from rural areas, hence they have started isolation centres in schools within villages. But do they have the trained manpower, asked Dr Abhijit More of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. “It is true zilla parishads have empowered gram panchayats to start Covid centres, but they need doctors and trained nurses,” he added. Salunkhe said cities like Mumbai and Pune can never rest with their decline in cases till the fringes are out of the wave. The weekly projection made by the public health department for districts like Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Chandrapur and Akola states these districts are likely to face shortage of ICU beds, oxygen-supported beds and ICU beds by May 23 if cases increase at the same rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-as-cities-stabilise-cases-toll-in-peri-urban-rural-areas-a-concern/articleshow/82672922.cms||Sumitra Debroy

To monitor and coordinate spread of Covid in rural areas, the government has ordered to reactivate the ‘Gram Nigrani Samitis’ in every gram panchayat. The samity will have 10-12 members, including the Asha Bahu, anganwadi karyakarti, lekhpal, secretary ANM, reputed persons from village and others. "Other than this, additional rapid response teams (RRTs) have been set up for the rural areas to assist the gram nigrani samiti in testing, tracking and medicine distribution in rural areas," said divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar. To check the ground situation and to ensure that effective preventive measures are being taken at the village level, the commissioner said that on Saturday he visited the Pargahi Baangar village in Kalyanpur block of the district along with CDO, DD panchayat, CMO, SDM, DPRO and other officers and reviewed the functioning of the gram nigrani samiti, vaccination, testing, medicine distribution, cleaning and sanitation, quarantine centres etc. "A total 360 families reside in Pargahi Baangar village. After a house- to- house survey, 77 persons were found having some symptoms, and after checking, 19 were shortlisted for Covid checking who had Covid symptoms. After antigen testing, one person was found positive while the rest of the 18 samples have been sent for the RT PCR test, the commissioner said. “One person is being given medication and recommended for home isolation.A total 38 persons were given vaccination in this village, out of which 15 have received the second dose. The second dose to the remaining 23 people is due on May 19”, he added. He said that fogging could not be done in the village in the last many months because of non-availability of kerosene used in the fogging machine.He has asked the DM and the CDO to examine the issue and get directions issued from the district headquarters so that the fogging is done effectively. "A quarantine centre was set up in this village, but no patient in isolation was kept in the quarantine centre till now”. He has asked the DM and the CDO to issue a standard format to all the quarantine centres in the district to maintain and update the data in a standard format. Later, the commissioner visited a few houses and interacted with the residents and family members of those who were in home isolation and were getting medicines. Noting that the Prescription slip was not given to the patient or identified persons in the medicine kits distributed to them, the commissioner issued a warning to the MOIC and asked the CMO to ensure that the prescription slip (in Hindi and English) is kept with every medicine kit and also the patient or his/her family members are well briefed by the ASHA workers during distribution of medicine kits. He also visited a patient in home isolation and found that the patient had become Covid negative after 14 days of home isolation but later on developed post Covid complications. He asked the DM and the CMO to examine this and issue detailed instructions to Nigrani Samiti for post Covid follow up of the patient so that timely and effective treatment could be given to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/gram-nigrani-samitis-in-villages-to-check-covid-spread/articleshow/82668125.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||City of Pearls put riders on patients earlier too||HYDERABAD: A row has erupted over ambulances from Andhra Pradesh and other states entering Telangana carrying Covid-19 patients for treatment in hospitals in Hyderabad. Though it may sound strange, it is not for the first time such a situation has emerged. The princely Hyderabad State, whose dominion extended over some districts of present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra, had witnessed a similar situation when the plague and the Spanish flu wreaked havoc. The City of Pearls gets many patients, seeking treatment, mostly from these states even now as they still lack medical infrastructure. Hyderabad State then had 16 districts (part of four divisions) where Aurangabad division included Aurangabad, Beed, Nanded and Parabhani districts. This entire division is now part of Maharashtra and shares the border with erstwhile Nizamabad district. Gulbarga division, included Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur districts which are now part of Karnataka. The division also had Osmanabad (now Latur district in Maharashtra) . The other divisions of Gulshanabad or Medak and Warangal division had present day districts of Telangana. Post-independence, when Hyderabad (with Telangana districts) and Andhra state merged, the city became hub of private hospitals in addition to government infrastructure already created by the Nizams. In modern day Telangana, 17 of 33 districts share borders with other states, including AP. Though Hyderabad does not share border with AP, it is close to Krishna, Guntur districts. Also, people from East and West Godavari districts seek medical facilities in Hyderabad. Also, the city has several super-specialty hospitals and over 1,000 medium-level hospitals. Being a medical hub, historically, Telangana and Hyderabad, had tackled outbreaks of epidemics like the plague, small pox and cholera in the modern era. The current Telangana government is not preventing anyone from other states bringing Covid negative certificates to visit. However, there was a time when quarantine was the norm. During outbreaks of plague, people from Maharashtra intending to visit Hyderabad had to be quarantined. “When passengers from Wadi (Maharashtra) entered Hyderabad, rulers were quick to send them to quarantine. Travellers from there were found in railway stations and sent to isolation centres,” historian and professor Adapa Satyanarayana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-of-pearls-put-riders-on-patients-earlier-too/articleshow/82668105.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Lucknow||Twin FIRs lodged, a day after bloody shootout in Chitrakoot jail kills 3 dons||LUCKNOW: A day after a dreaded gangster from west UP, Muqeem Kala, and another criminal, Merajuddin, were shot dead by a history sheeter, Anshu Dixit, inside district jail in Chitrakoot, police lodged two FIRs in connection with the shootout. Dixit, who allegedly held five other inmates at gunpoint, was also killed in retaliatory firing from police. Cops recovered a 9mm pistol from Dixit. Chitrakoot jail superintendent, jailor, two head warders and a warder were suspended following the incident. Muqeem Kala of Shamli was held responsible for the much publicised 'Kairana exodus', a phrase popularised by former BJP MP Hukum Singh, while Merajuddin was an aide of don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari. Anshu Dixit, a dreaded criminal and a sharp shooter, was languishing in Chitrakoot jail since December 2019. He shot to infamy after his name figured in the murders of Lucknow University general secretary Vinod Tripathi and Gaurav Singh in December 2007 and then in the murder of CMO Vinod Arya murder case but was given a clean chit. In the first FIR lodged by suspended jail superintendent, SP Tripathi, police have accused Anshu Dixit of killing Kala and Merajuddin while in the second FIR, SHO, Karwi, Virendra Tripathi has accused Anshu Dixit of attempt to murder by opening firing on the police forcing the cops to open fire in retaliation. In the first FIR, SP Tripathi said he was informed by jail staff that around 9.55am, inmate Anshu Dixit walked out of his high security cell and shot dead Muqeem Kala who was lodged in a temporary barrack as per Covid-19 protocol. Thereafter, Dixit also reached high security barrack of another inmate, Merajuddin, and shot him dead. “Anshu held five other prisoners hostage at gunpoint,” he added. “Superintendent of police, Chitrakoot, along with the district magistrate and PAC reached the spot and asked Dixit to surrender but he opened fire on cops and was killed in retaliatory firing,” Tripathi said. The second FIR, lodged by Karwi SHO Virendra Tripathi, mentions the sequence of events which unfolded inside the jail and states that at least 26 rounds were fired by the police over a span of 105 minutes before Dixit could be gunned down. He said around 10.35am police force entered the jail and by 11.45am climbed the rooftop of another barrack. Cops warned Dixit to surrender but he refused and opened fire on police teams. “We neutralised him around 12.10pm,” said the SHO. The FIR was lodged under charges of attempt to murder, wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation and the relevant sections of the Arms Act and Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act against Dixit. IG, Chitrakoot Dham, K Satyanarayan, told TOI that the bodies of all the three criminals were handed over to their families after post-mortem examination. Officials said at least two bullet injuries were found on the body of Merajuddin, five on Muqeem Kala and four on the body of Anshu Dixit. SP, Chitrakoot, Ankit Mittal visited the jail premises to interrogate inmates to find out the motive of the murders. “We are yet to find any significant reason that could have triggered the shootout,” he said. On Friday night, Chitrakoot jail superintendent SP Tripathi and jailor Mahendrapal were suspended for laxity. Prisons department transferred DIG, jail headquarters, Sanjeev Tripathi as DIG, prisons, Chitrakoot, while Shailendra Kumar was made the new DIG, Jail Headquarters. Similarly, Jail superintendent, Kasganj, Ashok Kumar Sagar was made new jail superintendent of Chitrakoot while CP Tripathi from Ayodhya jail was made the new jailor of Chitrakoot. Meanwhile, two head warders, Harishankar, and Sanjay Khare, and a warder, Amit Kumar, were also suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/twin-firs-lodged-a-day-after-bloody-shootout-in-chitrakoot-jail-kills-3-dons/articleshow/82670151.cms||---

Is this really happening?” sighs Radhika Bapat, a slight young woman, her thoughts restlessly vacillating. In other times, these are questions that she would have been fielding to help others battle their anxiety and fear. But for the first time in her career, Bapat, a clinical psychologist, found herself experiencing the same emotions alongside them. One of the hardest parts of being a therapist — in high demand during the pandemic — has been the parallel experience of helping too many clients cope with crises that they have been going through themselves. Bapat says her caseload was manageable last year. “People were dealing with shock and threat but were more careful and responsible. This year we’re mostly dealing with panic and grief.” By March this year, Bapat had become her own client who could barely fight the urge to turn away clients or terminate therapy. The blurring of boundaries too took its toll. Telepsychiatry became the new normal in the pandemic after the central government allowed it for the first-time last year to help people access therapy from their home. The Telemedicine Society of India in February recorded an increase of about 302% in online mental-health consultations. To beat the burnout — or compassion fatigue — mental health professionals have been seeking therapy to examine their own emotional state. For Bapat it was about choosing between her clients and her sanity. “On one hand, you know their problems are real and the distress palpable but when your phone is continuously buzzing with SOS messages or you’re added to a WhatsApp group without consent, it gets too much to take.” In March, she took help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clinical-psychologists-too-seeking-therapy/articleshow/82672673.cms||Mohua Das
---||Chandigarh||Tweeterati to chief secy: Why not one nation, one vaccine price?||Chandigarh: Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan’s tweet about rates of Covid vaccines Covishield and Covaxin for 18-44 age group at two private hospitals in Mohali has attracted sharp criticism. “#Private hospitals Max Mohali and @fortis_hospital have procured vaccines & have begun #vaccinating 18-44 years in #Punjab. Max is charging Rs 900 for covishield and Fortis Rs 1250 for Covaxin. Please register on #CowinPortal to book a slot at these hospitals (SIC),” tweeted the chief secretary on Saturday morning. Replying to the chief secretary’s tweet, Jashandeep Singh of Kotkapura said, “Can a normal person afford this vaccine rate?? @CMOPb @capt_amarinder This shows how private players dominated the health as well as transport system of Punjab. It’s shameful.” One Chetan Shah replied, “Covaxin is not available for government, but they can supply to private hospitals ? What can be more pathetic than this. The government should enact emergency essentials commodity act (SIC).” Private hospitals in Punjab have been charging Rs 250 per shot of vaccine - Rs 150 for vaccine cost and Rs 100 as service charge - for persons of age 45 years and above as they were being provided vaccines by the state government. Now, private hospitals can directly purchase vaccines from manufacturers for the 18-44 age group. Neither the state government nor the central government have capped vaccination prices. However, Covid vaccination is free of cost for all about 18 years of age in all government hospitals in Punjab. Advocate Davinder Kumar Rana from Jalandhar replied: “Very costly. I am surprised how age factor assessed the price of vaccine, when it was available for Rs 250 for 45+, then why the price hiked for 18+. Why not one nation, one price.” Twitterati also asked the chief secretary when would the vaccine for 18-44 age group be available in other parts of Punjab, especially in government facilities. Some people also brought it to her notice that the two private hospitals in Mohali which she had mentioned did not have the vaccination slot on CoWIN app. People were also of the view that private hospitals were profiteering from the Covid pandemic and the government needed to cap vaccination rates and procure adequate vaccines for government hospitals, so the poor could get vaccine jabs for free. Box No stock from Centre Though the Punjab government is facing a Covid vaccine shortage, it did not get any delivery of vaccine from the central government on Saturday. It did receive 50,000 vaccine doses ordered directly from the manufacturer. Due to limited stock of vaccines, the Punjab government had on Friday launched the vaccination drive for 18-44 age group family members of healthcare workers, both in government and private sectors, and those suffering from co-morbidities. Other people in this age group would be covered depending on the vaccine availability. The state only has vaccine quota for the 18-44 age group for the vaccination drive on Sunday and not for those of 45 years and above, said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tweeterati-to-chief-secy-why-not-one-nation-one-vaccine-price/articleshow/82670183.cms||Sanjeev Verma

Recently, chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath had directed all district officials in the state to prepare themselves for the third wave and set up Covid hospitals for children. On May 14, the CM talked to the mayor on phone and inquired about the preparations being made for Covid hospitals for children. The mayor informed the CM that Chacha Nehru hospital in Cooperganj and Jageshwar hospital at Govindnagar could be converted into Covid hospitals. She said that the CM had asked her to send the proposal and the current status report of both the hospitals to the government, and also send their copies to the district magistrate. During discussion, the CM suggested creating awareness among the people about the deadly disease and asking them to take preventive measures, Pramila Pandey said. The CM also inquired about other preparations and measures being taken to tackle the disease, she said. Municipal commissioner Akshay Tripathi said that the report of the two hospitals was being prepared and it would be sent to the government soon. Meanwhile, a team of the revenue department also went to the Jageshwar hospital and measured the area for setting up an oxygen plant. Around 2700 square metres of land would be acquired at Jageshwar hospital for setting up an oxygen plant, said local corporator Naveeen Pandit . Talking to TOI, Naveen Pandit said Jageshwar hospital has enough space where a special wing for children could be set up. The hospital could play a significant role in providing medical facilities to the residents of Kanpur South, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/two-covid-hospitals-to-be-set-up-in-city-to-provide-treatment-to-children/articleshow/82668174.cms||---

Thackeray has been trying to involve private doctors in the fight against coronavirus and has spoken to over 1,000 doctors from Mumbai over the last few days. The idea of addressing doctors is to tell them decisions taken by the state and to redress any doubts or problems the fraternity may be facing, officials said. The Sunday interaction will taken place at 12 noon, and the topic of discussion is treatment of Covid-19 in primary health centres. With Covid cases in the state reaching the smaller cities and rural areas, it is important for local doctors to be involved in the fight, officials said. “The CM has been trying to motivate and mobilise more and more private doctors. Task force members have been involved so treatment protocols reach the lowest levels,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-and-task-force-to-speak-to-docs-across-state-at-noon-today/articleshow/82668169.cms||---

As more people are visiting the vaccination centres in the third phase of the drive, the selected sites stopped spot registration and implemented no walk-in rule to avoid overcrowding. Those who did not register themselves on the portal were being turned away from the vaccination centres. Navin Kumar (47) of Kumhrar said he was checking for open slot in the state capital. “I do not have any preference of vaccine or taking it at any particular centre. But, unfortunately, the wait for vaccine is getting longer for me,” he said. Ragini Tripathi (49) of Digha said she was earlier reluctant to take the vaccine due to myths and rumours, but got ready after her neighbour assured her of its usefulness. “I thought, the operators at vaccine sites would register and give slot accordingly. But they refused and asked me to book a slot first. I got registered but did not get the slot yet,” she said. Somesh Agarwal said he tried but failed to book a slot for himself and his parents. “I tried but the days end with disappointment,” he added. As per the state health department data, of the 8,18,661 shots administered in Bihar since May 9, 5,22,769 people in the age group of 18 to 44 got their first dose of vaccine while 1,02,223 people above 45 got the first shot. Booking the slot for vaccine appointment on CoWIN has become a game of fastest finger first. Sanvi Bhardwaj (24), who took her first jab on Saturday, said she was checking for the slot after every five minutes and finally “hit the jackpot” late Friday evening. “I tried to book the slot at Lok Nayak Jayprakash Hospital in Shastri Nagar on three days but in vain. They opened booking for only a minute or two. After several attempts, I finally got the slot for vaccine for today,” she said. Amarjeet Kumar, an IT professional, said it took him only 20 minutes to book the slot on CoWIN portal after he registered himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-45-people-find-it-hard-to-book-slot-for-vaccine-shots/articleshow/82666486.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh government has shown the path of humanity, says Shiv Sena||Mumbai: The Shiv Sena on Saturday praised the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh for its decision to provide a monthly financial assistance of Rs 5,000 and free ration to children orphaned due to the pandemic. In an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Sena also questioned the need for spending on projects such as the Central Vista, which it said will “deface” Delhi,or for the PR machinery of ministers in the time of the pandemic. The Sena's comments are viewed as a veiled swipe aimed at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in view of the state government's decision to allocate Rs 6 crore for appointing a private agency to handle his social media accounts. Under fire over the decision, Ajit Pawar had ordered the cancellation of the government order in this regard. “It is often debated how children orphaned after losing their parents to Covid-19 should be taken care of. This issue is discussed in Maharashtra as well. But MP did not stop at discussions but took a decision to financially support such children,” Sena said. On May 13, MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that the state government will provide free education, ration and a pension of Rs5,000 per month to children whose parents have died of coronavirus. “The MP government has shown the path of humanity to the rest of the country. This decision shows politicians still have humanity,” it said. A former ally of BJP, the Sena heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, comprising Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. The Sena also said children suffer the most in natural and man-made calamities. “The crisis of the orphaned children is a big calamity during this pandemic,” the Uddhav Thackeray-headed party said. It recalled the 1993 earthquake in Latur in which several people had lost their lives. “Orphans need to be taken care of. Social organisations will do their bit, but what politicians can do; MP has shown the way,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-govt-has-shown-the-path-of-humanity-says-shiv-sena/articleshow/82668160.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In poor health, Elgar Parishad accused must get interim bail: Kin||Nagpur: Relatives of the accused in Elgar Parishad (Koregaon Bhima) case have alleged poor conditions and lack of health facilities in the jails, threatening their health amid the pandemic. They have appealed that their kin lodged in Pune’s Taloja jail and Byculla prison in Mumbai should be released on interim bail. In an online press conference, it was urged that the state’s high powered committee formed following the Supreme Court’s directives to decongest prisons should also recommend release of Elgar Parishad case accused. Even medicines asked by them are not being allowed to be sent on the grounds that outside items have been barred due to the pandemic, said one of the relatives. Accused under Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act (UAPA) like those in Elgar Parishad case are out of the committee’s scope. The relatives say due to the poor conditions threatening their life, even their case should be considered. Already, two of the accused — singer Jyoti Jagtap and Delhi University professor Hany Babu — have been diagnosed with Covid. Babu has already developed complication in the eye, threatening his vision. 60-year-old trade unionist from Chhattisgarh Shubha Bhardwaj has Covid-like symptoms since a month after getting first dose of vaccination. No further testing was done after a rapid antigen test (RAT) found her negative. Surendra Gadling, the lawyer from Nagpur, was not able to get the vaccine because the family members could not produce his Aadhaar card. Gadling has developed problem in the eyes too. Jesuit priest Father Stan Swamy is a patient of Parkinson’s and Anand Teltumde, also from Nagpur, is an asthmatic. Shoma Sen, another accused from Nagpur, is suffering from co-morbidities too, said the relatives and friends of different accused TOI talked to. Minal Gadling, wife of Surendra Gadling, said she got a call from the jail a month ago that they needed his Aadhaar number for vaccination. He does not have an Aadhaar, so the driving licence was given but he was not vaccinated, she said. “Even UAPA accused are out of the committee’s scope. There have been numerous correspondences with the chief minister who heads the committee that either the conditions of the jail should be improved or the accused should be released considering the pandemic. If murderers and rape accused have been released, why not Elgar Parishad accused who are human rights activists should be let out?” asked Koel, daughter of Shoma Sen. Jenny Rowena, wife of 54 Hany Babu, said he had lost coordination between two eyes and was seeing dual images apart from having blurred vision. Smita Gupta, an associate of Shubha Bhardwaj, said since April she had severe diarrhoea, body ache and tastelessness. Gupta said in the third week of April, she tested negative after a rapid antigen test (RAT). However, RAT cannot be entirely confirmatory. Monali Raut, sister of Mahesh Raut, an accused from Mumbai, said some of the medicines he wanted were not allowed to be sent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-poor-health-elgar-parishad-accused-must-get-interim-bail-kin/articleshow/82663318.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: For 1st dose for 60+, BMC may still allow walk-ins for 3 days||MUMBAI: People above 60 years old may get the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on Monday through on-spot registration. Civic authorities are likely to proceed with their plan of carrying out walk-in-only vaccination for 3 days starting Monday. A final call on Monday’s vaccination plan will be taken on Sunday. Dr Mangala Gomare, the city’s executive health officer, said that the tentative plan was to allow walk-ins for those 60 years and above who want to take the first dose of Covishield. For those between 45-59 years, frontline and healthcare workers, vaccination would be only through online registration, she said. They can get vaccinated on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays, when only online appointments would be entertained. The BMC had planned a walk-in drive from May 17 to May 19 to facilitate the vaccination of all those waiting for the second dose. However, following the Centre’s decision to extend the dosage gap to 12 weeks to 16 weeks for Covishield, the BMC was left with doses, which they are now planning to give to those waiting for their first shots. Senior citizens, whose drive was started on March 1, will become eligible to get the second dose after May 23. In Mumbai, 19.96 lakh people have taken the first dose of Covishield and 6.56 lakh had taken the second dose till Friday. There will be no vaccinations on Sunday. Gomare said those eligible for the second dose of Covaxin can walk in on Monday. “Even those between 45 and 59 can walk in for the second dose of Covaxin,” she said. However, even second-dose seekers will have to take appointments if they want to get vaccinated between Thursday, Friday and Saturday. A little over 1.24 lakh people have taken Covaxin in the city, of which nearly 64,000 have taken the second dose as well. At the state level, vaccination plunged to a six-day low on Friday. According to state data, merely 1.50 lakh people could get vaccinated in Maharashtra. Although the state is inching towards 2 crore vaccinations, having administered 1.97 crore doses, state officials said that the pace was extremely slow. The state has vaccinated an average of 2.30 lakh people in May so far against its daily capacity of vaccinating 8 lakh. Several districts said they were not holding a drive over the weekend or trimming it. Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, said it was the decision of individual districts whether or not to hold a drive over the weekend. “They decide their own pace, we only take care of the supply,” he said. The state had received 1.15 lakh doses of Covaxin and had Covishield to sustain the drive for three days. At Amravati, district officials said people were keen on getting vaccinated, but there were not adequate doses. “With the increasing interval in doses, we are planning to finish vaccinating all healthcare and frontline workers. Then we may vaccinate those willing to take the first dose and those who come through online appointments,” said civic surgeon Dr Shyamsundar Nikam. He added centres in Amravati are allowing walk-ins as well as online registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-for-1st-dose-for-60-bmc-may-still-allow-walk-ins-for-3-days/articleshow/82668203.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana declares it a notified disease, to pay for treatment||Chandigarh: Haryana government has declared black fungus a notified disease in the state, which means that every case detected by any doctor has to be notified to the government through the district chief medical officer. The decision came after over 40 cases of Covid patients found to be suffering from black fungus infection were reported from Gurgaon, Karnal, Fatehabad and other districts. Haryana’s health and home minister Anil Vij confirmed this on Saturday. “Our team of senior doctors is in consultation with experts to plan a future course of action. The government will take adequate measures for its management in the state,’’ said Vij. He also clarified that the government would bear the treatment cost of Black fungus and special treatment centres would be set up in medical colleges and major government hospitals of the state. PGIMS, Rohtak and a tertiary care hospital of Gurgaon were the first to report the incidence of Black fungus this week. With its notification, it would be mandatory for the government and private hospitals to report any such case for treatment. Dr Usha Gupta, director, Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) Haryana said starting from Saturday evening, all ENT, ophthalmologists and physicians shall start getting training from management on measures to be taken. “Basically, this is a post Covid management complication. As of now, these cases were going unreported. Now, it is mandatory for all physicians, ENT surgeons and ophthalmologists to ensure reporting to the government for the purpose of management. Honorable HM Anil Vij himself will be monitoring and reviewing the training and workshops related to this,’’ said Dr Gupta. The incidence of Black fungus put the governmnent on the firing line of opposition as well. HPCC president Selja was the first to raise the issue. “Why did the government not accept this earlier? We raised this issue for the purpose of welfare of masses. Now the government should ensure management and free treatment of this disease for patients,’’ said Selja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-declares-it-a-notified-disease-to-pay-for-treatment/articleshow/82670224.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lifesaver boost, more jobs in Uttar Pradesh’s oxygen production policy||LUCKNOW: The state cabinet on Saturday gave its nod to UP Oxygen Production Promotion Policy, 2021, to augment production of medical and industrial oxygen and generate jobs. The policy blueprint, which was hammered out by the infrastructure and industrial development department, will bolster supply of medical oxygen amidst a surge in demand due to Covid’s lethal second run. A senior official in the department said, the policy will enable private investment in liquid oxygen plants, medical oxygen plants, zeolite and cylinder manufacturing, oxygen concentrators and accessories, cryogenic tankers and container manufacturing units. Applications under the policy will be accepted within six months of release. Sources in the government said, the government has an estimated daily requirement of 1,200 tons of the lifesaver gas, based on requirement of Covid-19 patients in home isolation or hospitals. Against this, the state has a liquid oxygen production capacity of 250.308 tons coupled with 88.84 tons from oxygen separators, pegging the total to 339.148 tons. Currently, the state is sourcing 894 tons from the Centre and other states, while industries have been asked to divert oxygen from industrial to medical use. Going by the oxygen production policy, investors will be given capital subsidy in three equal annual instalments of 25% for Bundelkhand and Purvanchal, 20% for Mandhyanchal and 15% for Pashchimanchal. There will also be 100% stamp duty relief of for Bundelkhand and Purvanchal, 75% for Madhyanchal and 50% for Pashimanchal. All applications will be assessed by a nodal agency after which the infrastructure and industrial development department will table it before a high-level committee comprising officials from departments of industrial development, MSME, stamp and registration, legal and power. A letter of comfort will be issued after clearance by the high-level committee. The final clearance of up to Rs 100 crore will be given by the industrial development minister, while projects more than Rs 100 crore will go to the cabinet for nod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lifesaver-boost-more-jobs-in-ups-oxygen-production-policy/articleshow/82670206.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The senior Congress leader claimed that 70 patients are suffering from ‘black fungus’ in Bhopal out of which 23 are currently undergoing treatment at Hamidia hospital. “There are rising cases of ‘black fungus’ and patients are getting admitted throughout Madhya Pradesh. The essential drug is Amphotericin injection, which has suddenly disappeared from the market and relatives of patients are running pillar to post for the drug,” the former chief minister wrote. Digvijaya said that the way Remdesivir injections for treatment of Covid was being black marketed and fake injections were manufactured, it raises concern if the same is not happening with Amphotericin. Digvijaya urged chief minister Chouhan to ascertain that Amphotericin injections are provided to patients through hospitals and also take stringent measures to stop black marketing of the vital drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/black-fungus-cases-rising-in-mp-diggy/articleshow/82668179.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19 cases at 66-day low in Mumbai, but total deaths in Maharashtra past 80,000||MUMBAI: On a day Maharashtra reported its lowest daily detections in 46 days, the total Covid-19 death toll in the state crossed the 80,000 mark. Maharashtra reported 960 deaths on Saturday, the second highest fatalities reported so far, taking its total toll to 80,512. It added 34,848 cases, lowest since March 30 (27,918). The state’s total caseload rose to 53.4 lakh. With fatalities continuing to surge, the state’s journey from 70,000 to 80,000 deaths was completed in merely 13 days. The state had 70,284 deaths on May 2. On Saturday, cases in Mumbai dropped to a 66-day low of 1,450 – the lowest since 1,012 cases recorded on March 9, taking the city’s overall tally to 6,86,295. In a positive sign, the city’s positivity rate dropped to 5.81% on Saturday. From a high of 20.8% on April 1, it had dropped to 9.9% on April 30. Civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal, however, urged Mumbaikars to come out and get tested in higher numbers. “We urge more citizens to come forward for testing. The higher the testing, the sooner we can flush out the virus,” he told TOI. On Saturday, 24,900 tests were carried out. A month ago, Mumbai had hit a high of over 56,000 tests. Another worrying aspect has been the deaths. On Saturday, the city recorded 62 deaths, taking overall mortality numbers to 14,164. Doctors believe the numbers are likely to stay above 50 for the rest of the month. Deaths are seen in two categories now, said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force. “One in a group of patients who are getting admitting and succumbing with 24-72 hours. The second group is those who are dying after 14-21 days of hospitalisation,” he said. Given that the city's ICUs continue to be 90% occupied, it is feared deaths would continue, he said. With daily discharges being higher than new detections, the state’s active cases dipped below the 5 lakh mark on Saturday. It has 4.9 lakh active cases, of which 34,083 are in Mumbai. State officials said smaller districts were adding higher deaths. Solapur district on Saturday added 91 deaths, of which 77 were from rural areas and 14 from the corporation area. Beed district added 35 deaths and Chandrapur district 51. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a technical advisor to the state, said cases in semi-urban and rural areas are driving the transmissions now. “These areas see a surge a month or two after cities, so they would take longer to settle down too,” he said. Deaths would continue to be high in the state much after that, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cases-at-66-day-low-in-city-but-total-deaths-in-maharashtra-past-80000/articleshow/82668236.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Patna||Bihar: Officials rule out vaccine shortage for 45+ people||PATNA: The Covid vaccination programme in the state may be hindered temporarily following the shortage of vaccines for the people above 45 years of age. The state health department on Thursday claimed that it had about six lakh doses available till then, but going by the statewide inoculation target of 2.5 lakh doses per day, the state needs replenishment of vaccine stock at the earliest. State immunization officer N K Sinha admitted the scarcity of vaccines for the 45+ age group, but said the present stock will continue for a day or two. He pointed out that the fresh stock of vaccines may arrive on Saturday night or Sunday. Earlier, the state had received the vaccines for the 45+ people from May 1 to 15. “The fresh stock is on way,” he said. He further said there was no dearth of vaccines for the 18-44 years age group and it would continue without any hindrance. Patna district immunization officer Vinayak, however, asserted that there was no dearth of vaccines for the people even above 45. He has received 60,000 doses of vaccines on Friday and this stock will last for five to six days and the fresh stock of vaccines is likely to arrive in two to three days, he said. Health minister Mangal Pandey also claimed that there was no shortage of vaccines in the state and that the vaccination for the people of all ages would continue uninterrupted. He said while the state is purchasing vaccines for 18-44 age group, it is getting it free from the Centre for 45+ people. The state has been receiving sufficient doses of vaccines from the Centre regularly, the minister added. Meanwhile, recent announcement regarding enhancement of gap between two doses of Covishield vaccines from 8-12 to 12-16 weeks has provided some relief to the states facing shortage of vaccines, notwithstanding some apprehensions about their efficacy. Health experts have, however, countered the people’s apprehensions. “The interval between two does of vaccines has been increased only after successful trials. There is no adverse impact on the people’s health by taking the second shot at the interval suggested by the new health guidelines,” said PMCH’s former superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad. Noted pediatrician Dr Arun Shah pointed out that the manufacturer of Covishield vaccines, the Serum Institute of India, conducted successive trials after giving both the shots at an interval of four, eight and 12 weeks and found that maximum antibodies were formed (more than 90%) in 12 weeks. He said when the interval between the two successive doses increases, the efficacy of vaccines also increases. The second dose, in fact, serves as the booster dose and it is always given after a long interval (as seen in cases of general immunization earlier), he said. He further pointed out that the interval between two doses of Covaxin remains a month till date as sufficient antibodies are formed during the time, Dr Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/officials-rule-out-vaccine-shortage-for-45-people/articleshow/82666571.cms||B K Mishra
---||Delhi||In 25 days, Covid cases dip from 28,000 to 6,430, but deaths still more than 300||NEW DELHI: Covid cases are on the wane in Delhi. From 28,395 cases reported on April 20 to 6,430 cases on Saturday, the capital has witnessed a major turnaround over the past 25 days. The number of deaths, however, continues to remain high. In the last 24 hours, 337 fatalities have been recorded. The positivity rate has declined to about 11% from 36% on April 22. The sudden dip in the Covid cases and positivity rate has brought a major relief to Delhiites. According to Saturday’s health bulletin, Delhi reported 6,430 fresh Covid cases and the positivity dropped to 11.3%. A total of 56,811 Covid tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, which was one of the lowest in recent weeks. In all, 11,592 Covid patients recovered. CM Arvind Kejriwal said that Covid cases were declining in Delhi slowly and steadily. “I hope it diminishes completely and does not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent in any way. Yesterday, we prepared 500 additional ICU beds, and 500 similar beds were prepared four days ago. Within 15 days, our doctors, engineers and workers have prepared 1,000 ICU beds. They have set an example for the world. I salute them on behalf of the people of Delhi and thank them for their work,” Kejriwal said. The occupancy of Covid beds is also declining in the city. Currently, 16,795 out of 24,018 Covid beds are occupied and 7,223 beds are vacant. 42,484 Covid patients are under home isolation. Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said that the sudden fall in the number of Covid cases and positivity was expected following a surge in the positivity rate and the number of cases. Gupta, however, underlined that even after the steep fall, the number of Covid cases was still close to the third peak witnessed in the second week of November 2020, when highest single-day Covid cases had touched 8,500. “Factors behind the steep fall include a large number of people already being infected in Delhi and more and more people taking Covid-appropriate behaviour seriously due to the alarming situation,” said Gupta, adding that let-up in following Covid-appropriate behaviour may cause another spike. Delhi currently has 66,295 active Covid cases. So far, the capital has reported 13,87,411 positive cases, while 12,99,872 people have recovered, including a large number of senior citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-25-days-covid-cases-dip-from-28k-to-6430-but-deaths-still-gt300/articleshow/82666559.cms||AlokKNMishra

He said they should make regular visit to the Covid patients to keep their morale high besides providing them proper treatment. He also asked the officials to take feedback about the patients recovering in home isolation. “Ensure regular visits of medical staff to the patients in home isolation so that they could get better treatment,” Nitish said. Nitish, who made a virtual tour of the DCHCs of 10 districts and the dedicated Covid hospitals at nine government medical college and hospitals through videoconferencing to take stock of the arrangements, medical facilities and infrastructure, asked the health officials to increase the number of ICU beds at the dedicated Covid hospitals across the state. The DMs of Purnia, Samastipur, Saharsa, Siwan, East Champaran, Nalanda, Khagaria, Aurangabad, Patna and Katihar gave detailed information to the CM about the arrangements made at the DCHCs in their respective districts.

---||Allahabad||Anand Giri sacked from Niranjani Akhara and Baghambari Math||PRAYAGRAJ: The Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani has expelled Yoga guru Swami Anand Giri of the Bade Hanuman temple from Baghambari Math and the akhara for being in constant touch with his family against the traditions of being a sanyasi. Besides, the ‘Chhote Mahant’ — as he was popularly called by fellow disciples of Mahant Narendra Giri and devotees, has been accused of financial irregularities, informed secretary of Niranjani akhara, Srimahant Ravindrapuri. The action follows a complaint lodged by president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parisad Narendra Giri. Anand Giri, being a disciple of Mahant Narendra Giri, enjoyed a stronghold in the akhara and wielded lot of clout within his fraternity and among devotees, but differences between the guru and disciple had started emerging for some time though they never said anything on public platform. Anand Giri hails from a village of Bhilwara district in Rajasthan. He had met Narendra Giri around 18 years ago and became his disciple. He learnt Sanskrit, Vedas and Yoga along with English. He was in link with devotees from several foreign countries due to his fluency in English. “Anand Giri called his entire family to Nashik, Ujjain, Prayagraj and Haridwar Kumbh, whereas according to the tradition of our akhara, family relations cannot be maintained,” said Narendra Giri. “Parents should be respected, but there is a tradition of the akhara. He was breaking the rule even after several warnings and was thus first removed from Baghambari Math and then expelled from the akhara, he added. There were also complaints of misappropriate use of funds of the Bade Hanuman temple by Anand Giri. The complaints were inquired by Panch Parmeshwar of Niranjani akhara and the accusations were found to be true. Sources said he had made some properties in different cities, including a building at Haridwar which has recently sealed by Haridwar Development Authority. Meanwhile, Anand Giri said his Guru (Narendra Giri) has the right to take action against him, but he will continue to honour him and his words. “Perhaps there were some shortcomings on my part while serving the guru,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/anand-giri-sacked-from-niranjani-akhara-and-baghambari-math/articleshow/82668252.cms||---

Prasad gave the advisory to the directors and other officials of AIIMS-Patna and IGIMS, as well as the superintendents and principals of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) while reviewing the state of treatment being given to the Covid patients and the level of preparations to meet any contingency situation. While health minister Mangal Pandey accompanied him, deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi also participated in the review meeting through videoconferencing. As an instance of heightened alert sound, AIIMS-P director told Prasad that timely preparations should be made and more effective measures should also be taken to prevent black fungus disease. Preparations should be complete and foolproof, he added. Prasad was informed that preparations were being made to make 50 more ICU beds at IGIMS and 20 more ICU beds at AIIMS-P. In his deliberation, Pandey said there was no shortage of medicines. Prasad sought details about the ICU beds, availability of oxygen, life-saving drugs, ventilators and Remdesivir medicine and also asked the four hospitals to provide information and food to attendants of the patients. Prasad was also informed that the pressure of patients at the hospitals had reduced. On Friday, Prasad had said Medanta Jaiprabha Superspecialty Hospital would provide Covid treatment from next week, besides noting that IGIMS will soon have a medical oxygen generation plant on its campus. On Saturday, the IGIMS director said the work would begin soon. It will provide oxygen to 100 beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-asks-hospitals-to-be-prepared-for-likely-3rd-wave/articleshow/82666619.cms||Abhay Singh

It will serve as an additional boarding/de-boarding point for the state capital. DRM Bhopal, Udai Borwanker told TOI that the project includes development of a new island platform on which trains can be admitted from either side for halting. “The platform will have connectivity to the circulating areas on both sides through a new Foot Over Bridge. For facilitating the boarding and de-boarding, a station building with passenger amenities like ticket booking counters, washrooms and waiting area will also be provided,” said Borwanker. With this new facility coming up, two major issues will get resolved. He added, “Presently, trains coming from Western Railway side are often detained at Nishatpura for want of a free platform at Bhopal. With the platform being made at Nishatpura, passengers will have the option of alighting at Nishatpura itself.” He further said, “Secondly, the locomotives of trains coming from Western Railway side and going towards Bina have to be reversed at Bhopal station, which takes at least 30 to 40 minutes and the platform remains occupied for this time, depriving berthing space to other approaching trains. This locomotive reversal can now be done at Nishatpura, without holding up trains going towards Bhopal or departing from Bhopal. This will help in de-congesting Bhopal station, especially during peak hours.” Road connectivity to the station has been planned from the CWC warehouse side, which will dovetail into the main road in the natural direction of traffic flow. A new circulating area, drop and go lane and parking lot are also being developed. This is also likely to ease the vehicular congestion around Bhopal station considerably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/new-railway-stn-at-nishatpura-soon-to-ease-rush-of-passengers/articleshow/82668241.cms||Ramendra Singh

It also issued guidelines for preventing the fungal infection and managing sugar levels in diabetics afflicted with Covid-19. Mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, is a highly invasive infection that could spread rapidly causing loss of eyesight, parts of eye, nose and even death. The much feared infection leads to nearly 90% mortality as per various studies and is being increasingly seen in Covid-recovered diabetic and immunocompromised patients. The guidelines specified the need to control blood sugar levels during Covid-19 with or without use of steroids. While patients having high levels of blood sugar before and during Covid-19 infection are more vulnerable to infection, the usage of steroids for treatment of Covid-19 further increases their sugar levels making them even more susceptible to the opportunistic fungal infection. Therefore, controlling blood sugar levels was very important, the guidelines said. “Black fungus is not a new disease. Mucosal mycosis is more common in people with diabetes and organ transplants. It is treated with antifungal drugs along with surgical debridement. It is known that the disease is spread due to overuse of steroid medication given to patients during corona and improper cleaning of oxygen delivery devices. Instructions were given to all public and private hospitals on precautions and measures to be taken to prevent the spread of the infection,” Dr G Srinivasa Rao said. Meanwhile, with an increase in instances of mucormycosis being reported from across the state, the government named ENT Hospital, Koti, and Gandhi Hospital as nodal centres for treating cases. “A few cases of mucormycosis are being reported post Covid treatment from various parts of Telangana. Many of these cases have ENT complications. It is decided that the ENT Hospital will be the nodal centre for managing these cases. If they are still Covid positive or need multidisciplinary treatment, those cases may be referred to Gandhi Hospital. Where ever there is a need for ophthalmologist intervention, the services of SD Eye Hospital need to be used,” director, medical education, Dr K Ramesh Reddy said in an order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ent-hosp-gandhi-named-nodal-centres-for-treatment-of-mucormycosis-cases/articleshow/82668275.cms||Amrita Didyala

The mother-daughter duo used to stay together.Persons staying in the area around house 161 called the police on Saturday morning after they noticed a stench from the house. The police came to the site and found the bodies of the women inside the house. They were identified as Taramati Pawar (74) and Aruna Pawar (50). Warasiya police inspector Kirit Lathiya said that when the police reached the spot, it found the door open and it was not bolted from inside or outside. “The bodies seem to have been there for a few days and were getting decomposed,” he said. A fan and a television set were found working inside the house. The bodies were not dressed properly, but the police believe that could also have been due to extremely hot climate or because the women were unwell. The bodies were taken for an autopsy to the SSG Hospital. Lathiya said that the procedure would be conducted after a RT-PCR test on the bodies. He added that there was also a possibility that the duo may have been suffering from Covid-19 and died inside the house. According to Lathiya, the women did not interact much with the residents of the locality. “Their behaviour was strange and they did not get along well with neighbours,” said Lathiya. Apart from Aruna, Taramati had another daughter and a son too. Inquiries by the police have revealed that the oher siblings also did not come to the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-daughter-found-dead-in-suspicious-circumstances/articleshow/82665085.cms||---
---||Delhi||Integrated centre in Delhi to monitor Covid data in real time||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has started an integrated command and control centre to monitor Covid-related data in real time. Officials will keep tabs on data regarding hospitals, ICU beds, availability of oxygen and vaccines, etc through the command centre, which is expected to help them in taking better decisions. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “Delhi government’s integrated command and control centre has been initiated today for the management of the coronavirus pandemic. In this centre, a variety of coronavirus-related data from all over Delhi will be collected on a real-time basis. It will help us in making informed decisions.” Which hospital has how much oxygen, from where the oxygen tankers have left and where have they reached; we will now be able to monitor all that, said Kejriwal. “How many beds are empty in a certain hospital, how many ICU beds are empty, how many oxygen beds are empty, how many people have been vaccinated, what age group of people has been vaccinated; all the hospital-related data, vaccine-related data, oxygen-related data, data regarding the number and status of Covid patients in a particular area are being captured and analysed. If the government takes decisions based on these data, they will turn out to be more successful and effective,” stated the CM. Kejriwal further said that the command centre would be made more robust to collect more and more data. He added that it would cover all the hospitals, including private hospitals, Covid care centres and all the related big and small institutions. “The data will be made available to the government officials/departments working on coronavirus-related information, through an app. It will also be reviewed as to how much data will be given out to the general public,” the CM said. On the possibility of a third wave, Kejriwal said, “Though the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi is dipping, the efforts of the government are in no way going to see a decline anytime soon. We started 500 ICU beds in front of LNJP yesterday and we added 500 ICU beds three days back. We are not sure when the disease may rise or fall again and hence, preparations will continue. Even the Covid care centers, which were created after the first wave—some of which were closed down after the second wave—will now be made permanent and will be strengthened further.” He urged Delhiites to continue taking precautions despite the cases going down in the city. The CM further said that the government had contacted Dr Reddy’s company for Sputnik vaccine. “We have contacted Dr. Reddy’s company for Sputnik vaccine, we have written to them, but have not received a complete response as to how many vaccines they can provide. We have asked for 67 lakh Covishield doses and asked them how much and when they can provide us the vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/integrated-centre-to-monitor-covid-data-in-real-time/articleshow/82666616.cms||---

Carrying banners and posters, as many as 3,000 party workers demonstrated at 36 party offices, 677 residential premises and other places between 10 am and 11am. CPI (M) state secretary Gopikant Bakshi said, “The protest, which we titled as Maang Diwas (Demand Day), was held to ensure that those falling below the income tax bracket are given Rs 7,500 per month for a period of six months. The Centre also needs to supply 10kg of food grains to the needy people, ensure speedy vaccination and stopping the Central Vista work in New Delhi.” He added, “Even though the Union government has allocated Rs 35,000 crore for the vaccination drive, it has now left the task of procuring the vaccines on the states. The Modi government is trying to avoid providing free vaccine to all the citizens.” He said that several weeks have passed by since the deadly second wave started but the Modi government is not ready to correct its mistakes. He added that the Supreme Court has questioned the vaccination policy of the government and has asked it to determine the allocation of vaccines for the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cpm-held-stir-in-19-dists-to-demand-relief-for-poor/articleshow/82666542.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Bike ambulances debut in Deoghar villages to ferry Covid patients||RANCHI: In a first, Deoghar district administration on Saturday rolled out five bike ambulances to wheel-in medical help or ferry Covid-19 patients to hospitals from hard-to-reach areas where normal ambulances cannot visit. Deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri along with SP Anjani Kumar Sinha jointly flagged off the new facility from the district collectorate building. Bhajantri said the ambulances will be used in rural and urban areas in the temple town as per requirement. “Extending medical help in minimum time is an important aspect of Covid management at a time when the second wave is killing more people. Hence, we thought of this idea to address the geographical challenges of a few areas and also address issues of ambulance shortage,” he said. While many rural areas pose mobility challenges for ambulances due to improper roads, the cluttered localities and narrow by-lanes in the urban pockets make it difficult for four-wheelers, he explained. Each of the five bike ambulances will be equipped with necessary gadgets and have been customised to carry patients. Anyone requiring ambulance service can call at 108 or 9262291244, said officials. The concept of bike ambulance isn’t new to Jharkhand. A few years ago during ex-chief minister Raghubar Das’s regime, they were introduced for naxal-infested areas. However, it is for the first time that a district is using for Covid help. Deoghar DPRO Ravi Kumar further informed over phone that these bike ambulances were donated to the administration by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) in the past which were put to use during the month-long Shravani mela. However, they were lying unused currently as the religious congregation didn’t take place last year due to the Covid-19 outbreak. “Hence, senior officials have now decided to use them for Covid duty as a part of our ongoing efforts for effective Covid control in the district,” he said, adding that these ambulances will be equipped with all necessary equipment to address exigencies so that help can reach patients in the least possible time. Notably, as the virus is spreading into rural Jharkhand, the state government is now focusing on various measures to curb the transmission chain and reverse the trend of infection. Besides trying to augment medical infrastructure, different districts are also working out innovative measures to create awareness towards Covid appropriate behaviour and increase vaccine coverage. Last week, Khunti and Jamtara roped in traditional village heelers (quacks) for early identification of suspected Covid patients. Gumla too adopted similar steps a few days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bike-ambulances-debut-in-deoghar-villages-to-ferry-covid-patients/articleshow/82666645.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand’s preparedness for possible third wave reviewed||RANCHI: The state health minister, Banna Gupta, on Saturday lauded the health workers and the bureaucratic officials for their relentless work “which helped reduce the Covid-19 caseload in the past one week”. “The manner in which our officers, in co-ordination with our health workers, have tirelessly worked to reduce the infection rate is admirable,” Gupta said, while urging them not to let their guard down and brace themselves for a possible third wave of the virus. Gupta made these statements after concluding a high-level review meeting with the senior government officials. The meeting was attended by the additional chief secretary of health department, Arun Kumar Singh, besides 17 IAS officers who head different cells for management of Covid-19 in Jharkhand. The health minister reviewed various aspects of the pandemic’s management, including reviewing the infection rate district-wise, expediting the vaccination drive and the availability of essential drugs and oxygen supply. The officials presented a roadmap on strengthening the healthcare services to stop the spread of black fungus cases. The officials’ preparedness to handle a possible third wave was also reviewed at the meeting. Speaking to TOI after the meeting, Gupta said, “I have reviewed the status of the ongoing vaccination drive and we want to expedite it in the rural areas on a priority basis.” He added, “Keeping the onset of a possible third wave in mind, we have planned for some major infrastructural changes in our paediatric care unit as we will require NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and SNCU (sick newborn care unit) in large numbers in case the third wave starts infecting kids (as predicted by some experts).” During the meeting, it was decided that state will require paediatric ICUs at CHCs, PHCs as well as at the district hospitals to treat the infected kids, if any. The government will consult the child specialists and paediatric hospitals to chalk out plans on a macro-level to treat the infected children. The government has also planned to keep ambulances, ventilators and mobile RT-PCR labs ready to test and track the infection among the kids. Meanwhile, asked about the government’s plans to tackle the shortage of health workers for treating Covid patients, Banna said they are planning to rope in the services of final-year MBBS students after providing them an initial training in the treatment protocols of Covid-19. On being asked about the three-day relaxation given by the state government during a lockdown, Banna, while taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said, “The Jharkhand government does like to surprise people by announcing ourr decisions at the eleventh hour. We gave the relaxations as there’ll be strict curbs on the movement of people from Sunday onwards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhands-preparedness-for-possible-third-wave-reviewed/articleshow/82666464.cms||Gaurav Pandey

District civil surgeon Dr B Mardi, who led the five-member team to inspect 111 Life Saving Nursing Home at Adityapur in adjoining Seraikela Kharsawan district said the proprietor of the healthcare centre did not produce any documents and did not allow to meet relatives of Covid patients treated there. Dr Mardi said, "We visited the nursing home with orders from health minister Banna Gupta after getting information that it charged exorbitant fees from Covid patients but it did not comply with the formalities." However, the proprietor Dr O P Anand told a TV channel, "The government spends crores for treatment of MLAs and ministers but wants the common man to avail Covid treatment at a meagre Rs 6,000. The minister is doing a big mistake by ordering an enquiry." He also taunted the inspecting team and said he would have chased and thrashed the members had there not been Covid patients undergoing treatment at his nursing home. Notably, nine Covid patients, including two on ventilators, were undergoing treatment at the nursing home when the team visited there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/private-nursing-home-prevents-govt-inspection/articleshow/82666409.cms||---

It’s the cities, especially the municipal corporation areas, that have witnessed a major decline in cases and deaths. On the other hand, rural areas are still reporting a high number of cases as well as deaths due to Covid-19. On Saturday, the region reported 6,931 new cases, its lowest count in a day since April 10. The day also saw 11,868 patients recovering from the disease.

Unlike the roads in Bangali Paja, the house is much spacious with six horses tied in the courtyard. “Would you be interested in buying one. We can negotiate the rates,” quickly asked Samrat Rambat at the entrance. He wants to sell three of the six horses he has. Samrat supplies horses for the bridegroom’s traditional mount during wedding processions (baraats). The lockdown-like restrictions has put the ghodewalas (horse suppliers) like Samrat in a fix. A number of them are keen or have already sold their animals as they are no longer able to incur expenses on the animals’ maintenance. Feeding a single horse takes anywhere between Rs300 to Rs500 a day, they say. The buyers are traders who can sustain for some months or amateur riders wanting to flaunt their new possession. In distress, the horsemen too are letting off the animals at a loss. “Reducing the horse’s diet is also an option which some may try but reluctantly,” said Balya Saoji, also a ghodewala. “Last year was bad, and this year is worse. The marriage season begins from March and lasts till June. With Covid leading to curbs on weddings, there have been no orders this year,” said Samrat. “Horses are the only means of livelihood but it’s difficult to even feed them these days,” he says hoping for a government dole for those like him. “If this continues some may just leave the horses on the roads,” he says. Amit Mahajan, who heads the Ghodewalas’ Associations, says, “There are over 250 horses engaged for wedding ceremonies in the city. Owners are in a helpless situation. The animals are tied to the stables and are being fed without any income.” Mahajan’s family has been in the business since a century. They started with horse carriages and then shifted to supplying horse for weddings when carriages became a passé. Even Mahajan has reduced one horse from his stable of six. “There wasn’t any business in the last year, except in November and December. Whatever we earned in those two months has been already exhausted by many. A number of horsemen have resorted to borrowing to meet their expenses,” he said. During weddings, horses are supplied for Rs 2,000 to 5,000 per function. The money earned during the wedding season is spent over the year, said the horsemen. No weddings this year has left them restless. The Bangali Panja has other horsemen too. Babloo Bhai says he sold the single horse he had over a fortnight ago. The horses are purchased from animal fairs. The famous ones are those from Saranghkheda in Maharashtra and Barananki in Uttar Pradesh. “My brother had bought it for Rs 80,000 from Barabanki. Part of the money was to be given after the wedding season.

Families of patients are running pillar to post to find intensive care facilities. Nearly 28,000 patients are currently occupying ICU and oxygen beds. During the first wave of the pandemic, this number was just around 9,000 at the peak. As of Friday evening, only 447 ICU beds are available out of a total 6,453 ICU beds in Covid-19 hospitals across the state. However, half of these vacant beds are in Kurnool. Districts such as Guntur, Krishna, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari are facing an acute shortage of ICU beds. Similarly, only 1,200 oxygen beds out of a total 23,200 are available as of Friday evening in Covid hospitals. Apart from hospitals, there are around 50,000 beds available in Covid care centres to treat patients with mild symptoms. The state health department has roped in 600 hospitals for Covid-19 treatment during the second wave against 261 hospitals in the first wave. In addition to the bed shortage, another issue hindering effective pandemic management is that people are directly landing up at hospitals instead of calling the 104 call centre, especially at the major state-run hospitals which are already packed to capacity. This has been leading to delays in hospital admission in some districts. Officials say that while patients can approach hospitals directly, managing resources would get much easier if people called the 104 helpline. Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary (health and family welfare), said that district collectors have been asked to motivate patients to join Covid care centres if there is no immediate availability of beds in hospitals. “Covid care centres are already equipped with oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and other equipment,” he said. Singhal added: “Andhra Pradesh has placed orders for 18,500 new oxygen concentrators and 10,000 D-type oxygen cylinders. As and when we receive them, we will send them to Covid care centres. This will reduce the gap between bed demand and supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/only-447-icu-1200-oxygen-beds-vacant-in-ap-hospitals/articleshow/82665601.cms||---

Since March, 2020, when the first case of Coronavirus was reported, 15,877 Covid patients were ferried in the 108 ambulances. As against this, 46,025 non-Covid patients were taken in these ambulances during the same period. “Among the other patients, majority were cases of non-heart related medical emergencies. These constituted 32% of the total non-Covid patients ferried in the ambulances called by dialling 108. This was followed by around 30% pregnant women and road accident cases have been in the range of 9% to 10%. Those suffering with heart troubles have been in the range of 1% to 2%,” said Dr Deepakkumar Ukey, in-charge of 108 service in Vidarbha. The same proportion has been maintained month by month, he added. The 108 service has 40 ambulances in Nagpur. Apart from these, there are over 300 ambulances belonging to private operators. Private ambulances were mainly engaged in ferrying Covid patients in March and April. Before that even these vehicles catered to non-Covid patients in substantial numbers, said sources among private operators. Even in March and April when Covid cases had touched a peak, the 108 ambulances have catered more to general patients, said Ukey. In March, 2021, 1,255 Covid patients were carried in the 108 ambulances as against over 5,500 non-Covid patients ferried in the month. The number slightly reduced in April, but was still higher than the Covid patients. The ambulances took 1,655 Covid patients during April when the infections were at a peak but non-Covid cases were still at 3,920, said Ukey. The trend continued in May, he said. So far, 197 Covid and 792 non-Covid patients have been served during the month, he added. As the number of Covid cases has ebbed in May, this has eased the pressure on ambulance operators. The number of calls on 108 has come down to 24 during May, it was over 40 in a day during April, said Ukey. As the cases have reduced, the availability of ambulances has also eased, he said. Private operators also agreed that there has been a sudden dip in the calls. Ravi Kanekar, president of Nagpur Ambulance Operators Association, said there is no work these days. “Earlier there used to be at least 6 to 7 calls each day. However, the ambulances attached to smaller hospitals are hardly getting any calls these days,” he said. Abhishekh Rana, who also caters ambulances to private hospitals, said the number of daily calls he is getting are the same at around 20. However, the turnaround time has reduced to 30 minutes against anywhere between 2 and 4 hours last month. “Earlier patients used to run from hospital to hospital in search of a bed. Now, its much easier,” he said. Rana said even today very critical patients find it difficult to get a bed and government hospitals like Mayo Hospital or GMCH are the last option. On the brighter side, the calls for bringing discharged patients home have increased, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/even-during-pandemic-108-served-more-non-covid-patients/articleshow/82669252.cms||Shishir Arya

Terming it as part of the BJP’s divisive policies, Amarinder said it was an attempt to incite communal hatred ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab. Earlier in the day, Yogi had tweeted, “Ideological and religious driven discrimination of any kind is against the basic spirit of the Constitution,” and added that creation of the district is testimony to the Congress policy of divisive politics. Contrasting the communal harmony in Punjab with the divisiveness promoted by the Yogi government in UP, Amarinder asked the former to stay out of his state’s affairs. “What does he know of Punjab’s ethos or the history of Malerkotla, whose relationship with Sikhism and its Gurus was known to every Punjabi? And what does he understand of the Indian Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled every day by his own government in UP?” asked Amarinder. The whole world knows about the BJP’s communally divisive policies, particularly of the government in UP, said Capt Amarinder. Pointing to the spate of changes in the names of various cities in UP, including of Mughal Sarai to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar, Allahabad as Prayagraj and Faizabad as Ayodhya, Captain Amarinder said it was an attempt to rewrite history, which the peace-loving people of India will never condone. Citing media reports, Amarinder said UP was the first state in the country to approve ‘love jihad’ laws and Yogi’s open hatred for Taj Mahal (which he sees as a legacy of the Mughals) has been the subject matter of criticism in the international press. In fact, the UP chief minister is reportedly the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organisation that was responsible for starting cow vigilantism, which led to the lynching of Muslims in his own state, the Punjab chief minister pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stay-out-of-punjabs-affairs-focus-on-your-people-in-up-captain-amarinder-singh-to-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/82672780.cms||---

The accused has been identified as Dr NS Raju, a medical officer working at G Konduru PHC. According to Satyanarayanapuram circle inspector V Bala Murali Krishna, police received a tip-off about the PHC doctor from local area corporator Sarvani Murthy and division 31 corporator Penumatsa Sirisha. Subsequently, police laid a trap and reportedly caught the doctor red-handed with five doses of Covaxin and six doses of Covishield in his possession. Police said that the accused doctor charged Rs 600–1,000 to administer the vaccines. Upon being interrogated, the doctor reportedly told the police that he used to pick up the vaccines from vaccination points. This is the first instance of vaccines entering the black market in Andhra Pradesh. Black marketing of oxygen cylinders and medicines used to treat Covid-19 has become prevalent in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/doctor-arrested-for-illegal-vaccination/articleshow/82665639.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

As weddings get cancelled, birthday parties go low-key and official events go online, the flower trade has lost much of its vibrance. Flower business owners say that they have never seen such slow business in their lives. “Business is not good these days. We are struggling to pay rent for the shop and hardly manage to sell 10 flower bouquets a day. We are selling the bouquets worth 250 for 150,” says Anil, a florist, whose major business comes from birthday parties, marriages and retirement parties. Anil is not the only one suffering. Floriculture farmers from Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and East Godavari used to export roses and lilies to Odisha and Telangana. Now, farmers say that demand has fallen drastically. The drop in demand has caused flower prices to plunge. The price of jasmine flowers has dropped from 300 a kilo to 150 a kilo. Even then, large quantities of flowers go to waste. “The bulk of our business comes from festivals, weddings and funerals. There were no public celebrations of festivals owing to the pandemic and weddings and funerals have become low-key affairs. Temples too are closed in parts of the state. We are dependent only on daily customers who buy small quantities of flowers for doing pooja at home,” said B Santhosh, a flower-seller. The Covid-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to industries involving perishable products and dependent on events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/aps-flower-trade-withers-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/82665688.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Nagpur||Dengue, malaria cases go down sharply in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Already diminishing for the last two of years, the prevalence of dengue has further gone down by half as compared to last year. So far, just six have tested positive for the vector-borne disease from the 30 samples recorded in the city between January and May 7. The highest number of 13 suspects was reported to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) malaria and filaria department in January. Of these, only two tested positive. No positive case was recorded in April, the peak of Covid, as well as so far in May. Also, no death took place this year from dengue while only one death was reported in June 2020. The development comes in the backdrop of National Dengue Day which falls on May 16. Last year, 107 patients had tested positive for dengue from among 643 suspects. Over 650 positive dengue cases were reported in 2019 and 565 in 2018. In both these years, the samples were over 4,000 to 5,000 and confirmed through ELISA testing. Also, malaria seems to have almost disappeared. Yet, the civic body has continued to perform aggressive testing. Between January to May 7, around 48,000 samples were collected but no patient tested positive. Last year, just five malaria cases were reported from 1.56 lakh tests. NMC officials said dengue cases intermittently kept surging and declining in the last one decade. “But this is the second consecutive year that the cases have gone down drastically,” they said. One of the reasons for less sample collection has also been attributed to surge in Covid cases. “Maximum hospitalization were for Covid cases this year. Earlier, people would get admitted for dengue,” they said. The lockdown and maintenance of clean surroundings too have played a major role, officials believed. “As people are mostly indoors, they are ensuring water contamination is not happening at home. Discarded items are being removed. People are keeping their coolers free of mosquito breeding. Our teams have surveyed different premises, but only a few were found to be hosting breeding spots,” they said. In 2018 and 2019, the NMC had slapped notices and recovered penalties from schools, hospitals and other commercial establishments after mosquito-breeding spots were found on their premises. Regarding malaria, the department officials said anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the parasite through bite, is believed to be eradicated from the city. “Malaria prevalence has already gone down in the last 10 years. But aedes aegypti, which causes dengue, are still present and citizens need to remain vigilant,” they said. NMC malaria and filaria officer Dipali Nasare appealed to citizens to follow guidelines issued by the civic body and prevent themselves fron the vector-borne diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-malaria-cases-go-down-sharply-in-city/articleshow/82669365.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The planned desalination plant is estimated to cost around 500 crore. The proposed plant would desalinate around 100 million litres of seawater per day. GVMC plans to sell the desalinated water at 60 per 1KLD (kilo litre per day). The civic body has identified a technically suitable location for the desalination plant at Appikonda area, which is close to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. A senior engineer with the GVMC said that after conducting a survey, the civic body found that Appikonda area is technically suitable for the plant. But the agency which gets tenders for plant construction will study the feasibility of other places as well. GVMC commissioner G Srijana said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wants to focus more on desalination of water to cater to industries and utilise the current water sources for drinking purposes. “We have already sent a report to the government and had a meeting on the issue recently. There would be no (additional) burden on GVMC. This plant will be useful for addressing the water scarcity issue in the city in future,” Srijana added. Once the government finalises the project, it will go for global tenders in the next four months. Construction is likely to be completed in less than three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-civic-body-to-set-up-desalination-plant/articleshow/82665748.cms||Siva G
---||Nagpur||BJP corporators fight over transport panel chief’s post||Nagpur: The BJP senior functionaries’ decision to ask NMC’s transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar to step down and replace party’s another corporator Jitendra Kukde has become a bone of contention between two corporators. While Borkar wants to continue on the post, the department’s legal opinion favours Kukde as he has already been nominated to the committee.BJP city president and MLC Pravin Datke said the differences between Borkar and Kukde have been resolved. But the ground reality seems to be different.A three-term corporator Borkar was nominated to the NMC’s transport committee in 2020 for two years. The row started after the BJP forced Borkar to resign as transport committee chairman early this year, citing his “inactive and poor” performance. The BJP was supposed to nominate Kukde as Borkar’s replacement. However, due to Covid-induced lockdown, the NMC could not conduct the election for the post though it nominated six corporators including Kukde on the transport committee. The six fresh corporators had to replace the members headed by Borkar, whose resignation from the panel was accepted by both -- the transport panel and the general body.On May 10, Borkar wrote to NMC’s municipal secretary Ranjana Lade drawing her attention to Maharashtra government’s notification which allowed continuation of the standing committee and subject committees’ chairman and members beyond the end of their tenure. The relaxation was meant for a month in abeyance of elections due to a spike in Covid cases, stated the notification issued by additional secretary Sachin Sahasrabuddhe on May 6.Borkar pointed out that as the NMC could not conduct the election to the transport panel chairman, it should allow him to continue as a committee chairman.Kukde too had held the post of transport committee chairman in the past. During his stint he cracked a whip against Aapli Bus conductors and drivers involved in pocketing bus fares. He had also helped in increasing revenue from city bus operation.Over Borkar’s letter, Lade had asked the transport department to seek legal opinion over the issue. Subsequently, the transport department sought legal opinion from lawyer AM Quazi. According to Quazi, in the situation prevailing with NMC, the election of six new members had already been held by the general body on March 25. It appears that the tenure of present chairman (Borkar) as a member of the transport committee is also complete and a new member in his place has already been appointed as per MMC Act. “In the present circumstances, this factual proposition is to be clarified by the government as to whether chairmanship to be continued in spite of the person ceasing to be the member of the transport committee,” Quazi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-corporators-fight-over-transport-panel-chiefs-post/articleshow/82669419.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

SBS members said that if authorities do not act against RFO Prabhudesai villagers from Caranzol, Kumthol and Bandirwada will hold a morcha in Valpoi town. Members Shivaji Zarmekar, Anatanio Pinto and Batu Gawade said that they are unhappy as no action has been taken by the police against the forest officer. The members alleged that on Wednesday, the RFO had assaulted Rukmini Gawade, 70, when she was busy doing domestic work. They alleged that police did not take any action even after Gawade’s statements were recorded by police against Prabhudesai. It may be recalled that on Wednesday Prabhudesai along with DCF Tejaswani and other forest officials had gone to inspect the felling of trees. The situation turned tense when the team arrived in Caranzol and started asking questions to an elderly woman and also tried to snatch her sickle. SBS member Shivaji Zarmeker said that villagers are repeatedly demanding land ownership rights for the people of Sattari taluka. “We are also demanding the exclusion of villages from wildlife sanctuary limits, but the government is neglecting our demands,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-forest-officer-or-well-protest-sattari-locals/articleshow/82669633.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Minor punishments to military personnel excluded from jurisdiction of AFT||CHANDIGARH: The principal bench of the armed forces tribunal (AFT) has held that minor punishments given to military personnel by the military authorities through summary trials are excluded from the jurisdiction of the AFT. This means that the grievances of the defence personnel against any minor punishments would not be covered as “service matter” for redressal before the AFT. The development is significant as several regional benches of the AFT have been entertaining every application filed by military personnel, including those against minor punishments. With this, any punishment other than dismissal or imposition of three-month imprisonment on military personnel cannot be subject to the jurisdiction of the AFT. A division bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon, chairperson and Lt Gen P M Hariz of the principal bench of AFT Delhi passed the orders while dismissing an application filed by Dfr Shatrughan Singh Tomar. The applicant, in this case, was enrolled in the Army on April 28, 1997, and said he had rendered 22 years of exceptional service. He was holding the rank of Havildar and according to him, he is due for promotion to the rank of ‘Naib Subedar’, having passed all the educational/technical qualifications, including the promotion cadre. SERVICE MATTERS ‘Punishment in question within exclusion clause’ It has been clearly laid down that punishments other than dismissal or imprisonment for more than three months imposed on the basis of a summary court-martial or summary disposal are not within the purview of the jurisdiction available to the Armed Forces Tribunal under Section 14 of the AFT Act… while interpreting a provision or statute affecting the jurisdiction of courts, their exclusions or inclusions, their extent should be understood in a manner as is explicitly expressed by the lawmaker and clearly implied from their intention,” observed the bench. Records indicated that the applicant was involved in some disciplinary matter and after a summary trial at the time, he was punished with ‘severe reprimand’ on account of the fact that he was found intoxicated while on duty and certain other allegations were levelled against him. The applicant had approached the principal bench of the AFT for quashing the punishment order dated September 23, 2019, vide which, on the basis of a summary trial held, punishment of ‘severe reprimand and a fine of seven-day pay’ had been imposed. The applicant wanted the punishment to be quashed and thereafter his case for promotion be considered. Strongly opposing the application, the military authorities argued that as the punishment in question falls within the ‘exclusion clause’ as contained in Section 3(o) of the AFT Act, the AFT has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The authorities also contended that any punishment other than dismissal or imposition of three-month imprisonment imposed cannot be subjected to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. The applicant’s counsel, however, emphasised that once in similar circumstances in all these cases, the punishment of ‘severe reprimand’ has been interfered with by various benches of the tribunal, primarily on merits, the objection now is unsustainable and is liable to be rejected. After hearing both the parties, the AFT principal bench held that the object of interpretation of the statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature communicating it and advance the cause of such intention. “The definition of ‘service matters’, if analysed in the backdrop of the principles of statutory provisions, would clearly show that in relation to persons subject to the Army Act, 1950; the Navy Act, 1957; and the Air Force Act, 1950; all matters relating to their conditions of service are brought within the purview of ‘service matters’… summary disposal and trials where the punishment of dismissal is awarded are specifically included in the definition of ‘service matters’, but all other punishments imposed after summary disposal or trials are excluded, from this cause,” held the AFT principal bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-minor-punishments-to-military-personnel-excluded-from-jurisdiction-of-aft/articleshow/82672826.cms||Ajay Sura

They were turned away from vaccination centres across the state on Saturday. They had no inkling of the change and the CoWin portal didn’t in any way reflect it. Arguments broke out at the vaccination centres as second dose vaccinations for 45+ was suspended in Madhya Pradesh. Those due for the second dose must now wait at least a month, or till June 20 to be precise. So far around 73 lakh doses of vaccines have been administered to those in the age group of 45+.

It shows a man, identified as Dalip from Ram Nagar locality in Jalandhar, carrying his daughter’s body on his shoulder for the last rites and his young son walking close behind.’ A video of the incident came out late on Friday night, five days after the incident took place. A quick inquiry ordered by Jalandhar deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori on Saturday revealed that the girl had never tested positive for Covid-19 and was in fact admitted to the surgical ward of Guru Nanak Hospital attached with Government Medical College, Amritsar. A certificate issued by the hospital for the purpose of transportation of the body also mentioned that she was diagnosed with SAIO (subacute intestinal obstruction). It stated that she was admitted there on May 7. Dalip, who is from Odisha, said he has been living in the same Jalandhar locality for the last 20 years. He said he got married here and had three children. He said that his daughter Sonu had been sick for the last two months. “I took her to Civil Hospital Jalandhar, from where she was sent to hospital in Amritsar. She was tested and treated for Covid-19 for a few days, but she died on May 9 evening. On the same night, I brought her body here in an ambulance after paying Rs 2,500. The next day, I prepared for her cremation and arranged three quintal wood,” he said. A video grab of the father and son going for the cremation of the girl Girl suffered from ‘acute gastroenteritis’: Report There are eight rooms in the compound where I live and all the other residents told me that none of them would help me carry the body for fear of contracting Covid-19. They also advised me to carry the body by myself, without even my son. They walked behind us at a distance to attend the cremation,” he said. Thori also issued a statement in the evening, saying that according to an inquiry conducted by the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) into the case, the cause of death was not Covid-19 as the girl had tested negative for the disease. The medical record at Civil Hospital Jalandhar also mentioned that the girl had ‘acute gastroenteritis’. Covid-19 patient tracking officer Navneet Kaur Bal said none from the victim’s family or anyone in the area had sought help in the cremation. Under normal cases (other than Covid-19 deaths), once the body is handed over to the family, they take care of the last rites, she said. “Cremation protocol is followed only in case of Covid-19 death. This case was different the as deceased was tested negative for Covid-19,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fear-shrouds-11-year-olds-non-covid-death-dad-carries-body-for-last-rites-in-jalandhar/articleshow/82672863.cms||IP Singh

At least three Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes across the coastal enclave, health officials said, and many were injured as the sounds of heavy bombardment roared through the night. Israelis dashed for bomb shelters as sirens warning of incoming rocket fire blared in Tel Aviv and its suburbs. Around 10 people were injured while running for shelters, medics said. At least 148 have been killed in Gaza since the violence began on Monday, including 41 children, health officials said. Israel has reported 10 dead, including two children. Envoys from the United States, United Nations and Egypt were working to restore calm but have yet to show any signs of progress. The U.N. Security Council was due to meet later on Sunday to discuss the worst outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian violence in years. Both Israel and Hamas have insisted they would continue their cross-border fire, a day after Israel destroyed a 12-storey building in Gaza City that had housed the U.S. Associated Press and Qatar-based Al Jazeera media operations. The Israel military said the al-Jala building was a legitimate military target, containing Hamas military offices, and that it had given warnings to civilians to get out of the building before the attack. The AP condemned the attack, and asked Israel to put forward evidence. "We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building," the news organisation said in a statement. In what it called a reprisal for Israel's destruction of the al-Jala building, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv and towns in southern Israel early on Sunday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Saturday that Israel was "still in the midst of this operation, it is still not over and this operation will continue as long as necessary." In a burst of air strikes early on Sunday, Israel targeted the home of Yehya Al-Sinwar, who since 2017 has headed the political and military wings of Hamas in Gaza, the group's TV station said. AL-AQSA Hamas began its rocket assault on Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city's Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Speaking to crowds of protesters in the Qatari capital of Doha, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said late on Saturday that the underlying cause of the hostilities was Jerusalem. "The Zionists thought ... they could demolish Al-Aqsa mosque. They thought they could displace our people in Sheikh Jarrah," said Haniyeh. "I say to Netanyahu: do not play with fire," he continued, amid cheers from the crowd. "The title of this battle today, the title of the war, and the title of the intifada, is Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem," using the Arabic word for 'uprising'. Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups have fired around 2,300 rockets from Gaza since Monday, the Israeli military said on Saturday. It said about 1,000 were intercepted by missile defences and 380 fell into the Gaza Strip. Israel has launched more than 1,000 air and artillery strikes into the densely populated coastal strip, saying they were aimed at Hamas and other militant targets. WAR CRIMES Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, told Reuters the court was "monitoring very closely" the latest escalation of hostilities, amid an investigation now under way into alleged war crimes in earlier bouts of the conflict. Netanyahu accused Hamas of "committing a double war crime" by targeting civilians, and using Palestinian civilians as "human shields." U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reminded "all sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs," U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Saturday. There has been a flurry of U.S. diplomacy in recent days to try to quell the violence. President Joe Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, arrived in Israel on Friday for talks. Biden spoke with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas late on Saturday, and updated them on U.S. diplomatic efforts, the White House said. But any mediation is complicated by the fact that the United States and most western powers do not talk to Hamas, which they regard as a terrorist organisation. And Abbas, whose power base is in the occupied West Bank, exerts little influence over Hamas in Gaza. In Israel, the conflict has been accompanied by violence amongst the country's mixed communities of Jews and Arabs, with synagogues attacked and Arab-owned shops vandalised. There has also been an upsurge in deadly clashes in the occupied West Bank. At least 12 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank since Friday, most of them during clashes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-bombs-hamas-gaza-chiefs-home-as-fighting-enters-seventh-day/articleshow/82672895.cms||---

The two deceased police officers were identified as ASI Bhagwan Singh of Jagraon and ASI Dalwinderjit Singh of Sarali in Tarn Taran. Their colleague Rajwinder Singh, a home guard, escaped unhurt. A team of Punjab Police crime investigating agency (CIA) had got an input that some liquor smugglers had sneaked in a consignment from outside. Miscreants fired four rounds at police team. Acting on the input, the CIA team reached Jagraon’s new grain market on Saturday evening and found a white i10 car and a red-coloured Canter parked there. As the CIA team insisted on checking the two vehicles, the occupants of the car, who numbered around four had a heated argument with the cops and fired at the team before escaping in the car along with the Canter. ASI Bhagwan Singh died on the spot and the other ASI died on way to the hospital. A trader in the grain market, who did not want to be identified, said he realized something was amiss when some youngsters playing cricket left their game midway and started running on hearing gunshots. On reaching the spot, they found that ASI Bhagwan Singh had already died and they arranged a vehicle to rush the other injured ASI to the nearest hospital. He added that the miscreants had fired four rounds at the police team. The CCTV footage retrieved by the police has recorded some details about the registration number of at least one of the two vehicles. Ludhiana (rural) SSP Charanjit Singh said a murder case had been registered against the unidentified accused in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/two-punjab-police-asis-shot-by-goons-in-jagraon/articleshow/82672894.cms||---

A police official said, “The inquiry has gone slow because of the pandemic. We will call people for the inquiry and based on the findings, an first information report will be filed in the case.” On September 15, 2020 a day before his retirement as Goa Lokayukta, justice (retd) PK Misra had directed the ACB to investigate the Covid relief scheme for BOCW and to file an FIR against those who siphoned off funds meant for labourers. Misra had also stated that if “politicians and high-ranking officials were found to be involved, the investigation should be handed over to CBI”. “An FIR shall be filed by the ACB against unknown persons for conspiracy to siphon out money from the Goa BOCW welfare fund...with a view to distributing largesse by staffing the beneficiary register of the fund with beneficiaries who are not BOCWs,” Misra’s order had stated. The Lokayukta had recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India look into the functioning of the labour welfare fund, specifically payments made to beneficiaries under Covid-19 schemes. The case follows a complaint by Goa Forward Party (GFP) which alleged that the state government had misused the scheme to channel funds to BJP functionaries including some sarpanchas and panchas. “If the fodder scam of Bihar was about non-existent livestock, the ‘labourgate’ in Goa is about non-existent labourers,” GFP president Vijai Sardesai,” had said. In November, 2020, chief minister Pramod Sawant had accepted the Lokayukta’s recommendations and directed ACB to register an FIR and conduct an inquiry into the labourgate scam||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acb-wants-labour-dept-to-provide-labourgate-files/articleshow/82669966.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Over 70% of snow leopard habitat unexplored: WWF||NAGPUR: A large majority of snow leopard habitat, spanning over 12 range countries, remains under-researched, and critical knowledge gaps must be plugged for informed snow leopard conservation, according to a WWF report. The report titled, ‘Over 100 years of snow leopard research - A spatially explicit review of the state of knowledge in the snow leopard range’ examines the current state of knowledge across their range. The report is based on an analysis of peer-reviewed published papers on the species and its habitat. It shows some glaring gaps in our knowledge of this elusive and threatened big cat, and highlights that lack of basic data could be hampering its conservation. “The snow leopard lives in rugged terrain – some of the harshest landscapes on the planet – so research poses significant logistical challenges. Serious efforts to learn more about the species began in the 1970s but the snow leopard’s remote and vast range and elusive nature, means that most of the habitat is still unexplored and we don’t have a full picture of the status of this magnificent wild cat,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, WWF Global Snow Leopard Lead, who is the lead author of the report. The WWF report points out that despite a major research focus on snow leopard population assessments, less than 3% of the big cat’s range has robust data on abundance. Though snow leopard research in the past few decades has been growing exponentially, there are only four research hotspots where multi-year research is being carried out. All the research efforts, spanning over a century, covered only 23% of the snow leopard habitat. Most of their vast range – possibly over 1.7 million sq km of rugged mountain terrain – has never been researched from a snow leopard context. Globally, there could be as few as 4,000 snow leopards left in Asia’s high mountains and this remaining population faces continued and emerging threats. Increased habitat loss and degradation, poaching, and conflict with communities have contributed to a decline in their numbers and left the species hanging by a thread in many places. The report also highlights that although conservationists are addressing several of the threats, a robust analysis of how effective the interventions are in achieving their objectives remains deficient. “Snow leopards are not just the emblems of Asia’s high mountains but are also critical to sustaining the landscapes they live in, which support water sources for over 2 billion people. The report will be a guide for the conservation community to diversify and prioritize areas of conservation research to preserve sufficient and suitable habitat for snow leopards and to ensure water security for the vast human populations downstream,” says Margaret Kinnaird, Lead Wildlife Practice, WWF International. As part of its conservation strategy, WWF supports vital research including the use of camera traps and satellite collaring, to collect more data on the elusive big cat. In recent years, there has been a growing global focus on national-level population assessments and several range countries, and NGOs, have come up with nationwide snow leopard numbers. “We need to build a more accurate picture of the status of snow leopard populations and establish baselines and indicators for both snow leopards and their prey species so that range states can better assess future changes and evaluate the impact of conservation actions. But more than anything else, we need a much better understanding of what the people sharing space with snow leopards think,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-70-of-snow-leopard-habitat-unexplored-wwf/articleshow/82705938.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The vaccines should have a shelf life of at least six months. The TNMSC, which procures medicines and equipment for government hospitals, has specified that winning bidders should complete delivery of the stock within 180 days of the purchase order. "Time is the essence in a pandemic. We want supplies to reach us early so we vaccinate maximum people at the earliest," said a senior official. The tender says that if the bidder is a vaccine manufacturer, the company should have delivered at least 200 million doses - 50 million in the last one year - to any of the countries. Bidders who are not manufacturers must have supplied at least 50 million doses -- 25 million doses in the last one year-anywhere in the world. The TNMSC reserved the right to split the order to more than one bidder depending on factors such as delivery schedule, and the right to purchase more than one vaccine at a differential price based on cost, efficacy and availability. The technical bids will be opened on June 5. "There are 3.65 crore people in the 18-44 age group. The aim is to cover 70 per cent of them. This means we will need 5 crore vaccines for 2.5 crore people. While 1.5 crore doses are being procured by Tamil Nadu through the Union government's allotment from the two Indian manufacturers, the remaining 3.5 crore doses are being tried through the global tender," a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-floats-global-tender-for-3-5-crore-doses-of-covid-vaccine/articleshow/82672903.cms||---

---||Goa||Mhadei sanctuary plundered of wealth, forest officials claim they are helpless||Keri: The lackadaisical attitude of state authorities towards forest officials in Sattari has resulted in degradation of the wildlife and rich forested areas. After the declaration of 208 sq km forest area as the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in 1999, it took almost a decade for the government to appoint a full-fledged range forest officer (RFO) and bring the area under the purview of north Goa wildlife division of the forest. More recently, on Wednesday, forest officials noticed illegal felling of trees in Kazredhat in Caranzol. When RFO Narayan Prarbhudessai started an inquiry, a group of the villagers blocked the vehicles of the forest department. Valpoi police officials then rushed to Kazredhat and allowed safe passage to the forest officials. The villagers as well as the forest officials filed counter-complaints. Speaking to TOI, Amrut Singh, a wildlifer from Bicholim said in Caranzol, huge tracts of forest have been cleared illegally. Whenever officials try to act against the accused, locals obstruct the investgation and level false charges against them. “Politicians’ interference has been affecting the morale of forest staff. For self-protection, officials have the right to fire in the air and take lawful action. The apathy of the government to act against the board that has been installed stating ‘no entry for forest officers’ has helped locals with vested interests to destroy forest inside the sanctuary,” he said. When contacted, chief wildlife warden of Goa forest, Santosh Kumar said, “Our officials have lodged a complaint against the accused. Taking law in one’s hand is not tolerable. We will take necessary action for restricting our staff while discharging their regular duties.” In 2009, when the incident of tiger killing came to light, RFO Parob investigated the matter and arrested the persons involved. In turn, allegations of harassment were leveled against him and he had to face a probe by the police department. In 2020, four tigers were killed in the Golaulim area and the officials investigating the incident had to face the wrath of locals. An association of the Dhangar community targeted the officials claiming harassment of the alleged accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mhadei-sanctuary-plundered-of-wealth-forest-officials-claim-they-are-helpless/articleshow/82670088.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Covid decline continues; deaths lowest in 36 days||LUCKNOW: The second wave of Covid-19 zoomed past the 1.5 lakh mark on Saturday in city, with 617 new cases in the past 24 hours. As many as 1,054 patients have also died in two months of the second wave that started rolling on March 15. About 1.3 lakh patients recovered in the same period. Times ViewThe curfew imposed by the state government coupled with the increasing number of people following safety protocol seems to have played a crucial role in the decline of Covid-19 cases in the past 15 days. The administration will have to ensure no overcrowding takes place anywhere as soon as the curfew is lifted, fully or partially. People will also have to understand that safety precautions are now the new normal, which will have to be taken till the sword of the pandemic is hanging over our heads.A comparison showed that the highly virulent second wave accounted for 65% of the total cases and 42% of the deaths in 14 months since the start of the pandemic in the city. However, the good sign was that both the cases and deaths registered a significant decline in the past 24 hours. On Friday, the new cases were 900, deaths 21 and recoveries 2,759. In comparison, 617 persons tested Covid-19 positive and 12 patients died on Saturday, while 2,371 people recovered. In fact, the infections and fatalities on Saturday were the lowest in 40 and 36 days, respectively. As recoveries have been higher than the new cases for the past three weeks, the number of active cases dropped to 12,474. Though most of the recoveries were of asymptomatic or mild symptomatic in home isolation, many serious patients in the hospitals have also been able to defeat the virus, easing pressure on the Covid facilities. Meanwhile, 12,997 people got vaccinated on Saturday at 89 government centres. These included 3,651 beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 who took their first jab. Among the 45-59 age group, 2,418 came to take their first shot and 3,564 the second. Similarly, 942 senior citizens (60 years and above) turned up for the first dose and 1,807 for the second. Some healthcare and frontline workers also took the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-decline-continues-deaths-lowest-in-36-days/articleshow/82672947.cms||---

While reviewing the preparations online, with field officers from across the state, including SPs, SSPs and DIGs, Sinha said, “The primary responsibility of implementing the rules is on police.” He added, “Police have to not only enhance its performance but also extend help to other departments in implementing the norms. Any doubt regarding orders should be clarified at the level of deputy commissioners.” The DGP said police should check e-passes of travellers on private vehicles while maintaining social distancing and protecting themselves with masks. Sinha said local police must initiate dialogue with panchayti raj representatives and the organisers to ensure observance of the government order at village haats and markets. He also pointed out that there is no restriction on movement of goods vehicles and there should be no hindrance in their movement. Similarly, there is no curb on interstate movement and any disruption in this regard would be taken seriously, he said. The field officers gave presentations on law and order, inter-state check posts and vehicle checking plan in their respective areas. Senior officers, including additional director general of police (operation) R K Mallick and inspector general (operation) Amol V Homkar were present in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ensure-strict-compliance-of-cov-rules-dgp/articleshow/82665952.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Bengal goes for 15-day blanket restrictions||KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Saturday announced severe restrictions on movement of people to dissuade them from stepping out of their homes in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections that has overwhelmed the healthcare sector. The shutdown will be in place from 6am on Sunday, May 16, to 6pm on Sunday, May 30. All offices, government and private, have been ordered shut while educational institutions will remain closed. Shops and markets will be open for only three hours in the morning between 7am and 10am but liquor shops will be completely shut during the 15 days. Other than flights and long-distance trains, virtually all other modes of transport — buses, local trains, Metro, private vehicles, cabs, autos and ferries — will be off. However, private cars, taxis and autos will be allowed to ferry patients to hospitals or passengers to stations and airports (see chart). The last time Bengal had witnessed similar restrictions was during the nationwide lockdown between March and June 2020. Earlier this month, the state government imposed curbs on local commute, stopped local train services, shut down malls and market complexes and restricted office attendance to 50% on May 5 as cases started rising sharply. Announcing the measures, chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the curbs would be strictly enforced. “These additional restrictions are aimed at cutting down mobility of people and limiting human contacts by prohibiting assembly and congregation to snap the transmission chain of the virus,” Bandyopadhyay said, adding that only emergency services would be allowed. Those who violate the stricter lockdown will be prosecuted under Disaster Management Act, 2005 and West Bengal Epidemic, Diseases and Covid Regulations, 2020 as well as Indian Penal Code, he said. Health experts welcomed the order and said this was necessary to bring down the active case count that was pushing the health infrastructure to the absolute brink. On Saturday, the active case count in Bengal stood at 1,31,948 with 19,511 new Covid cases. . The state also recorded the maximum Covid deaths on Saturday at 144. Among the districts, North 24 Parganas was the worst off with 4,279 cases and 35 deaths, followed by Kolkata with 3,951 cases and 30 deaths. South 24 Parganas, Hooghly, Howrah and Nadia clocked over 1,000 cases. Among the services that are exempt from curbs are fuel stations, banks and other financial institutions, medicine shops and optical stores as well as electricity, telecommunication and other essential services. Jewellery and saree shops have been allowed to remain open between noon and 3pm while shops selling sweets will be allowed to operate between 10 am and 5pm. Bandyopadhyay later announced the postponement of Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations that were scheduled in June. All industrial and manufacturing units, except continuous process industries and those relating to emergency services, supplies of medical necessities, food commodities, beverages, will remain closed till 6 pm Sunday, May 30. The tea garden and jute mills, both of which are ailing, can operate with 50% and 30% workforces respectively. Marriage and funeral will remain low-keyed affairs during the pandemic, with 50 guests for marriage and 20 persons to attend a funeral The veterinary and pet care services can continue as per their schedules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-goes-for-15-day-blanket-restrictions/articleshow/82669616.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||12 years and several stumbling blocks later, E-W Metro tunnelling work is complete||KOLKATA: The tunnelling work of East-West Metro was completed on Saturday evening, a day ahead of the scheduled ‘breakthrough’ as engineers revved up the tunnel boring machine to reach the landmark before restrictions kicked in on Sunday. Among the most ambitious Metro projects in the country, the Rs 8,576-crore East-West Metro links the twin cities of Kolkata and Howrah through a tunnel that runs below the Hooghly riverbed. While the tunnelling was scheduled to be completed months earlier, an accident in August 2019 that led to house collapses in Bowbazar delayed the project. On Saturday afternoon, TBM Urvi covered the final 10 metres to pierce the diaphragm wall to complete the Howrah-bound tunnel. Last October, it had completed the Kolkata-bound tunnel and then turned around to complete the 800 metres to the cave-in zone where TBM Chandi had stalled after hitting an aquifer leading to subsidence. Last year, a shaft was built to extricate Chandi so that Urvi could complete the tunnel. Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of the 16km East-West Metro corridor project had originally scheduled to cross the final barrier on Sunday afternoon. The East-West Metro project has crossed several milestones along its journey. The most significant was on May 23, when TBM Rachna completed the tunnelling under the Hooghly in 36 days. Sibling TBM Prerna followed and finished the other river tunnel on June 21, 2017. But it was the last lap of tunnelling that proved the most challenging as the TBMs bored under a congested neighbourhood with crumbling buildings and met with an accident. Ironically, it was over the alignment of the same section that the project was delayed for several years in its infancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/12-yrs-and-several-stumbling-blocks-later-e-w-metro-tunnelling-work-is-complete/articleshow/82669754.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Ranchi||Two hospitals with 90 oxygen supported beds to come up in East Singhbhum||JAMSHEDPUR: Two temporary hospitals with a combined capacity of more than 90 oxygen-supported beds to treat Covid-19 patients will come up in the district soon amid the surge in cases. Work for setting up the two hospitals, which will be run by Tata Steel, is almost over and will come up at the buildings of Employees Training Centre and Ramgarhia Sabha in Sakchi area, officials said. The liquid oxygen plant located some 500 meters away from the two hospital buildings with supply the gas through a pipeline. Tata Steel advisor (medical services) Ranjan Chaudhry said, "A dedicated pipeline from the oxygen plant to the two hospitals has been laid so that every bed is connected." He said the hospital at the employee training centre building will have 40 beds while the other will have 50 plus beds. "Making the two non-medical buildings ready to function as hospitals is a difficult job as it is not just about installing oxygen supply and beds. To make them operational, there has to be a robust system to take care of every small detail," Chaudhry said. He further said the steel major will utilise the manpower of the Tata Main Hospital (TMH) to run the two temporary hospitals. Chaudhry also said considering the number of Covid-19 cases in the district and despite the availability of about 1,200 beds across 20 hospitals, there is a need to scout for infrastructure and convert them into medical facilities. Meanwhile, the positivity rate in the district stood at 32.17% in the past two weeks while it was 48.89% earlier. There is also a marginal decline in the number of new patients admitted to TMH daily. Experts said that these figures could be indicators that the second wave of the pandemic has crossed its peak. However, a senior medical practitioner and Indian Medical Association Jamshedpur chapter secretary Dr Mrityunjay Singh said, "The number of active cases numbers is continuously increasing in the district and we are also expecting a third wave. Hence, there is a need to augment the existing medical care facilities." As of Friday, the district has 5,367 active cases with 901 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-hosps-with-90-o2-supported-beds-to-come-up-in-e-sbhum/articleshow/82665922.cms||---

Police have identified the victims as Bharatpur residents Ram Chandra Bhoumik (40), wife Shankari and their daughters Rani (12), Saraswati (7) and Parna (4). The trigger behind the tragedy is yet to be ascertained, but financial hardship caused by Covid lockdown is not being ruled out. Preliminary investigation shows Ram was finding it difficult to make ends meet amid the partial lockdown. Rani, who succumbed to burns at Raiganj Medical College and Hospital on Saturday morning, reportedly told those attending to her that her father poured fuel on them around Friday midnight and set the room on fire. By the time neighbours doused the flames, all except Rani were dead. Senior police and administrative officers, including the SP and BDO, have inspected the site. SP Sumit Kumar said: “The bodies have been sent for post-mortem. An inquiry is on.” District magistrate Arabind Kumar Meena said: “It is a very unfortunate incident. Primary probe indicates a suicide case. The family was receiving benefits from the government. We are yet to know the exact reason behind all this.” Brother Surendra Bhoumik said they had met on Friday and he didn’t notice anything unusual in Ram’s behaviour. Villagers, however, claimed that poverty led to the incident. They said Ram had also taken a bank loan, which he was finding hard to pay back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/couple-3-kids-charred-to-death-in-north-dinajpur/articleshow/82667863.cms||Subhro Maitra

District health officials said they have issued directives to doctors to give special attention to diabetic Covid patients who are more prone to the disease. Similar guidelines have been given by the management of Bokaro General Hospital (BGH). Even doctors at the Eye Hospital have been asked to remain cautious. Civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, “A 32-year-old woman resident of Chandrapura was immediately referred to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in Ranchi for treatment while an elderly resident of Bermo couldn’t survive.” Pathak added, “We have asked doctors to keep a watch on Covid-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes, weakening of immune system due to use of steroids, prolonged ICU/hospital stay, co-morbidities, post organ transplant, cancer and voriconazole therapy (used to treat serious fungal infections).” BGH, a dedicated Covid hospital, reported another death of a 68-year-old woman with black fungus (cutaneous) a few days back. The woman was diabetic and had recovered from Covid but got admitted after showing symptoms of the infection. By the time the doctors could diagnose, she died. The suspected case of black fungus has been found at BGH after in a 72-year-old diabetic male patient. He is currently under treatment. Executive director of BGH A K Singh said, “Mucormycosis begins to manifest as a skin infection in the air pockets located behind our forehead, nose, cheekbones and between the eyes and teeth. It then spreads to the eyes, lungs and can even spread to the brain. It leads to blackening or discoloration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood.” Prominent ophthalmologist Dr Ambrish Soni said a male patient from Kathara of Bermo with symptoms of black fungus died a week ago before the treatment could be started. “Controlling diabetes is one of the foremost preventive methods suggested by ICMR. Hence, Covid patients who are diabetic need to take utmost care,” said Dr Soni. The Indian Council of Medical Research has advised not all cases of blocked nose should be considered as cases of bacterial sinusitis, particularly during/after the treatment of patients. One must seek medical help for detecting fungal infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/black-fungus-keeps-bokaro-on-toes-diabetic-cov-patients-kept-under-scanner/articleshow/82665841.cms||Divy Khare

The petitioner, identified as Rajan Kumar Singh, said that the e-pass system is complicated and requires too much information of the applicant which, according to him, is unnecessary. “With the kind of information being sought by the government, there are ample chances of a breach of privacy of the applicant,” Singh said. Citing an example, Singh, in his petition, mentioned that if a person needs to come out of his/her house to even buy milk, he/she will have to obtain an e-pass from the government. Without the e-pass, the applicant will be questioned by the police and punitive action will be initiated. Moreover, those without smartphones cannot apply for the e-pass. “The application process can only be completed with the help of a smartphone, which is acts as a hindrance in the issuance of the e-pass,” Singh’s counsel Anup Agarwal said. Agarwal added that a special mention has been done before the court to list the case for urgent hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pil-before-hc-to-challenge-issuance-of-e-pass/articleshow/82665895.cms||---

Speaking on the issue, Chatra DC Divyanshu Jha said, “Besides ascertaining the cause of deaths and taking action accordingly, the health workers will look for suspected cases of Covid-19 and carry out an awareness drive during the camps to prevent the spread of the virus, if any.” He added, “The workers have been instructed to follow the guidelines laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research, which included measuring the oxygen level of all sick persons. If anyone is found with oxygen levels below normal, he or she will be immediately taken to a dedicated Covid care centre or to the Covid care ward in the district.” Jha said the move will help in taking up a better action plan to minimise the number of deaths and provide timely treatment to those who are sick. The DC has roped in the sahiyas (health workers) also to check oxygen level of the suspected cases of Covid-19 through a door-to-door campaign. He has named senior officials, including deputy development commissioner, additional collector and sub-divisional officers of Tandwa and Simaria, district land acquisition officer, district agriculture officer, district supply officer, incident commanders and others, to monitor the campaign closely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nearly-300-deaths-reported-in-chatra-villages-admin-launches-health-camps-to-find-cause/articleshow/82665852.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar meets Nandigram ‘victims’, TMC says bid to disrupt peace||NANDIGRAM: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who toured violence-hit villages in Nandigram-I on Saturday, said the Mamata Banerjee government needed to address without delay the issue of post-poll atrocities. Trinamool Congress responded by saying that the governor was unable to “tolerate” the CM’s ability to lead a battle against Covid and was trying to “disturb peace and destabilise the situation”. Dhankhar landed on a temporary helipad in Haripur at 9.45am and headed to Dakshin Kendamari, Bankim More, Chillagram and Nandigram Town Club, where he heard out “victim families” and took note of property damage. Narrating their woes, women reportedly said male family members had fled homes on May 2 — the day assembly election results were announced — and were yet to return. BJP legislative party leader Suvendu Adhikari met the governor at the Haripur helipad, but didn’t accompany him to the villages. “Why is the CM not hearing out victims of violence now?” Dhankhar said, pointing out how strongly Banerjee had reacted to the April 10 Sitalkuchi firing during the fourth phase of polling. “The CM had called it (Sitalkuchi incident) a genocide and cold-blooded murder. She suspended the SP (of Cooch Behar) after the elections and announced compensation for bereaved families. But, she is silent on post-poll violence,” he said, adding that the state administration should wage a two-pronged battle against Covid and atrocities that took place after the elections. Kalyan Banerjee, Trinamool’s Lok Sabha chief whip, said: “I challenge the governor to give in writing at least one of his allegations. He is merely there (Nandigram) to destabilise the situation and disturb peace. He is creating a narrative. The CM is leading a big battle against Covid. She is leading from the front. He is unable to tolerate that.” Unlike his Sitalkuchi tour, Dhankhar was neither greeted with black flags on Saturday nor was he heckled by Trinamool supporters. “The fact is we are not giving any importance to the governor’s visit,” said TMC leader Sheikh Sufian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-meets-nandi-victims-tmc-says-bid-to-disrupt-peace/articleshow/82667836.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Positivity rate up, mortality rate down in Covid second wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh witnessed its first 50 Covid-related deaths on May 17 last year when the state’s cumulative case tally touched the 2,380 mark with a fatality rate of over 2%. At the peak of the pandemic in August-September 2020, the mortality rate had stabilised to around 0.9%. It further dropped to 0.8% when the curve flattened to its lowest levels on February 15 with only some 30 new cases. During the peak, the case positivity rate had shot up to as high as 17% in August last year before dipping to 0.2% in February. Three months have gone by since then and the state has added about 5 lakh cases. During the same time, AP also witnessed 2,010 deaths with a mortality rate of 0.4%, reflecting a dramatic fall. Now, the overall fatality rate of the state stands at 0.66%, against the national average of 1.09%. Timely detection and appropriate clinical management are the crucial factors that have helped keep the death rates in check, say experts. After a few weeks into the outbreak in AP last year, hypoxia-related complications took centre stage. Consequently, the state added oxygen lines to nearly 28,000 beds, apart from increased monitoring of patients’ oxygen saturation levels. But the state never drew more than 260 metric tonnes of oxygen on any given day during the first wave. The daily supply has surpassed the 590-MT mark in the last few days. Experts attribute the reduced mortality rates in AP to improved medical management over the last one year or the virus becoming less virulent. They also point to the fact that nearly 50% of total cases reported this time are among people aged below 40 years. It is generally believed that the novel coronavirus disease does not progress into severe form in the youth. However, the number of young people requiring intensive care has increased in the second wave compared to the first one. In fact, several young people succumbed to the pandemic in recent months in the state. Principal secretary (health & family welfare department) Anil Kumar Singhal said AP is one of the best performing states in terms of keeping the mortality rate under control. “Only two-three states have a better mortality rate than AP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-positivity-rate-up-mortality-rate-down-in-covid-second-wave/articleshow/82672973.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

However, security amount of D type cylinders (above 40 litre) will remain same at Rs 25,000. On the first day of the facility started with the assistance of National Informatics Centre (NIC), 11 people were issued e-permit for oxygen cylinder. At the same time, the UT administration held a review meeting related to oxygen supply in government and private hospitals in the city. The recent death of 26 Covid-19 patients in Goa allegedly due to shortage of medical oxygen was also discussed. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supply in Chandigarh. Officials submitted that in Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, apart from the oxygen generated by the recently installed PSA plant, the daily consumption of liquid oxygen is more than 10 metric tonne (MT). Presently, there are 130 D type cylinders and arrangements are being done to make it 200 D type cylinders. Similarly, in the Sector 48 hospital, apart from PSA plat, the daily oxygen consumption is around 3 MT per day. Presently, there are 218 D type cylinders, which will be reduced to about 150 cylinders after shifting them to GMCH. Likewise, in Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, apart from the oxygen generated from PSA plant, the daily oxygen consumption is around 3 MT. Presently, there are 100 D type cylinders as 60 cylinders were shifted to recently started Army hospital at Panjab University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-slashes-security-for-oxygen-cylinders-from-rs-25000-to-rs-10000/articleshow/82673021.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The MP showed his swollen foot to the VI additional junior civil judge court in Mangalagiri before whom he was presented on Saturday. The MP’s lawyer moved a petition alleging that Krishnam Raju was beaten on his legs while he was in custody. The MP was arrested from his residence in Hyderabad on Friday and brought to the CID office in Mangalagiri for interrogation. The judge, who initially rejected the remand report filed by the CID, referred the MP to a corporate hospital for treatment. This is perhaps the first incident involving a VIP in recent times that the court has rejected the remand report submitted by the police. Later, the judge accepted the revised report and sent the MP to hospital for treatment. He will be in judicial remand till May 28. After full recovery, the MP will be sent to jail. In her order to the CID, the judge, K Aruna, referred to the complaint of Raju that prior to his going to sleep at the CID office on Friday night, around five persons covering their faces with handkerchiefs entered the room at around 11 pm. “They then tied his legs with rope, among them one person beat him with a stick and second person beat him with a hard rubber stick on feet,” the judge narrated Raju’s claim in the order. After which, Raju was asked to walk on the floor and then they again thrashed his soles around four to five times. This time when Raju was unable to walk, they went away. After observing Raju’s foot, the judge ordered the superintendent of Guntur GGH and Ramesh Hospital to examine his injuries in presence of his Y category security. The court also asked the medical officers examining the injury to make a record of the injuries or marks of violence and ascertain as to what time they were inflicted. Earlier, the AP high court dismissed the MP’s petition seeking bail and directed him to approach the CID court for bail. The MP once again moved the high court on Saturday night seeking protection and stating that he feared for his life. He also alleged that CID officials had physically abused him. A division bench of AP high court heard the petition. The counsel representing Krishnam Raju claimed before the magistrate court that there were injuries on the MP’s body. His lawyer Gopinath also said that the police had prevented them from going to court. He said the situation was such that police permission had to be sought to go to court. In its FIR against the MP, the CID stated that they had taken suo motu action based on an inquiry report submitted by a DIG-rank officer. The report accused Krishnam Raju of making ‘hate speeches’ on various media and social media channels. The FIR also mentions that two vernacular TV channels were booked for airing the speech of the MP. The report summarises that Raju did not just restrict to fair criticism of the government but made ‘every attempt’ to create hatred and contempt disaffection towards the government. “Not only has he done this through his words, but also used visual gestures of face and hands to provoke his followers to take up violence,” the FIR stated. Raju is also accused of particularly targeting a caste and a community and trying to stoke hatred against them by portraying the government of being favourable towards them. Raju was arrested from his residence in Gachibowli, Hyderabad, on Friday afternoon while he was celebrating his birthday with his immediate family members. He was then brought to the CID headquarters in Mangalagiri where the medical examination took place. CID officials booked Raju under Sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 505 (incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence) r/w 120B (criminal conspiracy) IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rebel-ysrc-mp-accuses-andhra-pradesh-cops-of-custodial-torture/articleshow/82673148.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The incident has raised the ire of the patient’s kin, who want the authorities to initiate action against hospital staff for their apathy Sources said 42-year-old M N V Subramanyam, who tested positive for Covid-19 and was on home isolation, was admitted to Vijayawada GGH on May 12 after his condition deteriorated. He was allocated a bed in the ICU, but died a few hours later, following which hospital staff shifted his body to the mortuary. They, however, failed to inform the death to the hospital authorities or the victim’s family. When the family members called the hospital to enquire about Subramanyam’s health, the staff manning the help-desk told them that the patient was stable and would recover soon. When relatives found Subramanyam’s mobile phone switched off after May 13, they rushed to the hospital where the staff found another patient undergoing treatment in the bed allocated to Subramanyam. A search was initiated and his body was found in the mortuary, after which his relatives were informed. Tension prevailed for some time at the hospital as Subramanyam’s relatives staged a protest demanding action against the doctors and staff at the GGH for their apathy.

Earlier, his bail application was rejected by the AP high court. The bail plea is likely to come for hearing on Sunday. Earlier, after his bail petition was rejected by the HC, Raju filed another application before the court seeking protection, stating that he feared threat to his life. B Adinarayana, the MP’s counsel, wrote to the high court stating that Raju was beaten up by CID sleuths while in custody, following which the HC constituted a division bench comprising Justice Chagara Praveen Kumar and Justice Lalitha Kanneganti to hear the matter. Raju’s counsel also sought appointment of a medical board headed by Guntur GGH superintendent and other expert doctors to examine the nature of injuries. He submitted to the court that Raju is a sitting MP with ‘Y’ category security and the police didn’t permit CRPF personnel into the CID police station. He urged the court to permit security personnel at the hospital. The court passed orders constituting a medical board with three doctors as immediate relief and gave directions to provide necessary treatment to the MP. The bench also directed that the entire examination should be videographed and handed over to the district sessions judge in Guntur. It, however, refused to allow CRPF security in the hospital and asked state police to provide security. In the morning, the single judge bench of the high court had dismissed the bail petition.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu adds 33,658 fresh cases, deaths touch 303||CHENNAI: Active cases made a swift climb to 2.07 lakh in Tamil Nadu on Saturday, when the state reported 33,658 new cases and 303 deaths. Meanwhile, the state discharged 20,905 people, taking the recovery rate to 86% and the cumulative case fatality rate to 1.1%. So far, 17,359 people have died of the viral infection in the state. Discharges down, active cases up: The additional measures put in by the state to stop premature removal of patients from the active cases registry brought down discharges and has led to a steady increase in active cases across all districts in the state. Since May 11, the daily discharges have declined from around 21,500 to 20,400. And during the same period, the active cases increased by 45,000 - at least 10,000 a day - to 2.07 lakh on Saturday. In the past five days, the state has added at least 1.55 lakh fresh cases. Nevertheless, public officials say the list is still not completely updated. "Now, we ensure that most patients discharged from the registry have completed at least 14 days of isolation. We are still in the process of updating the registry," said a senior official. For instance, in the past ten days, the state added at least 2.92 lakh cases. "We don't have that many people on the active cases registry," the official said. Fresh case count continues to spiral: While the state added 33,658 new cases compared to 31,892 cases it reported on Friday, Chennai, which was reporting a declining trend for two days, showed a marginal uptick on Saturday. The city reported 6,640 new cases compared to 6,538 cases on Friday. While hotpot Chennai topped the fresh cases list, Perambalur had 178 new cases - the lowest in TN - compared to 140 cases the district recorded on Friday. Barring Perambalur, all other districts in the state reported more than 200 cases each. After Perambalur, Sivaganga reported the least new cases (249). Deaths make a steady climb: At least 33 of 37 districts in the state reported deaths on Saturday. Chennai reported 82 deaths followed by 24 in Chengalpet and 22 in Tiruvallur. With 10 deaths in Kancheepuram, the Chennai region reported 138 deaths. There were 20 deaths in Coimbatore, 18 in Kanyakumari, 17 in Madurai, 12 in Salem and 11 each in Trichy and Thanjavur. Vellore also reported 10 deaths. Dip in vaccination: The number of people taking the vaccine has dropped over the past two days amid intense lockdown, though the recipient tally increased to 62,352 on Saturday from 52,730 on Friday. In the 111 days since vaccination began, the state has administered 68,78,742 doses of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-adds-33658-fresh-cases-deaths-touch-303/articleshow/82673268.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Treating, tracking people in home isolation prove to be a challenge||CHENNAI: The state's new Covid-19 management protocol bars admission of people with oxygen saturation above 94%, but all home isolation patients, particularly the elderly, pregnant women and those with comorbid conditions, will have to be monitored by caregivers and public health staff daily for at least two weeks, say experts. At least 60% of 1.95 lakh active cases on Friday were in home isolation. "Patients in home isolation should be asked to record their temperature and oxygen saturation level at least three times a day and raise red flags when fever persists for more than five days or when the SpO2 levels drop below 90%," said former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. "But for this, the state has to ramp up the workforce and digitise monitoring," he said. Infectious diseases experts say there is an increasing concern over reinfection and relapse of Covid-19. " In cities such as Chennai, Greater Chennai Corporation does video consultations and inquires patients about their health over phone. But the biggest problem in home isolation is that many people - particularly the young patients or high-risk contacts - leave their homes violating quarantine rules. "Evidence for this is the case clusters within a family, an apartment complex and gated communities. We see this even in villages and small towns," said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan. "We have now directed civic authorities and local bodies to cancel home isolation and shift people violating quarantine rules to Covid care centres," he said. Organisations such as WHO and CDC recommend monitoring and isolation for 14 days because evidence shows that severe disease occurs even in the second week. "These people can still infect others," said infectious disease expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan. Public health department did not have data on the number of home isolations they cancelled following violations. But officials in the Covid control room said they have not been able to closely track movements of people in home isolation. The state tried using apps and information from mobile towers to track movement of positive people. "None of those were successful. The best way to keep track is to restrict home quarantine as much as possible," he said. Sometimes, people step out to the local grocery or drug store. Nobody in the neighbourhood will know they're infected because there are no posters or warning signs outside homes of people who are tested positive. "There was huge resistance when they (GCC officials) did it last year. Now I know its value," said S Kavya, who works for a private bank. "Two weeks ago, when my husband tested positive, a health worker from GCC came home to give us basic instructions. That's when we learned that there were patients in at least six houses in my apartment. We were using common areas including the lift freely," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-treating-tracking-people-in-home-isolation-prove-to-be-a-challenge/articleshow/82673302.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mango farmers fear cyclone Tauktae may cause serious losses||SURAT/RAJKOT: There are many who look forward to the scorching months just to take a bite of the quintessential summer fruit, Mango. But cyclone Tauktae apart from threatening widespread destruction may also hit the mango yield, its quantity as well as quality. The harvesting season of mangoes in the state has just begun. But the low pressure area created by cyclone Tauktae and its likely landfall in Saurashtra that can cause heavy winds and rainfall has the mango growers of the region worried. Farmers in south Gujarat are yet to pluck 75% of mango crop and they are already worried about the changing climate. Farmers say that if it just rains, there will not be much harm, but if it rains heavily with strong winds, there will be huge damage to the crop. Agricultural scientists have already forewarned the farmers. “We have issued advisory to the farmers to pluck as many mangoes as they can and sell them. If the cyclone results in strong winds then both the ripe as well as unripe mangoes will get hit,” said Dr C K Timbadiya, senior scientist and head of Krushi Vigyan Kendra of Navsari Agricultural University. “The major harvest begins after Akshaya Tritiya which was celebrated on Friday. But since the markets were also closed because of Eid and the weekend, farmers were going to start plucking over the weekend and next week,” said Vinod Desai, a farmer in Valsad who owns 5,000 mango trees. After Akshaya Tritiya, retail markets are flooded with mangoes which bring down the prices of fruit. However, farmers are worried that if the crop is damaged, they will not get a good price and the mango lovers will end up paying more. “Nobody prefers to buy mangoes that fall of the tree due to strong winds because they get damaged. So, we will not get good price. Also, since there will not be enough stock in the retail market, the vendors will increase the prices for end customer,” said Suresh Patel, a farmer from Navsari. Currently, Alphonso is sold in the price range of Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,800 per 20 kg, Kesar for Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 while Rajapuri for Rs 900 per 20 kg in the retail market of Surat. Usually, as the supply increases after May 20 the prices drop by Rs 200-Rs 300 per 20 kg depending on the quality of the fruit. The situation is no different in Saurashtra which is popular for its Kesar variety mangoes. There too farmers have not been able to harvest the crop due to changes in the weather over the last 20 days. Farmers already fear 40% loss in production due to unseasonal rain. The cloudy atmosphere and rains have caused damage to the crop, and it also didn’t allow fruits to mature. D K Varu head of department of fruit science in Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU) said that climate plays an important role in ripening of mangoes. “An ideal climate would a temperature of around 40 degrees Celsius with little or no humidity. But in last two weeks the humidity level remained high so the mangos did not ripen and farmers could not pluck them,” Varu said. According to farmers 70 to 80% crop is yet to be harvested and if the cyclone hits the state, it will cause huge damage. The Kesar variety of mango is cultivated in 25,000 hectares of Gir Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli and Bhavnagar districts and the average annual crop production is around 2.50 lakh tons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-mango-farmers-fear-cyclone-tauktae-may-cause-serious-losses/articleshow/82673287.cms||Jay Pachchigar
