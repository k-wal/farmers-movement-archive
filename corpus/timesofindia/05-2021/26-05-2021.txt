Violence erupted near Tahrir Square in the early evening following a largely peaceful demonstration. Iraqi security forces fired tear gas and live rounds to disperse the crowds and demonstrators hurled stones at riot police, witnesses and Iraqi security officials said.  One protester was shot and died in a hospital and over a dozen were injured, a security official and the semi-official High Commission for Human Rights said.  The security officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.  The shooting began after security forces first used tear gas to disperse the crowds. The demonstrators responded by throwing stones, and on some occasions bricks at police, according to an Associated Press videographer on the scene.  Earlier, demonstrators gathered in the square amid heavy security, among them protesters from southern provinces including Dhi Qar and Karbala. Tensions there have mounted in recent weeks over the increasingly frequent targeted killings.  "Today's protests took place because the weak government did not keep its promises to bring the murderers to justice," said activist Kamal Jaban at Tahrir Square.  Many waved Iraqi flags and raised portraits of Ehab Wazni, a prominent activist assassinated in Karbala, among three targeted killings this month alone. Protesters had given the government two weeks to hold his killers responsible.  "The government did not deliver, we had to march," said Jaban.  The High Commission for Human Rights reported nearly 35 activists have been killed in Iraq since an anti-government protest movement swept Iraq in October 2019. There have been nearly 82 attempted killings since them.  In the last year alone, 15 Iraqis were killed and there were 30 attempted killings recorded by the commission, said spokesman Ali al-Bayati.  Protesters expressed outrage that despite launching several investigations into the killings, Iraqi authorities have not named any perpetrators. They widely believe the killers to be linked to Iran-backed militia groups and that the government is powerless and unwilling to identify them.  "Impunity comes from the failure of state institutions to bring the perpetrators to account," said al-Bayati. "This gives them the green light to continue."  Many expect the killings to continue as Iraq plans to hold early elections in October, which had been a key demand of anti-government protesters.  Now, some of those same protesters are calling for the elections to be canceled as the death toll from targeted killings rises, saying they have no faith in the current system.  "We will not delay the elections if we get fair and safe chances to participate in them," said Jaban. "We will boycott the elections unless there are positive changes."  A recent Human Rights Watch report raised concerns that without justice the killings could prevent Iraqis from participating in the election.  "If the authorities are not able to take urgent steps to stop these extrajudicial killings the palpable climate of fear they have created will severely limit the ability of Iraqis who have been calling for change to participate in the upcoming parliamentary elections," wrote senior researcher Belkis Wille.  Heavy security deployments were seen in central Baghdad ahead of the Tuesday protest.  Iraqi security forces arrested four "infiltrators" near Tahrir Square in the morning, according to an Iraqi military statement. The individuals were reportedly carrying weapons and sought to incite violence.  Tens of thousands of protesters, most of them Iraqi youth, took to the streets in October 2019 to decry corruption, poor services and unemployment. Demonstrators camped out in Tahrir Square for months.  But the movement petered out by February last year owing to the government's heavy handed response and the coronavirus pandemic. Over 500 people died because security forces used live ammunition and tear canisters to disperse crowds.  Though protests have waned, targeted assassinations against civil society groups and outspoken activists continue to create a climate of fear. Many activists have left Baghdad to seek refuge in the Kurdish-controlled northern region, or sought asylum in Turkey.  ___  Associated Press writer Murtada Faraj in Baghdad contributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/one-killed-as-protesters-scuffle-with-iraqi-security-forces/articleshow/82954629.cms||---

Judge Pierluigi Balestrieri set Oct. 14 as the date for the opening of the trial, the LaPresse news agency reported after a closed-door preliminary hearing. It is widely expected that the suspects will be tried in absentia.  In December, Italian prosecutors formally put the four Egyptians under investigation for their alleged roles in the 2016 slaying of Giulio Regeni.  Regeni's body was found on a highway days after he disappeared in the Egyptian capital on Jan. 25, 2016. He was in Cairo to research union activities among street vendors as part of his doctoral thesis.  His mother has said his body was so mutilated by torture that she was only able to recognize the tip of his nose when she viewed it. Human rights activists have said the marks on his body resembled those resulting from widespread torture in Egyptian facilities.  Egyptian authorities have alleged that the Cambridge University doctoral student fell victim to ordinary robbers.  The case strained relations between Italy and Egypt, an ally for Rome in efforts to combat terrorism. At one point, Italy withdrew its ambassador to press for Egyptian cooperation in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/italy-orders-trial-for-4-egyptians-accused-in-student-death/articleshow/82954932.cms||---

The US is the worst-affected country with 590,574 deaths, followed by Brazil with 449,858, India with 307,231, Mexico with 221,695 and Britain with 127,724. The World Health Organization (WHO) says up to three times more people have died directly or indirectly due to the pandemic than official figures suggest. Here are the latest developments in the coronavirus crisis: US vaccinates half of its adult populationHalf of all US adults will have received full Covid-19 vaccines on Tuesday, the White House said. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70 per cent of adults vaccinated with at least one dose by July 4. The current figure is almost 62 per cent. Foreign minister Jaishankar meets Guterres India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday held a comprehensive in-person meeting with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and discussed the challenges posed by the Covid-19 and underlined the need for the importance of finding urgent and effective global vaccine solutions. He and Guterres discussed the need to ramp up global vaccine production through expanded supply chains. World's first man to get Covid-19 vaccine diesWilliam Shakespeare hit global headlines on December 8 last year when he became the first man world in the world to receive the Covid-19 vaccination. He died of an unrelated illness on Tuesday. Shakespeare had worked at Rolls Royce and was a parish councillor. Poland dangles lottery jackpot to boost vaccinationPoland will launch a lottery with prizes of as much as 1 million zlotys ($273,000) to encourage people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Although 69 per cent of Poles have declared they want to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, the biggest challenge was making sure they do it, said authorities. Single-dose Covid vaccine soon in IndiaModerna is expected to launch a single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in India next year. Moderna is said to be talking to Cipla and other Indian firms to supply 5 crore doses, reported PTI quoting sources. Vaccine highly-effective in teens: ModernaUS biotech firm Moderna has said that trials show its Covid-19 vaccine is "highly effective" in adolescents aged 12-17. It will seek regulators' approval in June. The company in a statement said that it will submit these results to the US FDA and regulators globally in early June and request authorisation. Cases in fully vaccinated remain rare: CDCThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday issued a report on these ``breakthrough'' cases through the end of April when 101 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Of those, about 10,300 breakthrough infections were reported _ that's about 1 infection in every 10,000 fully vaccinated people, based on the available data.

Obama-era policy adviser Chiquita Brooks-LaSure will be the first Black person to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which also administers children's health insurance and the Affordable Care Act. Together, the programs cover more than 130 million people, from newborns to nursing home residents, and play a central role in the nation's health care system.  The Senate vote was 55-44, with five Republicans joining Democrats in approving her nomination. Brooks-LaSure had been expected to win stronger bipartisan support, but a controversy over a CMS action affecting the Medicaid program in Republican-led Texas appears to have spoiled those chances.  During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Brooks-LaSure paid homage to generations of Black women and men in public service who came before her. "Too often, they weren't given the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential," she said. "But their selfless, often silent, sacrifice paved the way for me and so many other women of color."  Brooks-LaSure, 46, has spent most of her career in government, under administrations of both parties. She served in the White House budget office during the Republican administration of George W. Bush, and worked in Congress and at CMS in senior policy roles during the Barack Obama years.  Under Biden, she'll be charged with moving toward his goal of health insurance for all Americans by building on existing programs, particularly the Obama health law. Biden's Covid-19 relief bill has greatly expanded subsidies for private plans offered through HealthCare.gov, a feature that the administration wants to make permanent.  Biden is also keenly eager to help more than 2 million low-income people essentially trapped in a coverage gap because the states they live in have not expanded Medicaid. Throughout her career, Brooks-LaSure has worked on Medicaid policy, and that program has now grown to become a mainstay of coverage for many low-income working people.  Part of her portfolio will include reviewing -- and amending or rolling back -- a series of Trump administration changes to health insurance rules. Under Trump, CMS tried to promote the sale of cheaper private insurance that offered less coverage than plans sold under the Affordable Care Act. Many Democrats want restrictions on "short-term" plans that don't cover pre-existing conditions.  Prescription drug costs are likely to be the biggest challenge for Brooks-LaSure, and there she will be in the role of a supporting player.  With Biden's backing, Democrats in Congress want to pass legislation this year that would authorize Medicare to negotiate prices with drug companies and bring down the high costs Americans face. The Trump administration tangled with the powerful pharmaceutical industry for four years but ultimately was unable to secure legislation to curb prices.  Now it's Biden's turn, and the path forward for legislation remains uncertain, particularly in the Senate. If that route hits a dead end, Brooks-LaSure will be tasked with finding ways to use the rule-making powers of her agency to rein in prices.  CMS also plays a central role in the nation's $4 trillion health care economy. It sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers. Government payments become the foundation for private insurers. The agency also sets standards that govern how health care providers operate.  In between her stints in government service, Brooks-LaSure was a managing director at the Manatt Health consultancy.  Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who shepherded her nomination through the Senate said Brooks-LaSure has done just about everything in health care "short of scrubbing into the operating room herself."  She's "committed to working with both sides here in the Senate," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-confirms-chiquita-brooks-lasure-to-run-health-care-programs/articleshow/82956056.cms||---

Kejriwal, who is also a co-founder of the platform which offers two-way online learning through group classes, said that the first round of funding is currently sufficient to fuel the company’s existing expansion plans. “We’ve received a lot of investor interest, but we are in a growth phase right now and are not looking at any immediate fresh fund infusion beyond what we have raised,” he said, adding that a new mobile application interface has been added to its operations. The company, which was founded in April last year, currently boasts of nearly 1.5 lakh active learners and over 1,200 teachers who have signed up on the platform for offering courses across domains, subjects and skills. As a business model, BitClass shares a certain percentage of revenue with the teachers, out of the earnings generated with students’ enrolments into cohort-based courses. The company’s early investors include WaterBridge Ventures, Venture Highway, Figure Eight Investments and Better Capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/edtech-start-up-bitclass-expands-operations-on-new-funding/articleshow/82956845.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||Vijay Mallya asks London court for cash to pay his legal fees in India||LONDON: Indebted tycoon Vijay Mallya has made an application for £758,000 (Rs 7.8 crore) from the court funds office in London to pay his lawyers in India, saying he is unable to pay them himself owing to his assets being frozen whilst the bankruptcy proceedings against him are ongoing. The application was made as an appeal in the Chancery Appeals division of the high court on Tuesday against a judgment by deputy ICC judge Barnett in February this year in which Barnett allowed his historic and future legal fees for defending his bankruptcy petition and his £22,500 (Rs 23 lakh) monthly living expenses to come from the court funds office, but excluded payment for his lawyers in India. Judge Barnett had allowed Mallya to access £1.2 million (Rs 12 crore) in total from the court funds office, the source of which was the €3.3 million (Rs 29 crore) sale of Mallya’s property Le Grand Jardin in Cannes, France The court heard that Mallya owed law firms in India £555,000 (Rs 5.7 crore) and that he needed £203,000 (Rs 2 crore) for future legal costs in India. Philip Marshall QC, representing Mallya, said his client could not attend these cases himself as he would be "incarcerated". He said there were three sets of proceedings — Mallya’s compromise settlement offer that is before the Supreme Court of India, his challenge to the 11.5% interest being charged on the judgment debt, and the fugitive economic offender proceedings he is contesting. Marshall argued all three were inextricably tied up with the bankruptcy proceedings, pointing out that if Mallya was successful in the interest rate challenge, the judgment debt would be halved to £569 million (Rs 5,851 crore) and he could meet the rest of it through his remaining assets, his assets realised and contributions from third parties. He said if the compromise settlement is approved then that would dispose of the entire judgment debt. "It is quite invidious to not allow us to instruct lawyers in India and then complain he has not progressed these cases in India," Marshall said. He argued the lack of funds were the reason why proceedings in India were not progressing, as well as the pandemic. "You don’t get further unless you press and encourage the court to try and list your matter and push it along. There is no one in India pushing things along for Mallya. His Indian lawyers are not prepared to extend him credit indefinitely and do need to be paid. We are talking about cases in India which are heavy and complex and he can’t conduct as he is not in India and nor can he go there as things currently stand. They are intricately bound up with the defence of petition." He even referred to the lavish funeral that the late BBC presenter Jimmy Savile had been allowed despite his insolvent estate being sued by alleged sex abuse victims as an example of expenses bankrupt estates sometimes had to meet. Marshall submitted a letter from his Indian lawyers proposing to have their costs checked by an Indian court costs expert, which Tony Beswetherick, representing the banks, said his clients did not want imposed on them. Beswetherick added Mallya’s assets in India amounted to £230 million (Rs 2,365 crore), which was not enough to meet his debts even if halved by the interest rate challenge. Judgment will be handed down on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vijay-mallya-asks-london-court-for-cash-to-pay-his-legal-fees-in-india/articleshow/82957117.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||World||Mali's coup leader wrests back control of the government||BAMAKO: The man who ousted Mali's president from power last year regained control of the West African country Tuesday by deposing the president and prime minister of the transitional government, a move France decried as another coup d'etat.  While Col. Assimi Goita pledged to go ahead with holding new elections in 2022 as previously promised, his display of force casts doubt on whether the vote will go ahead without significant interference by the junta that overthrew the last democratically elected president last August.  The move also raised concerns that the new political unrest could further destabilize efforts to control Mali's long-running Islamic insurgency. The United Nations now spends some $1.2 billion annually on a peacekeeping mission in Mali and France's military has spent eight years trying to stabilize its former colony amid the ongoing threat.  French President Emmanuel Macron described the government takeover as a "coup d'etat" and warned of repercussions.  "We are prepared to take targeted sanctions on the protagonists," he said in a tweet.  The EU also warned that it was "ready to consider targeted measures against political and military leaders who obstruct the Malian transition."  The military's announcement on the state broadcaster Tuesday came a day after President Bah N'Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane were arrested by soldiers and brought to the military headquarters in Kati, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) outside the capital. Both men remained in detention Tuesday and there was no immediate word about their conditions.  Their arrests prompted an outcry by the international community, which put out a strongly worded statement warning Mali's military leaders that their actions could undermine global support for the country. That joint statement made by the African Union, United Nations, the EU, France and the US among others called for the immediate release of the president and prime minister.  The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS, which also endorsed the statement, said on Tuesday afternoon that it was sending a delegation to Bamako as the political crisis escalated. The regional body previously threatened the junta with sanctions if it did not install a civilian president and prime minister, and shorten the transitional period to 18 months.  The new government announced on Monday had left out two men who were prominent junta members: Interior Security Minister Modibo Kone and Defense Minister Sadio Camara. About an hour after the new Cabinet was named, the military rounded up the president and prime minister.  Goita, who led the junta calling itself the National Committee for the Salvation of the People, has served as Mali's vice president in the transitional government formed last September. He has held that position despite initial calls from the international community for an entirely civilian-led transition.  In announcing the removal of the civilian president and prime minister of the transitional government, the military also said that it would be relieving others from their duties including "everyone implicated in the situation."  Still, the military insisted: "The transition is following its normal course and elections will be held as anticipated in 2022." Following international pressure last year the junta had promised to organize that vote by next February, 18 months after the coup d'etat shook the country.  The overthrow of democratically elected President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita came amid mounting military casualties in the fight against Islamic militants linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.  The extremists first took control of major towns in northern Mali after the 2012 coup. Only a 2013 military intervention led by the former colonial power France pushed extremists out of those towns. France and a UN force have continued to battle the extremist rebels, who operate in rural areas and regularly attack roads and cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/malis-coup-leader-wrests-back-control-of-the-government/articleshow/82957140.cms||---

Hallandale Beach police arrested Jeffrey Carl Fleming on Monday on charges of felony stalking with a hate crime enhancement and littering human waste. Fleming was being held Tuesday on $11,000 bond at the Broward County Jail. Details on his arrest were not released.  Capt. Pedro Abut said in a statement that Fleming, 39, is the man captured on cellphone video who went on a rant outside the Chabad of South Broward on Friday.  The man, barefoot and dressed in a white robe, left and returned a short time later, carrying a bag or pillowcase that contained human feces. He dumped the bag in front of the synagogue and yelled, "Jews should die," according to a police report.  He also spat at a menorah near a sidewalk, according to the police.  At a Tuesday court hearing, Fleming's attorney asked that he receive a mental evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/suspect-arrested-in-south-florida-synagogue-harassment/articleshow/82957573.cms||---
---||World||Schools try pep-rally tactics to get students vaccinated||SAN DIEGO: A growing number of public schools are using mascots, food trucks and prize giveaways to create a pep-rally atmosphere aimed at encouraging students to get vaccinated against the coronavirus before summer vacation.  Districts from California to Michigan are offering free prom tickets and deploying mobile vaccination teams to schools to inoculate students 12 and up so everyone can return to classrooms in the fall. They are also enlisting students who have gotten shots to press their friends to do the same.  Officials are concerned that once school lets out, it will be even tougher to get enough teens vaccinated in time to guarantee widespread immunity on campuses.  The massive effort has just gotten underway because it was only two weeks ago that federal regulators authorized the Pfizer vaccine for children 12 to 15. Moderna said Tuesday that its Covid-19 vaccine strongly protects kids as young as 12, a step that could put it on track to become the second option for that age group in the US. Younger children are not yet eligible.  So far, about 14% of the nation's 15 million kids ages 12 to 15 have received their first shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among 7.5 million teens ages 16 and 17, that number goes up to 34%, and about 22% have had both shots, according to the latest figures released Monday. The doses are scheduled about three weeks apart.  There are many challenges.  Depending on the state and even county, minors may be required to have a parent present to get the shot. Some parents may not be able to get away from work to do that. Others are unsure about allowing their kids to get a vaccine that only was approved for emergency use.  Protests have popped up outside schools offering the vaccine, discouraging kids who may already be nervous.  Mission Bay High School in San Diego provides an example of the mixed reaction among students.  "I'm not getting it," said Tatum Merrill, 14, standing with friends outside a mobile vaccine clinic at the school. "It was developed too fast and is kind of sketchy. And I feel like the number of Covid cases is dying down so if everybody else has it, there may not be a need for me to have it."  Her friend Brandon Cheeks, 15, said he wants the vaccine, but his mother is unsure. In the meantime, another 15-year-old, Laura Pilger, said she feels safer being back in school knowing that she and everyone she knows is vaccinated.  "A woman showed up and was passing out flyers that said 'your body, your choice' but the message was not very welcomed," Pilger said. "Why wouldn't you want to get the vaccine?"  While hundreds of colleges across the country are requiring students to have proof of vaccination to return to campus, it's unlikely that K-12 public schools will do the same this fall. It's unclear whether schools can legally require a vaccine approved under an emergency-use authorization to immediately address the pandemic.  Instead, public schools are trying to entice students to get the shots by making the experience festive while sending flyers home to families to address the vaccine's safety.  In suburban Detroit, students in the Southfield district who show proof of vaccination will get a free ticket to the senior prom worth $80. The incentive drew protesters who said awarding the vaccinated could lead to harassment of students who haven't gotten shots.  "We are not separating or segregating students who choose not to receive the vaccine or do receive the vaccine," Southfield Superintendent Jennifer Green said. "We simply want to provide our students an opportunity to celebrate this milestone in their life."  The idea won applause from Dr. Howard Taras, a University of California San Diego pediatrician who consults with districts about health safety. He is also the in-house physician for the San Diego Unified School District, the second-largest in California with about 120,000 students. It has been hosting vaccine clinics at schools in communities with low vaccination rates.  The district also took part in a public service announcement with local teens who say, "We'll be getting the vaccine, now it's your turn."  "I think anything that is creating buzz helps," Taras said, explaining that vaccinating at schools has the added benefit of generating peer pressure.  The virus has spread more rapidly among teens than younger children. "But with a large portion immunized, there is much less chance of it spreading in the classrooms, on buses," Taras said.  And more students may want to return to classrooms as a result.  While most California public schools reopened in April, fewer than half of students resumed in-person learning, according to an analysis by the nonprofit EdSource.  Many continued with online learning, while some dropped out altogether or went to private schools. Public school enrollment dropped steeply in the nation's most populous state, falling by more than 160,000 this school year, according to the California Department of Education.  The Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest in California with about 600,000 students, plans to have a mobile vaccination team visit every middle and high school campus at least once before the school year ends June 11. The events will feature food trucks and music.  Superintendent Austin Beutner recently appeared with Wilson High School's "Mighty Mule" mascot to encourage students to roll up their sleeves. He said the district is offering paid leave for district employees to get their children inoculated. Schools where more than 30% of students are vaccinated will each receive $5,000 for projects, and students can decide how the money is used.  The school-based clinics also help administer shots to hard-to-reach populations who feel more comfortable going to their neighborhood school instead of mass vaccination sites.  Maisha Cosby was motivated by a drive-thru clinic at the Washington School for Girls in Washington, DC. She held her 12-year-old daughter Maya's hand as she got her shot. Then Cosby got hers.  "All my friends have gotten it and they're fine, and I'm ready for her to go back to school," Cosby said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/schools-try-pep-rally-tactics-to-get-students-vaccinated/articleshow/82958130.cms||---

While West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed about 11 lakh were evacuated, the Odisha government said close to 10 lakh people were moved. Kolkata, which continues to shudder at the memories of destruction left behind by cyclone Amphan last year, breathed a sigh of relief after the Met department declared the landfall site to be about 300km away in Odisha. While spells of heavy rainfall and wind at the speed of 60-70kmph have been predicted in Kolkata, a number of districts like East Midnapore — which is closest to Balasore — West Midnapore, South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly are likely to be hit. Kolkata airport will shut at 8.30am on Wednesday, just in time before cross winds start gaining strength and turn operations treacherous. The airport will resume operations at 7.45pm. In Odisha, Bhubaneswar airport suspended operations from 11pm on Tuesday till 5am on Thursday. Bengal recorded three deaths on Tuesday, with two killed in lightning strike in Asansol and another in a wall collapse following heavy rains in Hooghly. “Cyclone Yaas is coinciding with spring tide and the full moon, which has resulted in rising water levels at Digha as well as the Sunderbans from Tuesday,” said Banerjee, who would be overseeing ‘war-room’ operations at Nabanna. The genome sequencing lab at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG) near Kolkata has been temporarily shut to protect the sophisticated machinery from damage. The lab is one of 10 facilities nationwide that is carrying out whole genome sequencing, a critical research to identify and know the new strains that coronavirus mutates into. In Odisha, the surge in Covid cases in the coastal districts has worsened the situation. “To ensure physical distancing due to Covid, the space required to house evacuees is double than what would have been needed,” said Vishal Dev, senior IAS officer deputed in Balasore to oversee safety and relief measures. IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said Kendrapada besides Dhamra and other southern parts of Bhadrak district will witness the first impact as Yaas may pass close to the places around 5.30am on Wednesday. By 11.30am, the cyclone will enter the mainland between Dhamra and Balasore. Many parts of north Odisha faced wind speeds of 100-110kmph and heavy rain on Tuesday. The IMD said tidal waves of 2-4m high are likely to inundate low-lying areas of Balasore and Bhadrak while wind speed of 155-165kmph and gusting to 185kmph may prevail over Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada and Bhadrak when the cyclone enters land. Dhamra and Paradip ports have suspended operations since Monday.

He was chosen from a shortlist of three officers — the other two being SSB chief Kumar Rajesh Chandra and special secretary in home ministry V S K Kaumudi — cleared by the PM-led selection committee on Monday. Jaiswal, who was the senior-most officer in the panel, will have a fixed tenure of two years from the date he assumes charge as CBI director, or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The shortlist of three officers was approved by the high-powered selection committee — comprising PM Narendra Modi, CJI N V Ramana and leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury — after the CJI cited an eligibility rule regarding minimum six-month remainder term, based on a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that, ironically, pertained only to state DGP appointments. The criteria eliminated several hopefuls, including BSF DG Rakesh Asthana and NIA DG Y C Modi. While Asthana is due to retire on July 31, Modi superannuates at the end of this month. The three on the shortlist approved by the selection panel were the seniormost officers left in the reckoning after those with less than six months of tenure remaining were eliminated. An IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre, Jaiswal has been serving as CISF DG since January. The CBI director’s post has been vacant since early February when Rishi Kumar Shukla’s tenure ended. Additional director Praveen Sinha has been serving as the interim chief since.

---||India||Why arrest some & spare others in Narada case: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Even as the Supreme Court posed tough questions to the CBI, forcing the agency to withdraw its plea challenging the Calcutta high court’s decision to put four Narada scam chargesheeted TMC leaders under house-arrest, the bench questioned the “partial approach” of the bureau in arresting a set of persons named in the FIR while sparing another set of TMC leaders who have now defected to BJP. At the same time, the court dampened the joy for TMC by strongly disapproving the dharnas by CM Mamata Banerjee, her law minister and others to protest the arrests on May 17. On the CBI’s selective approach, the bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai asked, “Tell us, who is in a better position to influence the witnesses — those chargesheeted or those who are not? There are two sets of accused. One set chargesheeted, while the other is not. Which set is more likely to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence?” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta strived hard to paint a grim picture of the law and order situation in Kolkata by narrating how the CM-led mob laid siege of the CBI office on May 17, dared them to arrest her and after six hours went out threatening the CBI officers of arrest, a threat which has been implemented by police by registering FIRs. Arguing before the bench, the SG said when the CM was laying siege to the CBI office, that the trial court was gheraoed by the law minister and TMC supporters which prevented the public prosecutor from reaching the court. “The PP had to argue through video conferencing and the magistrate had to grant bail as cabinet ministers of the state with nearly 3,000 supporters virtually laid siege to the trial court,” Mehta said. The bench put a preliminary objection to the CBI’s plea. “When a five-judge bench of the Calcutta HC is adjudicating the CBI's plea against the grant of bail by trial court to the four chargesheeted persons, why should the Supreme Court interfere. It will be better for the Supreme Court to examine the issue, if necessary, after the HC renders a decision,” it said. Justices Saran and Gavai were also critical that once the chargesheeted TMC leaders — Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee — were granted bail by the trial court, could the HC have cancelled their bail without issuing them notice. On the CBI plea, a two-judge bench of the HC had taken up the issue but returned a split verdict — one enlarging them on bail and the other preferring house-arrest. Thereafter, the acting CJ of the HC referred the matter to a five-judge bench. SG said that it is a case meriting transfer outside the state for free and fair investigation and trial. But, the bench said, “The HC had acted in an extraordinary manner. When the trial court was sieged of the matter, a special bench of the HC was assigned the appeal filed by the CBI and it took away the liberty of the accused persons even without issuing them notice,” it said, The SG said extraordinary circumstances prevailed at that point with the rule of law being breached by the actions of the CM and the law minister. The bench said, “We make it clear that we do not approve or appreciate the dharnas led by the chief minister or the law minister. But, should the accused persons suffer incarceration just because the CM or the LM is taking law into their hands?” SG said they were taking law into their hands to help the accused escape the process of law, which mandated production of accused in the court and which was prevented by the TMC mob. When SG said the SC must deal with the serious situation prevailing in the state, Justices Saran and Gavai said, “We do not support the actions of the chief minister or the law minister. You are free to take whatever action against them in accordance with law.” The SG evaded the court’s question on the CBI’s selective approach in arresting some accused and sparing some others, while changing track to reiterate his request for transferring the matter outside West Bengal. The bench reiterated — “the larger issue projected by you about law and order situation etc can be taken up at other levels. The Constitution and the penal codes give ample power to the authorities to take action against those who violated law. But, the question is why should the SC interfere when a 5-J bench is dealing with the issue?” SG relented and agreed to withdraw the CBI appeal from the SC after the bench said CBI and respondents would have the liberty to raise issues before the HC. The bench also clarified that the SC has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. Throughout the hearing, the West Bengal government and accused persons, represented by senior advocates A M Singhvi, Vikas Singh, Sidharth Luthra and Kalyan Banerjee, attempted to interject. But, they were kept at bay by the bench which said they should speak only when invited and not before the CBI completed its arguments and answered the queries. The noted lawyers kept silent as the bench threatened to entertain the CBI appeal if any of them opened their mouths uninvited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-arrest-some-spare-others-in-narada-case-supreme-court/articleshow/82958682.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Goa||Goa cops destroyed proof in Tarun Tejpal case: Court||PANAJI: The additional sessions court, Mapusa, acquitting Tarun Tejpal, held that Goa police destroyed “clear proof of evidence” by not producing the CCTV footage of the first floor of the five-star hotel in which the Tehelka founder-editor allegedly raped a woman, even though the investigation officer “viewed” the footage. In its 527-page order, the court also referred to various lapses by Goa police as well as contradictions by the survivor. The court said that the investigation officer (IO) collected the CCTV footage of the ground, first and second floor, but that “the footage of the first floor cannot be found for the perusal of the court, which is a material lapse by the investigation officer”. The judge said that the IO didn’t compare the statement made by the survivor on November 26, 2013 with the CCTV footage, which constitutes the most neutral evidence in the case. The court added that the officer, after viewing the CCTV footage, was aware of the contradiction between the footage and her account. “It is crucial to note that the contradictions are often so glaring that the exact opposite of what the prosecutrix (survivor) is claiming actually happens on the screen, yet the IO didn’t even question the prosecutrix on the same,” the court held. The court said that a duty is cast on the investigation officer to conduct a fair investigation in the matter to bring out the truth. Thus, judge Kshama Joshi held, “Upon considering the other evidence on record, the benefit of doubt is given to the accused, as there is no corroborative evidence supporting the allegations made by the prosecutrix, and the deposition of the prosecutrix also shows improvement, material contradictions, omissions and change of versions, which does not inspire confidence.” The court noted that the IO viewed vital CCTV footage (of November 7, 2013 of the guest lift of the first floor) on November 21, 2013, and knew that it shows the accused and the survivor exiting the lift during the relevant two minutes on the first floor on November 7, 2013, and that that the same would exonerate the accused. “Despite the fact that the DVR (digital video recorder) containing CCTV footage could and should have been attached by the IO at the earliest to preserve the crucial CCTV footage, the IO appears to have deliberately delayed the seizure of DVR until November 29, 2013, and in the meantime, destroyed the CCTV footage of the first floor of November 7, 2013, thereby destroying clear proof of the accused’s defence,” the court said. As the said CCTV footage of the first floor has been destroyed, the DVR produced before the court contains no files containing the footage of the first floor of the guest lift of block 7, the judge said. Regarding the manner in which the probe was conducted, the court remarked that the IO gave directions to the other investigation officers to download the CCTV footage only of the ground and second floor of the guest lifts from the DVR of Block 7. Therefore, a police inspector, on November 25, 2013, “downloaded only CCTV footage of the ground and second floor, and not of the first floor, to destroy all traces of CCTV footage of the first floor”, the court said. The IO never sealed the room, in which a DVR containing the crucial first floor footage was housed, the court said. The case of the prosecution was that on November 7, 2013, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted the woman under the pretext of waking up US actor Robert de Niro. The accused took the survivor into the left guest lift of block 7 of the starred hotel, and allegedly committed the offence. The prosecution also alleged that she was molested again on November 8, 2013. Tejpal was charged under Sections 354 (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over woman, committing rape of such woman) and 376(2)(k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complaint was lodged by deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Sunita Sawant, who investigated the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-cops-destroyed-proof-in-tarun-tejpal-case-court/articleshow/82959195.cms||Murari Shetye

While the Centre expects vaccine supply to increase significantly from August, it is keen on adding to the current stock and is in talks with the two international majors, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. “We are hopeful of finalising something but if it takes too long, then it will not serve the purpose,” a senior government official told TOI. Once supplies are identified, discussions on indemnity issues will not prove a hurdle. A key challenge for the vaccine manufacturers is availability of surplus stock since supplies have already been contracted with several countries, some of whom have tied up more than they can use. Moderna, for instance, has indicated that it will not have stocks until the end of the year. The company is hoping to produce 800 million to a billion doses in 2021 and nearly treble the capacity next year. In fact, at least one leading Indian drug company wanted to have a tie-up with Moderna to manufacture its vaccines in the country, although the proposal was not accepted. Pfizer is ready to offer 5 crore shots in 2021 itself but wants significant regulatory relaxations, PTI reported quoting sources. It has sought indemnity from the government as well as waiver from trials. Government sources indicated the Centre may show some flexibility. “If vaccines are available, those things will fall into place,” the official said, while pointing to the government’s decision to allow Phase 3 bridging trials in India for Covovax by Serum Institute of India and Novavax. Although production is expected to rise from close to 9 crore doses May to 11 crore next month and over 17 crore in July, the high demand from the 18-44 year segment has prompted the government to talk to companies such as Pfizer and Moderna. “In a few months, we will have more than what we need and then we can export,” the senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-in-talks-to-boost-vaccine-arsenal/articleshow/82959241.cms||Sidhartha

The businessman, who took citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 using the Citizenship by Investment programme before fleeing India in the first week of January 2018, was last seen on Sunday in his car. Police recovered the vehicle after a search but Choksi could not be found, a statement from the Antiguan police said. “Police in Antigua have started search operations for him. The family is worried about his safety. We are keeping a watch on developments,” Aggarwal said on Tuesday. The CBI, which is probing allegations against Choksi, is verifying the reports thro-ugh “formal and informal” channels, including the Interpol that has issued a red cor-ner notice against him on a request from the agency, officials said. The statement fr-om the Antiguan police carries a photograph of the businessman and seeks information from the public. Antiguanewsroom, a local media outlet, quoted commissioner of police Atlee Rodney as saying that the police is “following up on the whereabouts of Indian businessman Mehul Choksi”, who is “rumoured” to be missing.

Ask Bhavesh Javeri, the 40-year old who flew as the lone passenger onboard Emirates flight from Mumbai to Dubai on May 19. ``I stepped into the aircraft and the airhostesses all clapped to welcome me aboard,'' said Javeri, CEO of Stargems Group, speaking to TOI from his Dubai office about his ``money can't buy experience'' . Javeri, a frequent flyer has boarded over 240 flights between Mumbai and Dubai in the past two decades, but this is the first time that he has recorded a clip when boarding a flight.  `I have flown so much, but this is the best flight ever,' he told the air hostesses as he walked in. The commander waved at him from the cockpit. An air hostess quipped: ``I thought you would be scared to travel alone''. The commander then came over from the cockpit to join in the conversation. ``Should I give you a tour of the entire plane,'' he joked. The novelty didn't wear off after he buckled into seat 18 A (18 is my lucky number, I asked for that seat, he said). It kept on coming through the flight in the form of the familiar inflight public address, delivered with a personal touch. ``Mr Javeri, please fasten your seat belt".. ``Mr Javeri, we are preparing to land".. ``After we landed, I walked out leisurely and picked up my bag, the only one lying next to a conveyor belt,'' said Javeri, a Dubai resident for the past 20 years. Emirates did not respond to a query sent by the TOI. Before Delhi upstaged it, Mumbai-Dubai was the busiest international routes out of India. So why did the airline have a 180-odd tonne Boeing 777, world's largest twin-engine jet, burn about 17 tonnes of fuel worth Rs 8 lakh to fly a lone economy-class passenger on this two and half hour long much popular route? Under the current travel restrictions put in place by UAE, only UAE nationals, holders of UAE Golden visa and members of diplomatic mission can fly from India to UAE. Said an official with an Indian carrier:" It's probably a case of good passenger load on one direction, say, when they flew from Dubai to Mumbai, and then poor on the return leg. The airline would have operated the return leg anyway, even with zero paying passengers on board." For the solo passenger though, it's quite an air ticket lottery win. Said an operator from the Indian aircraft charter industry:"It would cost about Rs 70 lakh to charter a Boeing 777 from.an airline to do the Mumbai-Dubai route. But the cost of charter would double if the aircraft was from a company that had to fly it back ferry, without passengers, to its base." Javeri, a Golden visa holder, bought the Rs 18,000 economy class ticket, a week in advance through a phone call to the airline as it had suspended regular flights. ``I normally book a business class ticket, but I thought, why not book an economy seat, the flight would have only a few passengers,'' said Javeri, whose parents live in Breach Candy. He learnt how wrong he was when he reached the airport in the wee hours to board the 4.30 flight. His ticket didn't carry a date and so he was denied entry into the terminal building by the CISF personnel. Standing outside the entrance, he called up Emirates, only to learn that the entire staff was waiting for him, the lone passenger on board flight EK501. ``I was elated. I had flown a charter flight from Dubai to Mumbai last June with nine passengers on a 14-seater aircraft. But it was no where close to this money-can't-buy experience,'' he said. Unfortunately, he had not slept a wink that night and so spent the entire flight catching up on lost sleep in an aircraft cabin that took social distancing to its most extreme form ever. There have been quite a few solo-passenger airline flights around the world in the past, but such occurences have gone up with the pandemic and the travel restrictions it brought on. One such flight happened last month. On April 15, Bob Pitts, was the only passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight from Ft. Lauderdale to St. Louis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-rs-18000-man-flies-solo-to-uae-on-360-seat-plane/articleshow/82960406.cms||Manju V

It adds, “According to the definition given by Section 10 (16) of Income Tax Act, we cannot be considered as employees. The state government should also offer financial incentives to frontline doctors as we are risking our lives to save the public during this pandemic. As it is already a high time and our repeated representations in the past have seen no visible result, we are requesting you to communicate with government and resolve all our issues latest by May 27.

The state added nearly 10,000 deaths in the past 10 days. Maharashtra had 80,512 deaths on May 15, and on Tuesday, 601 were reported; another 536 were added after a week, taking the cumulative deaths to 90,349. With this, Maharashtra has recorded more deaths than countries such as Germany and Spain. Meanwhile, the daily additions continued to be under 30,000 for the sixth day in a row—24,136 new cases were added, taking the total to 56.2 lakh. Mumbai is set to breach the 7 lakh mark in the number of Covid-19 cases since March 2020, and is on par with small European nations such as Switzerland, which has 6.9 lakh cases and 10,000-plus deaths so far. On Tuesday, the city added 1,029 cases, taking the tally to 6.9 lakh. The number of deaths dropped to 37, taking the total toll to 14,650 so far. “Although we could only conduct 20,000-odd tests, we are making efforts to increase the daily testing,'' said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. With malls closed and curtailed train services due to the restrictions, BMC officials said they haven’t been able to carry out random testing like they used to in early April. Kakani, though, said the positivity rate in the city has been low (below 5%) for the past few days. The World Health Organisation has said decisions on reducing restrictions can be taken only if the test positivity rate drops stays below 5% for 15 days. Pulmonologist Dr Lancelot Pinto from Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said the overall Covid situation in the city is better than it was a month ago. “The regular hospital beds are easily available but ICUs are still very busy. It will take a few more weeks for the deaths to reduce,” he said. At the state level, several smaller districts such as Solapur, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar were adding as many deaths as cities such as Mumbai. The high death rate has been a cause for concern for the state. Officials said with cases ebbing, the death rate in these districts will continue to be high for some more time. There is a continued decline in active cases of the state and the rate of recovery is on the rise too. The active cases in the state dropped to 3.1 lakh, of which 27,855 were in Mumbai.

NDRF battalion commandant Vijay Kumar Sinha told TOI over the phone on Tuesday that both teams are armed with all equipment necessary to deal with such a situation. “NDRF acts as a medical first responder. Besides, both teams are armed with various types of powered cutters which can cut concrete as well as thick metallic wires or trees,” he said. Sinha said teams are also equipped with inflatable boats which could be deployed in low lying areas if they get submerged due to heavy rain. "In cyclonic situation, mostly uprooted trees, collapsed electric poles or other structures are needed to be cleared for relief and rescue works,” he said. “Each team has 30 to 35 personnel, including team commander and technicians. Both teams would move to any place in south Bihar based on the requirement on Wednesday,” he said. The commandant said they are well prepared for the heavy rain and thunderstorms forecast for May 27, May 28 and May 29 in south Bihar. “I am personally in touch with the disaster management principal secretary Pratayay Amrit. He is looking after the overall scenario. Whatever need arises and directions are issued, we will act quickly,” he said. Sinha said a few NDRF personnel are deployed at the emergency operation centre at Sardar Patel Bhawan while the battalion’s control room in Bihta is also monitoring the situation round the clock. “We are in touch with the disaster management department of Jharkhand too. Latest IMD predictions show a slight change in the path of cyclone touching land near Paradip, which might cause a decreased effect in Bihar,” he added. SDRF deputy commandant KK Jha said the latest IMD predictions say wind speed in Bihar will be between 30-40kmph which won’t be able to uproot trees. “However, wind speed and other factors change several times after a cyclone touches land. The five reserved SDRF teams at Bihta, also have all necessary equipment like cutters that NDRF have,” Jha said. He said if required, personnel from the 11 teams deployed permanently in northern Bihar districts, could also be withdrawn and mobilised for relief and rescue work in southern Bihar. At present, five teams of the 9th battalion of NDRF have been deployed in West Bengal after airlifting them by IAF’s C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft from Patna on Sunday while eight other teams have been sent to East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Seraikela and Gumla in Jharkhand by road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yaas-imapct-seven-ndrf-sdrf-teams-on-standby-for-s-bihar/articleshow/82952855.cms||Debashish Karmakar

According to Unicef, nearly 75 lakh children in state would experience learning loss as only 36.5% of them have internet access and 3.5% have computer facilities. Nearly 3% or 7 lakh of children are not expected to return to school. Among the adolescents from the age group of 14 to 18 years, nearly 5.49% of girls and 0.26% of boys are expected to drop out of school. These data were shared by Unicef’s monitoring and evaluation specialist Prassana Ash and education specialist Pramila Manoharan in an online meeting with the education department on Sunday. The meeting was held to discuss strategies and solutions to ensure continuity of learning for the most marginalised children in Bihar in light of the Covid pandemic and continued lockdown. The Unicef also shared data of a study conducted by Azim Premji Foundation on loss of learning during the pandemic in the country. The study was conducted in January this year for classes 1 to 6, in which it was found that 92% of children on an average have lost at least one specific language ability from the previous year across all classes and 82% of children on an average have lost at least one specific mathematical ability from the previous year across all classes. UNICEF officials also shared a data of National Family Health Survey-5 in which it was mentioned that although 93% households have access to cellphone, only 36.5% have internet access and only 3.5% have computers. Education department additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said the state government is aware of the fact that a vast majority of children in Bihar do not have internet access and they find it difficult to attend online classes and avail e-resources. “We have requested the Centre to provide digital devices. There can be no better alternative to schools as schools provide a complete eco-system for education. Children need midday meal, interaction with teachers and friends and all other facilities for their learning and holistic development,” Kumar added. He stressed on the need to develop a comprehensive road map for continued learning taking into consideration the Covid-induced lockdown and the impending third wave of the pandemic which is likely to hit children the most. Unicef (India) Chief of Education, Terry Durnnian, highlighted the need for both short-term and long-term measures to boost education in Bihar. “It is crucial to put in place a range of solutions to ensure that the most marginalised groups of children can continue their learning. At the same time, it is also crucial to track and monitor whether children actually learned and how much,” he said. Unicef-Bihar chief Nafisa Binte Shafique appreciated the timely initiatives taken by the education department to ensure continuity of learning during school closures. “Bihar was the first state to roll out classes on Doordarshan as well as through mobile apps and mobile buses in marginalized communities with Unicef’s support. In March, enrolment campaign by Bihar teachers and Jeevika didis helped raise awareness among parents,” Shafique added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unicef-75-lakh-children-in-bihar-may-experience-learning-loss/articleshow/82952916.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Lenders had appealed against the order as they felt it was not legally possible to do a one-time settlement with the promoter facing an investigation for fraud. The order is also a relief to the Piramal Group, which got into a pitched bidding war with private equity firm Oaktree to acquire the housing finance company. The Piramal Group had also appealed against the earlier order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), besides the Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator R Subramaniakumar as well as the committee of creditors who had voted in favour of the sale to Piramal. While the matter will be heard next on June 25, the NCLAT has said that the hearing should not come in the way of the NCLT deciding on the lenders’ application to accept the proposal from the Piramal Group. The resolution plan of Piramal is now in the last stage, awaiting clearance from the NCLT. It had earlier received approval from the RBI and the Competition Commission of India. Amid the resolution process, the administrator had received a letter from Wadhawan where he claimed he could repay bankers by liquidating personal assets. Banks had discussed the letter in their meeting but did not see any merit in it and felt it was aimed at creating grounds for litigation and delaying the process. According to lenders, the letter was neither a resolution plan under the insolvency process nor was it a one-time settlement offer.Lenders were hopeful of completing the transaction in the first quarter. Although the loan has been fully provided for in their books, the transaction would have enabled lenders to show a higher recovery that would make up for some of the additional provisions they would need to make on account of the pandemic. SBI has the biggest exposure to DHFL of around Rs 10,000 crore, followed by Union Bank of India, Canara Bank, National Housing Bank, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclat-stays-order-on-wadhawan-bid-for-dhfl/articleshow/82955121.cms||---

The university’s public relations officer, Md Mudassir Alam, told this newspaper on Tuesday, “The decision has been taken in the light of the recent circulars received from the University Grants Commission, All India Council for Technical Education and Union ministry of defence. They lay stress on offering NCC as a ‘generic elective’ under the CBCS. The National Education Policy also pleads that there should be no rigid separation between curricular and extracurricular activities.” The NCC course will consist of 24 credits, of which 14 will be meant for institutional training and the remaining for two annual training camps of 10 days each. Vice-chancellor H C S Rathore said, “All official formalities like approval of the course by the academic council and other statutory bodies of the university will be completed soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cusb-to-add-ncc-course-to-curricula/articleshow/82953062.cms||---
---||Business||Cos must allow employees to prioritise families over targets||By Sukhjit PasrichaA colleague was going through a harrowing time at home. Both his parents as well as his spouse were diagnosed as Covid-positive. His manager asked him to take time off work, as much as was required, and to focus completely on his family, taking care of their medical and emotional needs, including his children, while also running the household. The manager also made one person from his team in charge of ensuring that all medical and other essential supplies as needed were supplied to the family and he would check in with his colleague twice daily through a simple “Any help needed?” message. This simple act of the manager conveyed to the colleague that he was more than just an employee and to take the necessary time and space to focus on his family when it really mattered. The pandemic has affected our lives in countless ways. While its economic impact is being widely discussed and debated, this crisis has also inflicted immense emotional and mental damage. Many of us have lost family members, friends or colleagues. At such a time, leaders, managers and the organisation as a whole have to focus on and demonstrate skills which they may have, so far, overlooked — empathy, caring and flexibility — as they help employees cope and recover from the after effects of the pandemic. Empathy: The biggest perk today Empathy is the biggest perk managers can give to their team members at this juncture. Empathy can be conveyed in many ways. To start with, it can simply mean giving employees some time off or a free pass from work responsibilities till their personal situation improves. Depending on the circumstances, it could also mean providing flexibility at work to employees in terms of enabling work from anywhere and, if possible, work in any time zone (that is, giving employees a greater choice on how, where and when they complete a work assignment). This allows them to prioritise family over work. Care for your team as you would for family Managers need to consider their employees as an extended family. Members of a family look out for one another and it is important now to do the same for the people one works with. Just the way daily business huddles are conducted with teams, now is the time to do a daily check-in with direct reports to ensure that all is well on the personal front. Together, we can stitch a chain of help and support down the line, which will help us break the chain (of the virus). Just the way we look after our family members, we need to stay connected and support our teams in a similar manner. Deadlines vs deadly virus By reaching out and connecting with employees, it is possible to create an environment of compassion, kindness and togetherness — one for all and all for one. Managers can manifest the well-being of employees by encouraging the practice of mindfulness. Instead of daily calls simply for sales updates, conversations can now begin by enquiring about personal well-being of employees and thereafter proceed to KRAs/KPIs. One has to strike a balance between focusing on deadlines and the deadly virus. We have to ensure that not only employees but their family members are safe and sound, and that their physical and emotional well-being is not at stake while chasing customers or targets. Over the last year, workplaces the world over have embraced virtual ways of working and team bonding. Whether it is team meetings, welcoming a new colleague, celebrating achievements or solving a new business challenge, all these and more have been held virtually. However, as we endeavour to cope with and recover from an extraordinary health crisis, now is the time that an organisation’s ability to help and support its employees will be tested severely. While it is easier to celebrate small joys and victories, a defining moment and a true test of organisational culture will be the effort made by companies to help their people manage the stress and anxiety as well as play a part in their ability to bounce back. Steering employees forward can be difficult during this time, and organisations which make a genuine and concerted effort will observe some significant behavioural patterns in the form of deeply engaged, satisfied and loyal employees as committed to their organisation as the organisation is to them. It is important that employers, human resource (HR) teams and managers are conscious and receptive to the changes taking place around them and respond with care and sensitivity.

The disease affects many vital organs, including eyes and brain regions. Though only one case of mucormycosis was reported at its ENT department on Monday, the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) has started the process of creating a separate 70-bed black fungus ward so that patients reaching there could immediately be admitted and provided the required treatment. “While 50 beds for mucormycosis patients would be ready by Wednesday, the remaining 20 would become functional in a few days. Suspected patients would be admitted through a unit of the ENT department,” said PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur. Since this disease involves several parts of human body and patients may reach different OPDs, the hospital administration has written to heads of all departments, asking them to screen mucormycosis cases and report to the superintendent’s office. Apart from mucormycosis, PMCH has also begun the exercise to keep all facilities ready to face the threat of the third wave of Covid, which might affect children. “Though the paediatric ward has already about 150 beds, 14 new ICUs are being set up for neonates and other children,” Dr Thakur said. The number of mucormycosis patients at India Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) touched 99 on Tuesday. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the number of patients infected with this fungus without Covid virus was 88. Two mucormycosis patients died at IGIMS on Tuesday, Dr Mandal said. The number of mucormycosis patients admitted at AllMS-Patna rose to 66 on Tuesday. Four patients with serious black fungus symptoms successfully underwent surgery by a team of doctors at the hospital. AIIMS-P Covid nodal officer Dr Sanjeev Kumar said a 20-bed new ICU for mucormycosis patients began functioning from Tuesday. “The AIIMS-P has already set up facility for treatment of 110 patients of black fungus at a time,” he said. Following detection of one case, Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) has created a 25-bed ward for mucormycosis. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said all departments and doctors on duty at Covid ward have been asked to screen admitted patients, numbering around 135, for mucormycosis symptoms and shift them to the special ward for treatment in case of detection. He said the state government has made available the required medicines and injections. Of the 17 black fungus-infected patients admitted at Paras HMRI Hospital, four were discharged on Tuesday. A hospital official said all arrangements have been made to increase the number of beds in case the number of patients keeps on rising. The number of black fungus cases admitted at Ruban Hospital has also risen to 11. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari said four black fungus-infected patients were admitted at Ford Hospital and one at Kiran Polyclinic in Khagaul. “Several other hospitals are yet to update the status of mucormycosis cases,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-start-setting-up-black-fungus-wards/articleshow/82952574.cms||VK Tripathi

He also asked them to continue testing people living in rural areas. “The daily count of Covid positive cases has declined in the state, but testing facilities should be ramped up,” Nitish said during a review meeting and directed the officials to pay an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of the people, who had died of Covid-19, from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The CM also reviewed the status of community kitchens, positive patients under home isolation, and the HIT mobile app. Meanwhile, Bihar recorded altogether 3,306 fresh Covid cases on Tuesday, taking the tally to 6,95,726. While Begusarai registered 313 cases, Patna recorded 285, Samastipur 237, Purnia 208, Muzaffarpur 171, Katihar 166 and Gopalganj 148. Besides, 104 deaths were reported from districts like East Champaran, Vaishali, Saran, Sitamarhi, Patna, Nalanda, Begusarai and Siwan. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna registered 10 deaths, including five from Patna and one each from Vaishali, Bhagalpur, Sheikhpura, Muzaffarpur and West Champaran. While 18 more positive patients were admitted to the hospital, 23 were discharged on Tuesday. On the other hand, the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital registered five Covid deaths.

The nine districts of north and eastern Bihar to be hit most adversely by Yaas are Purnia, Katihar, Kishanganj and Araria in Purnia division, Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura in the Kosi division as well as Khagaria and the northern parts of Bhagalpur district. As per the water resources department (WRD), the area comprising the nine districts will witness thunderstorm and widespread to scattered rainfall from Thursday to Saturday. “On Monday and Tuesday, the catchment areas of the Mahananda river in the Himalayan terrain in Nepal witnessed around 35mm rainfall,” a WRD official said. The maize-growing farmers of the nine districts concerned in north and eastern Bihar are a worried lot. The entire swathe of land is famous for maize cultivation. The farmers have only partly harvested the maize crop till now. Around 40% of the crop is still standing in the land waiting for harvesting for want of agricultural workers, a good chunk of whom has migrated to Punjab and other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yaas-maize-growers-a-worried-lot/articleshow/82952573.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Oxygen supplies readied as Yaas Cyclone nears coast||VISAKHAPATNAM: The three north-coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh are bracing to face the severe cyclonic storm Yaas, which is expected to cross the coasts of north Odisha and West Bengal between Paradip and Sagar Island, north of Dhamra and south of Balasore on noon of May 26. The India Meteorological Department has predicted that the weather system would further intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm in the early hours of Wednesday. Even though north-coastal AP region may not witness a major impact from the cyclone, Met officials say that gusty winds and rain bands from the storm would extend to Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts. Sea conditions are likely to become phenomenal along and off north-coastal Andhra Pradesh from the early hours of Wednesday. According to officials of Srikakulam district, existing oxygen supplies would last at least three to four days, even if there is any obstruction in the oxygen supply chain to the hospitals that are treating Covid-19 patients. Four NDRF teams have been deployed in the Ichchapuram border area, which may receive a major blow from the cyclone. Diesel generator sets have been kept ready in all hospitals in the region to ensure no disruption in oxygen supply to Covid-19 patients. Chief secretary Adityanath Das is camping in Srikakulam district to monitor the situation at the field-level, particularly in view of the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 and the logistics involved in oxygen supply during the cyclone. He has already conducted a review meeting with district officials. Earlier, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting with the collectors of three north-coastal districts on their preparedness for the cyclone. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said Andhra Pradesh has procured additional stocks of liquid medical oxygen over and above its daily quota in the last three to four days for Covid-19 treatment in view of the cyclone. “So it would not affect the treatment even if there is any delay in transportation, dispatching or storage,” said Singhal Head, Cyclone Warning Centre, Visakhapatnam, M Sunanda, said squally winds reaching a speed of 50-60 kmph and gusting 70 kmph, would prevail over Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts from the early hours of Wednesday. “Fishermen are advised to not venture into the sea,” said Sunanda. Distant warning signal No. 2 has been kept hoisted at Visakhapatnam, Machilipatnam, Nizampatnam and Krishnapatnam ports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/oxygen-supplies-readied-as-cyclone-yaas-nears-coast/articleshow/82952390.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

With an increase in Covid-19 deaths in and around the city and its neighbouring villages in May, families brought the deceased to crematoriums and burial grounds in Vijayawada. Taking advantage of the situation, a few gangs swung into action in the name of providing cremation services and increased cremation charges to between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000. The TOI on May 11 had highlighted the illegal practices that some agencies were carrying out. The district administration and VMC responded and made cremation free at electric crematoriums and asked that only firewood be paid for at other burial grounds. For a week, task force police and VMC deployed teams to ensure the rate cards were implemented. But soon, the gangs went back to charging exorbitant rates. A visit to the ESI burial ground at Gunadala on Tuesday exposed how middlemen are looting families of Covid-19 victims. A broker offered a package of Rs 22,000 for cremating a Covid-19 patient who passed away at a hospital near Ramavarappadu. “My brother-in-law died of Covid-19 at a corporate hospital. We are very poor and he got treatment under YSR Aarogyasri. We approached the agency for shifting the body to the burial ground at ESI Gunadala. They charged Rs 22,000. When questioned about the huge sum, they asked us to apply for Rs 15,000 financial support announced by the state government,” said K Sekhar, a resident of Gunadala Madhya Katta. Residents, meanwhile, have requested the district administration take action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cremation-agencies-fleece-covid-victims-kin/articleshow/82952259.cms||Venu Lanka

On Tuesday, the rupee closed 19 paise higher at 72.78 against the dollar. The local currency opened at 72.85 and touched an intraday high of 72.75 before closing a little lower. The rupee was also supported by weakness in the dollar index, which measures the performance of the greenback against major currencies. The dollar index fell 0.3% to 89.6. Besides the weakness in the dollar index and positive sentiment over the decline in Covid cases, The rupee is also being supported by actual dollar inflows into IPOs and fund-raising by startups. Traders are advising importers to hedge their positions by booking the dollar at current prices and advising exporters to sell at 73 levels. However, the reduction in manufacturing activity due to ongoing lockdowns across the country has reduced import demand. According to a report by ICICI Direct Research, the dollar is easing lower against major currencies as worries are diminishing over runaway inflation and the chances of the US Federal Reserve tightening policy sooner have receded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-recovers-after-2-mth-weak-spell-to-72-8-per-dollar/articleshow/82955189.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In an interview, he tells TOI that companies have sufficient headroom in terms of unutilised credit facility to meet their requirement. Excerpts: From an economic standpoint, how is the second wave different from the first?Compared to the first wave, when GDP decelerated by over 23% in Q1FY21, we expect numbers to be significantly different this time. The other aspect is that lockdowns have happened at different points in time, which has ensured continued economic activity. The supply chain has got disrupted for industries, but some activities like construction have continued. Also, we have not seen the migrations from cities that were there last year, and living with Covid has become a new normal. We do not see much disruption for large corporates. It is largely in the trade and SME space. Do these sectors need assistance from the government or banks?The RBI has extended a restructuring option for borrowers up to Rs 25 crore. Our experience last year was that not many entities came forward for restructuring. Borrowers have also become cautious. Banks can take care of the funding needs of large corporates. The utilisation of working capital by corporates we finance is only 70%, which means they have headroom to borrow. Demand is expected to be hit as citizens spend more on health. Do you expect that to affect SBI’s retail business?At the moment, the priority for the middle-class is health. We have devised a scheme to take care of customers’ requirement in respect of Covid care, which includes hospitalisation. We have tried to keep it cheaper than our normal credit. As of now, it is available for our customers as we have some visibility to their behaviour. The loan amount will be linked to credit scores and we will launch it soon. Will you also be lending to the healthcare sector?We will be supporting the entire ecosystem relating to healthcare — hospitals, oxygen plants for hospitals and even oxygen manufacturers. We can also support non-bank finance companies that provide such loans to the healthcare sector. Will your growth target be affected by the second wave?We had credit targets but given restriction on mobility, we will have to wait and watch for things to normalise. Our growth will be an interplay of macro and internal efficiency. Our internal aspiration is to take the return on assets and return on equity to the next level. As far as internal efficiency is concerned, we will do our best to deliver value. Is there still risk-aversion among lenders?The government has taken several steps to restore confidence among bankers. There is no risk-aversion. When there is 30% under-utilisation in working capital limits and term loans have not been availed, the risk-aversion is on part of the entrepreneurs and not banks. Have you achieved your goals on the digital front?At the end of 2020, 59% of our transactions were digital. Today, they are at 67%. Digital is also 97% of non-branch transactions. We are leveraging analytics in a big way. We will be strengthening Yono (app) to improve customer experience and provide end-to-end digital products from account opening to extending loans. Of the 50,000 accounts being opened daily, 30,000 are end-to-end digital. Almost Rs 30,000 crore of business (loans) has been done using artificial intelligence and machine learning. We will further strengthen our capabilities here. What about the rural area where SBI has a significant presence?That is why SBI will continue to pursue ‘Phygital’. We are ramping up business correspondents to extend loans. The idea is to offer all commoditised products through the digital medium with branches providing value-added services. The formalisation of the economy has given us a significant tailwind. In the Jan-Dhan accounts, average balance has risen to Rs 2,800, which offers insights into their behaviour and enables lending to them. How do you see the competition from fintech? Will Yono remain the super app?I would not like to undermine what the startups are doing. We will supplement their efforts. We would like to have Yono as a super app because having more and more apps only confuses people. The intention is to make it richer and more robust. Have you identified the assets to be sold to the new bad bank?It’s in the works, but it should be around Rs 20,000 crore. How do you plan to make SBI bigger and better globally and in India?SBI is a replica of the Indian economy and will globalise with the economy. Our international operations contribute around 10% of the balance sheet size and will grow as the economy moves towards the $5-trillion mark, export opportunities will increase. We are showcasing our overseas operations as an Indian bank catering to global trade in addition to the primary focus on India. Besides upgrading their technology to improve products and services, we are optimising costs by offering back-office operations from India. We want to scale the penetration of mutual funds, insurance and credit cards and make it available to all. What is the strategy for project finance in future?It is not true that we do not entertain projects. Not many projects have come up for financing. Of late, capital investment has majorly been done by government entities and in the road and construction sector, which we have supported while the private sector is seeing low-capacity utilisation. Also, several companies have taken advantage of the liquidity in the system and raised equity and debt from the capital markets. Of our sanctions, disbursement is 70-71%. For banks, there is still room to lend as there are many companies without access to markets. Banks also have an edge when it comes to the stability of funding requirements. Barring a few sectors such as steel, the realisation under insolvency process has not been good. How do you see it?This is a paradigm shift. A whole ecosystem for the resolution of stressed assets is now in place. For a capital-deficient economy like ours, brownfield projects are always in demand. It is the value of the underlying asset which is helping determine the recovery rate for the system. Last year, since NCLT functioning was impacted due to Covid, banks started promoting settlements. There are various options available today for the resolution of stressed assets, IBC or the NARC process. All these will lead to some competition in terms of the ability of bankers to generate better value. NBFCs are again saying they are under pressure. Does it warrant SBI intervention again?Last year, we stepped in because the RBI came out with TLTROs (Targeted Long-Term Repo Operations). Currently, we may not have a risk appetite to go on our own. We will evaluate if the regulator introduces something.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/risk-aversion-among-bizmen-not-banks-sbi-chairman/articleshow/82955051.cms||Mayur Shetty

Health minister Mangal Pandey told the newspaper here on Tuesday that the government would ensure that not a single patient faces any hardship owing to incessant rains, lightning or power failure. All health centres, particularly the ones treating Covid or black fungus patients, have already been alerted to make necessary alternate arrangements in the event of any crisis arising due to the cyclone. They have been asked to ensure uninterrupted power supply to drain excess of water from the hospital premises in case of water logging. Sump houses should be kept in readiness and generators should also be kept functional to meet the power shortage due to irregular supply. Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) has been specially alerted and asked to ensure that its low-lying campus free from water logging. Pandey further asserted that vaccination drive and testing of Covid suspects would continue as usual even during adverse conditions arising due to cyclone. The district magistrates have been asked to take proper care of all the health centres under their jurisdiction and also ensure running of community kitchens for the needy. Detailing the preparations being made at NMCH, deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said all drains in and around the campus have been cleared with a view to draining all the excess water. The sump house has kept ready. Besides, all generators have been repaired to meet the demand of power in case of failure of regular supply. The number of patients has declined and it has been decided that all patients occupying beds on the ground floor would be shifted to some old buildings located on the campus, he added. AIIMS Patna Covid incharge Dr Sanjeev Kumar said, “The electricity department has been asked to ensure uninterrupted power supply failing which the hospital would press its own generators into service. At present, 250 Covid patients are admitted in the hospital and many of them are using oxygen cylinders. Efforts have been made to have a sufficient number of cylinders along with liquid oxygen in stock so that patients are not allowed to suffer in case of any problem of transport.” Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) superintendent Dr I S Thakur said the hospital is fully prepared to serve all Covid patients along with others with full dedication even in adverse circumstances likely to be created by the cyclone. “The hospital has got all the necessary facilities to ensure uninterrupted supply of power and water and essential drugs along with oxygen,” he said. PMCH former superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said all the hospitals must arrange for sufficient stock of oxygen cylinders and essential medicines for treatment of patients. Programmes of vaccination and testing of people for Covid should continue unabated, he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-hospitals-ready-to-face-cyclone-impact/articleshow/82952523.cms||B K Mishra

The annual vacation for the court commenced on May 22 and will end on June 20. Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh, before whom the civil case was placed on Monday, observed that the pleadings are complete and the matter was placed for hearing even when the counsels of the petitioner, the state government or the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) did not make any mention for an urgent hearing. The single-judge bench observed that the matter can’t be taken up and decided during the annual vacation given the provisions in the 1916 rules. "Possibly, the provisions under Rule 4 of Chapter II of the Rules have not been brought to the notice of the Hon’ble Chief Justice," the bench observed while directing that the order be placed before him. Referring to the statutory provisions in the 1916 rules, the bench observed that a vacation judge may grant bail in criminal matters and pass interim orders only regarding stay, injunction or other relief in such other matters, civil or under the Constitution ‘as he may consider emergent’ but cannot decide and dispose of a case other than bail applications, on merits. The bench observed that it is not unmindful of the situation arising out of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and in a given situation the HC on its administrative side could decide in accordance with the law to overcome the limitation under Rule 4, but in no case, statutory provisions prescribing limitations on a vacation judge sitting during long vacation can be breached. Dr Shlok Kumar Chakravarti, a physics lecturer at Gulzarbagh government polytechnic, had filed a writ petition last year that the eligibility criteria published by BPCS of an aspirant must have PhD and first-class at either Bachelor’s/Master’s level in the relevant discipline (engineering/technology related branch) is different from criteria in Bihar Engineering Education Service Rules, 2020 and Bihar Polytechnic Education Service Rules, 2020 for appointment of principals in government polytechnic and engineering colleges. Prima facie satisfied, the bench had directed BPSC not to proceed with the selection process without the court’s leave on November 11 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-fumes-as-non-urgent-civil-case-listed-before-vacation-bench/articleshow/82953091.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Amid shortage of ambulances, increased waiting time, and exorbitant rates charged by private operators, aggregators operating in a “Uber for ambulance” model saw almost 5x-6x calls for help, clocking almost 2,000 calls per day at peak. Players like Medulance, Dial4242, StanPlus and others were able to reduce time to reach a patient from the current average time of 40 minutes to 15-20 minutes. While requests for these companies come in via calls (and app in some cases), the tech stack matches customer needs with the right type of ambulance and dispatches the closest vehicle as the fleet is fitted with GPS. With defined pricing systems adhering to trauma services guidelines, users were also saved from shelling out huge sums. With both B2C and corporate partnerships (B2B2C), most players in the sector are revenue generating and in a few cases also profit-making. “The average daily calls to the customer support team have shot up to 6x in the last 2 months and we have attended to over 70,000 Covid cases since the outbreak of the pandemic,” Pranav Bajaj, co-founder, Medulance, said. At a time when oxygen and hospital beds were scarce, our ambulances had to spend close to 2.5 hours in the admission process, up from 30 minutes normally, he added. Medulance currently serves 22 cities with a fleet size of almost 5,000 ambulances and claims an average response time of 22-25 minutes in metros and tier-I cities. The company ensures partner ambulances are fitted with the required equipment and all critical information of the patient is transferred to the hospitals where they are taken. The company’s corporate program, which provides ambulatory services across large organisations such as HCL, Schneider Electric and more, has also grown 3X in the pandemic. Another player, Dial4242, uses technology at every point in its service delivery-from booking of the ambulance, to tracking of the vehicle to digital payment. The company’s tech powers around 5,000 ambulances across 150 cities in India. “We have seen approx 300% increase in call volumes and trips this year compared to last year. Due to shortages of beds, our ambulances were supporting patients for 8-10 hours. In short we were hospitals for them,” Jeetu Lalwani, co-founder, Dial4242, said. With the Tata group and other MNCs as corporate subscribers, Dial4242 handled 800-1,000 calls daily on an average and 1,500-2,000 calls on peak days. Hyderabad-based StanPlus believes that while tech can solve the problems of the fragmented sector, it is critical to increase supply and thus besides aggregating ambulances, the company also has its own fleet fitted with essential equipment and trained personnel. “Getting the right ambulance is also important in an emergency. Central triaging and efficient routing matters in an emergency to save time. Our tech platform StanFleet matches the symptoms with the right type of vehicle,” Prabhdeep Singh, founder, StanPlus said. During the second wave, from March to May, daily requests went up almost by10X for StanPlus from March to May. Launched by IIT-ians and funded by Y Combinator, tech startup HelpNow is another startup in the space with a fleet of around 750 ambulances. Shikhar Agrawal, co-founder, HelpNow, says the tech enables data analytics which helps them map Covid hotspots and thus optimise routing. “Not having to Google for ambulance services or call various hospitals in an emergency, and just dial a single helpline number, is the biggest benefit for users in this model,” he said. HelpNow saw daily requests touch almost 2500 at the peak of the second wave in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tech-based-ambulance-aggregators-step-up-in-the-second-wave-of-covid/articleshow/82956034.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

As many as 12 quick response teams (QRT) comprising 4-5 sanitisation workers have been deployed in the municipal areas and 150 portable pumping sets have been placed to drain out water from low-lying areas. Around 120 labourers, 20 each in the six circles -- Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankerbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City -- to work round-the-clock. PMC Himanshu Sharma told this newspaper that the ward councillors have been asked to deploy more labourers at sump houses both temporary and permanent and in low-lying areas to ensure rainwater is drained out in the quickest possible time. He assured that even if rainfall is recorded between 75mm and 100mm in a day, it will be pumped out within 3-4 hours as soon as the rain stops. If it rains more than 180mm, it will take around 7-8 hours to clear water from the areas, he added. Himanshu said all sump houses are operational. “Altogether 20 temporary pumping stations have been made at such areas where there is no drainage system. At these places, raw sewers have been built and connected to the pumping stations. All big drains have been cleaned, illegal constructions and obstructions removed from these drains. Around 90% of work has been completed on minor drains, including catch-pits and manholes,” he said. In the municipal area, there are altogether nine big drains, 46,837 catch-pits and 36,241 manholes. The PMC commissioner is satisfied with the measures taken by the civic body in all the 51 problem areas identified in each circle. These areas include Kankerbagh Colony, Hanuman Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Indira Nagar Sanjay Nagar, Ram Lakhan Path, Ram Krishna Nagar, Sipara, Jagganpura, Ramnagar, Barf Kothi and Mithapur bus-stand in Kankerbagh circle. In Bankipore, the water-prone areas are- Rajendra Nagar (road number 1 to 13B), Bazaar Samiti, Saidpur, Nand Nagar, Kadamkuan and Congress Maidan, while Nehru Nagar, Gosai Tola, New and Old Patliputra Colony, Rajiv Nagar, Kesri Nagar, Indirapuri, Rajvanshi Nagar and Nepali Nagar in Patliputra circle. There are few places in New Capital and Azimabad circle, which include Airport road, Police Colony, Jakariyapur, Adivasi Colony, Punjabi Colony, Biscouman Colony and Harnichak. The public relations officer of PMC, Harshita, said drainage pipelines have been laid, temporary pumping stations set up and raw sewers have been built for timely removal of rainwater. “A new sump house has been built at Congress Maidan while the capacity of Saidpur sump house has been increased. A new drainage line was constructed parallel to the Mithapur bus-stand road,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/civic-body-gears-up-to-tackle-waterlogging-forms-12-teams/articleshow/82952474.cms||Faryal Rumi

Cyclone Yaas live updatesNDRF battalion commandant Vijay Kumar Sinha told TOI over the phone on Tuesday that both teams are armed with all equipment necessary to deal with such a situation. “NDRF acts as a medical first responder. Besides, both teams are armed with various types of powered cutters which can cut concrete as well as thick metallic wires or trees,” he said. Sinha said teams are also equipped with inflatable boats which could be deployed in low lying areas if they get submerged due to heavy rain. "In cyclonic situation, mostly uprooted trees, collapsed electric poles or other structures are needed to be cleared for relief and rescue works,” he said. “Each team has 30 to 35 personnel, including team commander and technicians. Both teams would move to any place in south Bihar based on the requirement on Wednesday,” he said. The commandant said they are well prepared for the heavy rain and thunderstorms forecast for May 27, May 28 and May 29 in south Bihar. “I am personally in touch with the disaster management principal secretary Pratayay Amrit. He is looking after the overall scenario. Whatever need arises and directions are issued, we will act quickly,” he said. Sinha said a few NDRF personnel are deployed at the emergency operation centre at Sardar Patel Bhawan while the battalion’s control room in Bihta is also monitoring the situation round the clock. “We are in touch with the disaster management department of Jharkhand too. Latest IMD predictions show a slight change in the path of cyclone touching land near Paradip, which might cause a decreased effect in Bihar,” he added. SDRF deputy commandant KK Jha said the latest IMD predictions say wind speed in Bihar will be between 30-40kmph which won’t be able to uproot trees. “However, wind speed and other factors change several times after a cyclone touches land. The five reserved SDRF teams at Bihta, also have all necessary equipment like cutters that NDRF have,” Jha said. He said if required, personnel from the 11 teams deployed permanently in northern Bihar districts, could also be withdrawn and mobilised for relief and rescue work in southern Bihar. At present, five teams of the 9th battalion of NDRF have been deployed in West Bengal after airlifting them by IAF’s C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft from Patna on Sunday while eight other teams have been sent to East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Seraikela and Gumla in Jharkhand by road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yaas-impact-seven-ndrf-sdrf-teams-on-standby-for-s-bihar/articleshow/82952943.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Patna||Ramp up vax drive in rural areas: Patna HC||PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday verbally directed the state government to ramp up vaccination in rural areas to tackle the pandemic. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar passed the order while hearing PILs filed by Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh on the grim pandemic situation in the state. It also orally directed the state government to increase the RT-PCR test rate in rural areas and take steps to stop people from getting vaccinated after testing positive for Covid. The court’s direction came after lawyer Parul Prasad raised the issue, saying vaccination rate of 18+ people is poor in small towns and rural areas. State’s advocate general (AG) Lalit Kishore told the court that people in rural areas are hesitant in getting vaccinated for several preconceived notions. The court, however, was not satisfied with the reply and asked the state government to ramp up vaccination and Covid test in rural areas. The AG also informed the court that positivity rate in Patna has come down to less than 2%. The court, however, asked him to file an affidavit instead of making verbal claims. The court gave time to the chief secretary till next Monday to file his detailed reply on number of Covid deaths reported since March 1 along with age and religion of the victims. Meanwhile, an affidavit of the chief secretary was placed on record before the court. It said the health department has been asked to verify details regarding Covid deaths from all sources. The court was also apprised that the health department has been asked to form committees at district level for ascertaining deaths taking place at hospitals and other places, including in home isolation, and submit a list. State government’s nodal officer for ESIC-Bihta also apprised the court that the hospital administration needs to take action as RT-PCR laboratory is to be established there. The officer apprised the court that a 100-bed dedicated Covid health centre at ESIC-Bihta, run by district administration, has been handed over to the hospital for expansion as per its need. A counter affidavit of Patna divisional commissioner was also submitted in which it was mentioned that 789 cremations which took place from May 5 to 14 at Mukti Dham Charitravan Ghat in Buxar were not only of people from the district, but also from several other neighbouring places. The court was informed that among the 789 people whose bodies were cremated during this period at the ghat, only 324 were from Buxar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ramp-up-vax-drive-in-rural-areas-patna-hc/articleshow/82952648.cms||Debashish Karmakar

As per the IMD forecast, south and central Bihar districts are expediting necessary preparations. Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh said on Tuesday that extensive awareness campaign has already been launched in each village in 20 blocks through mukhiyas, aanganwadi sevikas and sahayikas, vikas mitras, ward members among others. He has also asked civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar to ensure that health centres across the district are ready for any contingency. Senior deputy collector and Nalanda district disaster management officer Abhishek Kumar said at least 176 pucca shelters and 200 tents for makeshift shelters are ready to accommodate over 5,000 persons, if displaced. He added that 31 motorised boats, a team of 17 divers, 88 life jackets have also been deployed to launch rescue operations as and when needed. “Steps are being taken to ensure dry and cooked food through community kitchens and drugs were properly delivered to the needy. Also, 11,500 polythene sheets have been kept ready to be used to protect residents of kutchcha houses from rains,” Kumar said. In Bhojpur, senior scientist and head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) Pravin Kumar Dwivedi told this newspaper that according to the IMD, the wind velocity in the district is expected to be 40- 50 Kmph, hence impact of cyclone Yaas is likely to be moderate. “Farmers are being advised through different forms of media to avoid venturing into agricultural fields between Wednesday and Saturday. To save the standing crops of maize and green grams (moong) and vegetables, farmers have been asked to ensure proper drainage for taking out the excess water from the fields during heavy spell of rain,” Pravin said. Ara Municipal Corporation mayor Rubi Tiwari said drainage clearance work have been expedited. “In all the water-logging prone areas, cleaning of drains are being done both manually and with machines. About 60 workers, two excavators and two JCB machines have been engaged in cleaning of drains,” she said.  Nawda district administration has asked the public to remain indoors and advised to pay heed to tips enumerated vide a short video clip released by the National Disaster Management Authority titled—`Bunty Ka Radio’.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has put several airports in the eastern region, including Patna, on alert. "Keeping the safety of airport infrastructure and flight operations during inclement weather, the AAI-Patna has taken all the precautionary measures as per the guidelines," said airport director Bhupesh CH Negi. “To handle the situation, we are following the set of standard operating procedure (SOP),” he added. Officials at Patna airport said all scattered construction materials are covered, banners and hoardings removed from the airport premises. Drainage lines at Patna airport have been unclogged to ensure no water-logging on the premises. AAI-Patna officials have also reviewed the status of electrical and civil work. Santosh Kumar, the airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), said 4-5 portable pumping sets will be used to drain water from the airstrip and parking bays. “We are in touch with officials of the Patna Meteorological Centre, and according to them, the city would witness heavy rainfall. Accordingly, we have made preparations to drain out water from airport premises in case of overflowing sewers,” he said. Santosh said due to the cyclone impact the flight operations would likely get affected so the airlines have to update their passengers about the delays, cancellations and diversions. On average, Patna airport handles 15-23 flights per day against 48 scheduled flights under its summer schedule. The number of flights has been reduced by the airlines due to low occupancy in aircraft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-airport-braces-for-cyclone-impact/articleshow/82954024.cms||Faryal Rumi

While monitoring the vaccination drive on Tuesday, the general manager of the ECR, L C Trivedi, asked all the railway employees, particularly the frontline workers, to get themselves inoculated. “Vaccination is the only way to keep the deadly virus at bay,” he said. Nearly 5,500 ECR employees have already tested positive for Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic. ECR’s chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar told this reporter, “Of the 81,635 employees working in all five divisions of the zone, almost 50,000 have been vaccinated so far.” He added, “Altogether 1,313 staff working at the ECR headquarters in Hajipur, 6,688 under Danapur division, 8,665 under Samastipur division, 9,505 under Sonepur division, 8,227 under Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya division, and 12,589 under Dhanbad division have already been inoculated. Besides, 2,083 of the 3,770 employees working at different railway workshops have also received their vaccine shots.” Meanwhile, the vaccination drive for people belonging to the 18+ age group is yet to pick up the pace at railway hospitals. Chief medical director of the ECR’s superspecialty hospital in Karbigahiya, Dr R K Verma, claimed, “The number of people, who have got themselves registered under this age group, is very high, but we are yet to get vaccines from the government.” Dr P K Mishra of the Danapur railway hospital, on the other hand, said, “We have already vaccinated the frontline workers belonging to the 18+ age group. The drive will continue once we receive more vaccines from the state health department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50k-railway-staff-inoculated-ecr/articleshow/82952521.cms||Kumod Verma

The state added nearly 10,000 deaths in the past 10 days. Maharashtra had 80,512 deaths on May 15, and on Tuesday, 601 were reported; another 536 were added after a week, taking the cumulative deaths to 90,349. With this, Maharashtra has recorded more deaths than countries such as Germany and Spain. Meanwhile, the daily additions continued to be under 30,000 for the sixth day in a row—24,136 new cases were added, taking the total to 56.2 lakh. Mumbai is set to breach the 7 lakh mark in the number of Covid-19 cases since March 2020, and is on par with small European nations such as Switzerland, which has 6.9 lakh cases and 10,000-plus deaths so far. On Tuesday, the city added 1,029 cases, taking the tally to 6.9 lakh. The number of deaths dropped to 37, taking the total toll to 14,650 so far. “Although we could only conduct 20,000-odd tests, we are making efforts to increase the daily testing,'' said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. With malls closed and curtailed train services due to the restrictions, BMC officials said they haven’t been able to carry out random testing like they used to in early April. Kakani, though, said the positivity rate in the city has been low (below 5%) for the past few days. The World Health Organisation has said decisions on reducing restrictions can be taken only if the test positivity rate drops stays below 5% for 15 days. Pulmonologist Dr Lancelot Pinto from Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said the overall Covid situation in the city is better than it was a month ago. “The regular hospital beds are easily available but ICUs are still very busy. It will take a few more weeks for the deaths to reduce,” he said. At the state level, several smaller districts such as Solapur, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar were adding as many deaths as cities such as Mumbai. The high death rate has been a cause for concern for the state. Officials said with cases ebbing, the death rate in these districts will continue to be high for some more time. There is a continued decline in active cases of the state and the rate of recovery is on the rise too. The active cases in the state dropped to 3.1 lakh, of which 27,855 were in Mumbai. The rate of recovery, too, touched 92%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/as-maharashtra-deaths-top-90000-higher-than-some-eu-nations-toll-city-cases-near-7l/articleshow/82961506.cms||Bhavika Jain

Their special allowance and honorarium are also pending, the Asha workers said. Their duty includes visiting the houses of Covid-19 patients for various surveys, monitoring observation of dry days in the local bodies, etc. Now, they are in a situation that they should spend money from their pockets for travel and other expenses. However, the National Health Mission officials here said that the lack of fund allotment has delayed the payment of the salary to Asha workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/asha-workers-in-plkd-yet-to-get-salary/articleshow/82953912.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Agripada residents buy Sputnik for vaccination drive at nearby hospital||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Central and Agripada Advanced Locality Management (MCA ALM) will next week roll out the city’s first citizen-driven cluster vaccination for residents of their area. The ALM has tied up with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories who will supply them with the Russian-made Sputnik vaccine. For administering the doses, the ALM has tied up with the Wockhardt Hospital in their neighbourhood. Once it rolls out, this will also be the first time that residents will be vaccinated with Sputnik. So far Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), state government and private hospitals have vaccinated residents with Covishield and Covaxin. “We have around 80 buildings that are part of the ALM group. There are around 6,000-7,000 residents and many have been vaccinated already. So we are planning to vaccinate around 3,000 residents. We are getting 1000 doses from Dr Reddy’s Labs and they will be delivered soon. We might have one more round of vaccination for the residents who are left out,” said Mehboob Patel, Secretary of the MCA ALM. The MCA ALM will be Mumbai’s first ALM or citizen group to start a drive for residents by sourcing the vaccines on their own and tying up with a Private Covid Vaccinating Centre (PCVC). “The MCA ALM approached us and we are processing their request. We are delighted to support this vaccination initiative by the ALM,” said Dr Parag Rindani, head of the Wockhardt Hospital. On the outskirts of Mumbai, similar immunisation drives are being undertaken by large gated communities in tie-ups with private hospitals, but none of them have directly sourced the vaccines. “We are charging around Rs 1,400 per person. Wockhardt will keep a dedicated floor for MCA ALM members. We have already distributed forms among members so that they can sign up for vaccination. We are making advance payment to Dr Reddy’s Labs for the doses,” Patel said. There are some concerns about pricing though. Sputnik is being sold in India at a little less than Rs 1,000 per dose. The additional cost in this case is the service charge which Wockhardt is levying. “Doorstep vaccination is a very good initiative but it should be at an affordable price. The state government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) must fast track its vaccine procurement so that the maximum number of people can get free vaccines. All the ALMs must ensure that vaccination remains affordable for all residents,” said Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh. Last week, Goregaon’s Gokuldham Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Officers Quarters had become the first housing society in Mumbai to have doorstep vaccination after tying up with a Private Covid Vaccinating Centre. Around 400 residents were vaccinated with Covaxin through doctors and staff from Fortis Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-agripada-residents-buy-sputnik-for-vax-drive-at-nearby-hosp/articleshow/82956192.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The excise team of Attingal circle received a tip-off regarding sale of illicit liquor at Poovanpara on Monday. When the team reached the house of one Jayakumar, they came to know he was actually a primary contact and was in quarantine. The team went without any precautionary measures other than masks. The higher officials eventually asked the team to back off without arresting the culprit. They seized 470 litres of arrack, 1.5 litres of illicit liquor and Rs 3,000 as cash, which he had received from the sale of liquor. “It is a tricky situation as home brewing of arrack has become rampant in rural parts due to lockdown. We have no way to find out whether they are in quarantine or in isolation after being tested positive for Covid-19. On Monday, we had to put off his arrest or else our officials would have risked themselves to infection,” said an excise official. The team also arrested another man from Anchuthengu on Tuesday. He was tested negative after the arrest. Already a few staff at Chirayinkeezhu circle are in isolation after being tested positive for Covid-19 and owing to the workload, the excise team in rural circles can’t afford to have remaining workforce in isolation. Concerns are also being raised about people getting into contact with illegal brewers who are in isolation or quarantine. “We have recovered Rs 3,000 as cash on Monday. It clearly showed he was conducting sales and was in contact with people despite being in quarantine. We have not been able to question him to extract further details. His arrest will be executed after his quarantine period gets over,” said an excise official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/officials-in-a-fix-after-man-in-isolation-brews-liquor/articleshow/82953933.cms||---

Though they were later released after questioning, natives and political leaders alleged the administration has been suppressing the protests by the people. Sources said two students from Agatti Island and a contract official from Bitra Island were summoned by the police. The administration has not yet responded to queries yet. “The police said they were summoned based on the administration’s complaint that they sent ‘abusive’ WhatsApp messages to the administrator. But as the issue became public, all of them were allowed to go. It clearly indicates that the administration’s strategy is to suppress the protests by people who raise their voice against the injustice happening in the Lakshadweep Islands. The social media profiles of people are also under scanner,” said Ali Akber, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) state president, Lakshadweep. Akber said the administration should focus on Covid fight and providing emergency support to those who suffered losses due to the cyclone last week. “Around 70 fishing boats and 100 houses were damaged. The administration is yet to provide support to them but is trying to create enmity with the people,” Akber said. Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faisal said Patel’s actions were driven by corporate interests. “The move to curtail the powers of the district panchayat is an attack on the foundation of democracy,” he said. BJP leader’s letter to PM surfaces online: Putting the BJP local leadership in Lakshadweep under pressure, a letter sent to the PM Narendra Modi by BJP Lakshadweep general secretary, HK Mohammed Kasim, against the administration has surfaced online. In the letter dated 20 April 2021, Kasim states that the administrator did not support the party leadership in the islands. Kasim suggests the PM to recall him immediately. He stated that several welfare schemes were stopped by the administrator. As many as 15 schools were shut and 500 temporary staff terminated from service. \ When asked about the letter, Kasim, on Tuesday, said some of the amendments made by the administrator had caused inconvenience to the people and the matter has been brought to the PM’s notice. Yuva Morcha (BYJM), including its state general secretary PP Mohammed Hashim, former state vice-president M C Muthukoya and former state treasurer B Shukkoor, resigned from the party on Tuesday protesting over the unilateral decisions taken by the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-natives-say-admin-suppressing-protests/articleshow/82953925.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: In Covid times, MNC workers come out to help native villages with ‘free medicine account’||BAREILLY: Moved by deaths of Covid-infected neighbours back home in the absence of proper medication, natives of a Shahjahanpur village employed with MNCs have banded together to initiate ‘free medicine account’ for needy people by pooling in money from different sources. The service that they had initially started — after the deaths of five people due to Covid-19 in the absence of proper medication — for the residents of their Mudiya Pamar village in UP’s Shahjahanpur district has now expanded to four villages, covering a population of over 5,000, with more like-minded people joining them. “Though we don’t live in our villages now, we were shattered by the deaths of people back home. Since people are struggling to get prescribed medicines owing to the high cost, we decided to start running a medical account for them to provide free medicines. We have, so far, pooled in Rs 3 lakh for the purpose and effort is on to raise more money and expand the service beyond three villages,” said Sandeep Gupta, who works with an MNC in Lucknow. Pramod Kumar Gupta, retired group captain Indian Air Force, who is coordinating this initiative in the village, told TOI, “This is a joint initiative of Ajay Kumar Gupta, who is retired from Bhilai steel plant, along with Sandeep Gupta, Kamlesh Kumar, Priyanka Mittal and Pankaj Kumar. They all hail from Mudiya Pamar and live in other cities but remain connected with their roots. They wanted to help specifically the residents of our village and we came up with this idea of sanitization in the village and distributing medicines. Gradually, we managed to gather more funds and got the support from Rajesh Gupta who agreed to provide generic medicines through his agency. This allowed us to increase our reach to neighbouring Chand Pai, Chak Kanhu, Nagra and Umaria villages. Besides medical camps with the support of private doctors and sanitization of the villages, we have distributed Covid kits which contain N95 masks, sanitizers, gloves and Kadha in the villages to all the families living below poverty line.” Ajay Kumar said, “We are happy that a few local youths came in support of the initiative and are spreading the word in villages. They are sharing our helpline numbers with the residents and even supplying medicines to them. To be honest, they are the real heroes as we are only contributing money but they are risking their lives.” Satyabhama, a beneficiary, said, “The medicines prescribed to me were quite expensive. Fortunately, it was provided to me at my doorstep for free. At least someone is there thinking for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/in-covid-times-mnc-workers-come-out-to-help-native-villages-with-free-medicine-a/c/articleshow/82951934.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In a representation made to chief minister Pramod Sawant, GCCI has called for exemption/waiver from all applicable levies, taxes, levied by the state government. GCCI president Manoj Caculo asked for instructions be issued to civic bodies and other similar entities that collect/levy taxes, namely house, property and sanitation taxes, and trade occupation licences among others, directing them to waive them with effect from April to August as an immediate relief measure or till normalcy is attained. It has also demanded that the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) work out special loan packages to assist retail businesses. “Such loans shall be collateral free and at max secured against the inventory/ debtors and should be given at a lowered rate of interest and for a longer term,” Caculo said. If possible, these loans could be provided a guarantee by the government of Goa so that other banks could participate as well, he added. The representation stated that the retail sector works on margins and volumes, which inherently makes their business model fragile. To remain afloat they need consistency of business hours, certain number of footfalls, conversions and spending power and optimism from consumers. On the other hand, the sector has to pay wages, rent, taxes, corporation levies, interest on borrowing, cash flow for purchases, credits, huge maintenance costs, which are almost constant irrespective of business, GCCI said, calling for government intervention in the matter “to prevent the sector from slipping into irretrievable financial damage”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-asks-state-govt-to-work-out-relief-package-for-pandemic-hit-retail-sector/articleshow/82958004.cms||---

However, the meeting did not happen. Kishan Reddy himself confirmed it, but made it clear that Rajender sought time for a meeting. “It is true that he asked my time to meet. We have worked together as political leaders for the past 15 years. There is nothing wrong in meeting. Till now, we have not met, we have not decided when to meet,” he clarified. The minister said Eatala Rajender told him that he would meet him like he was having discussions with leaders from other political parties. Kishan Reddy said the party did not yet pay attention on the possible byelection to Huzurabad. “If election is inevitable, we will decide whether to field a candidate or not,” he said. Earlier in the day, there was speculation that Eatala met Kishan Reddy at a farm house along with Bhupender Yadav, who played a major role in BJP’s strategy in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) election. Earlier, the former minister met a few of his former TRS colleagues including Vijaya Rama Rao, who are currently with BJP. However, both sides refuted the speculation that the former minister would join BJP and become a Rajya Sabha member. There was also speculation that Eatala might resign from TRS and contest as an independent candidate from Huzurabad. The former minister has been meeting leaders of opposition parties ever since he was dropped from the cabinet. In his meetings, he was giving priority to those who leaders who were once with TRS but now in other parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-kishan-keep-everyone-guessing-fan-meet-rumours/articleshow/82956201.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Their kind approach drew praise from the new health minister Veena George, who also congratulated them for their efforts. According to health officials, the relatives of Kausalya (20), a resident of Koviloor in Vattavada, noticed that she was in labour around 1.30am on Tuesday and was in the process of rushing her to a hospital in a car. Mid-way, they sought the help of an ambulance as they felt that she might need more care amid labour pain. The message was sent to a primary health centre in Vattavada and relayed to the health control room. When they received this message, medical technician BS Ajeesh and pilot of the ambulance Noufal Khan rushed to their aid immediately. They saw the car with the woman near Pampadum Shola National Park and Ajeesh realized that there was no time to move the woman to a hospital. He immediately made arrangements for the baby’s delivery inside the car. Kausalya gave birth to her child by 2.15am.

The varsity is witness to the death of 18 serving faculty members and a large number of non-teaching employees since the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. In a letter addressed to additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad, varsity registrar Abdul Hamid said a dedicated vaccination centre is necessary for effective control of Covid as a total of 8,000 people, including teaching, non-teaching and technical staff, are working in the university. This number extends to 40,000 in case their dependents are added to the list. Talking with TOI, vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor said the centre is required for the convenience of employees. “Once the dedicated centre is opened, more people will come forward for vaccination as they will not have to go outside the campus,” he said. He added that the varsity administration is trying to motivate all sections of employees to get vaccinated. According to the AMU administration, the number of people opting for vaccinations has picked up pace but still more needs to be done. As per vaccination data collected by the administration, on May 21 and 22, more than 300 employees got vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/set-up-vaccination-centre-on-campus-for-staff-amu-to-govt/articleshow/82951968.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kolhapur||State to emphasize on Covid institutional care in rural areas||Pune/Kolhapur: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the government would be stressing on institutional isolation of Covid patients, mainly for rural areas in districts where the positivity rate is higher than the state’s weekly average positivity rate of 12%. Tope told TOI that there is no “ban” on home isolation as was reported earlier in the day, but there would be emphasis on institutional isolation wherever home isolation was not possible or was found inconvenient. On Tuesday, 16 districts where the positivity rate from May 16 to 23 is higher than the state’s 12% were in focus during a review meeting headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to ramp up infrastructure especially for rural areas. “We are asking these districts to focus on rural infrastructure, regarding having more Covid Care Centres (CCC) to help better isolate patients,” Tope said. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI on Tuesday that the positivity rate is going down in Pune district. “It is 8.9% today and is expected to go down further. We are, however, ramping up our infrastructure. We have already proposed a CCC in Ambegaon Budruk with a capacity of 270 beds,” he said. Data from Pune shows that the number of weekly new cases has been on a steady decline for the last four weeks. The district had 68,254 new cases (April 26-May 2), 60,201 (May 3-9), 47,531 (May 10-16) and 25,483 (May 17-23). Maximum cases were reported from Baramati, Haveli, Indapur, Shirur and Daund talukas of Pune. An average dip of 20% has been registered. Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said he was focusing on villages or cluster of villages which have a large number of patients in home isolation. “We have started community isolation. So far, we have shifted around 1,200 patients in home isolation to these community isolation centres, which are similar to institutional quarantine. These facilities have been set up in schools and other public buildings. We currently have a positivity rate of around 20% and have extended the lockdown till May 31 to curb the spread,” he told TOI. In Kolhapur, a team of experts was formed a week ago to suggest measures to bring down the mortality rate. Accordingly, the team had suggested doing away with home isolation completely. Since then, the district administration has been preparing isolation centres at the village level. “We have asked every village to set up isolation wards in schools or any unused building and shift all home-isolation patients there. We have empowered the village-level committees to take a decision on managing the logistics. We are ready to provide the doctors required for such centres,” said Kolhapur district health officer Yogesh Sale. Third lockdown in Satara district From Tuesday, Satara district is going under strict lockdown for the third time in the last couple of months. The decision has been taken after the administration found there is no natural decline in the positivity rate. Last week, the positivity rate came down to 17% from 33%, but district collector Shekhar Singh said there was a huge pendency of tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/state-to-emphasize-on-covid-institutional-care-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82953928.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The bench also directed the state to reply indicating whether incentives offered to hawkers due to the pandemic can also be offered to retail traders. The bench heard the petition by Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association seeking waiver of property tax, renewal tax and all licence fees for the entire lockdown period—from March 23, 2020, till when it ends. “The majority of retailers within the state have suffered huge losses and they are entitled to certain waivers and concessions, so as to ensure the businesses sustain,” the petition said, informing that there are over 13 lakh traders with over 45 lakh employees. Seeking time to take instructions, state’s advocate Jyoti Chavan said the situation is improving and the government will take an appropriate call in the matter. “You are offering incentives to hawkers but not retail traders. Is there any package for retailers also?” asked Justice Dhanuka. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, also sought time to file a reply regarding cancellation of projection licences. “The state government has to take a decision on property tax,” he added. The judges directed the state to “indicate as to whether incentives offered to hawkers due to their sufferings during the pandemic can also be offered to retail traders”. It was then that federation’s advocates, Jamshed Mistry and Dipesh Siroya, said the state government is not enforcing the April 13, 2021, SOP that permits only the sale of essential goods and services by the e-commerce industry. “Look into the serious complaint. What is going on?” asked Justice Dhanuka. The judges, in the order, recorded that the ongoing violations by e-tailers were brought to the notice of the state, but no action was taken. The state’s reply also has to “indicate what steps...would be taken against e-commerce dealers supplying non-essential items” in violation of the SOP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-state-take-action-against-errant-e-tailers-selling-non-essentials/articleshow/82956207.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Agra||Mathura cops question injured man instead of providing medical help||AGRA: Rather than providing medical aid to a man who was critically injured, police personnel in Mathura’s Raya police station allegedly started questioning him. The man who had been shot in the chest had walked into the police station on Monday to seek help. A video of the incident has gone viral. The footage purportedly shows Pushpendra Singh, a resident of Suraj village, being questioned by the policemen about who had attacked him. Singh is heard saying that he had been shot by the one Rajkumar at the residence of Vimal Kumar, who had accompanied him at the police station. Singh was also asked his caste and where the suspect could have fled. Not only this, the policemen, without paying heed to the pain the victim was undergoing, even questioned those who had accompanied him. The injured man was later admitted at the district hospital from where he was referred to Agra’s SN Medical College as his condition was critical. Singh was shot on Monday afternoon when he had gone to Vimal’s house as he suspected that the latter’s son had stolen his mobile phone. Meanwhile, Rajkumar arrived there and got into a verbal argument with him. The two have a long-standing dispute. Things turned ugly and Rajkumar allegedly whipped out a countrymade pistol and shot at Singh. Then he fled. An FIR has been registered against Rajkumar under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC at Raya police station. When contacted, Mathura SSP Guarav Grover said the SHO had informed him that Singh was asked a few questions about the crime and was immediately taken to the hospital thereafter. However, he had asked the circle officer details about the incident as providing immediate medical aid should have been the priority of the personnel at the police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-cops-question-injured-man-instead-of-providing-medical-help/articleshow/82951984.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Kochi||Identity theft via e-commerce, OTT accounts on rise: Study||Kochi: The country has witnessed a steady rise in data breach, financial frauds and identity theft from media, EdTech and e-retail platforms, says a study conducted by Kochi-based cyber security firm Technisanct Technologies Private Ltd. The study, which assessed 12,000 over-the-top (OTT), 7,500 e-retail and e-commerce and 4,500 EdTech accounts over a period of five months, from January to May 2021, found that there is a steep 90-100% increase in account takeover (ATO) on the dark web. ATO refers to the online identity theft where a cybercriminal accesses a bank, e-commerce or OTT account of the victim, siphons funds to steal credit or debit information or loyalty points, to commit another cybercrime or fraud.  The study found that most of the crimes occur on major brands in EdTech, OTT platforms and e-commerce and e-retail applications. They found that the main reason for ATO is that many Indian users are still using passwords which they used in 2014 for a brand which had a data breach at that time. The study also found out there is a huge demand for OTT usernames and passwords since lockdown and many of the credentials belonging to Indian brands are regularly kept for sale in Telegram and similar data sharing platforms on the dark web. “Using the same password for the ease of use and many digital business companies not imposing two-factor authentication and not prompting to regularly change their login passwords, fearing that it could create a dent in consumer experience, actually exposes them to threat of ATO, credential stuffing and credential cracking,” said Technisanct founder & CEO Nandakishore Harikumar. In credential stuffing attack, hackers use credential information sourced from data breaches to gain access to the victim’s other accounts. Credential cracking is another term for hackers using common usernames and passwords to guess their way into an account. The study also found that OTT platforms, mostly premium accounts, took a major hit and EdTech industry’s credentials are popular in Telegram platforms. It suggests to cultivate the habit to use strong password protection methods, especially among the young consumers of EdTech brands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/identity-theft-via-e-commerce-ott-accounts-on-rise-study/articleshow/82954016.cms||---

The working committee of the Kisan Congress, which discussed the issue on Tuesday, demanded that the government purchase even the rain-soaked paddy at minimum support price (MSP) from the farmers. “The government should take action against the officials and the rice millers harassing the farmers citing moisture and lack of quality in paddy,” said Sunketa Anvesh Reddy, state president, Kisan Congress. The Kisan Congress also demanded that the state ensure that an adequate number of vehicles are arranged to transport paddy from the procurement centres to the rice mills. Presently, the farmers are being made to wait at the procurement centres with their agriculture produce due to shortage of vehicles to transport their paddy. There is also shortage of hamali’s to upload and download the paddy bags at the procurement centres and the rice mills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kisan-cong-to-protest-across-state-tomorrow/articleshow/82956209.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra ‘won’t defy’ national policy on jabs for pregnant women||MUMBAI: A day after the BMC decided to allow pregnant women to get the Covid vaccine, the state has made it clear that it won’t defy the national policy that at present allows vaccination only for lactating mothers. The Centre is still deliberating on whether pregnant women should get the shot. Meanwhile, Mumbai on Tuesday crossed 3 million vaccinations with the 18-44 age-group nearing one lakh doses. When asked about the state’s stand on the matter, additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI that the current national policy does not cover pregnant women for Covid vaccination. Asked if the state and BMC would not be pursuing separate policies if BMC decided to vaccinate pregnant women, he said, “There is only one policy throughout the country.” About BMC’s move to give jabs to pregnant women in the city, Vyas said, “I do not think they will deviate, (there) must be some miscommunication”. Civic officials, however, said pregnant women can get the shot so long as they have a letter from their gynaecologist and their own written consent. Yet interestingly, BMC didn’t mention pregnant women in groups that can walk in for vaccination on Wednesday. It only said lactating women, people above 60 years coming for first dose of Covishield and people above 45 years eligible for second dose of both vaccines can walk in. Some civic officials said more clarity was needed on how the decision was reached and what kind of evidence was relied upon. AMC Suresh Kakani said it was based on “informal opinion” of senior medical experts who were concerned about the complications seen in newborns. “There was an internal discussion where suggestions were sought on how to curtail complications. Vaccinating expecting mothers was cited as an option, so we thought of allowing it. Also, the ultimate decision of taking the vaccine would lie with the mother, who can consult her doctor and decide what is best,” he added. Many gynaecologists welcomed BMC’s move, but said the rollout cannot be a hurried step. A BMC doctor said reading material that spells out the pros and cons of vaccination should be made widely available first. “Not every woman owns a phone or internet, or has a doctor to explain global data,” he said. Gynaecologist Dr Kiran Coelho said she had multiple queries but hadn’t given out letters yet. “In the US, 20,000 pregnant women vaccinated with Moderna and Pfizer shots have not shown anything to worry about. The only contraindication is use of a live attenuated vaccine, which neither of the Indian vaccines are,” she said, adding she would recommend it to patients. On Tuesday, 34,265 people got the shot, taking the count to 3014743. It means a third of city’s estimated population of 9 million who qualify forthe jab have got at least one shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-wont-defy-natl-policy-on-jabs-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/82961863.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “The fatality rate in the second wave of Covid-19 has been higher as compared to the first wave. The maximum number of deaths occurred in the age group 41 to 60 during the second wave. Overall, a majority of the Covid-19 patients who died were suffering from comorbidity. In several cases, patients reported late and were in a critical condition by the time they were admitted to hospital. We have all the required arrangements to ensure patients get adequate treatment. Over 95% of Covid-19 patients have recovered.” The CMO added, “ A majority of the people being tested Covid-19 positive in the district are youngsters. The main reason behind this is violation of Covid-19 protocol. However, we are seeing a high level of awareness among youngsters regarding vaccination. To prevent getting infected, they need to strictly wear a face mask and maintain social distancing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/39-covid-19-deaths-in-age-group-of-41-to-60-years-in-agra/articleshow/82952006.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Kochi||Kerala: Nair Service Society slams opposition leader over views on community outfits||KOTTAYAM: Nair Service Society (NSS) criticised opposition leader VD Satheesan for his approach towards religious and community organizations and its leaders. NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair also urged KPCC to make its stand clear regarding the protection of faith in the case of Sabarimala devotees. Unlike his predecessor Ramesh Chennithala, Satheesan has not been in the good books of NSS. After becoming the opposition leader, Satheesan had severely criticized the intervention of community leaders in politics. Nair, in a press note, said that the leadership of Congress party should analyse whether it is the tradition of the party to make such low-level criticisms against religious and community organizations. “Religious and community organizations should not intervene in internal issues of political parties. However, these organizations have the right, same as an individual, to assess and express opinion about the functioning of political parties,” he said, adding that KPCC should state the policies of the party and not the opposition leader. Seeking the help of religious-community organizations when need arises and disowning them afterwards is not the right way, he added. He said that a majority of candidates, irrespective of the political party they represent, had come to NSS seeking support. NSS has not taken a stand against political parties during elections. Though a reaction to a question from a TV reporter on polling day was made into a controversy, the NSS was not against political parties, he alleged. Nair added that Satheesan too had come to NSS seeking help in the recently-held assembly elections. He had spent almost an hour at NSS headquarters and personally met the taluk leadership and karayogam, seeking help. And now he appears delighted by the latest position and keeps making such cheap statements, Nair alleged. NSS will continue to its earlier stand on political parties and fronts. It will approve all good things done by the government and if anything wrong is noticed, it will be conveyed to the government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nss-slams-oppn-leader-over-views-on-community-outfits/articleshow/82954017.cms||---

Since Std X board exams have been cancelled this year, CBSE students will get marks based on their internal assessments done throughout the year. But the bone of contention for parents could be the ‘averaging of marks’ policy. A school principal said, “The marks being given by us have to fall within a specified range of the last three years’ average. There is both a good and bad side to this. Good news is that an academically underperforming batch of 2021 can get rated higher if the previous batches had performed well.” On the flip side, a better performing batch may find its grades restricted. Another principal said, “It’s going to be tricky, especially for those schools who really have a super performing batch this year. They won’t be able to justify the steep rise in marks and will be forced to limit it to the range specified by CBSE.” The senior academic added that parents won’t be convinced either way. “No parent likes to hear that their child is really not that good at studies. Similarly, those with academically brilliant kids always feel that their child has been given a few marks less.” Teacher of a well-known CBSE school said most of them are dreading their results’ day. “It’s something which many teachers are now talking about. Internal evaluation policy is going to leave us with some very unhappy and even angry parents,” the teacher said. A teacher from Chandrapur said their school was faced with a unique problem. “This is my second batch of Std X as we are a new school. So, obviously I can’t go with the three-year average score,” said the teacher. However, CBSE has declared a policy related to such schools wherein they can go with two-year average. “And therein lies a bigger problem,” said the teacher. “My last year’s batch was academically very weak; around 65% kind of track record. This time, we are looking at students who can easily score 80% plus. But they will be denied this grade because it will breach CBSE’s policy on staying within a specific range,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-schools-fear-parents-reaction-post-std-x-evaluation/articleshow/82952038.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kochi||Kerala: While most doctors face pay cuts, some manage perks||KOCHI: Despite a flood of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals in the second wave, a majority of Covid warriors —doctors— now suffer salary cuts. However, a few doctors on Covid duty, demand and get special perks too. Since the second wave peak, there has been almost 75% drop in non-Covid patients and even elective surgeries have been completely stopped. Though there is a surge in critical Covid patients in the hospitals, the price cap on treatment and essential items means that the profits of hospitals have dwindled. This has resulted in 30% to 50% salary cuts in hospitals, mainly small and medium hospitals. Kerala is one of the few states with one doctor per 300 population. The World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribes a doctor population ratio of 1:1,000. “There is an understanding with the doctors that if there is no income from patients, then it would be difficult for hospitals, especially small and medium, to continue paying the old salaries. However, in private hospitals where Covid patients are being treated, doctors on Covid duty are demanding and getting an incentive too,” said Dr Joseph Benaven, secretary, Kerala Private Hospitals Association (KPHA). The incentive varies from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 per day, depending on the type of hospital and speciality. “While some managements have cut salaries, many have promised to compensate when they start earning. After a major dip in revenue during the national lockdown in the first wave, hospitals had started getting patients and doing good business. But now again, the situation is grim and revenue has dipped by more than 50%,” said Dr Gopikumar P, secretary, IMA, Kerala chapter. Hospital managements said that the minimum wage roll for nursing and other staff brought in by the state government in 2019 had created economic stress for everybody in the system. Added to this, is the financial impact due to Covid-19. Along with salary cuts, some have been asked to go on a few days unpaid furlough. “There is no concurrence on the issue of salary cut. Doctors are our strength. But hospitals which have reached the bottom of the barrel may be taking such decisions. It is a tough time for many,” said Dr M I Sahadulla, president, Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter). This has increased stress and anxiety among the doctors. “There are signs of burnout and emotional strain among the doctors due to patient overload, along with more patient deaths. Also, now there is an interim fear that they may also turn Covid positive as there are doubts about the quality of PPE kits due to price control. For many, there is no incentive and it’s all very demotivating,” said psychiatrist Dr CJ John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/while-most-docs-face-pay-cuts-some-manage-perks/articleshow/82954022.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Vaccine effect? Mortality in 45+ age group sees a drop||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: There has been an evident dip in mortality rates in various age appropriate categories since the middle of April in the district, probably reinforcing the importance of vaccination. Analysis of incidence of cases in people of 45 plus age category shows that there isn’t much difference in the number of cases before and after the second wave gathered strength. However, mortality rates have dropped sharply in the same time period for around six age categories and only probable reason could be the efficacy of vaccination. The biggest difference has been noted in two categories; 60-69 and 70-79. Before April 18, there were 291 deaths in 60-69 category and after April 18, 135 persons died in this category while the number of cases have not differed much in the two periods. As for 70-79 age category, before and after the middle of April, number of deaths dropped from 219 to 124. Again, there wasn’t much difference in the number of infections in this age group for two different periods. The mortality rates of age group 80-89 dropped from 6.94% to 3.52%. In 90 plus category, mortality came down from 9.29% to 2.48% and this was one group where number of infections increased; from 269 to 323 in period before and after April. The mortality rates for other age groups like 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69 also showed decline like 0.32% to 0.25% and 0.99 to 0.66% and 2.46% to 1.23%, respectively. The similar incidence of cases is attributed to break through infections where people in these age groups fell prey to disease even after getting inoculated but still saved themselves from progressing into dangerous and life threatening phases of Covid-19. The vaccination programme began in January. The first group included healthcare and frontline workers. The second age appropriate category to receive Covid-19 vaccine was persons over 60 years of age, persons between 45 and 59 years with comorbid conditions which started from March 1 and general public over 45 years of age which started on April 1. On May 1, 2021, 18-44 group vaccination started. Thiruvananthapuram had a target group of 11.86 lakh people in the age appropriate category; above 45 years. As per the figures available on May 24, 6,15,207 people have taken the first dose, which is 52% of the target and only 1,63,293 have completed the second dose in the age appropriate category. Meanwhile the district reported 3,131 Covid cases cases on Tuesday. Of these, 2,978 people have been infected through local contacts and six among them are health workers. As many as 3,112 people recovered from the virus. At present, 17,990 persons are under treatment for Covid-19 in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vaccine-effect-mortality-in-45-age-group-sees-a-drop/articleshow/82954018.cms||Aswin J Kumar

With 1,549 fresh infections and 2,081 recoveries, the state’s active case count dropped slightly to 15,705. However, there has been no real respite from the deaths, as 39 more persons, inluding a DySP of the Goa police, succumbed to the virus on Tuesday. While Goa Medical College (GMC) reported 19 deaths, 11 died at the South Goa district hospital, and five at various private hospitals. Five people were declared brought dead. One of these, a 73-year-old man, had been ill for ten days prior, but had only done the Covid test. In most of these cases, it has been found that the deceased were in home isolation after testing positive for a week or more. Nine of the day’s mortalities were under 50. A 39-year-old man from Malim, who had multiple comorbidities, was the youngest. A 41-year old man from Dona Paula and a 73-year-old woman from Margao died within 24 hours of hospitalisation. The mortality bulletin revealed that four of the deceased had been vaccinated with the first dose. Meanwhile, the Margao urban health centre continues to have the highest caseload across centres, with 1,480 active cases. In North Goa, Candolim, Chimbel, Panaji and Porvorim and in South Goa, Ponda Vasco, and Cortalim have between 500 and 1,000 cases.

---||Agra||4 young priests offer free cremation and ritual ceremonies in Mathura||AGRA: Touched by the sight of numerous bodies of suspected Covid victims floating in Ganga and buried near the ghats, four young priests from Mathura have decided to not only bear the expenses of cremation of those who can’t pay but also conduct all mandatory rituals for them free of cost. The priests — Shashank Pathak, 30, Girish Vashishtha, 35, Saurabh Sharma, 26 and Amit Bhardwaj, 51 — have been doing this free service for the past one week and have conducted two cremations and one “terahvin”. Two more are scheduled for next Monday. Of these, one body was received from the district hospital— Jagdish Prasad, 65, whose family had allegedly thrown him out of the house and refused to perform his cremation. Pathak, who did his LLB after obtaining an MCom degree, said, “Cremation ceremony is very important in Hindu culture. Disposing of a body without a proper cremation means an insult to the dead.” The total expenses for cremation and other rituals is Rs 14,000-15,000 and we try to provide peace to the departed soul by giving a respectful funeral,” Pathak said. He said that they have circulated their contact numbers to hospitals. “Those who know us can also contact us if such a death happens in their neighbourhood,” he said. Recently, a rickshaw puller, Amar, 70, died in his house. The family was very poor. They didn’t have money to even eat properly. One of the locals contacted the priests, who arranged an ambulance and took the body to the cremation ground where all rituals were performed. Another priest, Amit Bhardwaj, who works as an accountant in a degree college in Mathura, said, “Jal samadhi (immersion of the bodies in water) rituals are usually done for saints and are not for common men.” He added, “Instead of making sitting arrangements for Brahmins on the 13th day of the death, we are providing them food packets due to the surge in Covid-19 cases.” So far, they have been spending their personal savings for this work. “If we are unable to support this initiative on our own, we will seek support from committees involved in religious activities,” said Bhardwaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/4-young-priests-offer-free-cremation-and-ritual-ceremonies-in-mathura/articleshow/82952028.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Allahabad||On BJP MLA plea, HC asks Gzb DM tofile reply on black-marketing of oxygen||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court recently directed the district magistrate, Ghaziabad to file his personal affidavit in a PIL alleging black-marketing of oxygen in the district, resulting in alleged deaths of several Covid-19 patients during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The court also asked the DM to file the report of the inquiry instituted by him in this regard following a complaint filed by the petitioner Nand Kishor, a sitting MLA from Loni assembly constituency of Ghaziabad, alleging involvement of Shailendra Kumar Singh, ADM (City), Ghaziabad and some other persons in black-marketing of oxygen. Hearing the PIL filed by the BJP MLA, a division bench comprising Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Sadhna Rani (Thakur) directed to post this matter on June 7, 2021 for the next hearing. In the PIL, the petitioner requested the court to direct a CBI probe against the ADM (City) and some other persons for their alleged involvement in black-marketing and illegal diversion of oxygen to Delhi, Haryana, etc, “resulting in the deaths of scores of Covid patients in Ghaziabad and nearby areas”. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate SFA Naqvi contended that the ADM (city) was in-charge of oxygen distribution in Ghaziabad, and under his nose black-marketing of oxygen was taking place. “Ghaziabad has several oxygen plants and can easily sustain and fulfil the entire oxygen demand in the district. Regardless, the city has been facing a shortage of medical oxygen and there is a sheer violation of citizen’s rights guaranteed under Article 14 (right to equality), Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) and other provisions of the constitution of India,” the senior advocate argued. In order to prove his allegations, the petitioner had filed some audio and video clips along with the petition. Appearing on behalf of the state government, additional advocate general Manish Goyal submitted before the court that shortage of oxygen was not reported in said district during the period of complaint, that was in the last week of April, 2021, and the allegations in this regard in the writ petition are baseless. The AAG further submitted that an inquiry has been instituted by the DM on the complaint (dated May 1, 2021) filed by the petitioner before the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Ghaziabad. An order dated April 5, 2021, had been passed by the district magistrate appointing Ms. Asmita Lal, chief development officer (CDO), Ghaziabad as inquiry officer to look into the allegations levelled the complaint of the petitioner. He, however, admitted that the inquiry report has not been submitted so far. On which, the court directed the DM to file his personal affidavit, bring on record the inquiry report and fixed June 7 as the next date of hearing in the case.

Vice-chancellor Dr Rajasree M S approved the recommendations of the academic and examination sub-committees of the syndicate in this regard, the varsity authorities said here on Tuesday. Students can appear for the exams from their homes. Detailed guidelines for the conduct of the examination is expected to be published soon on the university website. The certificates and grade cards would be made available to students by the third week of July, taking into account the students’ campus placement and higher learning opportunities, the vice-chancellor informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ktu-to-conduct-online-exams-for-final-sem/articleshow/82954046.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Teachers pool in lakhs for families of dead colleagues||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Kunwar Pal, 44, a primary teacher in Saharanpur, died on April 10 while riding a scooter to a panchayat poll office for training. Doctors said he suffered a heart attack. Pal left behind wife, Kiran, and an eight-year-old son. About 460km away in Lakhimpur Kheri, another government teacher breathed his last in a hospital. Ravi Prakash had contracted Covid-19 during panchayat poll duty on April 8. His wife Sarita said that he was rushed to a hospital in Moradabad where he died on April 16. Staring at an uncertain future, Kiran and Sarita got some relief when their bank accounts were credited with Rs 19lakh and Rs 20lakh respectively. Even as prominent unions in Uttar Pradesh sweat it out to ensure government compensation for the teachers who have died due to Covid-19 after panchayat polls, an association launched by a group of five teachers a year ago was financially helping grief-struck families by pooling money. Within a year of its launch, the Teacher Self-Care Team (TSCT) now has 24,000 teachers as its members. “I will never forget the favour of the TSCT,” Sarita said. In the last few months, the association has helped the families of 11 teachers. Of them four had died of Covid-19. “And 45 families of the TSCT members, who died during the pandemic, are in the queue and we are collecting money for them,” said a member of the union. Among them is the family of government teacher Pradeep Kumar Tripathi who died of Covid-19 soon after taking part in panchayat poll training in Pratapgarh. His son, Shivam Tripathi, said, “TSCT has started the drive to collect money for my family. So far, Rs 7lakh has been collected.” The association drew its most members from the group of 72,825 teachers who were appointed during Mayawati regime. But their appointment was struck down when Akhilesh Yadav came to power in 2012. They were re-appointed by the Supreme Court in 2016 after a four-year long legal battle. In 2020, five of these teachers came together to form the welfare group on social media. The support grew and soon the association had 24,000 teachers as its members. Most of them contribute Rs100 when a member of the group dies. The group shares the bank account details of the family of the deceased on its website and the amount is directly credited to the nominee’s account. Co-founder of the association, Farrukh Hasan, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, said, “When we were fighting for appointment in the Supreme Court, two teachers of our group died. To give some relief to their families we had collected a couple of lakh rupees after contributing Rs 100 each from thousands of members.” It later led to the formation of the association, he said. The other four members are Vivek Nand Arya and Sudesh Pandey from Allahabad, Mahendra Verma from Maharajganj and Sanjeev Rajak from Balia. Arya is the founder of the organization while all four are co-founders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/teachers-pool-money-in-up-to-pass-on-lakhs-within-days-to-kin-of-dead-colleagues/articleshow/82952044.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||India||3 held as anger rises against Lakshadweep administrator||KOCHI: In the first sign of a crackdown on protests against Lakshadweep administrator Praful Patel over policy changes that are seen as challenging local traditions, island police on Tuesday arrested three people — two of them students — for allegedly texting him “abusive” messages. The police freed the trio later in the day. The arrests came even as Patel’s move to clamp a blanket beef ban and lift liquor restrictions, among other proposals, stoked outrage beyond the idyllic archipelago and adjoining Kerala. V D Satheesan, leader of the opposition in Kerala, wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah, urging him to recall the administrator at the earliest. Rajya Sabha MP Elamaram Kareem too has separately written to President Ram Nath Kovind asking for Patel to be replaced. Amid the public and political backlash against the UT administrator, an April 20 letter from BJP’s Lakshadweep general secretary HK Mohammed Kasim to PM Narendra Modi surfaced online, indicating that not everyone within the party was happy with him either. In the letter, Kasim accuses the administrator of halting several welfare schemes, shutting 15 schools and terminating the services of 500 temporary employees. Kasim said on Tuesday that some of the proposed amendments had “inconvenienced” the local population and he thought it fit to bring this to the PM’s notice. Padma Shri awardee Ali Manikfan, a Lakshadweep native based in Kozhikode, articulated the reasons for the UT’s resistance to the changes being “foisted” on the people since January. He said the administrator should have first tried to learn about the way of life and traditions of the people inhabiting the atolls. “New laws and reforms should be implemented only after holding consultations with the local population,” said Manikfan, an expert in marine biology and astronomy. “There is no need for stringent laws like the draft prevention of anti-social activities regulation.” Besides the draft Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation 2021, which proposes to make sale of beef and related products punishable with up to 10 years in jail, the decisions that have raised the hackles of the islanders include a regulation granting sweeping powers to the local development authority for land acquisition. A proposed two-child norm for all existing and future panchayat members is another pain point.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-held-as-anger-rises-against-lakshadweep-administrator/articleshow/82960455.cms||---

The judge also directed the commissioner to furnish a report on restoration and renovation works on the fort and structures located within its precincts along with details of efforts made to strengthen the walls. He wondered why the authorities were keeping quiet even after the legal hurdles were removed to protect the precincts of the historical fort under the provisions and rules of AP Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960. The Lokayukta sought details of development of a link road from the national highway to the fort. “Also explain in your affidavit the steps taken to restore jail khana (prison house), koneru (pond) and museum in the fort,” Justice Lakshman Reddy said.  He also directed the Ibrahimpatnam mandal revenue officer to convey to the court of Lokayukta the staus of appeals preferred by people whose pattas were cancelled on account of their location within the precincts. Amaravathi metropolitan development wing’s commissioner was directed to inform about the steps he has taken to cancel the layout permissions given to sites in the vicinity of the fort. Asking the state tourism and culture department’s special chief secretary to convey the steps taken to develop the area into a tourist spot, the Lokayukta said: “Landscaping needs to be done and there is a need to set up food courts and drinking water facility near the fort area.” He would review the status of his order on July 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-lokayukta-kondapalli-fort-a-prohibited-area/articleshow/82956355.cms||---

---||Meerut||Over 10,000 Uttar Pradesh prisoners released on bail, parole||MEERUT: In compliance with the Supreme Court directives, a total of 10,123 undertrials and convicts were either granted interim bail or parole in order to decongest the over-crowded UP jails in the wake of the second wave of the Covid-19 infection. As many as 8,463 undertrails were released on bail while 1,660 convicts were given a parole of six weeks, state prison department confirmed. TOI had earlier reported that following the directions of a high-powered committee (HPC), the state's prison department began compiling a list of prisoners eligible for a 60-day parole. Of the total 10,123 released from 71 central and state prisons, a maximum of 704 undertrial inmates were released on interim bail from Ghaziabad district prison, followed by 445 in Aligarh, 398 in Lucknow and 397 in Gautam Budh Nagar. There are a lakh inmates lodged at prisons across the state. The department had come up with 54 temporary jails in as many districts where suspects arrested in fresh cases were quarantined for 14 days before they were moved to permanent ones. As per the data of the jail department, as on May 21, there are 824 active Covid-19 cases. “More than 24,000 inmates above the age of 45 have been vaccinated,” the department said in a statement. Earlier, HPC consisting of Acting Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court Justice Sanjay Yadav, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and director general (prisons), UP, Anand Kumar had issued orders and sought a list of eligible prisoners in compliance with a Supreme Court directive. A similar exercise was undertaken last year during the first Covid-19 wave and 11,000 prisoners were granted parole. Several inmates had jumped parole after which efforts were made to trace them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/over-10k-prisoners-released-on-interim-bail-parole-from-71-up-prisons/articleshow/82952054.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Travel agents seek sops, assure to pay back||Nagpur: The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) has written to Prime Minister Narendra demanding a tax holiday, along with other sops, to help them recoup losses brought about by the pandemic. TAAI said government should step in immediately and help the sector survive till things turn to normal. The letter said, “Travel agents, tour operators and their employees have not even been able to do a business of more than 5% as compared to the pre-lockdown times.” It said the blow has been made worse because other existing issues. “With no respite in statutory compliances like PF, ESIC, professional tax, GST, income tax, TDS etc. and with the introduction of the new irrational tax like TCS ensures that our establishments are forced to close down,” the letter added. TAAI has asked for an income tax holiday for next five years. “There should also be a moratorium for at least two years on all loan EMIs for our staff and members. Grant of Rs 10,000/- per month per employee until normalcy resumes,” the letter said. It also added that the association was not looking for “alms” and will instead pay back this amount of Rs 10,000 per month. “This shall be paid back, free of interest to the government in installments over 24 months or deducted at 15% of their salary and paid back to the exchequer. Fresh collateral free loans/overdraft faciltities to our member organisations and personnel be provided at rebated interest for a period of at least five years,” said TAAI. With digital payments becoming the norm, travel agents say Centre must help them reduce this burden. “Credit card companies / banks are charging between 2% to 3.5% for payments. This must be reduced to 0.5%. Digital India, which was initiated by you, has lost steam. The airlines are also not accepting digital payments due higher charges by the banks,” said TAAI’s letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/travel-agents-seek-sops-assure-to-pay-back/articleshow/82952078.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cong takes on Governor over nominations||Mumbai: State Congress president Nana Patole on Tuesday took on Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over nominations to the legislative council. Patole said his attention had been drawn to a letter by Raj Bhavan public information officer and under-secretary Jairaj Choudhary to RTI activist Anil Galgali. Choudhary informed Galgali that the information sought by him was not available with the public information officer (administration), as such, and it can’t be given. “I have been told that the information sought by Galgali is not available with Choudhary, but available with the Governor, who is suppressing the list. The episode reflects the collapse of administration at Raj Bhavan,’’ Patole said. Galgali had submitted an application under RTI on April 20, 2021, to the Raj Bhavan public information officer. He sought the list of nominees submitted by senior cabinet members to Raj Bhavan on November 6, 2020, for nomination to the legislative council. Choudhary informed Galgali that the list was not available with his office and that if he was not satisfied by the reply, he can file an appeal before the competent authority. Galgali had also knocked on the doors of the chief minister and chief minister’s office for securing information, but he was refused the information as no final decision has been taken on the nominations. It appears it was error on the part of the PIO, since the office of the PIO can’t be separated from Raj Bhavan, as pointed out by Patole. A senior bureaucrat said it was a piquant situation for Raj Bhavan owing to prolonged delay in taking a decision on nominations. “No doubt, no time-frame has been fixed for taking a decision on the recommendation made by the cabinet, but it is expected that the decision will be taken in a reasonable period. A reply too will have to be submitted before the high court following a public interest litigation,’’ he said.  “The governor can approve a few names and send back the remaining to the government for more information,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-takes-on-governor-over-nominations/articleshow/82958091.cms||---
---||Mumbai||B.1.617 mutation found in 1/3rd samples from Mumbai||MUMBAI: The B.1.617 variant of the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus is in circulation in Mumbai and was found in at least a third of the samples from the city reported online recently. While the Union government hasn't yet given city-specific data on B.1.617 and its sub-lineages—which were labelled as variants of concern (VoC) by World Health Organisation—data from global initiatives such as GISAID confirm the presence of B.1.617's three sub-lineages 1, 2 and 3 in Mumbai and surrounding cities. (The B.1.617 was first detected in Covid-positive samples collected for genome sequencing from Maharashtra's Vidarbha region and has since been found in 44 other countries.) GISAID is a collaboration among scientists and enables them to share genetic sequencing data related to Covid-19 in a freely accessible database. While not all scientists may upload data on GISAID, it gives a fair idea of variants in circulation in various parts of the world.The GISAID data, shared by Foundation for Medical Research director Dr Nerges Mistry, showed that of the 165 samples sequenced from Mumbai, B.1.617.1 was found in 51 samples (31%) and the other two sub-lineages were found in 2 and 1 samples respectively. Officially, however, there is no word on the variant’s presence in Mumbai; foreign scientists have, meanwhile, linked the emergence of the B.1.617 variants with the second wave. When contacted, BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the central government had not shared information about the detection of B.1.617 in Mumbai (every week, samples are sent from Mumbai to National Institute of Virology for genetic sequencing). The state task force on Covid-19 held a briefing on genomic sequencing for its members on Monday.  GISAID data for Maharashtra showed that of 3,882 samples sequenced, the B.1.617.1 variant was found in 24% samples. Across the country, 10% of the 15,282 samples had B.1.617.1 while the other sub-lineages accounted for 1,255 (8%) and 77 (1%). The breakup is of significance because the Centre—despite having set up a consortium of 10 laboratories called INSACOG for gene sequencing—has so far given out only broad figures. On Monday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said B.1.617 has become the dominating Covid-19 variant in India, accounting for 55% of all variants of concern detected in India through genome sequencing so far. He said 25,739 Covid-positive samples were sequenced by INSACOG till Monday morning. Of these, 9,508 had VoC and the B.1.617 variant was found in 5,261 samples, making it the most common mutation till now. Dr Mistry, who found the B.1.617 sub-lineage 3 in a couple of samples sequenced in her Worli lab, said sequencing is important for public health measures. “We can find out which cluster has variants and plan accordingly,” she said. She said Mumbai/India could start sequencing from waste water samples. ``We cannot always take samples from individuals, but we could take samples from toilets in hospitals, homes, water treatment plant to find the variants in circulation,’’ said Dr Mistry. One of the most important uses of surveillance is to get information for vaccines. ``We have to start getting information for preparation of second generation Covid vaccine,'' she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/b-1-617-mutation-found-in-1/3rd-samples-from-mumbai/articleshow/82956436.cms||Malathy Iyer

The team first asked to take all patients on oxygen cylinder mode so that they could close the main line and repair it. Later the team repaired the valves, lines, panel and other equipment and made the system leak proof. After the recent incident of oxygen supply failure in the Covid ward of JLN Hospital because of technical problem, the district administration sought help from the army administration. Sources said the hospital did not have technicians who could handle such a situation and therefore there were complaints of leakage of oxygen from the plant. Following a request from the district administration, a team from the 24 field workshop of 475 Engineer Brigade of Army cantonment had reached JLN Hospital. At the time, there were around 450 patients oxygen support in the Covid ward, but the team managed to put them on regular supply from cylinders while they worked on the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/army-repairs-oxygen-plant-in-ajmers-jln-hospital/articleshow/82956382.cms||---

The woman was returning home when she was allegedly harassed by the youths. And when she narrated the incident at home, her family members went to the accused’s home and confronted them. It led to a clash in which four persons from the woman’s family were injured. As the clash involved people from different faiths, heavy police force was rushed to the area. “My daughter had gone out to throw garbage when the youth harassed her. We went to the accused home, but, instead of talking, the family became aggressive. They pulled out lathis and also pelted stones on us. Two of our family members sustained injuries while another two were mildly hurt,” the woman’s father said. Circle officer (CO) City Sangram Singh, said, “Both the groups are neighbours. Police reached at the nick of time and had to use mild force to disperse the crowd. In all 14 persons including Nadeem Ahmad, Mohd Danish and Farman Ahmad have been booked under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with dangerous weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 336(endanger human life), and 354(criminal force to any woman). Efforts are on to arrest them.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/4-injured-in-clash-over-harassment-of-woman-on-bulandshahr/articleshow/82952087.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Rajkot||Covid fear affecting mental health in second wave too||Rajkot: The demons in the head can be as dangerous as the real ones. That’s what a survey, conducted to gauge the impact of Covid’s second wave on mental health of the society, has revealed. The survey was carried out by the psychology department of Saurashtra University (SU) recently. According to the varsity’s psychologists, a negative mindset, developed due to the fear of Covid, also leads to physical sickness among some people. Yogesh Jogsan, head of psychology department of SU, and Dhara Doshi, assistant professor, carried out survey of 1,710 people in Rajkot and surrounding area. “In our survey 24.30% people admitted that the status, pictures and videos on social media highlighting the pandemic had created imaginary fear in them,” Jogsan said. In all 1,026 women and 684 men participated in the survey. Many participants among these said that they suffered from panic attacks after reading or watching the news about shortage of beds, medicine and oxygen. The panic attacks resulted in many respondents developing imaginary coronavirus symptoms and breathing problems. “As many as 19.10% of respondents said that they started fearing about what would happen to them if they get infected after hearing about medical infrastructure crumbling during the second wave of the pandemic.” Around 10% of the respondents revealed that they panicked after hearing ambulance sirens. Many spent sleepless nights after being disturbed by the sound of sirens. Also, people feared for their fate after the demise of Covid-infected relatives or friends. “The conclusion of this survey is that there are many people suffering from mental illness not due to Covid but because of its fear. An imaginary illness develops during a pandemic which has the same symptoms like physical illness but the cause of it is not the body but the mind,” Jogsan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-fear-affecting-mental-health-in-second-wave-too/articleshow/82952096.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Pune||Curbs strain ties of grain traders & eateries’ owners in Pune||PUNE: The prolonged Covid restrictions have started showing signs of strained relationship between the restaurant/eatery owners and the wholesale grain merchants, supplying raw material to the former. At least two prominent wholesale grain merchants from the Gultekdi Market Yard and the Satara Road have approached the Pune police’s crime branch with complaint applications stating that seven to eight restaurant/eatery owners had outstanding dues of Rs5 lakh to Rs10 lakh each since January/February last year despite an extended term. The grain merchants claimed that the eatery owners were consistently citing lack of business and earning source behind their inability to clear the dues. No FIR has been registered yet, but assistant commissioner of police (crime) Surendra Deshmukh told TOI, “We shall conduct an inquiry before taking any decision on action. It’s a difficult situation for either party under the prevailing circumstances. We have asked the eateries to return the grains, if not used, to the merchants or to arrive at some consensus for now. The wholesalers are ready to take back the grains and other eatables (if in good condition) instead of money.” Deshmukh said, “The wholesalers claimed that two restaurants had shut down their operations and sold their utensils, furniture, and other valuables but did not pay the dues of the wholesalers.” One of the affected grain merchants told TOI, “A restaurant operator from Wanowrie ordered grains and other eatables from me in February last year. The restaurant is an old customer of mine and generally I give credit period of 90 days to my clients to pay me the bills. I gave him a grace period twice, but the operator failed to pay me.” Ganesh Shetty, the president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, told TOI, “The dispute arose when the wholesalers refused to take back the unused raw material from the restaurant owners. Every restaurant buys bulk of raw material from the wholesalers on credit. The wholesalers provide credit only to those who are known to them.” He said, “Last year, all restaurants and eateries remained closed for eight months during the lockdown and phased relaxation period. Some of them had used just a part of the raw material in their stock. The wholesalers could have easily taken back the remaining items and sold them, but they refused to do so in many cases. A fresh round of closure this year has only made the matters worse.” Popatlal Ostwal, president, Poona Merchants Chamber, said, “The situation is very critical. The traders have delivered grains and eatables worth crores of rupees and restaurants and hotel operators have failed to make the payments in last one year. Even traders need money to survive. We hope the hotels and restaurants will start working soon and we shall get back our dues from them.” A cafe owner, requesting anonymity, said he had to pay more than Rs2 lakh to different wholesalers. “They have not taken action against me as they know me well, but I am under a lot of stress due to this. I am planning to sell off my restaurant at whatever price I get and clear the dues once and for all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-strain-ties-of-grain-traders-eateries-owners/articleshow/82956422.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Following the recovery, a probe under additional district magistrate Jainath Yadav has been initiated. A senior police officer termed the discovery of the ballot papers as a conspiracy to hamper the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected pradhans. People behind it would be brought to justice, he added. According to villagers, the ballot papers were of the recent panchayat polls in the state. Local authorities, however, are yet to clarify on the matter. “A probe has been initiated. It appears to be an attempt to hamper the swearing-in ceremony of the newly-elected pradhans.

The business development unit (BDU) of Central Railway has added new traffic of metallurgical coke from the loading point at Wardha. “At the rate of Rs48 lakh per rake, we will earn Rs4.8 crore by loading 10 rakes from Uttam Value Steel Limited, Wardha, to Kakinada seaport, a distance of 808km,” said Krishnath Patil, senior divisional commercial manager (SrDCM). The first rake was dispatched on Wednesday. Compelled to look into new business avenues in the aftermath of the pandemic, divisional railway manager (DRM) Richa Khare has been pitching for adding new commodities to the parcel section. “Prior to adding metallurgical coke, we transported 14 rail milk tankers from Nagpur to Delhi. Each tanker contained 40,000-litre milk. We earned Rs 14 lakh from it. This has not only helped save time to ferry perishable commodity like milk but also saved money as compared to road transport,” said Patil. During the financial year 2020-21, the Nagpur division earned over Rs130 crore by operating 407 rakes. This was done by tapping into commodities like dolomite, fly ash, automobile, iron slag, food grains (wheat, rice, maize), cotton husk, sugar, edible oil and cotton bales. ACM (Goods) SG Rao said, “From April 1 to 30, 2021, we operated 35 rakes by transporting above commodities and generated revenue of Rs11.29 crore. Similarly, from May 1 to 23, we operated 25 rakes generating Rs7.50 crore.” Last year, the Central Railway revived ‘Orange Kisan Rails’ after a gap of more than a decade. It has boosted the agriculture-based industry and helped farmers increase their income by transporting in an economical and time-saving mode. Metallurgical coke is a porous, fissured, silver-black solid. It is an important part of the iron-making process since it provides the carbon and heat required to chemically reduce iron burden in the blast furnace to produce hot metal. On the new commodity, Patil stated that most of the metallurgical coke is used in iron and steel industry processes such as blast furnaces, sinter plants, and foundries to reduce iron ore to iron. Over 90% of the total metallurgical coke production is dedicated to blasting furnace operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/transporting-metallurgical-coke-to-earn-c-rly-rs4-8cr/articleshow/82985368.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

In its interim order, the division bench said that eradication or at least prevention by inoculation becomes a viable alternative and states could work with the Centre on ensuring vaccinations for all. Stating that media reports indicated that the RBI dividend for the financial year 2021 has exceeded the budget estimate and the total cost for inoculating the entire population would be Rs 68,500 crore at the rate of Rs 250 per dose, as fixed for supply to state governments. The Centre will still have to raise Rs 1.75 lakh crore to reach the fiscal deficit target of 6.8% of the GDP in the financial Year 2022. However, the continued lockdowns now imposed as a preventive measure to curb the spread of the pandemic has already impacted actual tax collection and payments. Coupled with this is the loss occasioned in indirect tax revenue due to the reduced demand for commodities because of the diminishing purchasing power of the consumers. Eradication or at least prevention by inoculation hence becomes a viable alternative since normalcy would revive economic activities. The expenditure could also be justified on humanitarian considerations, which is a major expenditure for any welfare. “What we have observed is based on simple arithmetic and not on the complex issues of finance and economics; in which we lack expertise and hence we query the Union government to respond. We are sure the state governments too could assist in such procurement and after the vaccination is completed; the manufacturers could be compensated, if need arises and measures could also be brought in to obtain fair reimbursement from the haves.” The court said that it is aware of its limitations in interfering with policy formulations and “hence at this point refrains from issuing any positive directions but request the policy makers to ponder over our observations.” The case is posted for June 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vax-for-entire-population-only-way-out/articleshow/82954095.cms||---

The team first asked to take all patients on oxygen cylinder mode so that they could close the main line and repair it. Later the team repaired the valves, lines, panel and other equipment and made the system leak proof. After the recent incident of oxygen supply failure in the Covid ward of JLN Hospital because of technical problem, the district administration sought help from the army administration. Sources said the hospital did not have technicians who could handle such a situation and therefore there were complaints of leakage of oxygen from the plant. Following a request from the district administration, a team from the 24 field workshop of 475 Engineer Brigade of Army cantonment had reached JLN Hospital. At the time, there were around 450 patients oxygen support in the Covid ward, but the team managed to put them on regular supply from cylinders while they worked on the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/army-repairs-oxygen-plant-in-ajmers-jln-hospital/articleshow/82964437.cms||---

Distress Management Collective of India (DMCI), a Delhi-based NGO which had been focusing on Covid-control measures in the capital state for the past few months, will set up oxygen parlours in Kerala for patients free of cost. DCMI, with the patronage of the likes of former Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph and former Union minister Alphons Kannanthanam, will be sending around 40 oxygen concentrators to Kerala as demand in the state grows. “DMCI had procured oxygen concentrators for supplying it to needy patients and hospitals when the oxygen demand was very high in Delhi. Now, the oxygen supply in Delhi has improved significantly and the TPR, which was around 40% a month ago, has come down to less than 3%. So, DMCI plans to shift its focus to other states like Kerala and set up oxygen parlours,” said Dr Sakhi John, executive committee member of DCMI and faculty, public health management, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi. The NGO was launched to help the people in Kerala during the 2018 floods. “Our motto is to do whatever I or we can, when somebody badly needs our support. During 2018, we sent a trainload of goods to Kerala to help the flood-ravaged state,” said Justice Joseph, chief patron, DMCI. “Ever since Covid cases started to shoot up in Delhi, we have been trying to support the patients by providing oxygen concentrators, liquid oxygen, medicine and online consultation,” he added. The NGO has been providing online consultation to patients in Delhi, Haryana, etc. “We will be sending 25 oxygen concentrators to Kerala in a couple of days. With the support of various local bodies and health department, we will start oxygen parlours at Covid treatment facilities like CFLTCs in Alappuzha, Kollam and Kannur. In Alappuzha, the district panchayat authorities informed us that they are completing the preparation for setting up oxygen parlours. Patients requiring oxygen support but don’t require hospitalization can go to the parlours and get the support. But, patients with severity will require hospitalization,” said Dr John. DMCI will also provide teleconsultation to patients in Kerala. “We already have a doctors’ panel in Delhi. We are planning to constitute a separate panel, preferably from Kerala itself,” Dr John added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/delhi-ngo-to-roll-out-oxygen-parlours-in-kerala/articleshow/82954130.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Survey in Barmer to identify kids with flu-like symptoms||JAISALMER: Barmer administration will conduct a door-to-door survey across the district, especially in the rural areas, to identify children with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. The move comes in the wake of warning by health experts that the third wave of Covid may hit children the most. The survey will be conducted by village-level core committee members. Barmer collector Lok Bandhu said the second wave did not have much effect on children till now. He said very few children aged 0-6 and 7-18 years were found infected, but none was admitted to hospital and all were treated at home. Out of 15,242 cases in the district from April 1 to May 25, a total of 176 children aged 0-6 years and another 1,215 kids aged 7-18 years were found infected. All were mostly asymptomatic and were treated at home by keeping them in isolation. He said children between 0-6 years found Covid-infected included: 25 children at government hospital Barmer, 12 in government hospital Balotara, 27 in Baytoo, 14 in Balotara, 30 in outer areas of Barmer, 11 in Chauhatan, 17 in Dhorimanna, 11 in Sheo, 13 in Sindhari and 16 in Siwala from April 1 to May 24. Similarly, infected children aged 7-18 years include: 253 in government hospital in Barmer, 56 in Balotara hospital, 176 in Baytoo, 98 in other areas of Balotara, 137 in other areas of Barmer, 67 in Chauhatan, 161 in Dhorimanna, 90 in Sheo, 110 in Sindhari and 67 in Siwana area. During a meeting with officers, he said personnel working at villages should follow Covid guidelines issued by the state government. He said random verification of door-to-door surveys conducted by the village-level core committee was very important and officials should call people with ILI symptoms and distribute medical kits. Bandhu said in order to be prepared for the third wave, village-level committee members should check children with Covid symptoms and make arrangements for proper treatment on time. He also instructed officials to monitor people who have recovered from Covid but were showing symptoms of black fungus. The collector said after making entries of medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators and other gadgets at the block level, it should be informed at the district level. He said effective management of equipment are important after cases reduce at Covid care centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/survey-in-barmer-to-identify-kids-with-flu-like-symptoms/articleshow/82956444.cms||---

Organising physical meetings of residents is not a possibility during the pandemic due to social distancing norms so the social media groups on WhatsApp and pages on Facebook are being used to inform residents about the important numbers and dos and don’ts during and after the cyclone. Many big residential complexes like Sukhobrishti in New Town have even opened a control room to share information with the residents. “We have been using social media to share all important information from phone numbers to what one should do if there is a power outage or water crisis after the cyclone. We could not organise any physical meetings with the residents due to the pandemic as it would have led to crowding. But social media came to our rescue which we have already been using for the pandemic-related support for our residents,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the residents’ association at Sukhobrishti. Till Saturday most RWAs were using social media for information and support related to the pandemic. “We were sharing information like new safe homes in the vicinity to availability of oxygen to requirement of volunteers to help out the senior citizens in the complex. Suddenly the news of Cyclone Yaas making landfall on Wednesday arrived and the entire focus of the social media groups changed,” said Sameer Khatlani, general secretary of Siddhi Housing Complex in Bangur. At Urbana behind Ruby on EM Bypass, the residents’ welfare association has put together a disaster management team comprising electricians, security personnel, carpenters and housekeeping staff. “We have shared the contact numbers and standard operating procedure through social media with all the residents,” said Sanjeev Ganeriwal, former president of the residents’ association of Urbana and a resident of the complex. The housing societies have also urged residents to keep all devices charged so that everybody has access to social media and WhatsApp groups for the latest information. “At the time of such crisis we must have access to the information being given out by the authorities and social media is the only way to do that. So we have already started charging the devices so that even if there is power outage we are not cut off from others,” said Debolina Roy, a resident of Eastern High in New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/complexes-take-e-route-to-get-yaas-ready/articleshow/82954109.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The driver put sudden brakes after noticing a pothole that caused the autorickshaw to roll into a 20-feet deep roadside pit. The couple landed on a rock and suffered severe head injuries. The couple was seated in the vehicle with their children aged nine and five, who survived with minor injuries. The driver also escaped with slight injuries. The Kolad police identified the deceased as Ananta Kadam (49) and Manisha Kadam (47). They were into housekeeping jobs and natives of Majgaon, Tala taluka, Raigad. They were heading from Ananta’s residence to his father-in-law’s house. “The speeding auto-rickshaw driver, Ganesh Khade (38), lost control of the vehicle while trying to dodge a pothole on the Kolad-Roha road at Sambhe village.

At the peak of the ongoing pandemic, the administration that was looking to increase treatment facilities had managed free beds at several private hospitals attached to medical or AYUSH colleges, which included Dhiraj Hospital too.District development officer Kiran Jhaveri said that the hospital had been asked to prepare for a 1,000 facility, out of which 600 beds were ready including 500 with oxygen supply. Patients from other government hospitals as well as health centres in the rural areas of the district were being referred here.The hospital was to be paid money at government rates fixed last year depending on the type of beds. The hospitals also receive smaller amounts towards beds reserved by government that remain vacant.Jhaveri said that officials grew suspicious earlier this month when hospital employees started arguing and misbehaving with officials appointed to monitor and supervise work at the hospital. Also, it came to light that while only a small number of patients were being referred there, the hospital used to show that it was packed.Jhaveri said that it was decided to inspect the hospital on May 13. “It came to light that as per hospital records 329 patients were admitted on free beds earmarked for the government and 140 were admitted on paid beds. We found that there were only 246 patients in all being treated there,” said Jhaveri.Hospital officials argued with the officials and claimed that something was wrong. “We counted the patients again in their presence and found only 234 this time. Two patients had died in the intervening time and 10 were being discharged,” said Jhaveri.The records of the hospital were seized by the district administration. It is also verifying details for the month of April when the hospital had a smaller number of beds reserved for the government. The hospital has been asked to clarify on the issue.Jhaveri said that along with the number of patients, remdesivir injection supply and oxygen consumption are now being looked into. He added that initially they had believed that the hospital may be using free beds as paid beds for its patients. “But that was not the case, the beds were vacant,” Jhaveri said.The hospital, however, has not sought any money for treatment of Covid-19 patients so far. “They have not put up any bills and no payments have been made to the hospital,” the DDO said.Jhaveri, however, pointed out that showing beds filled on paper was itself not justified in the present conditions. “We did not fall short of beds, but if that had happened it was not proper for the hospital to show that its beds were occupied,” said Jhaveri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hosp-shows-free-beds-as-occupied-faces-probe/articleshow/82952240.cms||---

They said seafarers from other states are at an advantage as they are getting the vaccination doses and taking up jobs. Despite the director general of shipping’s plea to treat seafarers as frontline warriors, seafarers from AP are being deprived of jobs because they do not have access to vaccination. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala are giving jabs to seafarers. “Shipping companies are asking for a vaccination certificate but we are not being administered vaccination on priority,” rued 26-year-old seafarer Pawan Sagar Guntu of Visakhapatnam. Mumbai-based All India Seafarers Union (AISU) working president Abhijeet Sangle took up the issue with the Visakhapatnam Port Trust Hospital where the vaccination was supposed to be given for seafarers. He also wrote to the AP government, Union shipping minister and DG shipping asking that vaccine be made available for seafarers at the VPT Hospital. “The number of hospitals where the vaccine is given should be increased,” Sangle said. On May 24, some seafarers went to the VPT Hospital to remind the authorities about the vaccination. “The big issue here is about jobs. Seafarers from Andhra Pradesh are being deprived of jobs only because they do not have access to vaccination,” Sangle said. Pawan Sagar said: “Clearly, seafarers from other states are in a better position as they are getting the vaccination.” Seafarers earn in the range of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 15 lakh and this could be for six months, nine months or a year. AP health and family welfare principal secretary AK Singhal told TOI that the health department is giving priority to those who are deemed to be vulnerable to Covid-19 due to their direct public contact. “These include employees of APSRTC, civil supplies department, judiciary, banks and railways, among others. The remaining sections will be covered in the next phase,” Singhal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-jab-no-job-worry-for-seafarers-from-andhra/articleshow/82956461.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The caller withdrew this huge amount from the victim’s account through 50 transactions in two days. On learning about the cheating, the victim filed a complaint against an unknown person.The caller had introduced him as a bank officer from a special branch informing him about inactivation of his ATM card and lured him into sharing bank and ATM card details along with the OTP received by saying that if he would proceed with renewal of the card immediately, he would be entitled to some perks. According to Som Karan, SHO (Devnagar), a dry cleaner living in Sector 8 of the Chopasni Housing Board area of the city, Jagdish Dagar has an account with SBI, Jeevan Jyoti branch.“He came to us with a complaint that he received an unknown call on May 22. The caller introduced himself as a bank officer from a special branch, who told him that his ATM card was inactivated and if he wanted reactivation immediately, he would be entitled to some perks,” said the officer.Lured by this, Dagar gave his consent and on the request, provided the caller with the details of his bank account, ATM card details as well as the OTP received in the process of the said ‘reactivation’.“After this, the caller withdrew Rs. 13.65 lakh from his account on May 22 and 23 through 50 transactions. Interestingly, the victim received all the messages, the caller sent but none from the bank informing him about the withdrawal. So, he remained in the dark about these transactions from his account,” said the officer. On Monday, Dagar somehow learnt about this and after preliminary inquiry, rushed to the police to complain of cheating against an unknown person.Dagar had a huge amount of Rs 10 lakh credited to his account by way of maturation of his fixed deposit barely 2-3 days back.

---||Delhi||Vax or cancel Boards: Sisodia to Centre||New Delhi: Manish Sisodia has sent his response to the Union education ministry on holding of the Class XII Board exams. Reiterating his stance, he said exams should not be held without vaccinating the students.In a letter to the Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Sisodia said, “I would like to say with humility that neither of the two options presented by the ministry of education is the answer to the challenge before us. Both conditions not only put children at additional risk but also ignore their mental state. The new strain of corona has shaken the entire country. There will hardly be a house that has not lost anyone or anyone they know. At such a time, to tell the children to get ready for the exam is not only insensitive but also fatal.”The Central Board of Secondary Education had suggested either holding exams of only major subjects at the designation centre, or holding exams in the respective schools with the duration of exams reduced.Sisodia, Delhi’s education minister, has asked the central government to take views from experts if the Covishield and Covaxin can be given to those who are 17.5 years of age. Most Class XII students will be in this age group.“If experts agree, 95% of the children of Class XII who are 17 years and above should be given the vaccine on a priority basis. Also, all their teachers who have not yet taken the vaccine for any reason should be given the vaccine immediately. The central government should talk to Pfizer company and buy from them the approved vaccine for children over 12 years of age,” stated Sisodia.In case the central government cannot process the vaccination, Sisodia suggests that the exams be cancelled. “Students’ past performances can be used for tabulating the results. If any of the students are unsatisfied with the results, they can sit for an exam later when the situation improves.”Sisodia also suggested holding an education conference to discuss 2022 Board exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-or-cancel-boards-sisodia-to-centre/articleshow/82952299.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra pushes institutional isolation in 18 districts with high case positivity||MUMBAI: Hours after announcing the end of home isolation in districts with a positivity rate higher than the state’s average on Tuesday, the state government softened its stand saying it will be discouraged and the emphasis will be on institutional quarantine. Of the 36 districts in the state, the weekly positivity rate of 18 districts is higher than the state’s weekly average of 10% . In a review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, it was decided home isolation of Covid patients in these districts should be discouraged and Covid centres should be scaled up to accommodate more patients. The centres will be set up at the village level, and the state allowed districts to spend 25% funds from the grants received under the15th finance commission and also revenue generated by the minor mineral development fund. “The number of patients in home isolation in these 18 districts should be brought down to negligible. We have realised monitoring in home isolation is not effective and the infection spreads to the other family members as well,” said health minister Rajesh Tope after the meeting. He added: “Testing has to be done in a focused manner. Once a person tests positive, all the high and low risks persons should be tested diligently. The state has asked the collectors of the 18 districts to avoid random testing in a large number to artificially lower the positivity rate.” Earlier in the day, Tope had said the state government will completely stop home isolation in these districts. “The announcement had come as a surprise because no district would have that many beds in Covid Care Centres (CCCs). Even now, there is careful selection of patients to be admitted to CCCs given the manpower and infrastructure constraints,” a senior official told TOI. Theoretically, only institutional isolation would have been a good approach, said Sangli civic surgeon Dr Sanjay Salunkhe, but added it would be nearly impossible to implement. Besides manpower and infrastructure, there was the issue of hesitancy. People would have started avoiding the testing that has been ramped up in these districts. Salunkhe added: “The fact is families are not able to follow home isolation. They continue to share toilets, washing facilities.” Home isolation could have been an option in the first wave when the district peaked at 1,174 cases. “In the second wave, we had peaked at 2,300 cases on May 7, but still continue to see 1,400-1,500 cases daily,” he said, adding that the thick tail would mean hospitals would be overwhelmed in a day. Officials said due to lack of monitoring in these districts, the death rate too is going up. “Many patients who are in home isolation are coming to hospital in really bad condition,” said an official. A senior doctor from Gondia Medical College said institutional isolation is the fundamental way to treat an infectious disease. “But the numbers are so overwhelming at present, it’s not a practical solution,” he said. One of the ways to curb the rise in cases is to increase testing in a big way. “But often GPs and community doctors are not recommending it,” he said. At least three districts have over 20% positivity, which means their testing needs to increase four to five fold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pushes-institutional-isolation-in-18-dists-with-high-case-positivity/articleshow/82956484.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Ludhiana||Residents: We should have been told about post-jab issues||Ludhiana: The government and the administration are asking people to get jabbed against Covid-19, but are not counselling them about the post-vaccination complications. Many first-dose vaccinated people are facing different health issues and are clueless about dealing with them. A 39-year-old resident of the Old City said, “I was aware that I may get fever for two days after getting vaccinated. But I had it for three days and was feeling low, besides there was pain in my chest. I was told to get medicine for fever, which broke, but the chest pain continued. Worried, I got my ECG and x-ray done from a private hospital, but the doctors said the vaccination must have caused the pain. They gave medicine for the pain and asked me to consult after a few days.”“I kept feeling unwell, and had no idea about these complications. The administration should keep in touch with the people getting vaccinated to know about their health and if they are facing any issues,” he added. A 42-year-old hosiery businessman said, “After the first dose, I got a fever for a few days and felt low. I was uncomfortable even while using the stairs. I had body ache, headache and fatigue for over a week.” A 40-year-year old resident of Model Gram said, “I live alone in a PG here. I could not get up from bed for three days after getting vaccinated. There was no one to cook for me, so my friends helped me. Even after a few days, I faced breathing problems, especially while using stairs. I feel that the doctors must tell people about the issues they may face after getting the vaccine.” A 38-year-old businessman from Division 3 area, said, “I had heard that the doctors first check the medical history before giving the vaccine. But when I went for vaccination, nobody asked me anything. I was not even kept under observation for 30 minutes after the jab, which should have been done. About three hours later, I got a fever. The body temperature came down with medicine, but it kept increasing every four hours. This continued for three days. Besides, I could not drive due to pain in the arm.” Chief medical officer Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said, “People need time to recover after vaccination. They should take nutritious food, keep themselves hydrated, start excercising slowly and steadily like they can begin with 5-10 minute walk and breathing exercises, among others. As far as vaccination is concerned, beneficiaries are advised on the spot that if they suffer myalgia, body aches or fever, they can have a paracetamol.”“Beneficiaries who are getting vaccinated are healthy people. They can always approach a doctor and can also give a call on helpline 104. Contacts of nodal officers are displayed at the vaccination centres and people can approach them with queries or health issues after vaccination. Fever, body aches, headache and pain in arm can happen after vaccination, but not chest pain. Anxiety can cause this. They should visit a doctor,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/residents-we-should-have-been-told-about-post-jab-issues/articleshow/82952144.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Ludhiana||Changes and restrictions in vax process vex residents||Ludhiana: Residents are furious over frequent changes in the vaccination process, like increasing the gap between the first and the second dose of Covishield, no uniformity in the functioning of jab centres that are often changed, and shortage of doses. On Monday, the Centre approved on-site registration and appointment for vaccination of 18-44 years age group, but only at government centres.Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Suppliers’ Association of Ludhiana, said, “Total mismanagement is going on in the vaccination process in the country and the government is to be blamed for it. Every day the rules are changed. Earlier there were on-the-spot registrations, then the entire system shifted online. Now again for some age groups the government has allowed spot registration, but only at government centres. This is a complete mockery of the system and people are being made to suffer.” Singla added, “The gap in the first and the second dose of Covishield has been increased to three months. So even if there are slots available for vaccination, a person cannot book if 90 days have not been completed. Then why were people given the second dose after 30 days earlier? The vaccination system has fully collapsed, and both the Centre and the state government need to rethink and adopt a uniform approach otherwise millions will remain unvaccinated.” Abhinav Sehgal, joint secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “The system of registering online should be scrapped immediately and counter registration should start. When it is proving to be a daunting task even for tech-savvy people, how does the government expect poor or those who do not have smartphones or do not have knowledge or access to the internet to book for vaccination slots on the Co-Win portal?”Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, Ludhiana, said, “There are multiple problems being faced by people for vaccination as every other day the centres are being changed, sometimes one particular vaccine is out of stock and then there are age restrictions. There are also restrictions like non-completion of 90 days’ gap between doses. It would be better if the government simplified the system and brought uniformity in the vaccination process and removed the restriction and allowed more private hospitals to start inoculation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/changes-and-restrictions-in-vax-process-vex-residents/articleshow/82952182.cms||Mohit Behl

They have been put up in 120-odd buildings, which include night shelters, school buildings, community centres and even guest houses and dharamshalas. Around 1270 citizens of those shifted were from Port areas alone. The huge evacuation operation in the past 24 hours was carried out by KMC and Kolkata police with help from civil defence and NDRF at a few locations. Several NGOs, trusts and individuals have come forward to open their door for these people, pooling in even their own resources for this purpose. Those rescued and sent to shelters include the residents of dilapidated buildings in central and north Kolkata and those staying in the low lying areas of Port and adjoining EM Bypass — Madurdaha and Mukundapur. The homeless were also rescued and taken to safety around major intersections and temples. "Maximum evacuation has taken place across central, north and Port areas. A significant number is also from the added areas. The numbers are likely to go up by Wednesday morning," said joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. Sources in the KMC buildings department said over 200 families were evacuated from insecure buildings across the city alone. North Kolkata witnessed the maximum evacuation with 824 people having been put up at 32 different shelters. The Burtolla police have evacuated 17 persons from three dilapidated buildings located at APC Road, Aurobindo Sarani at Sovabazar and Beadon Street. Md Qasim, a Ripon Street resident, said, "We were asked to move out during cyclone Amphan too as we do not live in a pucca house. We are now used to the routine." Soumya Roy, a resident of APC Road, said, "They asked us to relocate to a safer location. Due to Covid, I did not wish to go to any shelter. Thankfully, my sister lives in Dum Dum and cops gave us permission to relocate there." Among the residents of the dilapidated buildings who had to be counselled by former councillors and OCs for hours before they agreed to move out, several were asked to stay at KMC-run schools and community halls located in four central Kolkata wards covering Bedford Street,, Elliot Road, Ripon Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Bowbazar. Several NGOs are also assisting the state agencies in their efforts. "Our volunteers are ready with utilities and food which are immediately necessary to tide over this calamity," said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, chairman, IHA Foundation, adding that the Kolkata Response Group and IHA Foundation have formed special squads for quick response and have launched a helpline — 1800 313 8100.

---||Delhi||Vax shortage: 18+ forced to get jabs at private hospitals in Delhi at higher rates, says AAP||NEW DELHI: The Covid vaccine crunch at government centres is forcing people in the age group of 18-44 years to get jabbed at private hospitals at expensive rates while those awaiting the second Covaxin dose are an anxious lot. While Delhi government has halted vaccination for the 18-44 age group, all centres offering Covaxin have been closed as no dose is left even for those above 45 years and frontline workers. AAP MLA Atishi said on Tuesday that if the second dose of Covaxin was not administered on time, the first dose would also become ineffective. Calling the shortage of vaccines a matter of grave concern, Atishi urged the Centre to approve and import vaccines available in the international market and allow an increase in the manufacturing capacity of Indian vaccines. Delhi government has requested the Centre to approve vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Tuesday was the second day since Delhi halted vaccination for the young people. “From today, Covaxin for 45+ is also absolutely finished. This is extremely saddening and worrisome for the people of Delhi, especially the youth,” Atishi said. On Monday, only 54,364 vaccines were administered, including nearly 40,000 first doses. Before the shortage hit the capital, more than 1 lakh vaccines were being administered daily. “The number has substantially decreased because of the halt in immunisation of youth in government schools,” said Atishi, adding that they were getting vaccinated only at private hospitals at unreasonably high rates. “One dose of Covishield costs around Rs 900-950 and Covaxin, Rs 1,200-1,300.” She pointed out, “We have witnessed in the second wave that a lot of young people were affected, had to rush to hospitals, and even succumbed to the virus. If they are not vaccinated right now, they will be at a very high risk.” The Centre supplied 1.5 lakh doses of Covishield for 45+ category on Monday, taking the availability to approximately 3,27,000 for 13 days. “Across the world, countries are administering vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. Even the World Health Organization has approved them, but the Centre hasn’t done that yet,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-shortage-18-forced-to-get-jabs-at-pvt-hospitals-at-higher-rates-says-aap/articleshow/82952335.cms||AlokKNMishra

Those in need of this service can contact the PMC on 9881190696. According to a statement issued by the PMC office, the prescription and the advice of using oxygen concentrator should be given to the patient by a doctor. After that, the patient can reach out to the PMC and seek the unit. The residents in home isolation or taking rest post-Covid treatment in home would benefit from this initiative. The units would be given to patients for different time spans like seven, 15 or 30 days, depending on the advice of the doctor and the requirement of the person concerned. Patients would have to provide documents like prescription of registered doctors, Aadhaar card and address proof like electricity bill, details about how many days the concentrator would be used, affidavit about the possession of the unit and a copy of Covid positive report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/o2-concentrator-library-to-give-gadget-to-patients-for-free/articleshow/82956529.cms||---

The network is already connected to the existing 175-km-long pipeline that connects Vasco to the 30-inch Dabhol-Bengaluru natural gas pipeline. Goa Natural Gas, a joint venture of Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) and Bharat Petroleum Ltd, had launched the gas distribution project for the town on May 22, 2017. Goa Natural Gas has been authorised by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board to lay the piped gas network for North Goa. “A total 3,800 households are connected to the piped gas network using galvanized iron (GI) pipes and have consumed 22,500 scm (standard cubic meter) gas until February-March,” Goa Natural Gas chief executive officer, Ajay Kumar Jindal, said. Consumers will be billed on a monthly basis. “PNG is far cheaper than LPG. While a 14.2kg subsidised domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs 823, the same quantity of PNG, which is based on standard cubic meters, comes at a price of Rs 353.8,” a company official said. One kilogram is equivalent to approximately 1.2scm. With the retail selling price of one scm natural gas standing at Rs 29, this means the comparative cost of LPG to PNG translates to Rs 57.9 per kg to Rs 24.9 per kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/entire-ponda-town-to-get-piped-natural-gas-by-dec/articleshow/82956519.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Mumbai||Pvt city hosps offering jabs to swell to 20||Mumbai: The count of private hospitals administering Covid-19 vaccines in the city will rise to 20 by the end of this week. This, though, may not immediately boost CoWin slots as most will dole out the shots at housing societies and for corporate firms through tie-ups, reports Sumitra Deb Roy. Over the past week, several hospitals have adopted a hybrid strategy where they are vaccinating through tie-ups with private firms and residential complexes, besides carrying out drives in the hospitals through CoWin appointments. Following the initial crisis after the Centre stopped allocating doses from May 1, many hospitals have started receiving supplies of Covishield from SII. City private hospitals are getting Covishield ranging from a few thousand to up to a lakh doses from SII. Civic data shows that private hospitals are administering 10,000 to 12,000 doses in the city every day now, while public vaccination centres are giving around 15,000 to 22,000 doses. Hospitals such as Hinduja, Jaslok, Nanavati, Lilavati, Kokilaben, HN Reliance, Charni Road’s Mittal, Saifee, and Masina, among others, are vaccinating both through Co-Win and tie-ups. While Breach Candy, Criticare, Fortis and Wockhardt are mainly vaccinating through tie-ups at present, they also plan to open vaccination to all. Some public centres such as SevenHills have tied up with embassies. Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) has partnered with Lilavati and Dr Meena’s Multispeciality Hospital for vaccinating its employees. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said at least 11 of the city’s major private hospitals have received vaccines from Serum Institute of India recently and more are in the pipeline. “Vaccination will gain momentum soon as more hospitals receive doses gradually, but we will keep the Co-Win option open in Hinduja,” he said, adding the hospital has received nearly a lakh doses. Almost all hospitals have been approached by a dozen to almost 80-100 companies for vaccination. Some corporations are themselves procuring the vaccines and collaborating with hospitals only to administer the doses. Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group of Hospitals, said they will start vaccinating employees of Kotak, Yes Bank, IDBI, Motilal Oswal, among others with Covishield doses that it expects to receive in batches of 10,000 to 15,000 by end of the week. He says the group plans to keep at least 1,000 Co-Win slots daily. Dr S Narayani, zonal director of Fortis Hospital, said they have been vaccinating housing societies from the neighbourhood and corporates, but intend to open vaccination in the hospital this week. The group has directly sourced doses from Serum Institute. A Breach Candy hospital official said they, too, have got doses from Serum which they are currently utilising to vaccinate their staffers. The hospital hasn’t opened slots for general public on Co-Win. Officials from Saifee Hospital said they had received a few thousand doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech and are expecting stocks from Serum this week. The hospital is vaccinating around 200 through Co-win appointments and 500-600 through tie-ups daily. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that since private hospitals are procuring their own doses, they are free to administer in any manner. “They can choose how many slots they want to open on Co-Win. The only requirement is that vaccination through Co-Win should be 100% through online registration,” he said. Hospitals have to submit an application to the local ward office which gives permission for the drive. Vaccination drives are conducted under the “workplace” or “workplace other” option in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pvt-city-hosps-offering-jabs-to-swell-to-20/articleshow/82999900.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The booster shot will be administered to those who have received the second dose at least six months back.Speaking to TOI, Dr. Puneet Misra, professor of community medicine at AIIMS said: “The booster shot will be given to individuals who had enrolled for the Phase II trials. This is being done not only at AIIMS, but at various centres across the country so see if a third booster shot improves the immunity after the two doses of vaccine. We are studying the various factors and will examine them.”So far at AIIMS, 17 people have been administered the booster shot, which will be given to 50 individuals in total. The third dose is being administered to people who have received both the doses of vaccination at least six months back. “The idea is to compare the immunity and other parameters of those who have taken both shots, and others who will be given a booster dose,” Misra added.Experts claim that the variant of Covid is changing and mutating so even with vaccine, it’s important to see if anti-bodies are being made and if the booster shot is helping. “In medicine, evidence matters so it’s important that from time-to-time that we keeping seeing the efficacy of the vaccination drive,” said an expert.Bharat Biotech had got permission from the expert panel of Drug Controller General of India to conduct clinical trials for the third dose of Covaxin on a few of its volunteers in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trials-for-3rd-booster-dose-of-covaxin-at-aiims/articleshow/82952203.cms||---

Private hospitals in the city that are mulling procurement said they are yet to receive a response to enquiries from Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Labs, the domestic supplier. “Eventually, most big hospitals in Pune would want to have all three brands: Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V so that people can pick. But Sputnik V’s arrival in our hospital may take some time,” Bomi Bhote, CEO of the Ruby Hall Clinic, said, adding that Dr Reddy’s is yet to respond to their request. Bhote said a limited number of Pune hospitals may finally decide to stock Sputnik V, mainly those that have cold chains that can store the vaccine at the required -18°C. Jehangir Hospital CEO Vinod Sawnatwadkar said, "As of now, we have plans to stock only Covishield. We have procured 50,000 doses.” Dr J Ravindranath, director of Poona Hospital and Research Center, which is expecting its order of 12,000 Covishield doses, said they’re thinking of buying Sputnik. “We’ll take the process forward once we hear from Reddy’s Labs,” he said. At Bharati Hospital, its deputy medical director Dr Jitendra Oswal said the unit has entered into an agreement with Dr Reddy's for 25,000 doses. “They have agreed to supply, but haven't given us a timeline,” Dr Oswal said. Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital (which was a trial site for Sputnik V in Pune), said they are in touch with Dr Reddy’s. “But we haven’t heard from them about a supply timeline or number of doses they can give us. We’ve been getting enquiries about the shot, especially from the IT crowd here,” Dr Sale said, adding that only a few large research-level healthcare facilities may want to stock the shot given its “stringent storage temperature”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sputnik-availability-in-region-may-be-delayed-hospitals/articleshow/82956669.cms||Neha Madaan

While 13 minors are being looked after by their extended families, four have been placed under institutional care. In all, five kids were orphanded in Kota, the hughest among the districts. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights told TOI, “The aim is not to separate the children from their families and fortunately in majority of the cases, the relatives were willing to look after the orphans while four children were sent to shelter homes.”Out of the 17, three are from Ajmer, two from Bikaner, two from Chittorgarh, five from Kota, two from Pali and three from Rajsamand.Recently, the state government had declared that it will look after children orphaned during the pandemic, irrespective of the fact if their parents died due to Covid or some other ailment and for the same the health department has also issued an order to the district administration. The nodal officers including medical staff at district level will provide details of all such children on the child helpline number 1098 following which the child commission will prepare a list of these minors to hand over to the government so that they can be given help. However, at present there is no clarity as to the measures the government will take to help these children in terms of food, health, education and shelter.Elaborating further on the same, Beniwal said, “The districts have been asked to send details of other children who have been orphaned, apart from the present list, and we will soon compile all the data to send to CMO. Even those who lost both their parents and are being looked after by relatives will be provided aid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/17-children-orphaned-in-covid-second-wave-in-raj/articleshow/82956536.cms||---

Covid-associated aspergillosis is a severe fungal infection being reported across the country, including Mumbai, and is linked with lung failure. Fungal infections caused by candida, yeast or even filamentous fungi have been seen in patients who have recovered from Covid-19. “We have practically seen the entire spectrum of invasive fungal infection in post-Covid setting in the last year,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Ayesha Sunavala from Hinduja Hospital, Mahim. She has been seeing one to three new cases of fungal infection among post-Covid patients in her practice for few weeks. While cases of mucormycosis or black fungus were reported even after the first wave, the numbers are overwhelming now. A doctor from a BMC hospital said severe invasive fungal infections are mostly in patients with an underlying condition such as diabetes who were given steroids during Covid treatment. “It was seen in pre-Covid times too, but the incidence in the last few months has been alarming,’’ he said. Infections like mucormycosis or aspergillosis caused by spores freely floating in air are opportunistic infections that don’t affect people with a normal immune system. It is usually seen in people with compromised immune systems due to HIV or cancer. “They attack people with compromised immune systems in patients who recovered from Covid,” said Dr Sunavala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-other-fungal-infections-on-rise-too-says-docs/articleshow/82956573.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata airport to remain shut for over 11 hours today||KOLKATA: Kolkata airport will shut down at 8.30am on Wednesday, just in time before cross winds start gaining strength and turn operations treacherous. The airport will resume operations at 7.45pm when the storm abates and conditions improve for safe flight operations. A notice to airmen (NOTAM) was issued on Tuesday to alert airlines about the closure. “We have been delaying the decision on closure till Tuesday evening for an update on the weather condition. Though the system has moved further away from Bengal and projected wind speed has reduced, it will still generate strong cross-winds to make operations hazardous. Thus, we have decided to shut the airport for 11 hours and 15 minutes,” said Kolkata airport director Pulla Hesekiah. Three flights will operate on Wednesday before the shutdown is effected and ground equipment stowed away to safety. “Two private airlines will operate three morning flights and one evening flight, clubbing passengers of multiple flights which were scheduled to fly on Wednesday,” an airport official said. While IndiGo is slated to operate two morning flights to New Delhi and Vizag, SpiceJet is also set to operate a flight in the morning. IndiGo will also operate an evening flight to Ahmedabad once the airport resumes operation after 7.45pm. Airport sources said, there were 27 scheduled departures and as many arrivals on Wednesday. There were at least six scheduled departures before 8.30am and at least two scheduled departures post 7.45pm. Owing to the suspension, 23 departures were cancelled. “We have started issuing text messages to fliers informing them about the cancellations. They can reschedule their flights to another date free of charge,” said an airline official. Durgapur airport will also remain closed for the entire day. While the airport will be deserted, air traffic controllers will report early to work and expect a busy day with lots of overflying aircraft taking deviations to avoid the cyclonic clouds. “Unlike Amphan when domestic flights were not operating and overflights were also less, there are over 900 movements now. When planes travel on set flight paths, controllers need to be vigilant. During a cyclone, many flights will deviate from the flight path and they need to be tracked constantly,” an ATC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-airport-to-remain-shut-for-over-11-hrs-today/articleshow/82954239.cms||Subhro Niyogi

According to the district health officials, the two urban family health centres which have won NAQS recognition now are located at Porkkalangad and Gausayikunnu. Altogether, there are seven urban family health centres, and the remaining five of them located at Anappuzha, Kacheri, V R Puram, Paravattani and Guruvayur, had won the NQAS recognition earlier. The urban family health centres primarily cater to the healthcare requirements of the slum areas in their vicinity. Another eight hospitals, including a taluk hospital, have won NQAS recognition in the district. Altogether, 119 healthcare institutions, including three district hospitals and four taluk hospitals, have received NQAS recognition in the state. The NQAS recognition is granted after evaluating a host of parameters, including the quality of services provided by the health centres as well as the quality of infrastructure. The accreditation is given after inspecting eight parameters like service provision, patients’ rights , support services, clinical care, infection control, quality management and outcome. All the seven health centres in the district provide OP services to the patients from 8am to 8pm, and if the patients require higher care the doctors there refer them to other hospitals. The health authorities have entered into MoUs for this with different hospitals, the officials said. A prize money of Rs 2 lakh will be given to each of the hospitals which have received NQAS accreditation for three consecutive years, the health authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/urban-fhcs-now-nqas-certified/articleshow/82954213.cms||---

On Monday evening, poachers shot dead a Nilgai at Jawai new area near Chadhan. The incident comes close on the heels when two chinkaras were killed at DNP. DNP deputy conservator of forests Kapil Chandrawal said guards during routine patrolling near Neemba village on Monday evening arrested Dwarka Ram with two spiny lizards. He was brought to range officer Jaisalmer headquarters for inquiry, in which he confessed to poaching in a planned manner.

---||Delhi||CBSE’s two options on exam find little favour||NEW DELHI: Parents and teachers alike are questioning the need to get school students to sit for an exam during the pandemic. They are, therefore, unwilling to consider either of the Central Board of Secondary Education’s options on Class XII exams: reducing the number of subjects for which exams will be held or reducing the length of the test. They point to schools following the International Baccalaureate programme, which have cancelled the school-finishing exams and opted for internal assessment instead. Khurram Nayab, whose daughter has to sit for the board examinations, declared, “I am not in favour of physical tests. Either conduct online exams or allocate marks based on internal assessment.” Nayab’s daughter, a student of Delhi Public School, turns 18 only in August so isn’t eligible for Covid vaccination before the exams, though Delhi’s deputy CM Manish Sisodia has suggested to the central government to have Class XII students vaccinated on a priority. According to a Delhi government official, there is a wider consensus among school principals and parents this year on cancelling exams than last year. Around 13 lakh city children are registered to appear for the Class XII exams, a majority of the students of government schools. Overall, 1.2 crore students are set to sit for the Class XII exams across India. Arguing against CBSE’s options, Shailendra Sharma, education advisor to the Delhi government, reasoned, “The vulnerability of the child does not decrease if the test is for 90 minutes instead of three hours or there are fewer papers to write. The virulence we have seen in the current infection indicates that social distancing might not be enough to prevent infection. Even if exams are held in the students’ school itself instead of external exam centres, the children will still need to travel, take public transport.” Sharma’s alternative to exams: “Take historical references since the Class XII examinees have already sat for their Class X, Class XI exams and pre-board exams. CBSE can create an analysis framework. If a student is not fully satisfied by such an assessment, the option of an exam when the situation improves can be given. That way, assessment of 80% of the examinees is resolved.” While emphasising that children not content with the assessment in such a format must be allowed to sit for tests, Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal, Springdales School, Pusa Road, added that CBSE’s suggestion on reducing the number of tested subjects wasn’t fair. “Class XII students are given the option of studying four subjects other than a language from a list of over 100 subjects. So, every subject chosen by the student is a major one,” Wattal pointed out. The concern of a few parents that an alternative assessment might not be accepted by overseas universities was addressed by Arti Gupta, principal, Amity International School. Gupta, who looks after the IB programme in the school, revealed, “Universities in US, UK, and Australia have already admitted IB students based on predicted grades. The IB board’s final grades will be determined by internal assessment grades and predicted grades, the latter given by subject teachers based on student’s performance throughout the course. This grading process shouldn’t put students applying abroad in any problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbses-two-options-on-exam-find-little-favour/articleshow/82966652.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||Goa Forward Party-Congress finalise names for Margao Municipal Council chief, deputy||MARGAO: Lyndon Pereira of Goa Forward Party’s (GFP) Fatorda Forward panel has emerged as a consensus candidate for the post of chairperson of Margao Municipal Council (MMC). Margao MLA Digambar Kamat’s Model Margao candidate Dipali Sawal will be the alliance’s nominee for the vice-chairperson’s post. The candidates for the two posts, elections for which will be held on May 27, were decided at a meeting held by Kamat and Sardesai with all councillors of the Margao Civic Alliance on Tuesday. The alliance had won 17 of the 25 seats of the MMC in the recently held civic polls, defeating BJP’s panel which won just seven seats. One among those elected is an independent, who is likely to switch over to BJP shortly. Sources said that there were multiple claimants for the two posts from both the alliance partners, thus rendering the task of choosing the nominees that much difficult. Sources said that the chairperson and vice-chairperson’s posts are likely to be rotated alternately between GFP and Congress candidates during the five-year term. However, the bone of contention among the two alliance partners was over laying claim to the top post for the first turn in the rotation system considering that the 2022 assembly elections are hardly a few months ahead. Sources said that BJP is unlikely to contest the elections for both the posts as the party would prefer to sit in the Opposition. In the 2015 elections, when a similar alliance was formed by GFP and Congress, 11 candidates from GFP’s Fatorda Forward had won, while Kamat’s panel ‘Model Margao’ had won in six wards. The power-sharing formula between GFP and Congress had resulted in GFP-backed Babita Angle Prabhudesai getting elected as chairperson. GFP managed to assert its supremacy over the council throughout the term despite Sardesai’s ouster from the BJP-led government in July 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-cong-finalise-names-for-mmc-chief-deputy/articleshow/82956544.cms||---

---||Goa||Retain existing taxi fares: Confederation of Indian Industry, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa||PANAJI: Days after the state directorate of transport invited suggestions and feedback from people over the revision of taxi fares, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) have written to the department insisting to retain existing rates. “We are suggesting that there should be no increase in the rates. If we compare the prices with other states, they are higher in Goa,” said TTAG president, Nilesh Shah. “We have conducted a practical study of the input costs and have arrived at a pricing which is reasonable even in the face of the rising fuel costs. Technically speaking, taxi operators will only have to increase the frequency of their trips to enhance their revenue rather than imposing maximum pricing. The focus must also be on implementing digital fare meters,” he added. In its feedback letter, TTAG suggested that the fares be “computed on the basis of the body type (size) of a vehicle and each body type be sub-categorised based on engine capacity of the vehicle.” Also, that the rate chart should not be based on the brand of the vehicle as is currently being done. Atul Jadhav, vice-chairman, CII-Goa said it is for the benefit of locals that they are in favour of affordable app-based aggregators. “The taxi drivers must attempt to join an app-based service or even a metered service and then decide if they want to continue the system. We are open to helping the department in having a workable solution because at the end of the day, even taxi operations are a business,” Jadhav told TOI. The CII has recommended minimum fare for yellow-black taxis, increments in rupees instead of kilometers, and requested changes in policies of return fare, night journey charges and use or non-use of AC, among other suggestions. Sources from the transport department said that they have received several such letters requesting not to increase the already exorbitant rates. “Overall, most of the stakeholders that have written to us do not want the fares to be revised.” a senior transport officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/retain-existing-taxi-fares-cii-ttag/articleshow/82956617.cms||Nida Sayed

According to the new guidelines issued by district collector K Gopalakrishnan, patients of households having one to five members will be allowed to remain under home isolation only if the house has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, including one bath attached room. “Households having six-eight members should have three bedrooms and three bathrooms, including one bath attached room for patients to be allowed to remain under observation in their houses,” the guidelines said. Police, Asha workers, anganwadi workers and Kudumbashree volunteers should visit the houses where patients are staying and if any violations are found it should be reported to the secretary or nodal officer of the respective local body institution and those violating the rules should be shifted to DCC with the help of police, the guidelines said. It says that other residents of houses where Covid-19 patients are remaining under observation should not venture outside. “Also, anyone violating the law will be subjected to Covid-19 test and if found positive will be shifted to DCC,” the guidelines said, adding that stickers would be affixed on houses where Covid patients are staying under observation. Meanwhile, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has alleged police excesses in Malappuram district during triple lockdown. IUML state general secretary PMA Salam said that police were acting against people who ventured outside their homes for essential needs as if they were criminals. “The enforcement of regulations should be done with a human face. The excesses on the part of police cannot be justified. Employees should be allowed to go to their places of work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/stringent-conditions-issued-for-covid-patients-in-malappuram/articleshow/82954284.cms||---

They have challenged him to reveal the experts who advised use of Ivermectin as prophylaxis treatment The party highlighted the shortage of oximeters which is endangering people’s lives, adding that many have received isolation kits without the instrument. Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar together with Mahila Congress president Beena Naik and Seva Dal chief organiser Shankar Kirlaparkar, demanded an inquiry into the mismanagement. Naik, reacting to the health minister’s statement claiming that the BJP government is sensitive, said that, “Sensitivity of BJP government got exposed when Covid patients were murdered by stopping oxygen supply at Goa Medical College. Which experts advised the chief minister to send oxygen cylinders to Sindhudurg?” The Goa Medical Complex (GMC) at Bambolim is a vision of the Congress government in Goa, the party stated, adding that the BJP government could not even maintain it. “The dilapidated condition of GMC Pathology Block is living example of the BJP government’s misplaced priorities. The collapse of the roof of the new Super Speciality Block on the second day of its opening is a certificate to the corrupt regime of BJP,” said Kirlaparkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-calls-for-judicial-probe-into-covid-management/articleshow/82956585.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Girl refuses to go with parents, CWC grants custody to aunt||Udaipur: The members of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Chittorgarh, faced a puzzling situation on Monday when a minor girl produced before them by the police refused to go with her parents. She said that she wanted to live with her husband.The girl had run away with her husband a few days back when they happened to meet for a relative’s wedding in Chittorgarh. The girl’s parents presently live in Ahmedabad and had lodged a complaint of abduction against their son-in-law and charges of rape against his younger brother.Seeing the girl’s reluctance to go with her parents, the CWC passed an interim order and gave her conditional custody to her maternal aunt. The police have, however, objected to the committee’s decision and said that the girl should have been sent to Nari Niketan.Asha, daughter of Ramlal, was married three years ago to one Madanlal of Chanderiya village (all names changed). The ‘bidai’ was due since she is a minor. However, in October 2020 Asha and her younger sister Seema were sent to her in-laws’ house when her mother-in-law was ill. The girls were taken back to Gujarat in December. In May, Asha and her parents visited Chittorgarh for a relative’s marriage where she met her husband and the couple ran away. They hid at a relative’s home. Meanwhile, Asha’s father filed an abduction complaint against her in-laws and husband. The man also said Madanlal’s minor brother had raped Seema (Asha’s younger sister) who became pregnant and later had a miscarriage. On Seema’s statement, the Chanderiya police detained the minor who was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board and sent to a shelter home. Asha and her husband too were found, and Asha was brought before the CWC where an expert counselled her.“Asha is 17 years and 11months old and would attain the marriageable age soon. She told us her husband had not abducted her and it was her parents who planned to get her married to someone else under the Nata system,” Ramesh Dashora, CWC chairman said.“Looking at the pandemic situation, sending the minor to any shelter home was the last option. The parents and her in-laws are offenders under the Prevention of Child Marriage Act and a case should have been lodged against them in the first place,” Dashora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/girl-refuses-to-go-with-parents-cwc-grants-custody-to-aunt/articleshow/82956620.cms||---

He was speaking to TOI in the backdrop of protests against various draft laws and policy decisions taken by the Lakshadweep administration. Manikfan said authorities should first try to learn about the life and traditions of the islands before coming up with new laws and the current administrator was implementing laws which are in place in his native place, which led to the current problems. "New laws and reforms should be implemented only after holding consultations with the local population," he said. There is no need for stringent regulations like the draft Lakshadweep prevention of anti-social activities regulation in the islands where the crime rate is very less, he said. "I was born in Minicoy island in 1938 and my father was the Amin (an administrative official) in the island, which had a population of 3,500, and the island had nine villages each with a chieftain. There was no police machinery on the island till 1956. Even today, the crime rate on the island is very low," he said. Manikfan, who currently lives in Kozhikode, has tried his hands in various fields of knowledge like marine biology, astronomy, ecology and even ship-building. He said the inhabitants of Lakshadweep are treated as Scheduled Tribe and had the rights it entailed. Erstwhile national leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had understood the unique culture of the islands and stated that it should be preserved while development initiatives are taken, he said. "However, many activities being carried out now in the islands are not aimed at development but destruction as they are initiated without understanding the ecosystem. For instance, the unscientific sea wall construction by laying stones has led to the disappearance of the shore stretch at many places," he said. Tourism development plans should be implemented only in the uninhabited islands, he said. On reports of dismantling of fishing sheds on the beach by the administration, he said they were built just to keep the boats safe and were part of the livelihood activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/padma-shri-awardee-flays-lakshadweep-decisions/articleshow/82954291.cms||K R Rajeev
---||Ahmedabad||Proposed investments slide in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Even as Gujarat bagged the highest foreign direct investments (FDI) in India, the state seems to have fallen short of replicating the same success on the domestic front. The Covid-19 pandemic brought down the investment intentions and fresh investments proposed through them in the calendar year 2020. The investments promised through Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandums (IEMs) in Gujarat plummeted by 87% to Rs 46,141 crore in 2020 from Rs 3.44 lakh crore in 2019. This has been revealed by the data compiled by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Union ministry of commerce and industry. The number of proposals also declined to 220 in 2020 from 433 in 2019. In fact, investments committed via IEMs also slowed down to Rs 4,346 crore (26 IEMs) in the first two months of 2021 as compared to Rs 11,785 crore (67 IEMs) during the same period last year, DPIIT data further shows. “During the national lockdown last year, businesses struggled to streamline their operations and clock growth as revenue shortfall was massive,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Gujarat state council, Assocham, one of the top industry bodies in India. “Moreover, the conceptualization of new projects also slowed down,” Thaker said. “With rampant mobility issues triggered by movement and territorial restrictions on interstate, intrastate, and also international travel, greenfield and brownfield investments both came to a standstill,” Thaker said. “Site visits to finalize new land, feasibility analysis, and the movement of global consultants and bankers could not be carried out. These factors had a cumulative impact on fresh investments.” Demand took a hit across sectors, so fresh investments were not viable, according to industry stakeholders. “Even as the industrial production began recovering towards the end of the year, viability of new projects was in question,” said Natubhai Patel, president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Raw material prices and logistics costs had gone up significantly, while the demand took a hit. The pandemic year came with many uncertainties on the revival front and therefore new investments slowed down.” States such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh too witnessed a dip in investments committed by way of IEMs. However, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha saw a surge in proposed investments. Across India, 1,432 IEMs with investment commitments to the tune of Rs 4.15 lakh crore were filed in 2020 as against 2,378 with proposed investments to the tune of Rs 6.79 crore in 2019. On the contrary, Gujarat with USD 30.24 billion grabbed the highest, 37%, of FDI inflows into India during 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/proposed-investments-slide-in-state/articleshow/82954295.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Delhi||Delhi: College admissions set to get trickier for students||NEW DELHI: Universities could well have to reprise last year’s modification of the academic calendar because of the delay in Class XII exams, marks scored in which determine admission to these institutions of higher learning. If the Central Board of Secondary Education decides to conduct the board exams at this late juncture, the university academic year could see a bigger change because the results are likely to be declared later than even last year’s July. Delhi University too is caught in this uncertainty. While some worry about the repercussions of Class XII exams on the university’s annual schedule, there are others who feel strongly that the exams are a must for admissions, though there is a strong demand for cancellation of the exams from parents and students in view of the Covid-19 risk. At the moment, however, as Balaram Pani, dean of colleges, revealed, DU will go by whatever the Union education ministry and CBSE decide. Pani told TOI that the alternative method of graduating the Class XII students through internal assessments might not work for DU. “Our admissions will be made on the basis of CBSE results. Without the Class XII results, we cannot have admissions,” the dean said. Ramanujan College principal SP Aggarwal is perhaps right in saying, “It is unfortunate that DU never devised a new admission policy and still relies on Class 12 marks. Private universities are able to go ahead with admissions because they adapted.” Aggarwal added that DU could not admit students to colleges merely on internal assessments done by individual schools. The final scores would have to be compiled officially by CBSE, he said. Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, former deputy dean of student welfare, felt that internal assessment was the only option left. “We cannot hold the proposed common entrance test for central universities this year. But you push for a board exam, showing you do not trust your own system,” said Tuteja. Late exams can also jeopardise the future of over 80,000 students from across India who opt for undergraduate courses abroad. Alok Bansal, foreign studies consultant, told TOI, “Many youngsters already got admission in universities abroad in March-April. Most of these universities have clearly demanded the Class 12 results by August 1, failing which the admissions would be cancelled.” The US has agreed to give Indian students visas on an ‘exceptional basis’, pointed out Bansal, but without results that isn’t possible. “Internal assessment can be the answer here,” the consultant said. Admission to some other institutions do not require Class XII scores. These include engineering colleges whose intake depends on JEE Main marks and law schools where CLAT scores count. Jamia Millia Islamia also holds entrance tests and has declared tentative dates for the tests, though controller of exams Nazim Jafri said the tests would depend on the Covid situation and safety needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/college-admissions-set-to-get-trickier-for-students/articleshow/82952270.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Agra||Now, government employees' union says 1,000 staff died during rural poll duty in Uttar Pradesh||AGRA: An employees’ association in UP said on Tuesday that over 1,000 government officials of various departments died after contracting Covid-19 during the panchayat elections. It released its "first list of 518 workers" and demanded Rs 1 crore in compensation for their families. The list, they claimed, contained names of officials from several departments including health, panchayati raj, public work department, rural development, agriculture, horticulture, irrigation etc. The Uttar Pradesh state employee’s joint council in its letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath has also demanded that the kin of the dead teachers be given a government job and the families vaccinated on priority. The association added that money spent by employees for treatment of Covid-19 complications should be refunded. Aassociation’s president Hari Kishore Tiwari said that these are still incomplete figures as data of police department, state roadways, Asha workers and various other departments has still not been compiled. “Panchayat elections wreaked havoc on employees. So far, at least 1,000 state government employees associated with different departments have died. Blatant violation of Covid-19 protocol took place across the state during polling and later at the vote counting centers. It resulted in massive spread of Covid-19 in the rural areas,” Tiwari said. Shiv Charan Yadav, general secretary of the employee’s joint council, said, “For now, we have sent the first list of 518 employees who succumbed to Covid-19 after poll duties. We will release the second list soon. We will have no other option but to launch an indefinite strike if the state government does not fulfill these demands.” Teachers’ unions have already released a list of 1,621 educators who died of Covid-19 after their polling duties. Earlier last week, the CM said that the state election commission should take a “sympathetic view” of the demand by teachers and amend its “archaic rules” to provide compensation to their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/now-govt-employees-union-says-1k-staff-died-during-rural-poll-duty-in-up/articleshow/82952288.cms||Deepak Lavania

Some of these colleges have started rolling out online campaigns on social media platforms to attract the attention of students towards their flagship programmes. Sources said that it may appear strange to many people seeing the posters for admission even when Class XII board examinations are yet to be conducted by state or central boards. But insiders from these colleges predict that this year will be challenging in terms of admission and such campaigns are aimed at attracting the students. “The colleges are attempting to create a feeling of excitement among parents and the students by giving details about their programmes,” said a staff from a arts and science college in the city. While centrally-funded technical institutions go with JEE score for admissions, Anna University affiliated / autonomous engineering colleges in the state have a centralised admission process based on Class XII board marks. However, arts and science colleges carry admissions on their own by inviting applications. In most of these colleges, admissions happen on first-come-first-serve basis, at least in the recent years. Staff from one of the arts and science colleges in the city said that colleges are worried about admissions this year. While most of the popular colleges manage to fill most of the seats and collect the fee as well, it may not be possible this year considering the second wave of the pandemic that has hit the people harder than the last year. “While many families are yet to recover from the first wave of the pandemic, colleges realise that the admissions are indeed going to be tough this time,” said the staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/arts-colleges-in-trichy-gear-up-for-admissions/articleshow/82956663.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Make optimal use of water projects: KCR||Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the water resources department to ensure optimum utilisation of water under various projects constructed on Krishna and Godavari rivers in the state. He said the government is constructing irrigation projects by spending huge money and asked the officials to complete repairs to canals and take up operation and maintenance works and fill all the tanks, lakes and checkdams for both irrigation and drinking water purposes. He said the state government has kept Rs 700 crore with water resources department for undertaking canal repairs and operation and maintenance works. KCR asked the irrigation officials to complete estimations separately for all the proposed lift irrigation projects between Devarakonda and Kodad on Nagarjuna Sagar ayacut by June 15 and get ready for tenders. The chief minister sanctioned 15 LI projects along with Nellikal lift before Nagarjuna Sagar by-election in the erstwhile Nalgonda district. The CM held a review meeting on Tuesday on the lifts proposed on Krishna and Godavari ayacut, operation and maintenance works of lifts and canals as the monsoon season is beginning soon. A worskhop on project operation and maintenance should be conducted in the first week of June, he said. The engineers should give priority to fill the all the water resources in the monsoon season. “The checkdams that were constructed at a cost of Rs 4,000 crore have been yielding good results. All the 50,000 irrigation tanks should be filled and first phase of checkdams before June 30,” he said. From Yellampally to Dummugudem, water is available in Godavari till October and all tanks and checkdams should be completed till tail-end Tungaturthi in Suryapet district so that there would be availability of water even for second crop and same method should be adopted for Krishna basin also, the chief minister said. “Revenue earned through agriculture produce is not just farmers’ income and it should be considered as state’s wealth. The agriculture income during the first wave of Covid-19 was 17% of the state’s GSDP,” he said. KCR said with the efforts of water resources department, the entire scenario of irrigation and farming sector has changed in the last few years. He said 35 lakh acres is being irrigated under Kaleshwaram project alone and the state has now emerged as the second biggest state after Punjab in agriculture sector. “When Telangana was formed there were not major water reservoirs, now the state has acheived to store 100 tmcft of water,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/make-optimal-use-of-water-projects-kcr/articleshow/82956680.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Pune||PMC removes over 5 tonnes of hyacinth from Mula river||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation has removed nearly five tonnes of water hyacinth from the surface of the Mula river near Holkar bridge, which falls under the Khadki cantonment limits, in the past four days. A 4km-stretch of the river’s surface, from the Kalas bridge in Vishrantwadi to Holkar bridge in Khadki, was covered in hyacinth. This turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes and posed a serious health hazard to the residents of the Vishrantwadi and Bombay Sapras Line areas. Jagdish Khanore, superintendent engineer of PMC, said, “We have roped in a private agency to remove the hyacinth. We have removed five tonnes so far and will remove the rest over the next five or six days.” For the past few months, residents have urged authorities to clear the river, which flows in from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. On Monday, TOI had reported that both PCMC and KCB officials said they were not responsible for hyacinth removal as this area was not in their respective limits. A senior official from PMC’s engineering section, meanwhile, explained the delay. “Carrying out this operation is difficult as there are very few locations where machinery can be set up to remove hyacinth. Moreover, defence establishments in KCB limits do not give access to their land. As a result, we couldn’t remove hyacinth in the past,” the official said. Rajesh Thakurdesai, the private contractor completing the task, said, “We have piled the wet hyacinth by the riverside for the moment. We will transport it away once it dries as otherwise, it will cause the roads to become slippery.” Residents urged speedy removal of the hyacinth, stating it had already caused them many problems. “Mosquito breeding was very high in our area. We couldn’t open our doors and windows, particularly in the evenings,” Abdul Shaikh, a resident of Bombay Sapras Line, said. Sachin Shelke, another resident of the area, said, “This shows how badly our river is polluted. The authorities concerned need to take cognisance of this and do the needful. If the hyacinth doesn’t grow, the problem of removing would not arise. Several housing societies in Vishrantwadi area discharge their water directly in the river, causing this problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-removes-over-5-tonnes-of-hyacinth-from-mula-river/articleshow/82956683.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||Eight bidders say they have links with makers of vaccines, Maharashtra govt seeks additional details||MUMBAI: The state government said on Tuesday that it had received eight bids for supply of vaccines and that it had sought additional details from the companies as these were all intermediaries. It said no response was received from any of the manufacturers. State government officials said that they had received bids from companies that claimed to have tie-ups with the manufacturers of the Sputnik, Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines for Covid-19. “We have received bids from some companies. They have submitted cost details but have not sent us a supply schedule,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. Officials said that most bids were for providing Sputnik vaccine and the rate quoted by these bidders were between Rs 800 and Rs 2,500 for a full dose. On Tuesday, the state government did not extend the date for receiving tenders. Officials said that as these companies were not manufacturers, the state had sought clarity on how they planned to source the vaccine. Several officials said the authenticity of their operations should be checked before proceeding. “With manufacturers of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines telling other states that they will not deal with state governments and will only talk to the Centre, how are these suppliers planning to procure vaccines from them? Also, as part of the tender condition, the onus of procuring permission from the Centre was on the interested party,so how will they go about that cumbersome process?” said an official. The state government had invited global tenders for supply of five crore vaccine doses last week. Individual local bodies like the BMC and the Pune Municipal Corporation too invited bids for vaccine supply. The BMC had also received eight bids for supply of a crore vaccine doses as of Tuesday, but it decided to extend the global expression of interest (EOI) for purchase of the vaccines till June 1 as it was yet to scrutinise the proposals. Officials said that out of the eight bids, seven were for supplying Russia’s Sputnik and one proposal was for supplying Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. Officials said further scrutiny process was being carried out and so the EOI was extended till June 1. Of the seven Sputnik suppliers, three have quoted a price of around Rs 1,500 for the full dose. While the BMC is open to paying around Rs 750 crore for 50 lakh vaccine doses, it is now making attempts to confirm if the firms can supply the vaccines in three weeks, as stated in its global EOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/8-bidders-say-they-have-links-with-makers-of-vaccines-maharashtra-seeks-additional-details/articleshow/82956711.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||State, BMC in a quandary over vax bidders||Mumbai: With both Moderna and Pfizer saying they will only deal with the Centre and denying authorising any agent to market their Covid vaccine in India, the state government is in a quandary as eight intermediaries claiming tie-ups with the two, AstraZeneca and the maker of Sputnik have responded to its 5-crore doses global tender. It has decided to seek clarification from the Centre on whether it can engage with the bidders, report Chaitanya Marpakwar & Bhavika Jain . The BMC, too, is facing the tough task of verifying the offers of its eight bidders, most based abroad. “We will evaluate the bids as per merits of the case,” BMC chief Iqbal Chahal said. While state officials said they will wait for the Centre’s guidance, health minister Rajesh Tope said the state will ask the bidders to furnish more details, especially on the schedule of delivery. The BMC said on Tuesday it had received seven bids to supply the Russian-made Sputnik V, and one from the Czech Republic to deliver Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. This firm has asked for 100% advance payment, which the BMC can’t make as per the terms of its global tender. “Verifying all details and checking if the bidders can actually supply the required amount is important. We are setting up video calls one by one. Also the mode of payment will have to be laid out,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), who is heading the BMC’s vaccine procurement plan. The BMC has sought 1 crore vaccine doses to be delivered within three weeks. Since further scrutiny of the bids is on, the EOI has been extended till June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-bmc-in-a-quandary-over-vax-bidders/articleshow/82999699.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ludhiana||‘Come up with an alternative, divert extra O2 stock for industrial use’||Ludhiana: Almost a month after ban on the use of oxygen gas in industrial processes was imposed in Punjab, the factories are now gasping for breath. TOI had recently reported about how the production of the furnace industry had tumbled due to non availability of gas and as a result a large number of factories have shut their operations. However, conditions have gotten even worse now and on Tuesday several business associations issued an appeal to the state government to come up with an alternative to meet industrial requirement of oxygen and also divert additional stock available for industrial use. Speaking on the issue, Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “In the ongoing second wave of Covid-19, the industry has whole heartedly supported the administration and government by shutting down all processes requiring use of oxygen. Further, even a single piece of oxygen cylinder, whether empty or filled, has been handed over to the administration so that it can be used for medical purposes and lives could be saved. However with almost a month without supply of oxygen to industry, huge after effects are being felt by the industry. Several processes have been jeopardised, like laser cutting machines used by agricultural machinery manufacturers are unable to operate, worse is being witnessed in the furnace industry where the oxygen gas is used in huge quantity. It is our request to the government to bail us out of this situation by thinking of some alternative by which industry can get supply of the oxygen.”According to Pankaj Sharma, CICU general secretary, “Huge shock waves are being felt in the industrial sector due to ban on use of oxygen for industrial purposes. In some cases entire factories have been forced to shut down just because one process requiring oxygen has been shut. It is being seen that there is decline in the demand of oxygen for medical use as the number of cases have reduced, so the government should consider providing us surplus oxygen available, if any.”According to Dev Gupta, vice president of All India Induction Furnace Association, “Despite of knowing that huge losses will be suffered by us with no oxygen, the industry has fully cooperated with the government and the local administration so that spurt in demand of oxygen for medical use can be countered. But with one month over, situation in factories has fallen to such a dangerous level that if the production does not normalises soon, we will see permanent shut down of several factories. We urge the chief minister and the industries minister to pay attention to our problems as well and come out with solution to counter this problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/come-up-with-an-alternative-divert-extra-o2-stock-for-industrial-use/articleshow/82952372.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Kochi||Parents of foreign medicos form group to voice concerns||PALAKKAD: The parents of medical students studying in foreign countries have formed an association to voice to their problems, especially during the pandemic times. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected nearly 10,000 MBBS students studying in 45 Chinese medical colleges recognized by India as they could not return to their host country since January last year. Though online classes are continuing, these students could not complete their practicals and sit for the examinations, the parents said. These students came to India in January last year on leave and after that Covid-19 virus spread, resulting in lockdown and restrictions to travel to China. Though foreign travel was allowed after the first Covid-19 wave in the country, permission was not given to travel from India to China, the parents said. Most students have taken huge amounts as bank loans for their study in China. Now they are in great anxiety about continuing their study and repayment of the loan. So the parents and students formed an organization — Foreign Medical Graduates Parents Association (FMGPA) — to take up the problem of the return of the MBBS students to resume their studies in China. Andrews Mathew was elected president and Dr Hussain Kurimannil as general secretary of the new association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/parents-of-foreign-medicos-form-group-to-voice-concerns/articleshow/82954331.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Thousands banking on Char Dham pilgrims face losses||DEHRADUN: May and June are usually the busiest months for owners of hotels, eateries and shops selling souvenirs on the Char Dham routes, pony and palki (palanquin) operators on the trek routes leading to the shrines as well as women self-help groups making prasad for devotees.  The preparation starts well ahead of the yatra, which begins in May and lasts six months till the shrines are closed for winter in November. The footfall declines in July-August due to the rainy season and picks up again in September. After the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, the annual yatra had suffered a big jolt but had picked up in subsequent years generating average revenues of around Rs 400 crore till 2019. However, for two seasons now, those dependent on the pilgrimage have lost their income even as they incur upkeep costs. While a curtailed version of the pilgrimage was held last year, the yatra has been closed for pilgrims this year. Mahesh Rawat, who runs a small dhaba in Rudraprayag district, en-route to the Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines, said, “Big hotels have enough savings to fall back on and can survive a year or two without tourist footfall but that is next to impossible for small eateries like ours.Last year was a bad season and this one is proving to be even worse.” Owner of another hotel on the outskirts of Rudraprayag said, “In 2020, we received advance bookings which eventually got cancelled. In 2021, even advance bookings were not made as there were apprehensions of the yatra being cancelled. Our hopes are now pinned on September and October. Even if devotees are allowed to visit the shrines in July or August, it wouldn’t be of much help as Garhwal sees heavy rains during that time. Last year, we had hired local youth to handle the rush but the losses we incurred that year forced us to cut corners this time and we have not been able to prepare much this year.” The hotel owner did not wish to be named. Ajay Negi, a restaurant owner on the Badrinath route, said that the last 15 months had been the toughest of his life. “All the preparations we made ahead of the yatra last year yielded little to no returns. The losses have piled up this year as the pilgrimage has not opened for tourists. While we keep incurring upkeep costs, the revenue has been negligible,” he said. Sunita Chauhan, a resident of Joshimath who heads Annapurna Seva Samiti, a women’s self-help group making prasad, said she had taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh last year, hoping to make profits from that year’s Char Dham Yatra but ended up with heavy losses. From a turnout of around 32 lakh pilgrims in the Char Dham yatra of 2019, the number dropped to barely 3.1 lakh last year. “Last year, we expected to cater to a huge footfall like the year before that. We assumed we would make huge profits, pay back the loan easily and grow our business. But all the raw material we bought was spoiled and we have been left with the task of returning the loan amount with little to no profit,” she said. Queried on when the yatra could be expected to open for the public, state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “The yatra will be opened when the situation improves. However, RT-PCR test reports and maintaining Covid protocol will remain mandatory for devotees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/thousands-whose-livelihood-depends-on-char-dham-yatra-deal-with-mounting-losses-as-shrines-remain-closed-for-devotees/articleshow/82952382.cms||Kautilya Singh

The independent councillors, Tarak Arolkar of ward 7 and Vikas Arolkar of ward 16, and MGP-backed Viraj Phadke of ward 8 joined BJP at the party’s North Goa office in Mapusa. Chief minister Pramod Sawant visited Mapusa to welcome the three into the party fold at a brief function held in the presence of BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavde, North Goa BJP vice-president Franky Carvalho, Aldona MLA Glenn Ticlo, Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza and others. “I am confident that in the long run, the councillors will give their best towards the development of Mapusa and to get the party’s candidates elected in the next elections. I am also confident that BJP will be successful in Bardez in the next elections,” Sawant told reporters. Tanavade echoed the chief minister’s views when he said, “These three councillors have joined BJP with the sole motive of developing Mapusa. I am confident they will work towards this.” Despite the ruling party making tall claims, the BJP-backed panel had failed to obtain a majority at the municipal elections held last month. In the 20-member council, nine members each were elected from the BJP-backed panel and the opposition-backed Mhapxekarancho Ekvott panel. Soon after the results, the opposition had charged that the ruling party was trying to poach its members. Earlier this month, a member of Mhapxekarancho Ekvott, Shubhangi Vaigankar, joined BJP. She is tipped to be the new chairperson. With Tuesday’s development, the BJP panel has a comfortable 13 members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-mapusa-councillors-switch-to-bjp-backed-panel/articleshow/82956646.cms||---

D'Souza claimed that a few days ago, he read an article in the print media where it was mentioned that the government has procured Ivermectin tablets worth over Rs 22 crore. He said the drive could be an attempt by the government to administer these tablets to fulfil their personal agenda. “If the government claims that it has the data of positive clinical trials and also the safety of the drug, then they should immediately release it,” he said, adding, “WHO and several doctors have warned against the use of Ivermectin.” He said some states in India facing shortage have already warned the central government that if the stock of vaccines is not made available to them then they shall be compelled to float global tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ncp-against-ivermectin-for-covid/articleshow/82956675.cms||---

The issue of water supply was recently discussed during a joint meeting of the civic authorities and local MLA Sunil Tingre. The options discussed were provision of a slump well in the area, laying of pipeline and installation of boosters for distribution of water in the area. Tingre said, “We have suggested various alternatives to the administration to boost water supply. The residents are facing water scarcity. Hence, we want the authorities to work on the proposal at earliest.” Porwal Road, Sathe wasti and adjacent areas have witnessed increase in population as many housing complexes have come up in the last few years. The residents have said that the area has been lacking water supply despite the citizens paying taxes to the civic body. The residents have been spending money on water tankers to fetch water. Tingre said, “There are some issues pertaining to the gradient and water pipeline network. Some areas have been merged in the city limits a few years back. Water distribution network in these areas need to be strengthened. We have asked the authorities to carry out a survey and organise field visits to find an appropriate solution. We are also checking if more proposals can be pushed ahead through the 24X7 water supply project and Bhama Askhed project.” Anirudh Pavaskar, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s water supply department, said, “The administration will explore the options for provision of slump well, pipeline and pumping of water through boosters. The administration is checking how Bhama Askhed water can be supplied. The survey will help check the feasibility of options,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-boost-water-supply-in-lohegoan-porwal-road-area/articleshow/82954382.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Final approval given, Gujarat can build skyscrapers||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat is a step closer to changing the skyline of its five major cities with ‘iconic buildings’ similar to the skyscrapers in Dubai and Singapore. Paving the way for this change, chief minister Vijay Rupani on Tuesday approved the final notification concerning the construction of buildings having 70 floors or more. The approval was given after considering the suggestions and objections to the primary notification that incorporated changes to the Comprehensive General Development Control Regulations (CGDCR)-2017 which allowed the construction of iconic buildings. As per the existing law, buildings in the state cannot have more than 23 floors or be more than 70m high. The new policy will allow high-rise buildings that are taller than100m in Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara and Gandhinagar. On August18, 2020, the chief minister had announced that permission would be given to construct highrise buildings like the ones dotting the skyline of Dubai and Singapore in cities here. The government had also issued a primary notification and invited objections and suggestions regarding the same. “An iconic building is one that has a height of 100 meters or more. With the final approval, these five cities will be able build landmark skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa in Dubai,” explained Ashish Patel, president, CREDAI-Gujarat, the state chapter of real estate developers’ national body CREDAI. Municipal corporations and urban development authorities in these five cities will be able to permit skyscrapers and tall structures after the notification is published in the official gazette, the state government said in a statement. “This approval will herald a new era of high-rise structures and skyscrapers in these cities,” the state government added. “The move will help Gujarat create a unique identity. The real estate community is ready to build such high-rise buildings. City developers are mulling as many as10 such projects along S G Highway,” said Ajay Patel, president, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, a body of realtors in the city. “This is an important step in the direction of well-planned urban development in the state. Even in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government’s ongoing efforts for urban development will yield positive and tangible results in the long run,” added Taral Shah, a realtor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/final-approval-given-gujarat-can-build-skyscrapers/articleshow/82954343.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Seniority-based elevation to 33% quota posts subject to HC orders on petitions||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday sought the state’s reply to petitions challenging its May 7 interim decision to grant promotion on the basis of seniority and fill 33% vacancies. It clarified that any promotions so made would be subject to further orders in the petitions. The government resolution (GR) sought to fill 33% vacant posts for promotions earlier reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other reserved categories on seniority. The vacation bench of Justice R D Dhanuka and Justice Madhav Jamdar posted the petitions challenging the GR and all intervention applications to June 21. There is no stay on the GR at present and the high court said such promotions “shall be subject to further order that would be passed by this court at the stage of admission”. “The promotees, if any promoted pursuant to those GR and circular dated 7th May, 2021, and 10th May, 2021, respectively shall be informed about the pending proceedings in this court,” directed the high court. The high court directed the state to file an affidavit in reply within two weeks to petitions filed by Sanjay Ghodke, Sanjeev Ovhal and Chandrakant Gaikwad. Senior counsel Indira Jaising and Advocate S D Rupwate and Advocate P R Dahat for the petitioners submitted that the state by the GR “de-reserved posts reserved for SC/ST” and sought a stay on its implementation. The state through a special counsel and government pleader, P P Kakade, said that the GR was a temporary or interim measure as the state could not function with 33% vacancies.The high court was informed that the state had on May 25, 2004, decided to grant reservation in promotions too in the reserved category but the high court had by a majority judgment in August 2017, following divergent views in 2016, struck it down and the Supreme Court had granted no stay on the high court ruling in appeal. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court and as an interim move the GR itself said the promotions based on seniority —which could include SC/ST candidates as well — would be subject to final orders of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-seniority-based-elevation-to-33-quota-posts-subject-to-hc-orders-on-petitions/articleshow/82958137.cms||---
---||Pune||District gets 6,900 Covaxin and 51,000 Covishield doses||Pune: Vaccination drives involving Bharat Biotech's Covaxin can now resume following the arrival of 6,900 doses on Tuesday. Drives across PMC, PCMC and rural areas were on hold for days due to supply shortages. Besides the fresh Covaxin stock, the district also received 51,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine. Pune rural got a larger allotment of both vaccines: 22,000 Covishield and 2,700 Covaxin doses. The PMC got 19,000 Covishield and 2,300 Covaxin doses. District Hospital Aundh, which has been the only Covaxin site in the city, began calling a list of second-dose beneficiaries on Tuesday evening, immediately after receiving a stock of 700 doses. But hospital sources said the stock is barely enough for two days. An official from the hospital said to avoid inconvenience, they will be asking beneficiaries to start collecting tokens from 7am at the site. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, "The fresh Covaxin stock we got is from the Centre, which will only be used for second-dose beneficiaries from the 45-plus group. As for the Covishield supply, if the number of second-dose beneficiaries is low, shots could be given to first-time beneficiaries from the 45-plus category." Deshmukh said the region is expecting more doses to land by the weekend or next week - from both Centre and state. On Tuesday, the district recorded a total of 7,481 vaccination - 5,312 were from the 18-44 age group at private hospital sites. In PMC areas, even with the civic body pausing its drives, there were 4,855 beneficiaries, thanks to scaled up vaccination programmes by private hospitals. On Wednesday, the PCMC organised vaccination drives across 16 centres for Covaxin. Another 49 centres for Covishield beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-6900-covaxin-and-51000-covishield-doses/articleshow/82956723.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Realising these twin challenges at a time when the coronavirus is playing havoc with people’s lives, K Mahendran, a Congress general secretary, has converted his car into an ambulance to ferry patients to hospital. “My plan was to buy an ambulance so that people could use it in an emergency. But I chose to convert my car for the time being as an ambulance van would cost a minimum of Rs 5 lakh,” says Mahendran. A native of Pattukottai in Thanjavur district, the 44-year-old has made changes to his SUV to accommodate an oxygen cylinder. What spurred Mahendran to do his bit was the non-availability of 108 ambulance service in remote towns like Pattukottai in recent days due to the overwhelming number of Covid-19 cases. “While private ambulances and taxis are another option, they are charging heavily for their services these days,” says he. Hailing from Thamarankottai village, 10 km from Pattukottai, he was moved by the death of a 60-year-old woman in the village due to non-Covid complications on Sunday. The family could not arrange a vehicle to take her to hospital as no one was willing to come. “Jipmer in Puducherry is about 180km from Pattukottai. Another family from the village had to spend Rs 15,000 to take a Covid-19 patient to the hospital a few days ago,” he adds. Mahendran says anyone within a 30 km radius of the village can avail the car ambulance free of cost to reach hospital on time. L R Muthu, 28, a volunteer from the village, has come forward to drive the car for those in need. “We have arranged a separate room for Muthu to stay as he would travel with Covid-19 patients,” Mahendran said adding that the PPE kit for Muthu costs more than the petrol for the vehicle. He had discussed his plan with Velachery Congress MLA J M H Hassan, his friend, who has now arranged for two private travel vehicles to be used for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cong-leaders-car-ambulance-offers-free-ride-to-villagers/articleshow/82956690.cms||Sampath Kumar

The portal had gone live two days ago and had a rough start, with many complaining that it didn’t open. Officials attributed the lukewarm response — the state has more than 7.5 lakh autorickshaw permit holders — to these glitches. “The problem with UIDAI has now been resolved and the portal is working fine. We are currently processing the 22,048 applications received online,” state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne told TOI. A Pune RTO officer expects better response Tuesday onwards with 2.5 lakh hits on Monday for the link. Under the scheme, eligible auto permit holders will receive a one-time payment of Rs1,500 to help ease their financial trouble caused by the current lockdown-like restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/22048-auto-drivers-seek-relief-package/articleshow/82956691.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 211 requests for amphotericin B at Civil Hospital on Day 2||AHMEDABAD: On Day 2 of the distribution of lyophilized amphotericin B injections for the treatment of mucormycosis, Civil Hospital received requests for 211 injections from 30 city-based hospitals. The authorities claimed that the distribution has started for the vials. On Monday, seven hospitals had submitted the requests. City-based private hospitals said that they are still trying for liposomal injections, which have less side effects on kidneys. They however said that the overall supply has dried up, and some of the city-based hospitals have approached the drug manufacturers for supply. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the private hospitals have been given the email address on which they send all the details of the patients. “After scrutiny by our panel of doctors, the stock is supplied to the authorized representatives between 3pm and 5pm daily till the stock lasts,” he said. “The injections would not be handed over to the relatives of the patients. We appeal to the citizens to approach respective hospitals for injections, and not the Civil Hospital.” Civil Hospital authorities said that they have been getting an average 20 to 25 new patients of the fungal infection daily. Several of the patients have already been operated upon at private hospitals in the city or elsewhere and have got admitted for the post-operative procedures and getting much-in-demand amphotericin B injections. Meanwhile, the hunt for the liposomal injections continues for the hospitals and relatives alike. “The lyophilized injections can surely be administered for mucormycosis, but it’s not for all – if the creatinine levels are high, it’s out of question. It also has long-term impact on kidneys. But we have also sent a request for injections to the Civil Hospital to continue the treatment,” said a senior ENT surgeon with a city-based private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/211-requests-for-amphotericin-b-at-civil-on-day-2/articleshow/82958142.cms||---

Hence, diabetic patients who have recovered from Covid-19, being a high risk group, must monitor their bloodsugar levels at least three times a day, and for up to six months post recovery,” said chairman, Meenakshi Hospital, Thanjavur Dr S Gurushankar. Stating that the infection will present itself on the seventh or tenth day after recovery from Covid-19, ENT specialist Dr Issac Richards said unilateral headache, especially at night, unilateral facial pain, facial swelling, numbness, greenish-yellowish nasal discharge, blood-stained or blackish are initial symptoms. Later symptoms include unilateral eye swelling, protruding of eyeballs , drooping of eyelids (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), loss of vision, blackish discoloration over bridge of nose/palate, loss of teeth, jaw involvement, loss of vision in both eyes, and stroke. Raised awareness levels have led to more patients turning up for consultation early. The infection can spread slowly or as fast as in 48 hours, he said adding that recovery will be high if the patient gets treatment at the early stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/monitor-sugar-levels-daily-docs-on-black-fungus/articleshow/82956720.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Trichy||Fearing Covid-19 spread, residents prefer vax drives at schools than hospitals, PHCs||Trichy: Expressing reservation in visiting government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) for Covid-19 vaccination, residents in Trichy have urged the local body and the district administration to host vaccination drives at schools and other neutral venues. As people having Covid-19 symptoms are visiting the hospitals and PHCs for testing, the residents, particularly, the senior citizens, dread to visit the government facilities to take the shot.While 18 UPHCs and two government hospitals including MGMGH and Srirangam GH have vaccination facilities, there is a fear among the residents to visit the centres. At the cramped spaces of the UPHCs local people with Covid-19 symptoms wait for the RT-PCR tests, and people from across the district gather at the government hospital campuses to give swabs. “She was afraid to visit the PHC as there was no scope for social distancing,” Deepak Saravanan, a resident of Khajamalai, said. Vaccination camps set up at neutral venues including the main office of Trichy Corporation saw a significant footfall compared to the UPHCs. “Hosting vaccine camps at schools in residential areas will encourage many people to take the shots,” Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, emergency physician, said. Trichy city has more than 120 schools covering every ward of the corporation. Education department officials said that schools can be opened for a decentralised vaccination programme if the district administration permits. “We have plans for using neutral buildings to promote vaccination. At present, we are using zonal offices of Trichy Corporation to encourage the local people,” a senior corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fearing-covid-19-spread-residents-prefer-vax-drives-at-schools-than-hospitals-phcs/articleshow/82956721.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Farmers, rural issues to be RLD’s top priority, says Jayant Chaudhary||MEERUT: Jayant Chaudhary was unanimously elected as the president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal during a virtual meet of the party’s national executive on Tuesday — 19 days after his father and party president Ajit Singh succumbed to Covid-19 at a Gurgaon hospital. Already serving as the RLD vice-president, Jayant's name was proposed and backed by the party’s national general secretaries Triloki Tyagi and Munshiram Pal, respectively, following which the national executive gave its approval. Addressing the executive meeting, Jayant pledged to follow the path shown by his grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh and his father. He said farmers and rural issues would be his party’s top priority. “I am honoured & mindful of the challenges ahead. Will try my best to strengthen our organisation & will value inputs as we collectively take our core issues forward. Am drafting an open letter to express my condolences & solidarity with all #Covid impacted families as a first step,” Jayant tweeted after taking over the reins of the RLD. Jayant is replacing his father as RLD president at a time when the party faces a political crisis as the BJP is ramping up its organisational machinery ahead of the UP assembly elections due next year. Party loyalists feel that while addressing the core issues of the party, Jayant will have to keep an eye on the forthcoming UP assembly elections in 2022, which will be his first litmus test as the party chief. Gaining the lost grounds in western UP by effectively mobilising party workers should be his foremost concern, they said. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Jayant had successfully contested the Mathura parliamentary seat, which he lost to BJP’s Hema Malini in 2014. Having tasted successive defeats in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Jayant’s aggressive posture during the farmers’ agitation against the newly-passed farm laws was well received in the recently-concluded UP panchayat elections with his party winning 10 zila panchayat seats in Aligarh, nine in Baghpat, eight each in Meerut and Mathura, six in Shamli and four in Muzaffarnagar. His party is most likely to join hands with the Samajwadi Party for the upcoming assembly polls in UP. Interacting with TOI earlier, Jayant had made it clear that the RLD would steer it in western UP if allied with the SP. The RLD chief, meanwhile, attacked the ruling BJP for not making enough efforts to stem the second wave of the pandemic which reached alarming proportions. “The government should step up vaccination drive, especially in rural areas,” he said. He also announced RLD’s support of the ‘black day’ proposed by the agitating farmers on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-rural-issues-to-be-rlds-top-priority-says-jayant-after-taking-over-reins-of-party/articleshow/82952448.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Will take fire safety issue to logical conclusion, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court once again rapped the authorities for not implementing fire safety rules and the court orders that were issued, asserting that it would now take the issue to its logical conclusion. While hearing the PIL filed by petitioner advocate Amit Panchal for directions to ensure fire safety measures at hospitals after the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia pulled up the authorities for not following court directions for two decades. They said, “We will take this to its logical conclusion. This time we are serious about it.” The court said it would fix responsibility of officials and deprecated the “pendulum approach” of the authorities when it comes to implementation of court directions. “They remain on paper and just filing of affidavits will not serve any purpose. They will not stop fires,” the court said and directed the state government, all municipal corporations and municipalities to prepare a chart on how the many directions issued by the court on December 15, 2020 and February 26 have been complied with. The court has ordered the authorities to submit details of all buildings across the state with their fire NOC and BU permission status by May 31 and posted a further hearing for June 1. The HC insisted that it wanted to know the status of not only hospitals, but also about schools and industrial establishments, which were lacking fire NOCs in huge numbers according to the government report. When the HC inquired about implementation of directions issued earlier, the advocate general defended the government by submitting that the second wave of Covid-19 cases caused a big hindrance in the process. The HC further questioned the government about action taken against defaulters before the HC passed orders. “How many buildings were without fire NOC then? This is going on for years. Specific directions are given to all civic bodies. Why no action was taken? Court passes orders and nothing happens. What action has been taken on the high court orders passed from time to time. Now we have to fix some responsibility on officers,” the court said and pointed out that only six buildings in Ahmedabad have been sealed for violation of fire safety rules. Management withdraws high court petition to re-open Shrey Hospital:Shrey Hospital on Tuesday withdrew its application from the Gujarat high court for permission to re-open the hospital and serve Covid-19 patients and to remove seal from the hospital premises and allow it to take out equipment and documents related to patients. The HC permitted the withdrawal and granted liberty to file an application afresh. For the hospital management, senior counsel Nirupam Nanavati submitted that it wanted the hospital functional because there was dearth of beds in the surge of Covid-19 cases, but since the situation has improved and beds are now available for patients there is no hurry. It also submitted that the documents may be allowed to be taken out of the building so that other patients could pursue their insurance claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-take-fire-safety-issue-to-logical-conclusion-hc/articleshow/82958138.cms||---

Strict restrictions can continue at hotspots within the city where positive patients are high,” said Gopal Tiwari, state Congress spokesperson. He was speaking at a press conference on Tuesday. According to Tiwari, many citizens residing in semi-urban areas around Pune and Mumbai are dependent on the economy of these bigger cities. Their income has suffered due to the lockdown. Now, if some relaxation is given to them, it will help channelise the economy, he said. “The citizens here have shown a lot of restraint. They have followed the norms. Even the healthcare system has played an important role in keeping the situation under control. All these have led to bringing down the number of cases. So, our party is in favour of opening up of the areas, which are safe as far as likelihood of the spread of the virus is concerned,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/congress-bats-for-relaxation-of-norms/articleshow/82956715.cms||---

People who have been asked to vacate are staying on a footpath where a tent has been provided by the corporation authorities. Gurjar has also written to the commissioner regarding rehabilitating the residents to a different place until the pandemic is over. “I have written to commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh to rehabilitate the residents to some other place until the pandemic is over.

Private ports such as those of Swan Energy, Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd (GPPL), UltraTech Cement and Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd (RNEL) have suffered losses of about Rs 700 crore while Gujarat Maritime Board-owned ports have incurred losses of just Rs 5 crore, according to initial estimates by the state government. GPPL’s facilities faced wind speeds of 240 km/hr on the morning of May 17 and two tugboats, Divan and Mulji, capsized, according to the findings of the state government. The cost of each tug is estimated to be Rs 25 crore and about Rs 100 crore of damage has been done to roofs, cargo and containers. “The total damage according to the preliminary assessment is Rs 150 crores for GPPL port,” said a state government official. Close to the GPPL facility near Jafrabad, the RNEL shipyard facility has incurred losses of more than Rs 225 crore. “The facility is facing insolvency proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad, and the last date of submission of corporate resolution plans by interested bidders is June 15,” said an industry official privy to the development. A very big ‘Goliath crane’ has collapsed in the cyclone and a tug capsized, said a GMB official. Sheds and under construction ships were damaged during the cyclone, he added. The assessment of damaged sheds and under-construction ships is yet to be done, the official said. Two years ago, Swan Energy Ltd’s plans to build an FSRU (floating, storage and re-gasification unit) LNG port near Jafrabad in Gujarat was delayed due to Cyclone Vayu two years ago. The company, which planned to commission it in 2019, had to delay the commissioning till 2021-22. “When Cyclone Vayu struck, 400 metres of an under-construction breakwater got washed away in June 2019. This time, a breakwater of 360m has been damaged. The tug berths, temporary structures such as labour colony, warehouse, top-side facilities and others are damaged. The preliminary damage assessed is Rs 200 crore,” said a government official. Cement major UltraTech, part of Grasim Industries, which has a captive jetty near Pipavav, received a setback with 500m of breakwater being damaged in the cyclone. “Also, the approach trestle to the jetty of about 60m has collapsed,” said the official. There is also damage to the 5 million-tonne capacity cement plant and 92MW capacity power plant, the assessment of which is under way. The preliminary damage assessment is Rs 100 crore and it may take 8 to 10 months’ time for restoration, said government sources privy to the development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/private-ports-stare-at-rs-750cr-damage/articleshow/82954389.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Hyderabad||Road to recovery:Beating the coronavirus||Found strength in my happy moments Murali Krishna | Zonal manager, financial services firm Though I was careful, somehow the virus found a way into my body with severe symptoms. I immediately quarantined myself and started medication and home remedies. The severity increased as the days passed by and I had to go through a lot of pain and stress. Especially after my wife too tested positive and my young son had to be isolated alone in another room. The days were harrowing to begin with, but then I realised it wasn’t getting me anywhere. So, I changed course and concentrated on the highs of life – a loving family, supportive friends and happy moments shared with each other. I started to train myself to be strong, stopped worrying about issues around me, connected with all my school and old friends and started to cherish these bonds that have been built over all these years. Now that I have recovered, I spend a lot of time talking to people I know who have been affected by Covid-19 and give them strength and advise them to be strong. I also follow a more disciplined lifestyle now – peppered with a proper diet, fitness and yoga. Since I have realised how precious life is, I have also started focusing more on improving my skills, reading books and enjoying every moment with my family -- watching comedy shows, laughing etc. ......................... Journaling was my friend in insolation Amy Kumar Deputy | manager at pharma firm Reading books, monitoring my online dance classes, journaling and meditation kept me going, after I was tested positive for Covid-19 in April. My symptoms started off as any other regular viral fever -- body pains, chills and weakness. But I realised it was something different when paracetamols weren’t working. So, I got myself tested and it was positive for the virus. Immediately, I isolated myself and started medication. On day 5, I felt completely out of breath and thought I wasn’t going to make it. But within a couple of hours I, miraculously, got better thanks to breathing exercises, anti-anxiety calming music and steam inhalation. It’s then that I realised one needs to dive in and find strength when times get tough. I started indulging in various activities to keep me distracted. Since I am a Kuchipudi instructor, I monitored my online classes. When I was not sleeping, I read books, watched movies and TV shows and did some sketching (always enjoyed doing this as a hobby). During my quarantine days, I also started journaling my everyday activity, emotions that I was going through, and notes to myself to stay positive and pull through. I felt a lot of anger, helplessness and self-pity on most days. Journaling helped me vent out those emotions and feel lighter. What also helped me recover was a trusted doctor, a dedicated caretaker (my father) and helpful neighbours. ........................................ Online course worked as distraction Dr Thrivikram Chander I Consultant physician Soon after taking the first shot of vaccine, I tested positive for Covid-19. I immediately isolated myself from my family and started taking medication. The next phase was very intriguing. Though, prior to that, I treated many Covid-19 patients and counselled them about not panicking; when it was my turn, I couldn’t keep the anxiety at bay. I was mostly worried about transmitting the virus to my family members. I also kept wondering if it would be a good idea to get admitted to a hospital though the doctor advised good home treatment. I decided to stick to that. Apart from following the recommended food, exercise regime I also enrolled for an online course in pain management – a subject I am passionate about -- which helped me learn new skills and techniques. It also kept me busy and allowed me to utilise my time judiciously. On the eleventh day I regained my taste and smell and I knew I was on my way to recovery. I had gained strength and my temperature was also under control. I thank all my friends and family for supporting and encouraging me through this period. My advice to people, post this experience is: protect yourself and your family by following social distancing and using masks and sanitisers. Also, if you start showing any symptom like fever, cough, cold or weakness, please consult a physician or pulmonologist immediately. .......................................... At 86, Dad didn’t panic for a day Pappu Viswanadham I Retd Inspector of Works, SCR Seeing my 86-year-old father recover from Covid-19 was heartening and inspiring in equal measures. Despite his age and all the worrying stories that we hear around us every day, he managed to keep his calm from Day 1. Not for a moment did he panic, even when people around him (which is us), got concerned. He testing positive, he went into isolation at home without any stress. Thereafter, he strictly followed all protocols till he finally recovered. Since I saw him from close quarters – he stays with me in Trimulgherry -- I thought sharing his regime could inspire others (patients and their caregivers). To begin with, he stayed positive and never thought of the worst. He stuck to his usual diet of home-cooked food and never, for a day, gave up on his exercise routine – his pranayamas -- and meditation. While he did indulge in some of his favourite shows on television, my father stayed away from social media completely during his period. On his usual days, he spends a lot of time on these platforms. Finally, he kept regular contact with his brothers, sisters and children so that he didn’t feel that he was cut off from the rest of the world. .................................. My ‘positive’ wife pulled me through Rakesh Singh | CEO of a consulting firm As simple symptoms of cough and cold showed up, I had to take the RT-PCR test to eliminate the possibility of Covid-19. I was confident it would be negative since I had neither exposed myself to anyone who had symptoms nor lowered my guard. Eventually the report arrived – I had tested positive for the virus. After overcoming the initial shock, I went on a frantic search for an online doctor consultation to take my Covid journey forward with the right medication and help. It also went into home quarantine. By the third day, my fever started to peak even as I lost my sense of smell and taste. Though medicines brought some temporary respite, the fever kept returning every six hours making me extremely anxious and distraught. By the fifth day, even my consultant physician got worried and suggested hospitalisation -- suddenly I found myself in the emergency room. Once back, doctors suggested that my wife take the RT-PCR test as ell since she had been my caregiver. She too tested positive. My own failing health, coupled with this development added to my stress. I found my strength back, when she too got admitted in a private room with me. Though we were both battling a deadly virus, her calm, positive attitude helped us both pull through. Today as I write this, I have recovered quite well and am looking forward to helping those crossing that bridge now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/road-to-recoverybeating-the-coronavirus/articleshow/82956736.cms||---

The bus operators suspended their operations on March 18 when Covid situation deteriorated in the city. The officials said that the authorities have been waiting for the number of daily Covid cases in the city to go down to 250 to start the bus service. The AMTS has been operational only with 50% capacity since Covid restrictions were relaxed last year. However, a senior officer said that it was noticed that during peak hours, the buses had been plying with more that 50% of the capacity. There are over 200 BRTS buses and 650-odd AMTS buses operational in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-buses-may-ply-from-june/articleshow/82954359.cms||---

The state is also mulling capping the prohibitive treatment cost in private hospitals. It has already announced that its health insurance scheme would cover the cost in empanelled hospitals. In another bit of good news, the state, which has one of the bigger black fungus caseloads, will get 60,000 vials of amphotericin-B, the key drug for treatment of mucormycosis patients, from June 1 through the global tender the government had floated. This will be over and above the allocation made by the Centre. Once a disease is declared notifiable, the law requires that every patient is reported to the authorities. This allows proper monitoring and provides the authorities early warning of possible outbreaks. Several states like Karnataka, Gujarat and Rajasthan have already declared mucormycosis a notifiable disease. “There are 2,245 mucormycosis patients in the state today. Reporting of the correct number of patients is very important as the allocation of antifungal drugs by the Centre is based on the number of patients in a state,” said health minister Rajesh Tope after a review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday. Officials said since the infection is being reported among Covid-recovered patients, there is confusion about whether to call this Covid or non-Covid treatment and whether the state can extend the cap on Covid treatment to it. “The state has capped rates of Covid treatment under the epidemic diseases Act and there is a court case being heard in the Bombay high court regarding capping of non-Covid procedures. We will raise the issue to allow the state to extend the cost capping on Covid treatment to mucormycosis as well during the hearing,” said Tope. Tope said of the 2,245 mucormycosis patients in the state today, 1,007 are covered under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). In all, 131 hospitals have been notified to treat these patients. Speaking about the boosted amphotericin-B supply, Tope said: “The Centre has taken control of all the amphotericin-B injections being produced in the country and is allocating them to states in proportion to cases. The 60,000 vials will be over and above the Centre’s allocation.” There is a severe shortage of these injections, and Maharashtra is no exception. The state government has also decided to use the amount collected as penalty for violation of Covid norms to create awareness about preventive measures and early signs of mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mucor-cases-now-notifiable-state-may-cap-pvt-hosp-cost/articleshow/82956727.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Nagpur||Covid deaths under 5 in Nagpur, 1st time after February 22||NAGPUR: The district reported under-500 cases for the second day in a row, while the city’s Covid fatality was at 93-day low at four on Tuesday. At 470, Covid cases in the district were lower than a day before, while deaths too declined to 25, which included 10 from rural and 11 from outside district. On February 22, the city’s Covid toll was at four and the district’s 8 (including 2 from rural and 2 from outside district). After that, the fatalities kept rising and reached all-time high of 112 in the district on May 2. Most part of February, the city and even rural areas had reported deaths below five and on a couple of occasions the only fatalities reported were of patients belonging to other districts but succumbing in city hospitals. As the district is witnessing decline in cases, availability of beds has increased due to which many patients from neighbouring districts and states are preferring healthcare facilities in Nagpur. Doctors said these patients are being brought quite late and in bad condition due to which their chances of survival are less. Some of them are also being transferred after over 10-day hospitalization in peri-urban areas or other districts. In a promising indicator, fall in cases was reported from 14,145 tests in city and rural, which were 1,016 more than the previous day. This led to further decline of the test positivity rate for the day to 3.32%, slightly lower than Monday’s. The district’s cases had plunged to a 100-day lowest tally of 482 cases on Monday. The city’s tally too was lowest in 105 days. After a gap of some days, the cases from rural areas were on the higher side as compared to the city. Of the 470 cases, 246 were from rural and 213 from city and one from other district, which is again similar to the daily reporting before the second wave started in February. The number of patients under treatment has come down to 10,848. Of the total under treatment, 2,866 are hospitalized or in Covid Care Centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-deaths-under-5-in-city-1st-time-after-feb-22/articleshow/82954358.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court reserves order on plea to halt sealing drive at hospitals||AHMEDABAD: Fate of some 400 clinics and hospitals in the city hangs in balance as the Gujarat high court on Tuesday reserved its order on a petition filed by the Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) against the sealing drive undertaken by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) over absence of valid building use permission with the hospitals. Last week, AMC rejected requests by 44 such clinics and hospitals to grant relaxation in public interest, and ordered for action against the hospitals in accordance with law. AMC had earlier issued notices to more than 300 hospitals as part of its sealing drive for want of the fire NOC and valid BU permissions as they have BU permissions for residential purposes and not for commercial one. AMA’s counsel Mihir Thakore urged the HC to stay civic authorities from taking action in this pandemic situation because some of the hospital are treating Covid-19 and mucormycosis patients. He said that HC’s refusal to protect these hospitals in present situation will “create a havoc”. The judges questioned AMA why these hospitals continued to admit patients though they were asked not to admit them. Justice Bela Trivedi of the division bench also commented, “Unless stringent actions are taken, nothing is going to happen in this country. Basically, we are very undisciplined people. We don’t like to abide by law.” AMA continued its request to stay AMC action for time being. It was submitted that if AMC takes action, some 400 hospitals would be facing closure, and this would not be in public interest. To this, the court said, “No wrong doers can be encouraged by saying that this is in public interest. Public authorities are also wrong doers. This is going on for 20 years. They have emboldened you. What was the authorities doing all these years?” On the request to grant relaxation, the judges said that the hospitals have not done anything in last three months. The hospitals have got no fire NOC, no valid BU permission and therefore no right to occupy buildings. Most of these hospitals are housed in residential buildings and how it can be permitted, the court questioned. When AMC said that there are patients being treated in these hospitals, the judges said, “We are not concerned how many patients are there. You just have to follow rules and regulations.” The court rebuked hospitals for not following elaborate directions issued by the court. The judges also said that since the Covid situation has eased a little, patients can be shifted to other hospitals. The high court also said that it would be taking stock of hospitals in other cities also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-reserves-order-on-plea-to-halt-sealing-drive-at-hospitals/articleshow/82958144.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court asks Bharuch hospital to explain fire team’s inspection||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday directed the Bombay Welfare Society to explain the authorities’ assertion that a fire team was not taken for inspection to the new building of Patel Welfare Hospital on the day when fire killed 18 persons in its Covid-19 ward in Bharuch on April 30 night. Two officers – the Bharuch municipality’s chief officer and a secretary of the urban development department – maintained that a fire brigade team of Bharuch municipality had visited the hospital hours before the fire took place. However, the hospital management did not take the team to the new building, where the Covid-19 facility was operational, and the inspection was limited to the old hospital building. The fire broke out in the ground floor of the new building. The authorities asserted that the inspection team was not informed about the new building at all. A petition has sought action against those responsible for the fire that broke out in the hospital killing 16 Covid patients and two nurses. The HC had asked the authorities and the trust and administrator of the hospital to respond to the litigation. The trust filed an affidavit on Saturday. The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia pointed out that the trust’s affidavit was silent on the visit of Bharuch fire brigade team and how it was not taken to the new building. For the trust, senior counsel Percy Kavina told the court that the authorities were not telling the truth and they were aware about shifting of the Covid facility to the new building which is few metres away from the old building. The court has asked the trust to file affidavit on these contradictory facts by June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-asks-bharuch-hospital-to-explain-fire-teams-inspection/articleshow/82958143.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||25-Citizen Readers Corner||Found my calm in spiritualityBy Babita Misra From doing household chores to working at the school, life has always been busy. But with the lockdown, things suddenly started to feel a little disorganised. I am one to always follow a schedule, but the chaos around the spread of the virus affected the zeal to celebrate life. Though my teaching continued from home, staying busy had become a habit. As all of us were indoors and confined to our homes; a fear instilled in our minds. There was news doing the rounds of how people were succumbing to Covid-19 across the globe. In the hope to stay away from negativity, I tried to join free webinars through which my learning boosted. During this process, I found a progamme -- ‘Understand Gita in 18 Days’. I joined the group, just out of curiosity and eagerness. Those two weeks taught me that the Gita is not just the lessons Lord Krishna imparted to Arjuna but are also the answers to many problems in our everyday lives. Challenges may stop us from accomplishing goals but we must fight courageously till we achieve them. On completing the course, I felt the need to put the preaching to practice in my life and for that I joined various other programmes. Since then – within a span of 9 to 10 months -- I have learned how to deal with fear, anger, loneliness, ways to balance the mind and to strongly believe in myself. I have become a strong-minded person now as I don’t rely on any rumour and stay away from anything that creates anxiety in me or my surroundings. Subconsciously, all the negativity around me has been distanced and since then my journey towards spirituality has begun. It has opened the doors to eternal peace and filled my life with more positive vibes. I am happy that the idea to learn something new has ended up with me finding happiness. (The writer is a teacher) …................ Creative things made me happy Abha Pandey I am nine-year-old and live in the city with my parents and brother who is four. I still remember how last year our school and apartment got shut down because of the lockdown. I stopped meeting my friends or going out to play in the evenings. My classes began online and all day I just stayed at home. I used to spend my day watching videos on mom’s phone or playing computer games. Whenever my parents stopped me from doing either, I got annoyed and fought with everyone at home. I was mostly irritated and bullied my little brother for fun or lazed around on the couch the whole day! I felt sad and lonely because I could not meet my school friends and they soon forgot about me. I was only happy about staying at home because that way I knew I would not catch Covid-19 and fall sick. I knew it would be bad because my best friend’s parents got it and she was left alone in a room without either of them. She had to cook her own food and do everything all alone. Last year was not a very good year for me. After getting really bored for a long time I slowly started finding new things to do -- like having picnics on the balcony with my brother every time my dad cooked something special for us. I also started cleaning up my own room to help mom in keeping our home neat. Now, I have taken up more duties in the house to help my parents. I fill up all the water bottles and fold my clothes. Recently, I have also started collecting the boxes that we get (from home delivery) to make doll houses and creative things. My mom says that I am becoming good with my creative activities and turning into a smart girl! My parents say that my attitude has also changed a lot from last year and I have become active. I don’t know what she means but I definitely feel happier and thankful this year for being healthy and at home.

---||Goa||Goa police destroyed ‘clear proof of evidence’ in Tejpal case: Court||Panaji: The additional sessions court, Mapusa, acquitting Tarun Tejpal, held that Goa police destroyed “clear proof of evidence” by not producing the CCTV footage of the first floor of the five-star hotel in which the Tehelka founder-editor allegedly raped a woman, even though the investigation officer “viewed” the footage. In its 527-page order, the court also referred to various lapses by Goa police as well as contradictions by the survivor. The court said that the investigation officer (IO) collected the CCTV footage of the ground, first and second floor, but that “the footage of the first floor cannot be found for the perusal of the court, which is a material lapse by the investigation officer”. The judge said that the IO didn’t compare the statement made by the survivor on November 26, 2013 with the CCTV footage, which constitutes the most neutral evidence in the case. The court added that the officer, after viewing the CCTV footage, was aware of the glaring contradiction between the footage and her account. “It is crucial to note that the contradictions are often so glaring that the exact opposite of what the prosecutrix (survivor) is claiming actually happens on the screen, yet the IO didn’t even question the prosecutrix on the same,” the court held. The court said that a duty is cast on the investigation officer to conduct a fair investigation in the matter to bring out the truth. Thus, judge Kshama Joshi held, “Upon considering the other evidence on record, the benefit of doubt is given to the accused, as there is no corroborative evidence supporting the allegations made by the prosecutrix, and the deposition of the prosecutrix also shows improvement, material contradictions, omissions and change of versions, which does not inspire confidence”. The court noted that the IO viewed vital CCTV footage (of November 7, 2013 of the guest lift of the first floor) on November 21, 2013, and knew that it shows the accused and the survivor exiting the lift during the relevant two minutes on the first floor on November 7, 2013, and that that the same would exonerate the accused. “Despite the fact that the DVR (digital video recorder) containing CCTV footage could and should have been attached by the IO at the earliest to preserve the crucial CCTV footage, the IO appears to have deliberately delayed the seizure of DVR until November 29, 2013, and in the meantime, destroyed the CCTV footage of the first floor of November 7, 2013, thereby destroying clear proof of the accused’s defence,” the court said. As the said CCTV footage of the first floor has been destroyed, the DVR produced before the court contains no files containing the footage of the first floor of the guest lift of block 7, the judge said. Regarding the manner in which the probe was conducted, the court remarked that the IO gave directions to the other investigation officers to download the CCTV footage only of the ground and second floor of the guest lifts from the DVR of Block 7. Therefore, a police inspector, on November 25, 2013, “downloaded only CCTV footage of the ground and second floor, and not of the first floor, to destroy all traces of CCTV footage of the first floor”, the court said. The IO never sealed the room, in which a DVR containing the crucial first floor footage was housed, the court said. The case of the prosecution was that on November 7, 2013, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted the woman under the pretext of waking up US actor Robert de Niro. The accused took the survivor into the left guest lift of block 7 of the starred hotel, and allegedly committed the offence. The prosecution also alleged that she was molested again on November 8, 2013. Tejpal was charged under Sections 354 (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over woman, committing rape of such woman) and 376(2)(k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complaint was lodged by deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Sunita Sawant, who investigated the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-police-destroyed-clear-proof-of-evidence-in-tejpal-case-court/articleshow/82956753.cms||Murari Shetye

The stock will be used to vaccinate employees of five corporate firms in the city, the hospital said. Dr Narendra Vaidya, MD of the hospital group, said, “There were some permissions that were required from civic bodies and COWIN-related procedures that needed to be dealt with before starting the vaccination drive. We will start the drive for the companies from Thursday. We plan to finish the initial round in a week to 10 days.” The drive will be held across three branches of the hospital group. It's also expecting another batch of 10,000 doses from Bharat Biotech. The hospital will charge the corporates Rs 1,300 per dose. For private hospitals, Bharat Biotech had announced a purchase price of Rs 1,200 per dose plus GST. “We will be charging around Rs 40 over the purchase price per dose. Vaccinations will be done via CoWIN. Corporates in the tie-up will have to register via CoWIN and staff will have to visit our hospitals to get the shot,“ Dr Vaidya said. The group has signed an MoU with five corporates in the city. “We focused on corporates because they need vaccines urgently as they are the city's working population. Some slots will also be available for citizens who need first or second doses. We will increase slots of citizens once supply streamlines," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/facility-gets-5000-bb-shots-for-staff-of-five-corporates/articleshow/82956739.cms||Neha Madaan

Contractors appointed by Jaipur Smart City Ltd had removed a layer of cement from the terraces with an intention of properly constructing it again, but since it was not done for the last four months, it resulted in seepage of rainwater into shops.Manohar Ragani, one of the shopkeepers, said contractors did a shabby work and dumped all the garbage on the terrace.“The work is still incomplete and we are facing the consequences of it. The terrace of the first six shops in Chandpol market was exposed to rain as renovation work wasn’t complete. Most of the shops were selling food items — grocery, snacks, confectionery etc. Now, most of our stuff is damaged, costing us a lot,” said Ragani. Narendra Gupta, executive engineer Jaipur Smart City Ltd said, “We have called up the contractor and the work will start from Wednesday. Due to Covid, labourers have gone to their villages.” Reacting to this, Chandpol Vyapaar Mandal president Subhash Goyal said, “There is a need to take proactive action instead of waiting for the last minute. Why wasn’t the work completed on time? This problem should have been prevented. Government must take this seriously.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/walled-city-terrace-renovation-in-limbo-rain-damages-shops/articleshow/82956737.cms||---

The rate was at an all-time record of Rs99.71 a litre after another hike on Tuesday morning. What has irked motorists is that the basic cost of fuel is Rs34.33, and in Maharashtra you have to pay taxes/VAT on petrol of Rs65.38 on every litre. VAT on fuel in Maharashtra is one of the highest in the country. If petrol crosses Rs100, protests by political parties across the state are likely. The tax breakup for petrol on Tuesday showed basic cost as Rs34.33 per litre, while Maharashtra VAT/surcharge was Rs28.06 and Centre’s excise duty was Rs33.64. Dealer commission was Rs3.68 for every litre, oil industry sources said. Diesel also went to an all-time high of Rs91.57 per litre here. Its basic cost is Rs36.44, VAT/surcharge is Rs19.78, while Central excise duty is Rs32.90 and dealer commission Rs2.45, sources said.

We have recovered the knife, a toy gun, chilli powder and a rope from Shetge,” assistant inspector Virendra Chavan of the Nigdi police told TOI. Shetge hails from Beed district, the officer said. The actor’s father sustained injuries on both his hands and needed stitches. Shetge is currently undergoing treatment in a hospital after he was overpowered and beaten up by some residents of the building where the victim stays. Another police officer said, “Shetge claimed that he is a fan of the actor and had gone to her house to talk to her through a video call, as she is currently travelling abroad.” When contacted, the actor’s father told TOI, “A fan never visits with a knife and ‘gun’. I have sustained stitches on both my hands. I have filed an FIR and am currently not in a condition to talk much.” API Chavan said, “The complaint stated that the suspect barged into his flat on the second floor of the building around 7am. He sprayed some chemical on the 63-year-old man’s face and also assaulted him with a knife. He then told him to hand over his wife’s ornaments,” He added, “Some alert neighbours of the elderly man and the watchman of the society overpowered the suspect and immediately informed the police. The suspect was later hospitalised with injuries.” Chavan said, “We are yet to question Shetge. We have booked him under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery), 452 (house trespass) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/actors-father-injured-in-bid-to-resist-burglar-in-nigdi-flat/articleshow/82954399.cms||---

On Monday, Jaipur and Ajmer police raided a transport company office and seized drugs without proper documents valued at Rs 11 crore. The two accused have been identified as Shyam Sundar Mundra, a chemist in Ajmer who allegedly ordered the consignment, and Rahul Chauhan, an Ajmer-based middleman. A third person has also been identified from Jaipur whose identity has not disclosed by police. “Other than the three accused, several others have been identified behind transporting and distributing it in the several cities across the state,” Digant Anand, DCP (crime), Jaipur police commissionerate. He said the seized drugs have been manufactured in May, which indicates that the supply chain is very small. He clarified the different price estimates on the catch quoted by Ajmer and Jaipur police. “One way to determine the worth is by calculating through the MRP, while the other way is estimating the worth through its rate in the black market. For us, the most important thing is the seizure,” said Anand. These drugs are generally smuggled from Himanchal Pradesh, Agra and North-East states. Meanwhile, the residences of Mundra and Chauhan were searched in Ajmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ajmer-court-sends-two-drug-dealers-to-2-day-cop-custody/articleshow/82956764.cms||---
---||Pune||IUCAA to webcast total lunar eclipse at 4.30pm today for sky enthusiasts||Pune: The first total lunar eclipse of 2021 on Wednesday visible in the North America, Central America, and parts of South America can be seen as a partial eclipse only in places in the northeast of India. Other areas, including Pune, do not fall in its path. “The shadow of the earth on the moon can only be seen by that side of the earth where the sun-earth-moon alignment happens. In India, it will be around 5pm when the moon is mostly covered. We will only see it come out of the shadow by the time the earth rotates to bring the moon into view for us. People in the Americas and some countries in the Pacific Ocean will see it as a total lunar eclipse,” Samir Dhurde, science educator and astronomer at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune, said.When the earth, in the course of its revolution, comes in between the sun and the moon blocking the rays of the sun from reaching the moon directly, casting a shadow on the moon. Director of Nehru Planetarium Arvind Paranjpye said the moon in Wednesday’s lunar eclipse will also be a red moon and a blood moon. “When the sun sets, the moon appears reddish because when the sun is in the horizon, the atmosphere scatters most of the blue light from the visible spectrum. The red part of the spectrum is the least scattered leading to a reddish appearance. The same will happen during the lunar eclipse. Blue light will be scattered while the least scattered red light will give a reddish tinge to the moon,” Paranjpye said while advising people not to believe in superstitions associated with eclipses. Aniruddha Deshpande, vice president of Jyotirvidya Parisanstha (JVP), the oldest association of amateur astronomers in India, said the last total lunar eclipse was visible on July 27, 2017 followed by a partial lunar eclipse on July 16, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/iucaa-to-webcast-total-lunar-eclipse-at-4-30pm-today-for-sky-enthusiasts/articleshow/82956775.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Asked Centre for nod to use 45+ vaccines for comorbid 18-44s, say Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the state government has sought permission from the Centre to utilise on loan basis the vaccines meant for the 45+ age group for those in the 18-44 group who have comorbidities. He said vaccination for all in the above 45 group is also being sped up to ensure that the state can focus on vaccinating those in the18-44 age group from the first week of June. Sawant said that the state government would now also allow walk-in vaccination for persons in the 18-44 age group, as per the decision of the Centre. “We have asked the Central government for its permission to use on loan-basis vaccines meant for 45 and above age group for the 18-44 group with comorbidities. If permitted, we will be able to use the available one lakh vaccines,” said Sawant. Those in the 18-44 age group should get a certificate of their comorbid conditions from their physician. They can show that certificate at the vaccination centre, and get themselves vaccinated, he said. As per expert committee members’ suggestions, the state will now give priority in the 18-44 age group to vaccinate lactating mothers with children below the age of two, and those with comorbid conditions, he said. “In the 18-44 age group, we have only 6,000 doses remaining from the previous stock received. We are getting an additional lot of 36,000 in the first week of June. We are also trying to procure 5 lakh doses from one company and 10 lakh from another. We are also trying to examine all other sources through which we can procure vaccines,” said Sawant. With many in the 45+ age group still reluctant to get their Covid-19 vaccine, the government has decided to launch another 10-day vaccination drive from Wednesday onwards for this category. In panchayat areas, the vaccination will be held at one location, while in municipal areas, there will be two sites. Public representatives and NGOs will help in the vaccination drive. “We have received a total of 7,31,020 doses so far,” he said. “For frontline workers and for those above the age of 45, 2.8 lakh doses are still available. We have started the second tika utsav, and have asked panchayats to provide transport to citizens to facilitate this.” He said that at present, 550 beds are available at the superspecialty block at GMC, and there are still 110 beds vacant. “We are shifting whichever patient is stable to the superspecialty block, so as to make beds available for other critical patients at GMC. We will be prepared in all aspects before June 10, infrastructure and training wise,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/asked-centre-for-nod-to-use-45-vax-for-comorbid-18-44s-sawant/articleshow/82956778.cms||---

According to local residents, the issue of drainage overflow was persisting for several days before the officials took stock of the matter recently. "With the increase in number of Covid-19 cases, the dirty water overflowing from the manhole was becoming a huge concern for the residents. Thanks to GMHC for promptly addressing the leakage which was brought to their notice just a week back," said HVN Raj, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. Ahead of the onset of monsoon, residents also fear that the issue of these overflowing manholes may worsen if regular maintenance is not done. "The sewage overflows usually happen because of the garbage that flows into the manholes along with the water and blocks the flow. I request the civic staff to ensure people don’t dump garbage in the open. Installing dustbins at street corners might really help in solving this issue," said Anita Kumar, a local resident. Meanwhile, the GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who has been inspecting the sanitation works across the city directed the GHMC officials to clear the garbage and urged citizens to not dump the garbage on roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sewage-overflow-in-banjara-hills-colony-finally-fixed/articleshow/82956772.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 25 shanties gutted in Vejalpur blaze, 100 homeless||AHMEDABAD: A major fire broke out in the slums in Vejalpur on Tuesday morning, gutting 25 shanties and rendering nearly 100 people homeless, said officials. No casualty was reported. An officer of the Ahmedabad Fire & Emergency Services (AFES) said a call was received at 9.47am on Tuesday about a cylinder blast at one of the shanties. Seventeen vehicles of the fire brigade were dispatched to douse the blaze. There were about 100 shanties in the slums. After a cylinder blast in one of the shanties, the fire spread to others in a matter of minutes. Fire brigade officials and local residents said that eventually eight LPG cylinders exploded in the fire. The explosions were heard in the radius of 1km. Fire brigade personnel took about two hours to control the flames and oneand-a-half hours more to clear the charred debris, said an AFES officer. He said that 3.40 lakh litres of water was used to douse the fire. As police and fire brigade personnel reached the spot, they first removed about ten cylinders to prevent further blasts, said deputy commissioner of police, Zone-7, Premsukh Delu. “There was a huge loss to people’s assets, but no lives were lost, nor any injury reported in the fire,” said Delu. An officer of the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) reached the site of the fire at about 4pm to ascertain the exact cause. People who lost their homes were made to stay at a water pumping station in the area. These people did not have toilets at their houses and had only electricity connections. They had to struggle to get water, said a local resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/25-shanties-gutted-in-vejalpur-blaze-100-homeless/articleshow/82954508.cms||---

The two boys panicked when Anand did not come out of the water. They alerted the watchman, who called for help,” Jadhav said. “We are ascertaining who holds the rights to the building site, as we were told Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was building a facility there. Earlier, the land belonged to a private society and was recently handed over to PMC. We are verifying these details,” he said.When contacted, a senior PMC building department officer said they had no knowledge about the incident. “We will verify the incident as well as ownership of the spot,” the official said.Assistant inspector Bhalchandra Dhavale said Anand — who was from a family of casual workers — and the two other boys had come to the construction site around 1pm.”The watchman told them to leave the spot. They returned 30 minutes later when the watchman was having lunch and sneaked into the site,” Dhavale said. “The watchman was still eating when one of the boys ran to him for help. As the watchman was alerting his colleagues, the two boys fled. The watchman jumped in and, after searching for a few minutes, brought a motionless Anand out of the water. He was taken to the closest hospital and declared dead,” Dhavale said.“The watchmen have been employed at the site by nearby housing societies to avert thefts in the area. The approach road to the site is also blocked,” Dhavale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12-yr-old-boy-drowns-in-pond-at-kharadi-construction-site/articleshow/82956762.cms||---

Even Nagpur Municipal Corporation-run (NMC) hospitals have large number of vacant beds, just three weeks after they were running to capacity. As of Monday, the city had over 3,000 oxygen, 1,000 ICU, and 200 ventilator beds available. The turnaround has happened in the last couple of weeks. The data suggests many of the 2,860 active patients are in home isolation. Some are in hospitals and some in Covid Care Centres. At the start of this month, the number of admissions were 15,000 due to which patients were unable to easily find a bed. Fewer cases now has also led to closure of CCCs started by hospitals in association with hotels. Some private hospitals are also downsizing the staff hired for the additional workload. However, the dramatic change in Covid scenario hasn’t given any respite to staff of medical colleges. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said though Covid patients had declined they are occupied with other responsibilities. Medical colleges are now bracing for a possible third wave besides dealing with increasing black fungus and trauma cases. “There are still over 400 moderate to severe Covid patients who require good care. Mucormycosis cases require multidisciplinary approach and over 100 patients are admitted right now. Trauma patients are also increasing. Our doctors are hardly getting any time to relax,” he said. Dr Gawande added rush was also increasing in OPDs. “We are also full steam in preparation for third wave. We have 900 beds, so the vacant ones are being cleaned and kept ready,” he said IGGMCH officials said the college was busy with mucormycosis cases and also general treatment has resumed. “During second wave peak, we restricted to only emergency cases but now other surgeries and procedure have resumed,” they said. Civic officials said vaccination and Covid testing are keeping them busy at some NMC hospitals. A private hospital spokesperson said it was a matter of joy that they had to shut the CCC running in collaboration with private hotel. “We had hired the additional healthcare staff on a six month bond. We are accommodating them in our routine hospital duties. Some of the existing staff were asked to do double shifts in CCCs. It is wrong to say we are suddenly downsizing. We knew it wasn’t a long term arrangement,” the spokesperson said, adding they too are now occupied with routine healthcare activities and mucormycosis cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-empty-out-as-covid-load-shrinks-take-up-other-works/articleshow/82954557.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Genome lab, IISER suspend ops to prevent equipment damage||Kolkata: The genome sequencing laboratory at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, has been temporarily shut down to protect the sophisticated machinery from damage during the cyclone. The lab is one of the 10 facilities nationwide that is carrying out whole genome sequencing (WGS), a critical research to identify and know the new strains that coronavirus mutates into by scanning samples of infected persons. WGS is crucial to check the virulence of the coronavirus and combat the Covid-19 pandemic. During Amphan, a power cut in laboratories had led to loss of research material accumulated over a decade by scientists at Calcutta University. Bio specimens like cell lines and tissues that were kept in refrigeration units at the laboratories in the Ballygunge Science College campus were lost. The shutdown process at NIBMG that was initiated on Monday was completed on Tuesday, well ahead of Wednesday’s storm when winds are expected to reach 60-80km/h gusting at 90km/h. While the buildings where the laboratories are situated are not vulnerable, it is the power supply that is a worry. Any major voltage fluctuation can damage the sensitive equipment used for WGS. “WGS involves analysing the genetic code of an organism and is done with the help of powerful computers. If there is damage to the computers or the servers due to erratic power supply caused by the cyclonic storm, a lot of data will be lost. So the sequencing operation was gradually scaled down to bring it to a halt to preserve the data. Once the storm blows over, maybe sometime Thursday, the sequencing operation will be resumed,” said NIBMG director Saumitra Das. At the neighbouring Indian Institute Science Education & Research (IISER) in Kalyani’s Mohanpur, several laboratories are also being shut down to prevent equipment damage. These include computer clusters to store big data, transmission electron microscopy and mass spectroscopy. However, the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) used to study nano-level molecular structure that requires continuous nitrogen supply cannot be switched off and is being carefully monitored. “During the time of the storm, two students will be on duty at each laboratory to keep a watch on power supply to refrigeration units where cells and organisms are stored at below -80°C,” said IISER associate professor Amirul Islam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/genome-lab-iiser-suspend-ops-to-prevent-equipment-damage/articleshow/82954550.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Delhi||1,568 Covid cases, 156 deaths in last 24 hours in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 1,568 Covid cases on Tuesday from 73,406 tests. It’s a little higher than Monday’s 1,550 cases, but the positivity rate has dipped to 2.14% from 2.52%. The death count also continues to fall, with 156 on Tuesday as against Monday’s 189. The daily discharge from Covid hospitals in the past many days has been nearly three times more than the fresh number of daily cases, resulting in a huge fall in active cases and relief for the overstretched healthcare infrastructure. The biggest turnaround, however, is the fall in the positivity rate over a month. On April 22, the city reported its highest positivity rate at 36.2%. Its fall to 2.14% means only two out of 100 people being tested for the novel coronavirus infection are now found positive. A total of 4,251 patients were discharged from hospitals, Covid care centres and home isolation on Tuesday. Last week, between 6,500 and 10,000 patients were being discharged daily. The number has come down this week due to a massive fall in active cases. The dip has also resulted in lower occupancy of Covid beds. “It is now easy to get beds in hospitals,” said a health official. Among the 25,035 Covid beds in hospitals, 7,872 are occupied and 17,163 vacant. Exactly a month ago, of the 20,333 Covid beds, only 1,579 were vacant. In the past 12 days, the number of admitted patients has declined to 5,226 from 12,740; however ICU beds are still in demand. Covid deaths have also started declining. Last week, the daily deaths hovered between 340 and 200, while it has gone under 200 in the first two days this week. So far, 23,565 people have died of Covid in Delhi. A doctor said some of the reasons behind the high death count during this wave included higher number of cases, delay in detection of infection and beginning of treatment and comorbidities. “The current deaths do not reflect the fall in the number of daily cases because many dying now got infected earlier. In some days, the deaths will also fall sharply,” said the doctor. Overall, the city has witnessed over 14 lakh Covid cases, out of which 13.7 lakh patients have recovered. Delhi, which currently has 21,739 active cases, has conducted 1.9 crore Covid tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1568-cases-156-deaths-in-last-24-hrs/articleshow/82954552.cms||AlokKNMishra

Ask Bhavesh Javeri, the 40-year-old who made the two-and-a-half-hour journey as the lone passenger onboard an Emirates flight from Mumbai to Dubai on May 19. “The airhostesses applauded when I stepped into the aircraft,” said Javeri, CEO of Stargems Group, speaking to TOI from his Dubai office, about his “money-can’t-buy experience”. Javeri, a frequent flyer, has boarded over 240 flights between Mumbai and Dubai in the past two decades, but this is the first time he recorded a clip of himself boarding flight EK501. The commander waved at him from the cockpit and even came over for a chat. “Should I give you a tour of the entire plane?” he joked. The novelty didn’t wear off after he buckled into seat 18 A (18 is my lucky number, I asked for that seat, he said). The inflight messages were delivered with a personal touch. “Mr Javeri, please fasten your seat belt...”, “Mr Javeri, we are preparing to land…” The perks of being the solo passenger didn’t end there. “After landing, I walked out leisurely and picked up my bag, the only one lying next to a conveyor belt,” said Javeri, a Dubai resident for the past 20 years. Emirates did not comment to a query sent by TOI. Before Delhi upstaged it, Mumbai-Dubai was one of the busiest international routes out of India. So why did the airline have a Boeing 777, the world’s largest twin-engine jet, burn about 17 tonnes of fuel worth Rs 8 lakh to fly a lone economy-class passenger? Under the current travel restrictions put in place by UAE, only its nationals, holders of UAE Golden visa and members of diplomatic missions can fly from India to UAE. Javeri, a Golden visa holder, bought an economy class ticket a week in advance. “I normally book a business class ticket, but I thought, why not book an economy seat, the flight would have only a few passengers,” said Javeri, whose parents live in Breach Candy. At the airport, he was denied entry into the terminal building as his ticket didn’t have a date. Standing outside the entrance, he called up Emirates only to learn the entire staff was waiting for him. “I had flown a charter flight from Dubai to Mumbai last June with nine passengers on a 14-seater aircraft. But it was nowhere close to this experience,” he said. There have been quite a few solo-passenger flights around the world in the past, but such occurrences have gone up with the pandemic and the travel restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/40-year-old-flies-solo-on-360-seater-mumbai-dubai-flight-for-rs-18k/articleshow/82956824.cms||---

State Congress president Nana Patole on Tuesday termed the decision taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as “unconstitutional” and said the party will force the government to restore the 33% reservation in promotions. Congress minister Nitin Raut, too, said the state did not take the party into confidence while cancelling the reserved quota. Congress on Tuesday had an online meeting with MLAs and MPs belonging to the backward classes and the SC-ST officers’ union led by Patole and Raut. Sources said Raut has decided to raise the issue in the cabinet meeting scheduled on Thursday. After the meeting, Patole said, “The Congress is firm on restoring the reservation in promotions and will not compromise on the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cong-ending-33-quota-for-promotions-not-constitutional-in-mumbai/articleshow/82954543.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Goa||Lockdown improved water quality in Mandovi: National Institute of Oceanography||PANAJI: A significant decrease in navigational and industrial activities along the river bank brought down the level of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and nutrients in the Mandovi estuary during the lockdown last year. A study by Albertina Dias and other scientists of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), which involved sampling of water in the estuary during May 2020, showed that CDOM was low at two stations between the Mandovi bridge and Ribander as compared to the previous five years’ average, from 2014 to 2018. With restrictions in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, operation of pleasure cruises, water transport systems such as barges and shipbuilding activities came to a standstill. Relieved of anthropogenic stressors, the water quality improved due to penetration of more light in the water column and aquatic biota in the estuary benefitted from it. “When CDOM is more in the water column, it will not allow light to penetrate through and growth of phytoplankton, which is the basis of food chain, will be hampered,” Siby Kurian, co-author of the paper related to the study, and NIO scientist, said. The study was recent published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. Sunlight facilitates production of phytoplankton, the algae which are fed on by zooplankton, which in turn are consumed by small fishes in the food chain. But, if the CDOM is too low, it allows penetration of ultra violet light to greater depth and can affect the marine biota adversely. On the other hand, CDOM occurs not only due to anthropogenic factors, but also natural ones, like decay of phytoplankton also releases CDOM into the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-improved-water-quality-in-mandovi-nio/articleshow/82956808.cms||Paul Fernandes

Justice Rekha Palli asked “what do you want poor people to do? Beg for food?” and ordered standing counsel Santosh Tripathi to fast-track the process. The government said the policy to provide ration and food to the poor was being prepared and would be finalised soon. Tripathi told the court that over 240 centres would soon be opened across the national capital to provide rations to the poor during the pandemic. Those without ration/ID cards will also get rations at these centres. “It is hoped that the respondent (Delhi government) will take expeditious steps to finalise the policy, so that people like the petitioners here, including helpless women and disabled children, do not starve for want of food,” the court said and listed the matter for hearing in July to take stock of progress on the matter. It was hearing a plea moved on behalf of seven families that lost earning members to Covid-19 or lost jobs due to the pandemic and had no other source of livelihood. The plea sought ration facilities without any insistence on ration cards. The court issued notice to the ministry of consumer affairs and Delhi government and sought their stand on the plea, filed through advocate Abhishek Anand. The plea has also sought monetary relief for the petitioners and others in a similar condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-240-centres-to-provide-ration-to-the-poor-soon-hc-told/articleshow/82954881.cms||---
---||Goa||IIT-Goa asks students to frame own question paper||PANAJI: An IIT-Goa question paper which asked students to frame their own questions and then answer them has gone viral online, eliciting a vast array of wisecracks from netizens across the globe, as well as serious debate in professional circles. The unique, 70-mark paper was split into just two questions — the first, for 40 marks, asked students to set questions based on lecture materials provided, reflecting the student’s understanding of the course, to be answered in two hours. The second question, for 30 marks, instructed the students to answer the questions they just prepared. The 70-mark paper was split into just two questions — the first, for 30 marks, asked students to set questions based on lecture materials provided. The second instructed them to answer it“Avoid discussing with your friends. It may reduce your score if similarities are found,” the May 11 question paper, for second-year electrical engineering students, stated. The paper expectedly drew diverse comments, from some praising it to others criticising it. “Even the IIT in Goa loves to chill out,” remarked a user on Subtle Curry Traits, an India diaspora group with almost a million members. The post got over 6,500 likes, with some believing the test was “a great way to understand a student’s capacity”. His opinion was echoed by many. “Woah, what an examination!” posted netizen Rajan Karna. “You prepare questions for yourself and answer the same. Got to say IIT-Goa has found this unique way to evaluate students. It’s not going to be easy... it’s going to be a test of integrity too.” However, following objections from some quarters internally, the IIT has referred the paper to its senate committee for undergraduate programmes. The committee will review the question paper and present its report to the director shortly, based on which action, if any, will be decided. IIT-Goa director Prof B K Mishra said that the matter would be dealt with internally once he receives the report. Mishra, however, said that he personally found the question paper “novel”, and that it is good that it has triggered a debate in academic circles. “As director of IIT-Goa, I don’t interfere with my faculty members’ academic freedom,” he said. “Only thing is, one needs to see what system the faculty member has in place to grade students, because it is going to be tough to grade them on such a question paper. I found it novel at a time when students are struggling, we need new ways of evaluating them in an online teaching-learning scenario.” He said he has been following the comments on the issue online, too. “Students are positive about it,” Mishra said. “In professional circles, they are saying it is an interesting approach. This year, I decided to teach a course just to see how students are feeling in the entire pandemic situation, and there is strain on them. Some rightly pointed out that forcing students and grilling them in a three-hour exam is not quite right.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-iit-goa-set-own-questions-and-answer-them-too/articleshow/82956872.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The Mumbai airport was packed with passengers eager to rush home after being stranded here for over two months. Over the next 12 months, passenger traffic went up only to run into the Covid second wave and crash once again. The average daily passenger traffic at Mumbai airport is about 17,600 passengers—a 68% decline as compared to the 1.4 lakh passengers in January 2020. Currently, the airport is permitted to handle only 300 flights per day, a fraction of what it handled pre-pandemic when about 950 flights arrived or departed in 24 hours. But cargo flights have not been stifled by the second wave. Over 387 tonnes of Covid relief supplies from about 20 destinations arrived into India through the Mumbai airport between April 26 and May 19 on 110 flights, said a MIAL spokesperson. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/68-dip-in-passenger-traffic-at-mumbai-airport-since-jan-20/articleshow/82956853.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: ED searches premises of Nagpur-based businessman||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday searched the premises of Nagpur-based businessman Sagar Bhateware as part of its probe into a money-laundering case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Bhateware is a director in Rabia Properties, where Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh is also one of the directors. The agency is also examining the firms associated with Bhateware. On Tuesday, six ED teams raided six different premises connected with the case in Nagpur, besides other locations. The search was continuing at the time of going to the press. This was the first search by the ED in the case. The ED has registered the money-laundering case against Deshmukh based on CBI’s corruption FIR. It was alleged that Deshmukh, then the state home minister, had summoned controversial police officer Sachin Waze at his official residence in Mumbai and asked him to collect Rs 100 crore for him illegally from bar owners and other sources every month. The ED is probing where Waze had extorted money and parked the funds collected. They are also examining the financial transactions of Waze, his family members and firms associated with them in the case, along with Deshmukh’s and his kin’s. Earlier, the ED had recorded the statement of an Andheri bar owner, who told them that he was paying Rs 2.5 lakh every month to Waze, when the bars were allowed to operate during the pandemic after cases came in control during the first wave. The ED also summoned five other bar owners who too claimed that they paid Waze for not harassing them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-case-ed-searches-premises-of-nagpur-bizman-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82958244.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Nagpur||No guidelines yet from state govt to resume vax for 18+||NAGPUR: Though the central government permitted limited on-site registration, no one from the 18-44 age category received Covid vaccination in the city on Tuesday. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials said there were no guidelines yet from the state government to resume vaccination for this group of beneficiaries in the city. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the civic body doesn’t have enough doses to cater to the 18+ group. Regarding lactating mothers, he said an appeal has been made to them through anganwadi workers and Asha workers to take vaccination. Joshi added that so far 4.80 lakh 45+ group beneficiaries have taken the first dose. “Only a lakh of them have taken the second dose so far. We need another 3.80 lakh doses for the remaining people. Also, another one lakh in this group are yet to take their first dose,” he said. Joshi was responding to a TOI query if the left over doses from day’s achievement target could be diverted to 18+ age group, especially after the centre’s nod. Regarding the drive losing steam and the daily figures coming down to 2,528, he said the civic body is trying to rope in NGOs and women’s organization to sensitize people. He said the city needs to conduct at least 10,000 vaccinations per day to ensure all among the 45+ group get at least the first dose in next 10 to 15 days. At the current pace of around 2,000 does per day, it is feared the drive will drag on for long in the city. The NMC officials have observed a couple of reasons for the slowdown. Some beneficiaries have taken the jab at rural centres. The new norms regarding gap between vaccination and certain other conditions have also impacted the drive. Many recovered Covid patients are unable to take the jab for next two to three months. Officials said the civic body has been holding camps for ‘vaccination at your locality’ to ensure people in slums and labourers take the jab. “If we had not reached out to them, the daily figures would have come down further,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-guidelines-yet-from-state-govt-to-resume-vax-for-18/articleshow/82954611.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Sunil Dutt, councillor of ward 90 of Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Heritage, alleged that because of the interference of sitting MLA Rafiq Khan, the entire list of people to be vaccinated is pre-decided and common people were not given a chance to be vaccinated. Dutt said, “At Janta Colony, vaccination camp being held for the last three days with 100 people’s capacity per day, the entire list of people to be vaccinated is coming from MLA Rafiq Khan’s house and people were sent away from the centre saying that if you want to be vaccinated, then get written permission from Rafiq Khan. This is sheer misuse of power and we want government to intervene in it.” After the councillor protested at the centre on Tuesday, police were called in and he was taken into custody. Although, he was later released but questions are being raised on the vaccination drive in the city. Refuting the claims made by the councillors, MLA Rafiq Khan said that all the people given vaccination were in dire need of it with people testing positive at their homes or ones from poor background. Meanwhile, former MLA Ashok Parnami also alleged that rules were not followed at the centre where government staff was working.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-councillors-allege-mlas-interference-in-vax-centre/articleshow/82956877.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Breather for Punjab, Covid cases taper off over 2 weeks||CHANDIGARH: In what comes as some respite, Punjab government data indicates that both Covid-19 cases and positivity rate have tapered off consistently from May 10 onwards. Highest positivity rate of 16.13% was recorded in Punjab on May 10, which fell to 6.51% on May 24. Daily cases touched a peak of 79,963 on May 12 and by May 24, fell to 54,996. However, case fatality rate (CFR) of over 2%, which is one of the highest in the country, remains a cause for concern. In the first three weeks of May, Delhi recorded the highest CFR of 2.54% followed by Punjab at 2.46% and Uttarakhand at 2.34%. The national CFR in May was recorded at 1.17%. Punjab recorded the highest number of 231 deaths in a day on May 18 since the start of the Covid pandemic. A total of 13,468 persons lost their lives to the virus in Punjab till May 24. To prevent mortality, health advisor to Punjab government and former PGIMER director Dr K K Talwar suggests testing as soon as symptoms manifest and immediate medical consultation if the report is positive. “Patients are running to the hospitals at a very late state where they directly need to be admitted in L3 level hospitals and their chances of recovery get low,” he warned. Another challenge for the Punjab government is rise in cases of black fungus or Mucormycosis. State government’s official figures reveal that the total number of the deadly fungus cases have reached 158 in the state till Tuesday evening and as many as 21 patients have lost their lives. The state government is also struggling to procure vaccines to stem both Covid and black fungus cases since it is totally dependent on the Central government for supply. Health experts are of the view that various restrictions put in place by the Punjab government since the beginning of the month have played a positive role in breaking the chain of the deadly virus. Punjab government also focused on testing and the highest number of 82,446 Covid tests were conducted on May 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/breather-for-punjab-covid-cases-taper-off-over-2-weeks/articleshow/82956890.cms||Sanjeev Verma

---||Kolkata||A yr after Amphan, Yaas fear strikes heritage structures||Kolkata: Across the city’s tall heritage structures, mostly churches and temples, and some campuses with heritage buildings and trees, the news of the cyclone Yaas inching closer is a cause of concern. In the past, these structures had been severely damaged and weakened by cyclones and earthquakes and Yaas may cause some irreversible damage, feared authorities. While old trees have been secured, there is no way in which the spires can be protected from the lashes of the cyclone. Two earthquakes, in 1897 and 1934, had wreaked havoc on the original spire of St Paul’s Cathedral, which finally fell off and had to be replaced later by a shorter one. Prior to that, the cyclone of 1864 had turned to rubble the first stained glass window that Bishop Wilson had brought from Windsor to be fitted behind the altar of the Cathedral. “A restoration work is on for the Eastern wall. We have been able to give the altar support from underneath and we are trying to undo all the damages caused by earthquakes and cyclones. Damages during Amphan are also being attended to. We pray to God that Yaas does not cause further damage,” said Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of the Kolkata diocese of the CNI, of which the Cathedral is a part. The stories are similar at St John’s Church, St Andrew’s Church and St Stephen’s Church. Two huge balconies on the eastern and western sides of the St John’s Church don’t exist anymore. “Taking off from the Amphan experience, we have tied up all doors and windows with thick ropes and this includes those at the steeple. We have made additional drainage arrangements so that the water gushing in from the Hooghly can be pumped out immediately. Trees have also been secured,” said presbyter Father Pradip Nanda. The historic weather cock that crashed down from the steeple of St Andrew’s Church during Amphan is yet to be restored, said presbyter Father Swarup Bar. In 1867, the church had suffered major damage from a lightning strike. The 200-year-old chapel that was built at the Bishop’s College in Shibpur, which is now the IIEST, is also under threat, said authorities. This was the first example of Gothic architecture in India built on the lines of the Hampton Court and is now called the Madhusudan Bhavan after Michael Madhusudan Dutta who stayed on the campus as a student. “It is a weak structure and heavily damaged. But it has great historical significance. We are about to restore it. During Amphan, we lost two 200-year-old trees just in front of this building. We are really scared about what Yaas will do this time,” said Bivore Das, assistant registrar and also chronicler of the historicity of the campus. All the mast lights of the Dakshineshwar Temple have been removed. The temple is going through a major restoration process because the structure, located on the banks of the Hooghly, has suffered structural damages. The trustees are keeping their fingers crossed about the effect of Yaas on the tall central tower of the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-yr-after-amphan-yaas-fear-strikes-heritage-structures/articleshow/82954609.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra SSC exam: HC asks state to explain why exams stand cancelled||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has directed the state government to explain why the SSC exams are cancelled when it has decided to hold HSC exams by May end. A vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade on May 20 had heard a challenge to the state’s May 12 decision to cancel the exams for nearly 16 lakh students due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In its order released on Tuesday, the judges directed that the state’s reply will also set out as to how Class X students will be uniformly evaluated “keeping in view the fact that every school has a different standard of evaluation and no school is allowed to declare the student as failed up to 8th standard, and in most of the schools there were no examinations in the academic year 2019-20 of students who were in Class IX.” The state will also explain how “they will ensure that the marks allotted at the school level are comparable across schools due to variation in the evaluation standards and mode of conduct of exams in the past years.” The judges said despite the second wave of Covid-19 having hit around early April 2021, the state failed to make a decision and inform Class X students and their parents whether it was going to hold the exams or not and informed them as late as May 12 that exams will not be held. “It is unfortunate that without considering what we have stated herein, the state government has proceeded to straightaway cancel the SCC examination without deciding how the students who are in the Xth standard would be evaluated in the event of such cancellation,” they added. The judges pointed out that in comparison, boards like CBSE and ICSE had not only informed about cancellation of exams by the second week of April “but have also provided a very well-planned, comprehensive, and foolproof programme of how the students would be evaluated and promoted to the next class in a very fair and transparent manner.” The judges said even after adjourning the hearing to know how students would be evaluated, government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade informed it “is not decided, thus leaving the students as well as their parents guessing about their/their ward’s future.” He sought time to take instructions and file a reply. “Conduct of education department of the state government speaks volumes, and shows the scant regard and concern it has about vital educational policies which mold and shape the future of its children, who have reached the first milestone of their educational life, and based on the correct, fair and well-thought-out policy of assessment, will proceed to compete with other students in future,” they wrote. The judges adjourned the hearing “out of exasperation” to June 1 for the state’s reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-state-to-explain-why-ssc-exams-stand-cancelled/articleshow/82964201.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Jaipur||Petrol price breaches Rs 100 mark in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Petrol prices on Tuesday hit the Rs 100 mark per litre in Jaipur at a time when the demand for auto fuels has crashed by 75% due to the lockdown. Prices in Jaipur and Jodhpur are lower compared to other districts as the presence of fuel depots in the two cities brings down the cost of transportation. If the prices have hit Rs 100 in Jaipur, they would be higher in rest of the state. One-third of the retail price is the actual cost of the fuel and the rest are taxes levied by both Centre and the state. In Rajasthan, the VAT rates on the auto fuels are highest in the country with petrol and diesel attracting 36% and 26% respectively. In February this year, the state government had reduced VAT by 2% on petrol and diesel. The government had claimed that the reduction would reduce VAT realizations by about Rs 900 crore annually. Even after the cut, VAT in the state is the highest in the country after Manipur’s 36.5%. Sunit Bagai, president of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said, “The state government should bring down VAT on petrol and diesel by 6% if it wants to give relief to the common man. Due to the rise in fuel prices, all the goods will be costlier, hitting the household budgets of people whose incomes have already been depleted due to the lockdown.” Bagai said that when the prices go up, the revenue to the state also increases proportionately as is VAT is charged as a percentage of the total cost after the central taxes. “The Centre’s taxes are in absolute value terms whereas the state’s tax is calculated as a percentage of that. That’s why with every increase, the state’s taxes also go up,” added Bagai. Despite lockdowns and demand squeeze, the state government earned more taxes from fuel sales compared to the previous year. In fact VAT revenues of the state increased by 10% from Rs 15,842 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 17,493 crore in 2020-21 (Covid year). Bagai said given that the government’s VAT revenues have not suffered, rather improved, it should now consider reducing the VAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petrol-price-breaches-rs-100-mark-in-jaipur/articleshow/82956920.cms||---

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union health minister Harsh Vardhan should have put vaccine production on top priority and if necessary, more companies should be allowed and encouraged to produce vaccines by changing the law, he said.“The Union health ministry should leave statistics aside and ensure more vaccines are available for the states. If the third wave affects children, then the country will never forgive,” Gehlot tweeted.In a country with a population of 130 crore, if vaccines are not provided soon and the third wave starts affecting children, then the situation will be worse than the second wave where people struggled to get oxygen and essential medicines. He called for augmenting vaccination drive which is critical to avoid a third wave which according to experts is likely to infect children more.Gehlot recently alleged that the central government had failed to make a road map for vaccination and lack of preparation on vaccination front is evident in the shortage of vaccine that the country is facing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ensure-enough-vaccines-for-states-cm-to-centre/articleshow/82956910.cms||---

Suresh Patel, 54, a resident of New Ranip, in his FIR said that the accused, accompanied by another person, came into his shop on Monday morning and said he wanted to buy a gold chain and a pendant. Patel showed him a gold chain and a pendant, worth Rs 71,000, the accused put it on to see if it suited him. The accused told Patel that he wanted to spit out paan-masala and went out while wearing the gold chain and pendant. When Patel tried to stop him, he said that his friend would stay there while he went out to spit. After about 15 minutes, the accused person returned to the shop and resumed negotiating the price of the gold chain and pendant. After a couple of minutes, he told Patel he wanted to spit again. This time, Patel did not stop him as the accused’s friend was sitting in the shop only. But after this, the accused did not return even after an hour. When Patel began asking the other man about the accused person, he expressed ignorance as to where he had gone. Patel locked the man inside his shop and called the police. A Sabarmati police team reached the shop and nabbed the nother man, later identified as Mahaveer Prajapati, a resident of Odhav. Prajapati said he was tricked into accompanying Thakkar to the shop. Prajapati told the cops that the accused stayed at the hotel in Odhav where he works as a cook for around a month. The accused had identified himself as Radhe Thakkar at that hotel and his bill of Rs 90,000 was unpaid. Sabarmati police inspector R S Thakar said the accused was charged with theft and is yet to be nabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-steps-out-to-spit-flees-with-gold-chain-in-new-ranip/articleshow/82954644.cms||---

We therefore call upon the additional solicitor general of India to state what action would the Centre initiate.” Ventilators are believed to be life-saving instruments and malfunctioning can put lives of patients in danger, said the HC, posting the next hearing on May 28.Of 150 ventilators with the model name ‘Dhaman III’ supplied by the Centre though a company to Marathwada, “except 37 ventilators which are yet to be unboxed, 113 ventilators put to use by government or private hospitals are found to be defective,” noted the HC.Chief public prosecutor D R Kale said five private hospitals who were distributed 41 ventilators had written that “not a single ventilator is functional” and declined to use them as it poses “serious threat” to lives of patients. They wrote to authorities to take back these ventilators, he said. In court, it was clarified that 64 ventilators supplied by several industries and the Chamber of Marathwada Industries “are perfectly operational and flawlessly working.”Advocate S S Bora, appointed as amicus curiae (friend of court) to assist the HC, had submitted newspaper reports to show MLAs and other people’s representatives have “jumped into the issue of non-functional ventilators supplied through PM Cares fund. Some started visiting the government medical college and hospital to find out whether the ventilators are functioning properly or not,” HC observed.“We express our displeasure as regards such indulgence by people’s representatives. This is likely to cause more botheration to medical faculty than render any assistance,” HC noted. “Contrary statements are being issued by politicians. We find it to be distasteful as some politicians have visited the hospital posing as if they have knowledge or expertise to inspect the ventilators and recommend correctional methods,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/defective-ventilators-bombay-hc-asks-centre-about-action-it-will-take/articleshow/82956941.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Drought & dogs gift endangered vultures safe food||Siswan dam (Mohali): A lethal combination of drought in the Shivalik foothills behind the Tricity and the wanton killing of Sambar fawns by stray dogs from neighbouring villages has had a positive spin-off for endangered resident and migratory vultures. Dogs are killing more Sambars that they can eat at the vulnerable water holes and check dams, which are receding by the day. An unprecedented number of vultures have flocked to these parched water holes and taken advantage of the “safe food”, the Sambar carcasses, which are naturally free of the veterinary drug Diclofenac and other anti-inflammatory drugs administered to ailing cattle. The concern for Diclofenac-free zones for vultures in the Tricity region arises from the release of six captive-bred and critically-endangered White-rumped vultures from the Haryana government-BNHS Jatayu Conservation Breeding Centre, Pinjore, last October. In fact, one of these released vultures was tracked by satellites feeding at the drying Siswan dam, a hotspot currently for vultures due to the abundance of Sambars killed by packs of domesticated dogs from neighbouring villages. Wildlife photographer Pushkar Bali noted that “there were just 4-5 vultures at Siswan last summer but this year I have seen 30 at one time due to an abundance of Sambar carcasses.” The summer of 2021 has witnessed dams and jungle waterholes drying up rapidly in the foothills due to an abnormal paucity of rainfall in preceding months. While welcoming the safe food available to vultures, BNHS deputy director and pioneering vulture scientist, Dr Vibhu Prakash, struck a note of warning: “Dogs are causing immense harm to wild species. They not only kill sambars but severely disturb birds that nest along water banks or forage around water bodies. Dog packs harass birds like peacocks that come to drink water in acute summer. Habitats for wildlife are shrinking dramatically and dogs are adding immensely to the destruction of species,” Dr Prakash told the TOI. As long as dogs are killing Sambars and the forest and wildlife departments are doing precious little to counter dog massacres, the carcasses of Sambars do benefit vultures. These magnificent avian scavengers have declined drastically by feeding on cattle carcasses that retain Diclofenac residues. But there are cases where the Haryana forest department’s wildlife wing has been quietly burying dozens of Sambar carcasses denying vultures the safe food. “We are sensitive to water shortages at wildlife points and have been refilling the drying holes. However, we will ensure that the staff is sensitised to any waterhole that we may have missed and needs to be filled. We will also sensitise the field staff to leave Sambar carcasses in the open for vultures,” M L Rajvanshi chief conservator (wildlife), Panchkula, told TOI. The array of vulture species feeding on Sambar carcasses at the drying water points is dominated by the Himalayan vulture but the rare Cinereous or King vulture has also been observed. Dogs and vultures have long shared a close association while feasting on carcasses. “Vultures carefully watch a carcass before coming down to it. When vultures see that dogs and crows have begun eating and are undisturbed, vultures also come down from their tree perches as they feel the area is now free of disturbance or threat,” Dr Prakash explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/drought-dogs-gift-endangered-vultures-safe-food/articleshow/82952674.cms||---
---||Kolkata||From New Mkt to College St, traders shift goods and books, rejig drainage system||Kolkata: Markets across the city saw a large number of shopowners packing up their items and transporting them to safety. Many shops that do not have the problem of seepage from ceilings and walls but get waterlogged easily, were seen removing items from the lower racks and placing them as high as possible. In many shops even furniture and display racks were removed to safety. Right from New Market to Hatibagan, from Gariahat to the ground floor shops in standalone market complexes and the College Street boipara, the picture was the same everywhere. At New Market several stores had complained of heavy damage from Amphan when the ceilings had leaked and there was ankle deep water on the floor of the shops. No one had expected the damage to be this heavy. Once the shops were opened up, sarees and other garments, cosmetics and eatables were found to be completely soggy and destroyed. “We were careful this time and removed all those items that were stacked in the portions of the shop where the ceiling leaks. We have taken them home,” said Vinay Mangalani, owner of Bombay Silk Stores. Former member mayor-in-council (markets), Amiruddin Bobby said that the roof of the market was filled up with unused items that have now been removed and the drainage system has been improved. “This will prevent flooding,” he said. “We didn’t want to take chances, however. As it is the market is shut and there will be fungal attack on the clothes. The cyclone might cause further damage,” said Sunil Aswani of Menka. Even boutiques in some stand-alone market buildings have removed their stocks because they get flooded. Sumona Koner, owner of Selai, a boutique in a market building on Anwar Shah Road, spent the entire Tuesday packing up her customised clothes. Hawkers at Gariahat and Hatibagan were seen packing up their items securely in trunks and carrying them inside buildings with which they have made temporary agreements. At College Street, book sellers tied up books and kept them on higher shelves. The stalls were then covered with plastic sheets. Some stall owners made arrangements with book stores to keep some stocks inside. Swapan Dutta, who heads association of these temporary book stalls, had called all stall owners to open their stalls and either take their stocks away or arrange them safely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-new-mkt-to-college-st-traders-shift-goods-and-books-rejig-drainage-system/articleshow/82954695.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

She came to Rishikesh, with a travel group when the lockdown was imposed last year. While being stranded in the city, she learnt about Varun Juneja, an economist who studied in the United Kingdom & Hong Kong and is now settled in India. With so many people running out of their daily wages, Varun arranged a place to cook for the people in need. “Seeing the work being done by Varun, I also got inspired to join him and amplify the cause he was working for. To help more and more people, we needed to raise money,” she said. Tarini Maa took help from her husband Ram Das Batchelder, a writer from USA who has been living at Mata Amritanandamayi Math in Kerala for the last three decades. He took pictures and videos of the welfare work that Varun and Tarini had been doing with limited means. The campaign became popular in the US and help started pouring in. After the lockdown was removed and people started returning to their usual life last year, the initiative didn’t stop. Tarini also opened a Shakti school of arts which has over 50 girls aged 4 to 9 years and 10 to 14 years. The girls here are taught art, yoga, dance and English. ‘Feeding Rishikesh’ initiative has now expanded to provide special help to women who have been abandoned by their husband and are in need of care and medical services for themselves and their children. “The children who come to the schools are also being treated for malnutrition with nutritious food under medical supervision,” Tarini said. “By the end of the lockdown, we had distributed over 25,000 ration bags. We had also started giving cooked meals to people at Triveni Ghat and Chandrashekhar Mahadev temple since September 2020 and it continues till date,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/foreigners-on-spiritual-quest-in-rishikesh-extend-help-to-daily-wagers/articleshow/82952738.cms||---

The division bench of Justice Sabina and Justice V K Vyas asked the government to reply to the notice by June 28. The petition was filed by lawyer Siddarth Jain. The petitioner said Covid had posed a never-imagined challenge to every sector of society and every activity of the nation. Due to the pandemic, another epidemic called mucormycosis (Black Fungus) has emerged , which has hit more than 500 people. Mucormycosis is a fungus infection that mainly affects people who are on medication for Covid or for other medical conditions that reduce their ability to fight environmental pathogens. It could be life threatening if proper diagnosis and treatment is not provided on time. Due to the increasing cases of black fungus, Rajasthan government has placed orders for purchase of about 2,500 injections of liposomal. Mucormycosis patients have to take about 40 to 60 injections, but it is not available in the market. Due to this, many people lost their lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/high-court-notice-to-state-on-med-crisis-for-black-fungus-treatment/articleshow/82956977.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The worst, however, is in Uttarakhand where the recovery rate is a low of 80.7%. Only north-eastern states of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Sikkim have a far worse recovery rate ranging between 70-76%.

For almost a month, 20 forest-dependent Van Gujjar families have been forced to live under the open skies after being banned from entering the Govind Wildlife Sanctuary citing the pandemic. On Wednesday, the Uttarakhand high court slammed the state government and the forest department for violating their human rights and ordered immediate steps to ensure their free movement. “I hope this gentleman knows that you cannot reduce humans to less than an animal existence and this is exactly what he has done … They are not animals. They are as much human beings as you and I are and they have the same fundamental rights and human rights. They can’t be left abandoned to the mercy of gods,” Chief Justice RS Chauhan said during the hearing. The bench of the Chief Justice and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has asked the district magistrate of Uttarkashi Mayur Dikshit and deputy director of the sanctuary Komal Singh to ensure all families are tested for Covid immediately and allowed in if they test negative. Meanwhile, the others must be put up at a permanent settlement and provided with food, medicines and fodder for their cattle. The Van Gujjars depend on cattle for their livelihood and migrate to the upper reaches seasonally. TOI had earlier reported that around 100 members of the nomadic community had set off on foot from Mohand and Badakla in Dehradun and from Shakambhari in UP’s Saharanpur on April 30 but stopped from going to Sankri and Rupin ranges and asked to “put up on the roadside” instead with their children and cattle. At least 12 buffaloes died without food and water. Arjun Kasana, an activist, informed the court about the plight of Van Gujjars by filing an affidavit in a bunch of petitions already pending before the high court. In one of the photographs he submitted, a child is seen sleeping next to a dead buffalo. Chief Justice Chauhan referred to the image and asked, “How can you possibly reduce human beings to this low level of existence?” He added that he is “surprised at the adamancy” of the deputy director. The bench further said that Singh’s behaviour has been “dictatorial” and asked if he “knows about the words human rights and Article 21 of the Constitution.” The court prima facie held that the right to life of these Van Gujjar families has been violated by the forest department and the local administration. The district magistrate and the deputy director have been asked to file reports on steps taken to comply by June 15. The case has been listed for hearing the following day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kid-asleep-next-to-dead-buffalo-tribe-forced-to-live-outdoors-for-month-hc-slams-govt-on-pandemic-rules/articleshow/82952818.cms||Prashant Jha

The teachers claimed the school was deliberately not taking new admission of students to show losses and had filed a caveat in court against them moving it for relief. School secretary Sanjay Dabrai said: “Since we are not getting new admission due to Covid-19 and student’s parents not paying fees, we are suffering losses. So we have issued retrenchment letters and once students come back to school, we will take the teachers back.” The primary and secondary New Era School has been run from 1964 by Seva Sadan trust, which also runs RKT College in Ulhasnagar. “We have written to the school management, asking them to take back the teachers. If they do not, we will take action,” said Bhausaheb Mohite, municipal education officer. Neeta Gupta, a teacher, said the school has retained only three teachers for around 900 students in the pre-primary and primary sections. “The school has given us 16 teachers gratuity with one month’s salary, which shows they have no intention of taking us back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-16-teachers-laid-off-by-ulhas-school-hold-protest/articleshow/82957062.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: Drones to keep vigil on Ganga pollution, containment zones||VARANASI: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath launched four drones in Varanasi on Tuesday morning for curbing pollution in Ganga, keeping a vigil in containment zones and delivering medicines and other essential articles to the needy. The officials displayed drone operations before CM at the Community Health Centre in Shivpur and informed him that these drones can move at a speed of 10-12 m/sec and can fly to a height of 120 metre. Varanasi municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi said, “We have arranged four types of drones for efficient monitoring during the second wave of Covid-19 in partnership with Garuda Aerospace Private Limited, Chennai, under the Smart City project. These drones equipped with high resolution cameras will help in monitoring river Ganga stream and ghats along it.” The videos and photographs captured by the drones will enable the officials to keep vigil and will help in judicious deployment of personnel and resources and make further strategies. In case of emergencies, these drones will also deliver medicines and other essentials in containment zones. The drones are equipped with public address system and can be used to relay administrative orders and spreading awareness in containment zones, besides surveillance in containment zones, said Rathi. “These advanced drones are GPS enabled and can hence also help in medicine kit distribution and can in fact deliver them in the hands of beneficiaries at their registered address,” he added. During the lockdown last year, officials had carried out sanitisation of more than 2,750 acre with the help of drones. Rathi also received CM’s appreciation for using drones efficiently for these purposes. The drone used in sanitisation has a 10 litre tank which is filled with sodium hypochlorite solution, said officials. Drones are used for sanitisation in containment zones where taking heavy machine is not possible. The smart city officials said surveillance through drones will help check contamination of the holy river. In the past fortnight, many bodies were found floating in river Ganga and had created a row. Massive patrolling had been started and police teams were deployed on boats to prevent immersion of bodies in river and administration made arrangements for helping families lacking resources in proper cremation of bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/drones-to-keep-vigil-on-ganga-pollution-containment-zones/articleshow/82957051.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Pune||Pune: Cyclone Tauktae hits supply of veggies, triggers price rise||PUNE: The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) has reported a 10-15% increase in the prices of all vegetables, including leafy greens, onions and tomatoes, at the Market Yard here. The price hike was blamed on a disruption in supply for the past two days in Pune district in the wake of cyclone Tauktae. Sources said the intake at the Market Yard was less than average on Monday and Tuesday. “The supply disruption has had an effect on the prices of vegetables. But this won’t last long as a fresh supply of vegetables is soon expected,” said Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of the Market Yard and secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). On an average, the Market Yard gets 900-950 truckloads of vegetables per day. This dropped to 850 truckloads on Monday, officials from the vegetables section at the Market Yard said. “On Tuesday, we got 20,599 quintals of vegetables and fruits in 873 vehicles. This is less than the average intake and led to the price hike,” Datta Kalamkar, head of the vegetables section, told TOI. Kalamkar said demand for all vegetables was high in the market. “Poor weather and the cyclone have affected crops in most tehsils of the district,” he explained. Vilas Bhujbal, head of the Commission Agents Association, said most farmers do not cultivate fresh vegetables, particularly coriander, fenugreek and spinach, due to uncertainty in sales and low rates. “Several farmers had not planted cauliflower and tomato, among others, due to Covid restrictions. This has also disturbed the supply. Because of this, prices will remain high for a few days,” he said. In the retail markets, a kilo of onion was sold for Rs15-20, while potato and tomato were going for Rs15-22 and Rs8-14 respectively. The rates of leafy vegetables too increased by Rs 5-10 per bunch. A bunch of Coriander is now sold for Rs 10Rs 15, while fenugreek is being sold for Rs12-18 per bunch. Spinach, meanwhile, costs Rs 7-12 per bunch. Sandesh Khade, a retailer from the Vishrantwadi market, said he expects the prices to remain high for two weeks at least. “The supply shortage could affect prices for the next two weeks or so. Many farmers told us that they haven’t grown fresh vegetables because of the curbs,” he said. Deepti Deshpande, a resident of Dighi employed with a private firm, said citizens will feel the pinch, especially with the financial impact of the ongoing pandemic. “This comes at a time when salaries are being reduced. It has become difficult to meet our monthly expenses,” she said. Archana Gardare, a resident of Dhankawdi, said, “We always buy vegetables at high pricees. The prices of several grocery items too have significantly increased this month. We don’t know how to manage monthly expenses. Things have become very difficult during the pandemic”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cyclone-tauktae-hits-supply-of-veggies-triggers-price-rise/articleshow/82957030.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||South Kolkata Club starts auto-ambulances for Covid patients||KOLKATA: A South Kolkata club has converted autos into Covid ambulances to ferry patients to hospitals with oxygen support. Rolled out this Sunday for the Covid patients of Dhakuria, where the club is located, the auto-ambulances are being much sought after for the patients living in far-off areas like Baghajatin, Garia, Tollygunge, Behala and Thakurpukur. The initiative comes at a time when ambulances are fleecing the kin of Covid patients to ferry them to hospitals. Having started with two autos, the club — Dhakuria Tarun Mahal — is planning to introduce more such ambulances with the demand steadily soaring. “We were hearing the horror stories of ambulances charging exorbitant amounts from the patient parties. We realised that such patients even with severe symptoms may require oxygen support. We thought if we keep an oxygen cylinder and put up a plastic partition for the safety of the driver, we can manage to ferry them to hospitals,” said Sarbajit Sengupta, secretary of the club, which is also preparing food for 500 Covid patients staying in isolation. “If the patient is poor, we offer him or her the service at free of cost. If the patient can afford it, we charge only the costs of fuel and sanitization,” said Subho Chakraborty, a member of the club and frontline worker who has volunteered to ferry patients to hospitals. From Sunday, they have ferried nine patients to hospitals. “ “The idea to start auto-ambulance came to our mind when we saw the hapless kin of Covid patients. We contacted some auto operators who were sitting idle because of the restrictions in the city. They readily agreed to our proposal,” said Billow Mukherjee, a member. “We already have a stock of 40 oxygen cylinders for the service meant for Dhakuria residents,” said Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/club-starts-auto-ambulances-for-cov-patients/articleshow/82954741.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Jaipur||BJP accuses govt of hiding coronavirus death figures||Jaipur: BJP leaders Satish Poonia and Rajendra Rathore have alleged that the state government was hiding Covid figures, including the number of deaths caused by the virus. BJP allegations were based on a local newspaper’s claim that Covid deaths in the state were 14,000 and not over 3,000 as reflected in the official data. Health minister Raghu Sharma denied the allegation saying that the state government is keeping record of each Covid death that takes place in the hospitals. Sharma said, “There are no chances of any kind of irregularity in it.”Our efforts from the first wave was in the direction to keep record, from positive cases to deaths. Directions have been given till ground level to ensure that there is no tampering in figures. We are more concerned about the lives of people.” Justifying his claim, Sharma said that Rajasthan is a bigger state and its population is around 8 crore. In such a big state, there is a possibility of deaths, apart from Covid, from other diseases, accidents and age-related ailments. It is not wise to link such deaths with Covid. It is quite possible that due to lack of awareness or carelessness, a patient did not undergo Covid test and he died. In such a situation, when a person dies without being tested for Covid, his death cannot be registered as a Covid death. The figures issued by the state government are certified and correct.BJP leaders have alleged that the government is hiding Covid death figures.Satish Poonia, state BJP chief, said, “The condition of hospitals has not improved. Neither staff was deployed, nor oxygen plants were installed. Beds in hospitals and medicines were black-marketed. Patients kept dying on the door of the hospitals and you kept hiding the figures of deaths. 50% vaccination was your responsibility, but you kept misleading the people. The people will not forgive you.” BJP leader Rajendra Rathore, in his tweet, said that the chief minister should stop hiding the number of Covid deaths in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-accuses-govt-of-hiding-coronavirus-death-figures/articleshow/82957001.cms||---

In the last week of May to first week of June, ‘Nautapa’ (nine days of heatwave) will be witnessed wherein mercury will further take an upward swing across the state and many places are likely to log maximum temperatures on or above 40°C, the Met reports said on Tuesday. Attributing the continued rise in mercury to the active northerly winds and upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office stated that places including Churu, Sriganganagar, Barmer, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur are likely to report maximum temperatures above 44°C. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning as a minimum temperature of 26°C was recorded.

The overall state-wise rural-urban district share in new cases indicates that rural penetration has increased, while the share of urban areas has dropped during the second wave. While the rural areas accounted for 40.2% in the daily cases during the first peak that had hit the state in September last year. However, during the second wave, the percentage share went up to 42.2% in April and further shot up to 45.3% in May. Contrary to the trend in the interiors, the share of urban areas in the daily caseload slipped from 59.8% in September 2020 to 57.8% in April and 54.7% in May. Bathinda, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur, Nawanshahr, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur -- districts having more than 60% of their population residing in rural areas -- have been hit hardest by the virus in the last two months. Till the week ending May 23, Bathinda had the highest positivity of 13.9% in the state. These districts are having a case fatality rate higher than the state’s average of 2.46. Sangrur has emerged as a district with the highest death rate of 7.1%, followed by Nawanshahr, where 5% of total infected patients died in a seven-day period. Gurdaspur recorded a death rate of 4.2% while for every 100 confirmed cases, four died in Bathinda and Gurdaspur. During this period, Bathinda recorded the highest number of 154 deaths while 95 people died in Sangrur. To control the spread of the virus in rural areas, the government has started screening people living in rural areas across the state for early detection and isolation of the infected. About 25 lakh households, comprising a population of 92 lakh have been screened by the health workers. Acknowledging the challenge at hand, Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the government is taking every possible step to control the spread of the virus. “Surveillance has been increased in the rural belt,” said Sidhu, urging the people to cooperate with the teams of the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-punjab-covid-rural-caseload-heavier-than-2020/articleshow/82957023.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Jaipur||Vax drive for 18+ category lacks speed, 14 lakh jabs of 7 crore given so far in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The state health department has administered the first dose of Covid vaccine to nearly 14.08 lakh people in the 18+ category till Monday since launching the drive on May 1. The numbers translate to only 2 per cent of the target of 7 crore doses considering that the 18-44 age group population in the state is around 3.5 crore. Authorities have blamed the vaccine companies for the slow pace of vaccination as the companies have not been able to cater to the demand of the state health department. TOI on Tuesday spoke to the authorities to find out the reasons why the vaccination is going at a snail’s pace and why many who have registered were still unable to get a slot. “We have a capacity to vaccinate 7 lakh people per day in all categories including health workers, frontline workers, 18+, 45+ and 60 years and above, but till date we haven’t received adequate supply of vaccines. We paid money in advance to Serum Institute of India and even to Bharat Biotech. But we have been getting vaccines on alternate days and that too 1.5 lakh doses or even less,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination, on Tuesday. Singh added that while only 1 lakh or less vials are received, sending them to each and every district is a herculean task. “If we get a lot of almost 7 lakh vials, our transport mechanism and other logistics can have little rest. But right now the scenario is once a vehicle reaches at Sriganganagar with 5,000 vials, we need to send another vehicle a day later in another vehicle. We have been requesting the Serum Institute to send us adequate amount of vaccines,” he added. Even health minister Raghu Sharma has been complaining of insufficient supply of vaccines. “We have even paid money in advance to Serum institute, but we are not getting the required lot. I believe for 18+ category, we definitely need momentum. Also for every other category, we need sufficient vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vax-drive-for-18-category-lacks-speed-14l-jabs-of-7cr-given-so-far/articleshow/82957049.cms||Ashish Mehta

The officials were directed to record deaths occurred due to Covid and non-Covid separately. The move is aimed to provide social security to families who lost their members in the pandemic. Gehlot said, “Our government is transparent and does not follow a tradition to hide death figures. Our concern is to save the lives of residents.” While reviewing the Covid management in the state, he instructed officials to take cognisance against private hospitals, labs and medical shops who are charging extra for medicines, oxygen and other life-saving and not adhering to the rate list fixed by the government. “The state government is sensitive towards the victims and will take strict against against the law-breakers if any complaint is received.” Gehlot had earlier issued directives to local bodies to ensure that last rites of patients dying due to Covid be done with dignity and according to Indian rituals following proper health protocol. “Any carelessness in implementation and monitoring will not be tolerated,” he added. To combat with the expected third wave, the CM directed officials to study the methods adopted by different countries and states. Heath minister Raghu Sharma said the state required to establish infant intensive care before the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-directs-audit-of-covid-non-covid-deaths-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82957005.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Charging water bills on old rates to cause Chandigarh municipal corporation Rs 93 crore loss||CHANDIGARH: The decision to put the increased water tariff on hold will cause a loss of Rs 9.3 crore per month to the municipal corporation (MC) that will balloon to Rs 93 crore by March 2022, the date till which UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has ordered to charge bills on the old rates. The charges had been increased after a gap of around nine years. As the gap between revenue and expenditure will swell further, it remains to be seen whether the UT will provide any special financial relief to the MC. Before the revision, the civic body was earning Rs 76 crore, while the amount shot up to Rs 188 crore following the hike in the tariff. The move has come at a time when the engineering department of the MC has been spending Rs 215 crore annually to bring and supply water to the residents, widening the gap revenue loss gap to Rs 139 crore. The MC is already enduring a fund crunch. The situation is such that the civic body is able to pay salaries to employees and fulfil its committed liabilities only on a monthly basis. BJP HAND The UT administration had taken the plea of Covid-19 to take the decision, but the UT administrator just a few months back had rejected any revision and sent the matter to the MC for reconsideration. Sources said the municipal commissioner had opposed any kind of revision in the water tariff in the monthly general house meeting just a month back. Sources said BJP had put pressure on the administrator, seeking his interventions. BJP leaders had met the administrator and asked him to take the revised charges back while citing MC elections. “The UT administrator was briefed about the financial ramifications. However, he finally decided to put the charges on hold till March 2022, which will lead to huge financial loss to the MC,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/charging-water-bills-on-old-rates-to-cause-mc-rs-93cr-loss/articleshow/82952852.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Surat||Life term for man who raped niece||Surat: A 45-year-old textile worker was convicted by a local court for rape and sexual assault on his niece for nearly two years and impregnating the teenager. The court of PS Kala, additional sessions judge, passed the judgment after eight months on Tuesday sentencing accused Shailesh Rathod to life imprisonment. Even as the FIR had been registered, the court operations remained affected in the city due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. While accused Rathod, a resident of Salabatpura area, was not convicted under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), he was charged of rape and sexual assault on his 19-year-old niece under sections of Indian Penal Code. The survivor became pregnant from the repeated sexual assaults and was eight months pregnant when the family came to know about her plight. Due to the delay, the teen could not get the child aborted and is currently raising the girl child. DNA profiling of the child proved that Rathod is the father. The court ordered Rs 10 lakh compensation to the survivor of which Rs 6 lakh is to be deposited in bank and from its interest expenses for the child should be made. The survivor is an orphan. Her mother died nine years ago, while the father passed away from some illness seven years ago. The rape complaint was lodged by the survivor’s elder brother in Salabatpura police station on September 23, 2020 when he claimed her age to be 14 years. “However, it was proven in the court from her school leaving certificate that she was born in June 2001. Hence the man was not convicted under sections of POCSO and given the benefit of doubt,” said Kishore Revaliya, public prosecutor. Since 2019, the brother had spotted the survivor in objectionable condition with Rathod, who lived in the same neighbourhood. Rathod’s first wife died 12 years ago and another woman he married too died two years ago, police investigation revealed. According to cops, the accused used to lure the teen to his house with money and clothes and later started to sexually assault her by threatening to harm her family members. “Considering the gravity of the crime the court announced life imprisonment in which an elder relative rapes a young girl multiple times,” Revaliya told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/life-term-for-man-who-raped-niece/articleshow/82952895.cms||---

The cyber cell recently recorded the statement of five officials of the State Intelligence Department who had been working under Shukla last year when she had asked for the phones of influential individuals to be tapped. The cyber cell is investigating an FIR for leaking of the confidential phone-tap data. Last month, the police summoned Shukla and asked her to remain present at her home in the city for her statement but Shukla said she could not leave her Hyderabad office as her department had to look after Covid-19-related security arrangements. Subsequently, Shukla filed a petition in the Bombay high court saying she was being hounded as she was a whistleblower in the politician-police nexus for assigning powerful posts. She requested summons be stayed and the FIR quashed.

---||Nagpur||Covid treatment bill Rs7.8L, 20-day room rent Rs4.55L||Nagpur: A 63-year-old Covid patient ended up with a bill of Rs7.80 lakh after a 20-day stay in a private hospital in the city. Out of this, Rs4.55 lakh was towards room rent alone. The patient, whose details have been accessed by TOI, was admitted to Hope Hospital in Teka Naka on Kamptee Road on April 16 and was discharged on May 5. Admitted in a critical state, the man has survived after a long struggle. The days when he was on oxygen, the rate ranged from Rs20,000 to Rs25,000, without oxygen it was Rs15,000 a day. The patient was admitted in a separate room under 20% of beds of the hospital on which government cap on rates do not apply. The NMC auditors scrutinise bills charged for 80% of beds earmarked as government quota in a hospital, but there is no control over rest of the 20%. Even though the patient’s kin have not raised a dispute, chances are that there may be major deductions at the time of reimbursement of expenses by insurance company, said sources. Doctors TOI contacted over the issue said this is a classic case of input costs going up during the pandemic, even as rates to be charged on 80% beds are capped by the government. This leads to hospitals covering losses on the 80% government quota beds from charges levied on the remaining 20% on which there is no cap on rates. A litigation is already underway on his matter. Dr Murali BK, promoter of Hope Hospital, said the treatment happened after taking the patient’s consent. The patient’s son is also a doctor and a partner in the same hospital. “The room charges were on a consolidated basis. It included expenses towards oxygen, ventilator, consultants and other ICU management charges. These were all clubbed into one as it was easy for the patient to get an estimation of expenses The patient had consented to the cost,” said Dr Murali. Even as the government has capped rates for 80% of the beds, there has been no reduction on the input costs. Cost of a number of items had gone up when cases were at peak. Oxygen, which normally costs Rs300 a cylinder, was priced at Rs1,000. Cost of Bi-PAP, through which oxygen is administered, had doubled to Rs70,000, at least. NMC’s bio waste clearance cost has gone up to Rs1.65 lakh as against Rs15,000 earlier, he said. Dr Murali said even as the patient was kept in a separate room, the charges would have been more or less the same if he would have been in a sharing ward. One of the insurance consultants, to whom the case was referred to, told TOI that this would give a chance to the insurance company for deductions. “For a number of patients, the insurance cover itself is in the range of Rs5 ot Rs6 lakh. So, if Rs4.5 lakh is charged towards room rent alone, how would one pay for rest of the treatment,” he said. A source in a corporate hospital said at their end even an executive room does not cost more than Rs12,000, including other costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-treatment-bill-rs7-8l-20-day-room-rent-rs4-55l/articleshow/82954786.cms||Shishir Arya

The samples will be analysed to check if the pollution has increased lately since bodies washed ashore in large numbers for few days. The IITR team, in fact, collected water samples from different locations from Kanpur and Varanasi also. “We collected samples from various locations on the request of UP Pollution Control Board and will analyse them on several parameters to test quality of water,” said senior principal scientist at CSIR-IITR, Lucknow, K C Kulbe. After reaching Prayagraj, the team members wearing PPE kits collected samples from Shringverpur ghat and then moved to Phaphamau ghat, both spots where bodies had been buried in sand. “Although bodies are buried at Phaphamau and Shringverpur ghats but there is no need to panic as Ganga water is still fine. However, sample collection and analysis is welcome as the result would clear the picture,” said irrigation department executive engineer S K Singh. Former regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board, Mohammed Sikander said, “Groundwater is found at shallow depth on banks of the Ganga and is often just two feet below. When buried bodies decompose, material may seep into the groundwater which could pollute the river.” Officer in charge, UP Pollution Control Board, Pradeep Vishwakarma said, “The samples have been collected to check the quality of water of the river. I can comment only after the analysis of samples is complete and we get the final results.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/iitr-collects-ganga-samples-after-bodies-found-floating/articleshow/82957095.cms||---

The number of people recovering daily from the infection continued to be higher than daily cases, with 6,225 patients discharged across the region. The region’s overall positive caseload now stands at 10,00,330, while the number of recoveries was pushed to a nearly 9.46 lakh. The municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad added 739 and 590 cases, respectively, while the rest of the region — rural parts, cantonments, and municipal councils — accounted for 1,457 new patients. As per a report released by district health officer Bhagwan Pawar, the number of discharged patients was higher than fresh cases across the region — PMC and PCMC recorded 1,560 and 869 recoveries respectively, while the rest saw over 3,796 patients being discharged. Of the 10-lakh caseload, PMC accounted for nearly half — 4.66 lakh cases.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Once in short supply, Covid drugs find few takers now||NAGPUR: Crucial drugs used in Covid treatment, including Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, are no longer in demand though mucormycosis drug Amphotericin B and other anti-fungal drugs continue to be in short supply. Market sources said there was up to 90% fall in sale of the Covid drugs making their availability easy, unlike around a month ago when even common medicines like Favipiravir frequently were not available. With Covid wave receding, mucormycosis in the Covid recovered patients is taking centrestage. The decrease and rise of diseases are reflected in the volume of the sales of their respective drugs too. A comparative data of April 25 when the second wave was peaking and May 25 when it’s almost gone shows there is an 80% decrease in the hospitalization followed by 86% fewer active cases too. The number of the home isolated patients too is down by around 88% now compared to last month. According to a senior pharmacist, he had a stock of Covid drugs worth around Rs 9.77 lakh as of Monday but had a sale of merely Rs 2,800 reflecting the scenario. Hetal Thakkar, secretary of the Nagpur Druggist and Chemist Association, said apart from Favipiravir, drugs like Ivermectin, Doxycycline, Methylprednisolone, Dexamethasone were in high on demand in March and April. “I sold a substantial quantity of most of these drugs every day during the peak but now there are only handful of customers,” said Thakkar. “We had to earlier turn away several customers from our outlet as the drugs would be mostly in short supply. The are now available in plenty,” he said. Thakkar, who along with his association has made a demand before the government to consider them as frontline workers for vaccination on a priority basis, said he did not regret stocking up Covid medicines as unlocking of the restrictions may push up the cases once again. Senior pharmacist Murli Kewalramani of Suresh Medicals recalled selling more than 100 strips of Favipiravir per day during the Covid peak which has trickled down to barely 10 now. “Blood thinners like Heparin and immunity modulator Imunocin Alpha 1 were in extremely high demand once prompting us to call for stock frequently in April last month. Now, stocks are ample,” he said. “Even the sale of vitamin C and Zinc tablets has fallen drastically,” he said. “General physicians would frequently prescribe Favipiravir and such drugs for common cold and such symptoms but that trend has also almost stopped now,” he said. Jai Tekchandani, another key player in the pharmaceutical market, said he used to receive relentless inquiries for Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Bevacizumab round the clock during the peak but it has reduced to almost nil. “We had planned placing the orders for our stock and hence did not allow to pile up. There is certainly still much stock of Covid medicines which we feel may get sold in a gradual manner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/once-in-short-supply-covid-drugs-find-few-takers-now/articleshow/82954829.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Gurgaon||Booze on fire as vendors in Gurugram look to cover losses||GURUGRAM: Liquor shops that re-opened on Monday after a month-long lockdown have steeply jacked up retail prices. While beer priced between Rs 150 and Rs 180 is being sold for Rs 220, whisky has seen a hike of about 50-80%. A 750ml bottle of Johnny Walker’s Black Label, for instance, is being sold at Rs 4,000 to Rs 4,500, nearly double its price. Many who went to liquor stores looking to stock up on booze complained about the exorbitant prices. Nikhil Gupta, a resident of Sector 45, wanted to buy a case of beer but instead settled for a few bottles only. “We checked multiple shops and found almost similar prices — nearly double of what we usually pay — everywhere,” he told TOI. Anamika Sethi, who lives in Sector 67, had a similar grouse. “They have increased the prices of all brands. Everything has become costly,” she said, adding that while a marginal hike is understandable, the cost now is almost double. Purnima Gaur, a resident of Sector 15, dropped the idea of buying liquor due to the high price and said she would prefer to wait for a few days. Haryana’s excise policy does not cap liquor prices; only the minimum selling price is fixed. Thus, there is no upper limit on what a liquor bottle costs in the state. Even before the lockdown, the price would vary in Gurugram’s localities because the licence fee of the zones is different. Prices rose last year too after the lockdown but had settled down in seven to 10 days. Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner, said no formal complaint had been received till now. “Under the state excise policy, there is no upper limit on the price of liquor. It only fixes the minimum retail price. However, the department has formed a team to look into the issue,” she said. Liquor vendors, who claimed they were facing losses due to the pandemic, said the prices were increased only temporarily and would return to pre-lockdown levels in the next few days. The pandemic, they added, had reduced consumption of liquor due to work-from-home, the large-scale reverse migration due to the lockdown, reduced purchasing capacity and closure of restaurants, bars and ahatas. Abhimanyu Singla, owner of Discovery Wines, said the rates were a little high on Monday but were down to pre-lockdown levels on Tuesday. “Our sales are down and customers are nowhere to be seen. We are running into losses,” he added. Another person in the liquor business, who owns a chain of vends, said the higher rates on the first day were an attempt to cover some of the losses. “But despite that, vendors hardly managed about 50% of the pre-lockdown collection, mainly due to low sales volume,” he added. Furthermore, he added, liquor would earlier be sold mostly between 8pm and 12pm. But with Covid restrictions in place now, their shops can now operate only in day time, between 8am and 4pm, which has badly affected sales, he said. “Also, a large number of people working in the IT sector have moved to their native places. Migrant workers have returned to their states and those coming to Gurugram for work from Delhi and other nearby cities are now home. So effectively, the floating population of the city is down,” he told TOI. Besides, even those who are buying are consuming less. “Earlier, people used to drink in groups outside their houses and consumption was more. Now, people buy a bottle and take it home. One tends to consume less at home in the presence of children and parents,” said the owner of the liquor vends. On the supply side, the companies have increased the costs and reduced the credit limit as well as the time period for making payments. This has put a financial strain on those in the liquor business. While the government had formed a committee last year to review the problems faced by vendors and provide them relief in the form of waivers, this year nothing has been done so far, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/booze-on-fire-as-vendors-look-to-cover-losses/articleshow/82957168.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra follows Nisarg cyclone payout norms for Tauktae||Mumbai: The state government announced compensation for losses due to Tauktae cyclone, on the lines of relief during Nisarg last year.Last year, the government had hiked per hectare compensation under National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) norms by nearly 80%. The compensation eligible under NDRF norms was paid by the Centre, while the rest was borne by state.Compensation for horticultural land was hiked from Rs25,000 to Rs50,000. Also, compensation for a fully damaged house was increased from Rs95,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh and for partial damage from Rs6,000 to Rs15,000. “Although damage due to Tauktae is not as much as Nisarg, we are considering the same compensation,” said a senior official. Around 12,000 hectares of farmland was affected and over 10,000 structures were partly or fully damaged. Nineteen people died due to the cyclone. After Nisarg, the state sought Rs 750 crore from the Centre but only Rs 250 crore was received. Vijay Wadettiwar, minister of relief and rehabilitation, had said on Monday they had sought a tour of the affected areas by a central team. Once that was done, they would send a detailed memorandum seeking compensation for the losses as per the NDRF norms, he had said. Officials said major losses were reported from the coastal districts of Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg. In the three coastal districts 12,000 hectares of farmland and nearly 10,000 structures were damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-follows-nisarg-cyclone-payout-norms-for-tauktae/articleshow/82957105.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Surprises in fungus data, calls for study: Haryana minister Anil Vij||CHANDIGARH: Haryana health minister Anil Vij has called for research on the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of black, white, and yellow fungus, given some surprising elements in the state’s case histories. So far, the state has 413 patients of black fungus and 64 of those have tested positive for Covid. Besides, 79 patients diagnosed with black fungus were not diabetic, 110 never had any steroid, and 213 were not even on oxygen support. Vij said: "Hence, we asked the Rohtak PGIMS (Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences) and other medical colleges to do in-depth analysis." The state has also asked the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the central health ministry to study this data in its efforts to find a cure. 7 mucormycosis cases in KarnalKarnal: Seven fresh cases of black fungus were reported in Karnal district, taking the total number to 25. Besides, there were 41 suspected cases of black fungus in the district, and their investigation is underway.According to the health department, four people have reportedly died of black fungus in the district so far. Karnal chief medical officer Dr Yogesh Sharma said seven fresh cases of black fungus have been reported in the past 24 hours and these patients have been detected during the screening of Covid patients. He said most of the patients have comorbidities like diabetes. A total of 19 patients are undergoing treatment at Kalpana Chawla Medical College and Hospital here. Agroha college out of mucor medicineHisar: Capacity overwhelmed after 12 Mucormycosis deaths and 90 cases with symptoms, Agroha’s Maharaja Agrasen Medical College has run short of medicine for black fungus. The senior medical officer said the doctors were “helpless”. A senior official of the college said: “Seven more patients came in on Tuesday. Some needed urgent surgeries. Eight families sought referrals to move their patients.” Dr Geetika, incharge of the Covid and black fungus treatment at the college, accepted that the want of medicine “had stopped the surgeries”, while the supply situation was “unclear”. The medical officer said seeing 90 patients with symptoms had forced the hospital to started a separate OPD for black fungus, since those who recovered from Covid-19 recently were now “scared”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/surprises-in-fungus-data-calls-for-study-haryana-minister/articleshow/82957147.cms||---
---||Chennai||Kancheepuram waits to get back on global tourism map||Till a decade ago, a visit to Chennai meant a one-day tour package through the temple town of Kancheepuram and a pit-stop at Mamallapuram to soak in the architecture and culture of the region. But over the years, the lack of promotion and infrastructure to draw tourists pushed Kancheepuram behind as the Shore Temple and Brihadeeshwarar temple at Thanjavur began to be considered more accessible. Today the district remains famous as a pilgrimage site but largely in the southern part of the country. Navigating through the town’s narrow bylanes full of colour and flavours need patience and determination as most temples do not have an approach road. Many of the temples are not maintained properly and hardly provide information to tourists unfamiliar with Tamil culture. The recent announcement of 11 ancient temples in Kancheepuram making it to the Unesco’s tentative list of world heritage sites opens an avenue for the region to be back on the tourism map. This will ensure better care of the structures as the final honour brings with it international recognition. Built by the Pallavas and Cholas between AD700 and AD1200 the 11 temples that were submitted by the Union culture ministry to Unesco on April 13 are: Kailasanathar, Piravatneswara, Iravathanesvara, Parameswara Vinnagaram Vaikunta Perumal, Muktesvara, Arulala or Varadharaja Perumal, Ekambaresvara (Thirukachiekambam), Jvaraharesvara, Pandava Dootha Perumal, Yathothkari Perumal and Ulagalanda Perumal. After inclusion on the tentative list, the final declaration as a world heritage site can take years as Unesco’s World Heritage Committee studies the dossiers presented on the sites and makes detailed inspections before taking a decision. But being on the list puts focus on the potential of the site. Approved Tour Guides Association president P Asoka says the world heritage tag for temples can help Kancheepuram regain its tourism momentum. "Many international travellers explore world heritage sites of every country. The move will mean more visibility, better upkeep and cleanliness around the world heritage sites. It will also help in creating infrastructure such as parking lots and toilets, facilities that are essential to tourists," he says. While six of the 11 temples on the list are maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), five are under the state’s Hindu religious and charitable endowments department. According to ASI sources, ASI will play a key in conservation and renovation of world heritage sites. "Restoration works cannot take place without the consent of the high level committee or ASI at world heritage sites," an official said. So far the state has four temple complexes that are Unesco world heritage sites — the monuments at Mamallapuram, the Brihadeeshwara temple at Thanjavur, the Gangaikonda Cholapuram Brihadeeshwara temple at Jayankondam, and the Airavatheeswara temple at Darasuram. Outside the temple too regulations are put in place. R Komagan, chairman of Gangaikondacholapuram Development Council, said areas around the 11 Kancheepuram temples will come under the regulations that apply to ASI and state government’s monuments, after they are declared world heritage sites. There will be no threat to the existing buildings, but construction of new structures will be regulated. "This is to maintain the ambience and environment around the sites. Priority would be given for funding as well, as they attract foreign tourists," he says. Tamil Nadu Tour Travel and Hospitality Association president V K T Balan says such a distinction comes as a boon for the local economy, particularly to the hospitality sector, as more hotels come up to cater to visitors. The Sri Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam, the Chettinad village clusters and the Padmanabhapuram palace in Kanyakumari are on the tentative list since 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kancheepuram-waits-to-get-back-on-global-tourism-map/articleshow/82954830.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Nagpur||Not in right frame of mind to give exams: NU students||Nagpur: With a spike in Covid-19 cases, many Nagpur University students were infected and many also lost their parents or relatives. They’re now demanding to cancel ongoing winter-2020 and forthcoming summer-2021 examinations stating that they weren’t in the proper mindset to appear in them. After some of them started a campaign under the hashtag ‘#rtmnu_cancel_ exams’ on Twitter and other social media platforms, a large number of aggrieved students joined them while flaying NU’s decision to go ahead with the examinations. They’re also getting support from their counterparts in other universities. According to them, after suffering a lot due to the deadly disease and also losing out their near and dear ones, they weren’t in the position to appear in papers and also facing bouts of depression. While tagging their tweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, chancellor BS Koshyari, tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and even actor Sonu Sood, the students blamed NU administration of playing with their lives by forcing the exams on them amid the pandemic. Citing examples of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, they said when these states can promote the students, why NU authorities were bent on exams under such stressful conditions. “On one hand, we’re immersing ashes of our loved ones and are filled up with all negativity and emotional trauma, on the other, you are pressuring us for exams. Even online classes were not being held regularly and a majority of us faced network problems and other technical glitches. Many of us from the rural areas faced perennial problems of load shedding and thus, missed classes while some couldn’t afford gadgets,” they said while asking NU on how to deal with these issues. Students to be at loss if papers are cancelled: Sable Responding to the students’, Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable said cancelling examinations and promoting them wouldn’t be of anyone’s interest and ultimately, they would be at loss. “When they would be tested at the national or international level, they would be exposed and ultimately the university would be blamed. Importantly, we can’t cancel the entire examination just for the sake of a few hundred students,” he said. He said in NU’s first semester papers, which were deferred till May 27, over 1.1 lakh students would be appearing. “Of them, if just 1,000 are demanding cancellation, the remaining 1.09 lakh are still ready to give exams. Why should these 1.09 lakh suffer just because just 1,000 aren’t ready to appear?” Last year, NU had promoted them as they weren’t ready for handling the pandemic and even UGC and Maharashtra government had suggested it. “Now, we have online systems in place, the vaccine is available, and Covid-19 cases are going down. I don’t see any reason to cancel the exams,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-in-right-frame-of-mind-to-give-exams-nu-students/articleshow/82954872.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The ACB had arrested Rathod and his peon Arvind Tiwari for accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 from an Aarey Colony resident. Soon after the arrest on Monday, an team of ACP Alka Deshmukh, police inspector Supriya Nate and others reached Rathod’s one-storey bungalow inside Aarey Colony in Goregaon (E) for the search. They were about to wind up when they sensed something amiss on the stairs leading to the terrace. “When our team reached the terrace, things were scattered around as if someone had just rearranged them. We removed the tins sheets and found several gunny bags. On opening them, we found cash stuffed inside,” said an officer of the team. Most of the cash was in Rs 500 notes and some were of Rs 2,000. Since Rathod had been detained, the police said it is clear someone in the family had shifted the cash as it is unlikely so much cash would have been left in an unguarded terrace. The ACB also found some gold ornaments and other documents, about which they are questioning Rathod, who has been remanded to custody till May 27. The ACB has begun an open inquiry against Rathod and is likely to register another FIR about disproportionate assets against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-rs-3-5cr-found-on-terrace-of-aarey-ceos-bungalow/articleshow/82957119.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||In rural areas, Maharashtra govt to stress on institutional care for Covid positive patients||PUNE/KOLHAPUR: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the government would be stressing on institutional isolation of Covid patients, mainly for rural areas in districts where the positivity rate is higher than the state’s weekly average positivity rate of 12%. Tope told TOI that there is no “ban” on home isolation as was reported earlier in the day, but there would be emphasis on institutional isolation wherever home isolation was not possible or was found inconvenient. On Tuesday, 16 districts where the positivity rate from May 16 to 23 is higher than the state’s 12% were in focus during a review meeting headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The meeting was called to discuss ramping up infrastructure, especially in the rural areas. “We are asking these districts to focus on rural infrastructure, regarding having more Covid Care Centres (CCC) to help better isolate patients,” Tope said. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI on Tuesday that the positivity rate is going down in Pune district. “It is 8.9% today and is expected to go down further. We are, however, ramping up our infrastructure. We have already proposed a CCC in Ambegaon Budruk with a capacity of 270 beds,” he said. Data from Pune shows that the number of weekly new cases has been on a steady decline for the last four weeks. The district had 68,254 new cases (April 26-May 2), 60,201 (May 3-9), 47,531 (May 10-16) and 25,483 (May 17-23). Maximum cases were reported from Baramati, Haveli, Indapur, Shirur and Daund talukas of Pune. An average dip of 20% has been registered. Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said he was focusing on villages or cluster of villages which have a large number of patients in home isolation. “We have started community isolation. So far, we have shifted around 1,200 patients in home isolation to these community isolation centres, which are similar to institutional quarantine. These facilities have been set up in schools and other public buildings. We currently have a positivity rate of around 20% and have extended the lockdown till May 31 to curb the spread,” he told TOI. In Kolhapur, a team of experts was formed a week ago to suggest measures to bring down the mortality rate. Accordingly, the team had suggested doing away with home isolation completely. Since then, the district administration has been preparing isolation centres at the village level. “We have asked every village to set up isolation wards in schools or any unused building and shift all home-isolation patients there. We have empowered the village-level committees to take a decision on managing the logistics. We are ready to provide the doctors required for such centres,” said Kolhapur district health officer Yogesh Sale. Third lockdown in Satara district From Tuesday, Satara district is going under strict lockdown for the third time in the last couple of months. The decision has been taken after the administration found there is no natural decline in the positivity rate. Last week, the positivity rate came down to 17% from 33%, but district collector Shekhar Singh said there was a huge pendency of tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-rural-areas-state-to-stress-on-institutional-care-for-ve-patients/articleshow/82957145.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Allahabad||Women doctors give healing touch to patients at railway hospital||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when the ongoing pandemic has witnessed the relentless service by doctors associated with different organisations, efforts of the team of women doctors at the Central Railway Hospital (CRH) is worth applauding. These female doctors worked diligently to ensure logistical support at this Level-2 Covid hospital of the district and continued to provide their services even when the family members of some of them were infected by coronavirus. Dr KirtiTOI brings stories of some of such brave female doctors of North Central Railways (NCR). CRH, which had started its fight against Covid-19 as a 100-bed Level-1 Covid care centre on July 11, 2020, was soon upgraded to Level-2 dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) by the district administration in 2021. The hospital now treats even those Covid patients who do not have a railway background. Among the female doctors who have joined the fight against Covid is Dr Usha SP Yadav, the pathologist who is working round the clock to ensure RAT and RT-PCR tests are being carried out daily. Her responsibilities have increased as this central hospital has upgraded its pathology department and a new four-channel RT-PCR machine has recently become operational. Special tests like D-dimer, CRP, Ferritin are now being done in-house under the supervision of Dr Usha Yadav. So far, the hospital has conducted 14,432 tests. Dr Payal Agrawal deserves special mention as she is the youngest of all doctors.Diet being an important aspect to be monitored in a Covid patient, Dr Manju Lata Handoo, a dental surgeon, is taking care of the diet and quality of food being provided to the infected patients. Covid vaccination is being done at the central hospital under the supervision of Dr Vishal Panday and Dr Mithlesh Dwivedi from the state government. Meanwhile, Dr Kirti from the railway hospital is assisting them. Dr Kirti, a gynaecologist, is maintaining data of the progress of vaccination, and raises an alarm whenever a drop is apprehended so that awareness generation programmes could be planned accordingly. “Remarkably, she continued to offer her services despite being infected by the virus herself,” informed chief public relation officer of NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma. Dr Neelam GoswamiLikewise, contributions of Dr Payal Agrawal deserves special mention as she is the youngest of all doctors. Assistant divisional medical officer Prayagraj, Dr Agrawal is basically an ENT surgeon. She is responsible for training all doctors, paramedical staff and support staff for upgradation of their capacity and contemporary advancements taking place in Covid management protocol. She is also responsible for preparing and implementing the latest protocol and assisting Dr Handoo in the administration of the hospital, informed Dr Sharma. “Our contract medical practitioners and house surgeons are providing all necessary assistance for Covid management. Our paramedical staff are also working tirelessly and substantially contributing in monitoring Covid patients,” informed Dr Payal. Besides, a Whatsapp group named ‘admitted Covid patients’ has been created and is managed by Dr Neelam Goswami. The group includes admitted patients and their attendants. Patients’ queries, feedback and suggestions are constantly being acknowledged and redressed by the doctors on this group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/from-monitoring-rt-pcr-tests-to-overseeing-vax-drive-female-doctors-of-ncr-play-key-role-in-fight-against-covid/articleshow/82957132.cms||Rajeev Mani

Instead, the engineering department of the municipal corporation (MC) is cleaning the existing line, assuring it will work in a smooth manner and concluding that choking, not cracks or damage, was behind the problem of overflowing in the southern part of the city. The civic body has allotted a tender of Rs one crore for cleaning the sewerage, managing to save a huge amount at a time it is struggling to boost its revenue. Latest machines are being used for the ongoing work. Besides cleaning the line, videos are being made to check internal space of the sewer line to ensure proper flow of sewage. “Besides other material, stones were stuck in the line. The machines are sucking everything, even big stones. The work is going on a good place and to our satisfaction. We have been making videos and clicking pictures of the line while cleaning it. The exercise will prove beneficial in future while carrying such type of works,” an official said. During the cleaning of the sewer, most of the sewage manholes were found covered under the roads, as they were not raised during the recarpeting works. “Now, we have raised all such manholes, making them easily visible. Due to covered manholes, the cleaning of the sewer line was not done properly,” sources said. Since the southern part of the city is thickly populated and sewage connections is quite high as compared to northern sectors, sources in the public health wing of the MC’s engineering department said it was receiving regular complaints of overflowing. During checking, the main reason was found to be that most of the part of the main sewer line was choked. Since the work started over a couple of weeks back, it will take another month to clean the entire main trunk sewer line covering the entire southern belt||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dropping-sewer-line-change-plan-saves-mc-rs-200cr/articleshow/82952908.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Pune||Three more home test kits in queue, ICMR-states to tie up for reports||PUNE: At least three more home-based test kits are likely to hit the market after they are cleared by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the next few months. Symptomatic persons can test at home so that they can spot Covid-19 early instead of waiting for the lab results which take time. These test kits will have a link to the ICMR portal for uploading the results. Senior epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda told TOI that the council will coordinate with states to communicate the reports. “We are looking at more such home-based kits and a system is being developed to link the reports uploaded on the portal with the state authorities,” he said on Tuesday. While the recently approved RAT kits require an Android phone, others may develop something more innovative which will have wider access, he added. More expressions of interest from various tests manufacturers will be called for, incorporated and cleared, he said. According to senior officials from ICMR, many innovative test kits, including saliva testing, will be cleared. “Three home testing kits, all RATs, are in the pipeline. We have also put out an expression of interest for home- testing kits on our website,’’ Dr Nivedita Gupta, a senior scientist and head virology unit, ICMR, said. Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions Coviself was cleared for the home-based RAT test kits. The company’s officials said it will be launched this weekend. “We will go for a pan-India distribution and will take guidance from the market in terms of where it can benefit people. We have a capacity of 70 lakh units per week and can scale it up to 1 crore per week as needed within 14 days,” managing director Hasmukh Rawal said. Each kit costs Rs 250 and will be easy to use, he said. Last week, former ICMR scientist Dr Lalitkant had said home-based tests are transforming healthcare and empowering the patients. They saved time and eased the pressure on laboratories. Several other home kits are widely used in India for glucose and pregnancy tests. “Coviself’s approval comes when Covid-19 infection is rapidly moving into areas where getting RT-PCR is a challenge,” he had said. ICMR’s Advisory All symptomatic individuals who test negative by RAT should get themselves immediately tested by RT-PCR. This is especially important as the RATs are likely to miss a few positive cases presenting with a low viral load. The advisory also said that symptomatic individuals who test negative on this home test may be treated as suspect Covid-19 cases. The advisory, referring to Mylab’s test kit, also said that the home-testing should be conducted as per the procedure described by the manufacturer in the user manual. This home-testing has a cellphone app available in Google Play Store and Apple Store and must be downloaded by all users. The app is a comprehensive guide of the testing procedure and will provide a positive or negative test result to the patient. All users are advised to click a picture of the test strip after completing the procedure with the same cellphone used for downloading the app and user registration. Medical Fraternity Hails Initiative People who test positive are considered as true positives and do not need to repeat any test. But those who test negative should get themselves tested immediately by RT-PCR. Rapid Antigen Tests are likely to miss a few positive cases with a low viral load, a senior doctor said Doctors said the antigen test is only advisable for those with symptoms or immediate contacts of people testing positive for Covid. It should not be used “indiscriminately” All those who test negative on these antigen tests should still be isolated till their RT-PCR reports come, they said.

---||Pune||Demand for medical oxygen drops in PMR||PUNE: The daily demand for medical oxygen has reduced by 50% in civic hospitals treating Covid patients in both the PMC and PCMC limits since last month. The civic hospitals in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, where the demand for the essential medical gas had increased to almost 45 tonnes a day last month, now need 20 tonnes of oxygen a day. A senior Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) official said the daily demand for oxygen in the civic hospitals has gone down to 35 tonnes from 50 tonnes in April. Experts attributed the trend, and also the rise in the number of vacant beds in the hospitals, to the drop in new nCoV cases and also the oxygen usage audit in both the civic and private health hubs. The Covid-19 review meeting report for Pune dated April 9 stated that the district required 67 tonnes of oxygen on January 22. The demand, however, went up to 310 tonnes on April 7, with the month witnessing a spike in Covid cases. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune, joint commissioner S B Patil told TOI that the daily demand for oxygen in the district had peaked to almost 350 tonnes in April. “The demand is now around 240 tonnes. We have managed to streamline the supply and there are no complaints regarding oxygen availability either in the civic or the private hospitals,” he said. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil, “We are installing oxygen generating plants in our seven hospitals. The installation work has already started in four facilities,” he said, adding that the civic body is better prepared this time to tackle the oxygen-related demand. A PMC official said oxygen generation plants have been started at its Laigude and Dalvi hospitals. “Eight other hospitals are set to install their oxygen generation plants,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s hospital board of India, said though the demand for oxygen was declining, everybody should be cautious till the requirement was less than 100 tonnes. “The lockdown-like restrictions are likely to be eased, considering the drop in new Covid cases. Under such circumstances, the civic and private medical facilities should be prepared for any kind of temporary surge,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-for-medical-oxygen-drops-in-pmr/articleshow/82957158.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Out of the total infected cops, 760 of them have recovered so far. As of now, 46 policemen including 25 in Prayagraj, four in Fatehpur and 17 in Pratapgarh are currently undergoing treatment at Covid-19 level one and two hospitals.

---||Nagpur||Not the PPE, but deaths leave him choked||Nagpur: The first day Datta Mote, deputy assistant chief of nursing at a private hospital, wore a PPE kit, he not only felt choked but it also left him dehydrated. That was the first wave of Covid. Over the months, Mote is used to wearing the gear now, but not to the deaths he witnessed almost every other day. Each time a patient under his care died, it took time to come to terms with the reality, he says. Mote’s day starts at 7:30am. Wearing a scrub dress and a PPE above it, he enters Covid ward which is his workplace for next six hours. As a part of the routine since last year, he takes over patients’ details from the colleague in the previous shift and the day goes on. “There are no breaks in-between, not even to attend the nature’s call. We cannot drink water either. Though it’s six-hour shift, working extra is normal,” he says. During the months, Mote has been a part of hopes and despair of the patients and himself had got infected, but is back after recovery. “Initially, when posted in the Covid ward, I was apprehensive that I may also end up catching the infection. There were doubts whether it would be safe within PPE,” he says. “I used to take utmost care at home, because my wife was seven months pregnant at that time. Yet in September, 2020, I contracted Covid. At that point I was cursing myself that because of me the entire family would suffer. Thankfully, I recovered and only needed isolation and others too were fine,” he says. Back to work at the ward, Mote says the pressure has eased these days. During the peak, there were 200-odd patients and now they are 100. The duties include monitoring oxygen level, pulse rate and temperature, and feed them time to time. “Patients undergo severe pain. They keep on coughing and suffer with acute body pain. In the ICU, there is no mobile phone with them,” he says. “There have been days when 5 to 6 patients died in a day. The patient struggles desperately in the last moments, as the oxygen level goes down. The dying man tries hard to breath and soon slips into unconsciousness and dies. It’s unbearable even for us to watch and we only pray that the patient is relieved soon,” he says. Mote recalls about a young doctor from Amravati who was pregnant, but the baby did not survive. She was on ventilator and we could see tears rolling down her cheeks. There was a young government officer from Gondia, who lost his life after a painful struggle. “But there have been cases when even difficult cases have survived. We have handled cases with oxygen levels below 70. A quick oxygen support given ensured our victory over Covid,” he says. He also recalls case of a young banker and contractor who were too scared when they came to the ward. “The staffers boosted their morale... both survived and they are still in touch with me,” he says. Some in better health also insist if they could get something tastier, like non-veg food. The hospital rules don’t allow but, says Mote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-the-ppe-but-deaths-leave-him-choked/articleshow/82954922.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Chennai||Icon that inspired Big temple now in a shambles||The Kailasanathar temple is fading away into the sands of time — or at least it’s murals are. A walk around the 1,300-year-old temple shows figures etched on to the temple walls with disfigured faces and missing embellishments of the thrones that form miniature scenes in alcoves. Realising that the temple, which is on the tentative list of Unesco’s world heritage sites, is in dire need of attention, the Archaeological Survey of India is planning to rope in experts from the IITs to help preserve one of the oldest temples in TN. The sandstone and lime mortar structure has been ravaged by time though conservation efforts are made every year. According to official sources, chemical conservation is not arresting the deterioration. "It is a completely lime plastered structure built using sandstone. Now, it is time to use traditional methods so that the issue is addressed permanently," said an ASI official. At present, in the Pallava-era temple chemical conservation is done annually at the sanctum sanctorum. On the walls outside, certain sculptures have been destroyed beyond recognition. Former archaeology officer and secretary of the Madurai-based Pandya Nadu Centre for Historical Research C Santhalingam says Rajaraja Chola was inspired by the Kailasanathar temple to build the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur. "The reason being Kailasanathar temple had all the aspects and features of a Shiva temple." Built by Pallava king Rajasimha I (700-728CE) as an edifice to adorn his capital of Kancheepuram, the temple is said to have survived the rivalry between the Pallavas and the Chalukyas of Vatapi. Though the victorious Vikaramaditya destroyed the capital, he was overwhelmed by the lavish beauty of the temple and left the city untouched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/icon-that-inspired-big-temple-now-in-a-shambles/articleshow/82954917.cms||---

The report said customer preferences shifting, and RERA seeking more compliances, played a major role in the shift awat from local, standalone players. The report said the share of listed and unlisted players in the real estate market across the top cities in India went from 17% in 2017 to to 40% in the first three quarters of the 2020-21 fiscal. Anarock added the shift started with notification of RERA. “After the roll-out of structural policies including RERA and GST, organized and branded players’ dominance has risen exponentially,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock. “While buying a home, customers expect and demand trust, transparency, as well as on-time delivery of their homes. RERA helped raise awareness for customers,” said Rohit Gera, MD of Gera Developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-brands-are-cornering-housing-mkt/articleshow/82957156.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Vadodara||Amul’s stand on milk vindicated||Vadodara: Amul’s stand on ‘milk’ has been vindicated. The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has dismissed three complaints filed by animal rights organizations - Beauty Without Cruelty (BWC), People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Sharan India - who had complained against homegrown dairy giant’s ‘Myths vs Facts’ advt which, according to Amul, was to expose the falsity behind myths that were being circulated regarding – “MILK”. The Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets the country's largest dairy organisation had come under attack after this ad that was issued on March 24. The complainants alleged that the contentions made in the advertisement were false. They further claimed that milk is not a complete food, is harmful to health and is less nutritious than plant-based food. They also claimed that dairy farming is not good for cattle as they are subjected to cruelty and that plant-based beverages are a more sustainable food system as compared to dairy milk.  Amul in its response presented statutory provisions incorporated under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the allied regulations while refuting the allegations as “false, baseless and motivated”. ASCI observed that plant-based milk is not covered under the definition of ‘milk’ as per the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). It upheld Amul’s contention that “plant-based beverages are impersonating and masquerading as dairy products”. As per FSSAI guidelines, milk is considered as a vegetarian product. Plant-based beverages also have proteins and beneficial minerals, however, most plant-based milks have lower protein content than milk, ASCI observed. ASCI observed that there is sufficient scientific data to prove that milk is nutritious and a rich source of calcium, vitamins, carbohydrates, fat, minerals and protein. “Thus, milk can be called complete food as it contains all essential nutritive ingredients required for sustenance,” it observed.  GCMMF officials said that the advt was issued in public interest and out of concern after sudden surge in misleading articles and videos published by various individuals/entities claiming to be animal activists, accusing the dairy industry of being involved in animal cruelty and defaming Amul and its products. “Such articles and videos continuously circulate false and misleading information such as - “dairy industry inflicts cruelty on animals”, “milk causes cancer and various other ailments”, “plant based beverages are healthier than milk” and “plant based beverages can be legally termed as ‘milk’,” a GCMMF official said.  Amul in recent times has initiated legal proceedings against such articles and videos before Delhi High Court through its counsel advocate Abhishek Singh. The HC in such cases has either passed injunctions against individuals directing them to remove the disparaging contents or have directed them to remove all references towards Amul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/amuls-stand-on-milk-vindicated/articleshow/82952985.cms||Prashant Rupera

With this, travel time is expected to reduce by a good 10 minutes. Traffic police officials said unauthorised parking was rampant on LBS Marg. The police had even considered implementing an odd-even parking arrangement. But since the Kurla stretch on LBS Marg is predominantly slum-based, it was unlikely that the arrangement would have worked. If properly implemented, the no-parking zone could be extended towards Ghatkopar on LBS Marg in future. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-permanent-no-park-zone-to-decongest-lbs/articleshow/82958472.cms||---

Every day, the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) and police seize at least 200 to 300 litres of hooch besides destroying raw material (fermented jaggery wash) used for brewing the hooch in the two districts. Hooch brewed along AOB is brought in to villages and towns in the two districts. The SEB said many illegal distilleries were found running along AOB. Bootleggers transport hooch in auto-rickshaws, bikes and other private transport from AOB to the two districts. Given the demand, a litre of hooch is selling for Rs 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/curfew-revives-illegal-liquor-trade/articleshow/82952960.cms||Nalla.Babu

The union chairman Trisharan Sahare said the Maharashtra government had announced similar benefits to registered workers, which were just 20% of total workforce. He informed that a majority of workers from unorganized sector have lost jobs due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, and it was becoming difficult for them to survive. “Many from the unorganized sectors like construction workers, hawkers, street vendors, rickshaw pullers, and autorickshaw drivers are sincerely complying with the government orders of lockdown and curfew. However, their survival depends on their daily earnings, which has stopped due to all these factors from last year. Moreover, they have exhausted all their meagre savings last year. Now, it’s impossible for them and their families to survive,” Sahare said while demanding the government pay attention to their demands. The NDUWF further requested the CM to immediately ensure free delivery of essential commodities to these 80% unorganized workers and also provide minimum financial wages so that they shouldn’t be forced to move out for survival. It also demanded setting up a welfare board for autorickshaw drivers. “If they move out, they would risk the lives of their own families and of others in the pandemic,” Sahare said.

Srinath wanted an e-pass to make a trip from Chennai to the city to be able to stay with his uncle. He said he was not able to apply for an e-pass online. The state police are not giving any reply to the cases that are being directed to them by the DGP but acknowledging the tweet of the DGP to look into the matter. The DGP himself had tweeted on May 23 that all medical emergencies were being facilitated through the epass portal. Meanwhile, Khammam police seized as many as 1,500 vehicles for violating lockdown rules in the last 15 days.

The patient from Ajmer was rushed to a private hospital here on May 20 after he complained of symptoms of mucormycosis. He had tested negative two day earlier. “After diagnostic tests, we found that he had candida on one side of his nose and mucor on the other side,” said Dr Anil Kothiwala, a neurosurgeon, who was part of the surgery team. According to health experts, mucormycosis and candida attacks are observed more in people with low immunity. Candida infection can manifest with symptoms such as white patches in the mouth, oral cavities and tongue, while mucormycosis infects the nose, orbit of eye or eye socket, oral cavity and can even spread to the brain. In cases of black fungus infection-related surgeries, neurosurgeons get involved in endoscopic surgical debridement of the mucor. The man tested positive for Covid on May 5. His lungs were affected, and his HRCT report showed a reading of 17. Doctors provided him treatment as a “moderate symptom case” of Covid. On May 20, when he was admitted with mucormycosis symptoms to the hospital, doctors immediately planned an endoscopic surgical debridement of fungus. The surgery was performed on Friday and the patient is now put on ‘second line’ anti-fungal medicines. “It is the first-of-its-kind case we have seen in which two different fungi have been found at the same time. Candida is a fungus, which remains in the body. When the body is weak, it starts spreading. It is a normal oral fungus. But black fungus infects the patient, when he does not change dirty mask for long among other reasons such as excessive use of steroids, diabetes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/black-white-fungal-attack-on-ajmer-man-who-beat-covid-19/articleshow/82957178.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Delhi||Right to be forgotten: Delhi HC orders removal of link to its own ruling||NEW DELHI: In an important order on the ‘Right to be forgotten’ and ‘Right to be left alone’, Delhi High Court has ordered removal of one of its own verdicts from search engine Google. The judgment was related to acquittal given in a drug case involving a US citizen of Indian origin. Justice Prathiba M Singh highlighted that the ‘Right to privacy’ includes ‘Right to be forgotten’ and ‘Right to be left alone’ while asking a website — Indian Kanoon — to remove the high court verdict link given in an Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act case so that the same can’t be accessed by Google and Yahoo search engines. “Owing to the irreparable prejudice, which may be caused to him in his social life and career prospects, inspite of the petitioner having ultimately been acquitted in the said case via the said judgment, prima facie this court is of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled to some interim protection, while the legal issues are pending adjudication by this court,” the court noted in an interim order. Since the court has protected the privacy of the petitioner, TOI is not naming him. In his plea the man told the court that he is of Indian origin but an American citizen by birth who was slapped with a case under the NDPS Act when he visited India in 2009. While the trial court acquitted him in 2011, the high court upheld his innocence two years later. He told the high court that on his return to the US he decided to pursue law at an university, but realised he faces a huge disadvantage due to the fact that the judgment rendered by Delhi high court is available on a Google search to any potential employer, who wanted to conduct his background verification before employing him.

---||Hyderabad||‘Blood platelets falling in Covid-19 cases’||HYDERABAD: Healthcare experts treating Covid-19 patients have revealed that they have identified several cases wherein blood platelet count was low. Experts predominantly said that it was a complication arising out of Covid-19 and in some cases, was a pre-existing problem. Assistant professor in department of internal medicine at University of Nebraska’s Medical Centre Department, Dr Buddharaju Laxmi Narayana, explained that a lot of patients had chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) predating their Covid-19 infection and this was brought to attention through blood tests for Covid-19. ITP is a blood disorder wherein there is a decrease in the number of platelets in blood. Platelets are blood cells which help to stop bleeding. Speaking at a webinar organised by the Andhra Pradesh health department, Dr Buddharaju said, “We see more ITP in Covid patients. Unless a patient has had signs of bleeding, we have not transfused platelets. A good response to steroids with increase in platelet count would be confirmatory of an ITP diagnosis.” Research by the Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine at Kolkata Medical College and Hospital found that ITP has emerged as an essential complication arising from Covid-19. In asymptomatic patients, researchers have reported that clinicians have to look into this aspect in the post-recovery period. “ITP and TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) are predominantly post-Covid related (issues). Blood platelets fall due to immunity issues. We have seen it in several cases. Unless the platelet count is falling below 75,000, we are not treating it. In most of the cases, it is self-lifting and reversable ,” said Dr Galla Viswanath from the AIG Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/blood-platelets-falling-in-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82956428.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 12 years on, new builder hired for Rs 3k-crore rehab of Worli society||MUMBAI: A stalled redevelopment project in Worli worth Rs 3,000 crore has been taken over by Oberoi Realty after the earlier builder, HBS Realtors, appointed by the society in 2009, was unable to complete the work. The tragic case of 192 families that resided in Worli’s Shivshahi cooperative housing society, comprising 12 buildings (demolished seven years ago), highlights the mess in redevelopment projects in Mumbai. TimesViewThe Shivashahi project saga is a sad reflection of what happens when redevelopment stalls and residents are left in the lurch. Shivashahi scheme was allotted to the builder a decade ago on the condition that the rehab tower will come up on vacant land available without disturbing the old buildings. They were repaired, money spent and a structural stability certificate was obtained. The FSI rules changed and the decisions taken earlier were overturned to benefit the builder. Strengthened buildings were declared dangerous and demolished. It is time the government looked into the regulations for redevelopment and made changes so that the people are not cheated and ousted from what was their residence for generations.Almost two decades after first initiating a redevelopment proposal, 12 years after appointing a builder and seven years after they vacated their flats, the residents were left high and dry by HBS Realtors (Wonder Value Realty). The prime 3-acre plot is located opposite the Glaxo property in Worli. The buildings were demolished in 2014. Since 2019, though, the builder stopped paying their rents—displacement hardship allowance (Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 a month)—leaving these families in the lurch and forcing them to shift to far-off locations. Some months ago, the harried society members approached Oberoi Realty that gave them an offer letter. Incidentally, in 2007-08, Oberoi had dragged the same society to court, accusing it of reneging on a memorandum of understanding signed with it for redevelopment. Oberoi had lost the case against the society, which had then appointed HBS Realtors and IL&FS. Oberoi’s new offer letter promises each resident a 1,025-square-foot flat with 425 car parking spaces in the rehabilitated tower. The developer will also pay the society Rs 27 crore to be distributed among the members as additional corpus since the previous builder did not pay the DHA. Oberoi will also pay Rs 1 lakh a month to each member as DHA. “An amount of Rs 35.4 crore shall be payable towards the corpus of your members for the FSI up to 3.19 and which will be paid by us in proportion against each of your members being handed over possession of their respective flats,” it said. “A further amount of Rs 61.44 crore will be paid as corpus on the FSI being 4...,” said the offer letter signed by the developer Vikas Oberoi. The society has terminated its earlier agreements with HBS Realtors and given 100% consent to Oberoi to finish the project. The 3-acre plot has a saleable portion of almost 8 lakh sq ft. The new agreement follows a harrowing experience faced by residents over the past decade with the previous builder. According to the original agreement signed with the society in 2009-10, HBS Realtors was to demolish their old buildings only after constructing the rehab tower. This never happened. Residents alleged that the society’s managing committee amended the agreement twice that allowed their eviction before their rehab building was constructed. Since the past two years, the builder stopped paying rents for their alternate accommodation nor was the rehab tower completed. The three-acre land on which the Shivshahi society stands, was leased to Mhada by the municipal corporation for 999 years for building EWS tenements for industrial workers. The buildings came up in 1950. Shivshahi is just one of the five societies in the 34,000 sq m (8.5 acres) Mhada layout. Of this, Shivshahi occupies about 12,325 sq m (3 acres).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-12-yrs-on-new-builder-hired-for-rs-3k-cr-rehab-of-worli-soc/articleshow/82951886.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Antibody response higher in recovered single dose recipients||HYDERABAD: A single dose of vaccine elicited a higher neutralising antibody response among those who have recovered from Covid-19 than those who have never been infected, according to a study published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The study titled ‘Immunological memory and neutralizing activity to a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine in previously infected individuals’ revealed higher memory cell response was seen in previously infected individuals. Dr Duvvur Nageshwar Reddy of AIG Hospitals, who led the study, said: “We have studied vaccine response in those who haven’t got infected and those who are already exposed to the virus. Hospital staff as volunteers numbering 200 infected and 200 not exposed, took part in the study. Those who were already infected had better antibody response. While antibody stays for three months, the T Cell memory response will work for 12 months, which is long term. Our study found another interesting factor that T Cell memory in already infected individuals given vaccine is higher.” Dr Reddy said that a single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in previously exposed individuals is an efficient strategy at the time country is facing vaccine shortage. “Among infected individuals, a single dose of vaccine from one month up to three months will be helpful. This study will pave the way for deciding on it,” said Dr Reddy. This study published in the prestigious and peer-reviewed journal revealed that of the 280 individuals enrolled in the study, 131 were RTPCR positive with mild to moderate disease. Of them, 50 required hospital admission. Prior to first dose of vaccination, all 131 (46.7%) were seropositive, and 149 (53.2%) were seronegative.“Though a single-dose vaccine strategy is recommended for infected individuals all the non-infected individuals are required to compulsorily take the second dose of vaccine,” researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/antibody-response-higher-in-recovered-single-dose-recipients/articleshow/82956365.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Nurse arrested for stealing phone from dead Covid patient||DEHRADUN: A nurse has been arrested for stealing the mobile phone of a Covid-19 patient who died. When she was questioned, she told police that the hospital she worked at allowed life-saving drugs and Remdesivir to be pilfered and did not report the thefts. “On May 18, we received a complaint from a person called Amandeep Gill saying her father had been admitted to the hospital and had died there on May 8. His phone had been stolen from there. We investigated and found a person called Salman Ahmed had been using it,” said Rakesh Shah, in charge of Rajpur police station. “He told us he had got the phone from Ruqaiya, 21, a nurse at a private hospital.” When Ruqaiya was called in for questioning, she confessed to the theft — she had stolen the phone of the dead man and passed it on to her friend Salman on May 9. In the course of interrogation, she said the hospital management was in a shambles. “In her statement to the police, the nurse has made some serious allegations of mismanagement against the hospital. She claimed that life-saving drugs and Remdesivir were stolen from the hospital, which did not report it to the police. We are investigating the veracity of her allegations,” Shah said. The hospital administration on Tuesday evening issued a statement refuting this. “Allegations levelled by the former nursing staff on theft of medicines from the hospital stores are baseless,” the hospital’s statement said. “We wish to clarify that we follow very stringent protocols in maintaining our inventory. We regularly check and audit stocks and there has been no mismatch found in our records and the actual inventory. In line with our disciplinary policies for our employees, the services of the nurse have been terminated with immediate effect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nurse-arrested-for-stealing-phone-from-dead-covid-patient/articleshow/82952991.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Hyderabad||Over 75,000 receive jabs as Telangana resumes vaccination||HYDERABAD: Administration of the second doses of Covid-19 vaccine resumed on Tuesday for those aged 45 and above. The drive saw an overwhelming response despite the lockdown restrictions with 75,314 persons taking the dose according to the details released by the state health department. While all districts in the state administered vaccine doses, Hyderabad administered the most, giving more than 6,000 doses. As many as 72,807 people received their doses in the 45 and above age group taking the total doses administered to the age group to over 48 lakh. Most doses administered on Tuesday were second doses, with 68,971 receiving the second dose while only 3,940 were recipients of the first dose. In several places, the vaccine drive picked up pace after 10 am, following the enforcement of lockdown hours. In some districts, people started queueing up at the vaccination centres as early as 6 am. In some places, arguments broke out between authorities and the locals over the insufficient number of doses compared to the number of people who had come for their vaccination. “In most cases, second doses of Covaxin were administered. Only some of the doses were Covishield where people had completed the 12 week interval,” a senior official informed. However, in Hyderabad and other districts, not all vaccination centres were covered under the drive while only a select few rural and primary health centres were covered. Although Hyderabad has over 90 vaccination centres under the government, vaccination drives were conducted at only a few while only six centres in the private sector could continue their vaccination programme. While the state government had halted administration of vaccines to all age groups for some time, some private vaccination centres in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, and Medchal-Malkajgiri districts were continuing with administration of second doses to beneficiaries. “It is good that people have now realised the importance of the vaccine and are now coming forward on their own. Many had not even cared to take their second dose of the vaccine initially,” said a top health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-75k-receive-jabs-as-t-resumes-vaccination/articleshow/82956205.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The impact of the cyclone is likely to be more in south Bihar. Chief minister Nitish Kumar at a high-level review meeting on Tuesday asked all departments concerned to remain on alert. Cyclone Yaas live updates“As per information, the whole of Bihar will be affected by the cyclone in some form. Departments and officials concerned should maintain continuous vigil on weather developments and make necessary preparations,” Nitish told senior officials at the meeting. The CM also asked officials to make alternative arrangements to ensure an uninterrupted power supply to all government and private hospitals in the state and hold a dry run. “We are concerned about the disruption in electric supply due to cyclone Yaas, which may affect the treatment of Covid patients in the hospitals. Alternative arrangements must be kept ready,” Nitish said. Earlier in the meeting, the additional chief secretary (disaster management department), Pratyaya Amrit, gave details of the preparations made for tackling the cyclone. He said two NDRF teams and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) are ready for deployment. Meanwhile, the Patna Meteorological Centre’s director Vivek Sinha, in a special bulletin issued on Tuesday evening, said the entire state will witness the impact of the cyclone from Wednesday but it will be more intense in the southern parts. “The impact of the cyclone will start getting witnessed at most places in the state from Wednesday in the form of cloudy skies, lightning, gusty winds and moderate to heavy rainfall. Such weather conditions are expected to prevail till May 30,” Sinha wrote. The Met director further claimed that as the cyclone will be moving from the southeast to north-east direction alongside Bihar and Jharkhand, its impact will be seen more in the southern parts of the state. “Most places in the state are likely to witness light to moderate rainfall along with heavy rainfalls at a few places between May 26 and 30,” Sinha wrote. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in a special bulletin released at 8.30 pm on Tuesday, issued a warning for light to moderate rainfall at most places in Bihar with heavy to very heavy rainfall and extremely heavy falls at isolated places on May 27 and isolated heavy to very heavy falls on May 28. About the status of the cyclone, the IMD bulletin stated it had intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm in the northwest Bay of Bengal, about 160 km east-southeast of Paradip in Odisha. It is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar Islands close to the north of Dhamra and south of Balasore, during noon of Wednesday as a very severe cyclonic storm. Bihar State Disaster Management Authority’s vice-president Vyasji told TOI on Tuesday evening that all districts have been sent alert along with high- alert to districts in central and southern parts of the state. “The impact of the cyclone is likely to be more in southern parts of the state. Though we are expecting more rainfall and less high-speed gusty winds but officials in the energy department have been alerted to make necessary preparations for damage control in case of uprooting of electric poles or trees in south Bihar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cyclone-yaas-met-warns-of-rain-thunderstorm-in-bihar-till-may-29/articleshow/82954114.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, all coop society audit reports to be in Marathi||Mumbai: The state government has directed all cooperative societies, including for housing, to henceforth submit their audit reports in Marathi. The circular, issued by cooperation commissioner Anil Kawade on Tuesday, has also directed societies to implement this rule in their reports to be submitted for the recently ended financial year 2020-21 itself. The move, the circular stated, is aimed at ensuring the majority of cooperation department officials, stakeholders, auditors and office bearers of societies who speak and write Marathi to take proper reviews and actions. The circular, though, allows the English version for societies that have made the required resolution in their general body (GB) while appointing an auditor. While submitting reports to the Reserve Bank of India, the commissioner wants societies to adhere to the bank’s guidelines.  Ramesh Prabhu of Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association said as per law, the move is “absolutely correct and cannot be challenged”. Advocate Vinod Sampat said though the intention behind the move may be good, it may not be practical in a cosmopolitan city like Mumbai. “It may result in lower output. Many CAs don’t know Marathi. When cases come up in court, English translation is to be provided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-all-coop-society-audit-reports-to-be-in-marathi/articleshow/82952161.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The two hospitals together have around 300 cases of mucormycosis under treatment along with a waitlist of more patients. The department of Ayurveda, yoga & naturopathy, Unani, siddha and homeopathy (Ayush) in the state has been studying 100 mucromycosis patients over the last three days at the two government-designated hospitals. The research team had selected the patients based on the various levels of criticality and has come up with treatment protocols for each level — mild, moderate, and severe. Meanwhile, the Ayush department had been giving preventive medicines to patients who have recovered from Covid-19 but had been on high doses of steroids and are diabetics for the last one week, at the BRKR Government Ayurvedic College. “We had been working in two units — at ENT Hospital and Gandhi Hospital — and each unit had studied 50 patients. We need to study the nature of the disease and how it is spreading. Mucormycosis had been a very rare disease but is now spreading. The teams have discussed observations and treatment protocol and the medicines are now in place. We will begin prescribing Ayurvedic medicines to patients from tomorrow (Wednesday),” said Dr Praveen Madikonda, associate professor at BRKR Government Ayurvedic College, who is heading the study team at the Government ENT Hospital. Officials at the two government hospitals meanwhile said that they do not want to create over-enthusiasm about this form of treatment. “Within a week we will be able to come up with some conclusions,” the official added declining to share more details about the treatment protocol for the time being.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ayurvedic-treatment-for-black-fungus-cases-to-start-today/articleshow/82956177.cms||Amrita Didyala

The 76-year-old, along with wife Meera Bhattacharjee, tested positive for Covid on May 18. So far, he had been under treatment at home. Bhattacharjee was put on non-invasive ventilation after his oxygen saturation level dropped below 90%, according to a statement by Woodlands Hospital, where he was admitted. Bhattacharjee has been stated to be “conscious, alert and communicating verbally”. His blood pressure and pulse are also stable and urine output satisfactory. Doctors said he was on antibiotics and Covid drugs, apart from non-invasive ventilation. Meera, who was released from the same hospital on Monday after recovering from Covid, was readmitted later on Tuesday after she suffered a panic attack. A six-member team has been formed for the former CM’s treatment. Though Bhattacharjee is clinically stable, his dropping oxygen level was a cause for concern, said doctors. “His oxygen saturation dipped below 90%. We did a chest CT scan that revealed changes in lungs and some other anomalies. Bhattacharjee is a COPD patient,” said Kaushik Chakraborty, a member of the medical team, which comprises Dhrubo Bhattacharya, Soutik Panda, Somnath Maity, Ankan Bandopadhyay and cardiologist Saroj Mondal. On Tuesday afternoon, chief minister Mamata Banerjee called upon Meera and assured her of all government support for the former chief minister’s treatment.

---||Goa||Champions League triumph will give Manchester City additional prestige: Omar Berrada||Panaji: To think of the City Football Group is to think of Manchester City. Once, in the words of former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, the "small club" with "plenty of talk, all talk," City have just won their third Premier League trophy in four seasons, fifth in the last 10 years, and will look to lift their first Champions League crown when they take on Chelsea FC in the final on Sunday. Since the takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008, CFG have added several other clubs to its portfolio. They have 10 across the world from Asia to South America, but City remains the crown jewel. Having won 13 trophies in the last decade, they now have a chance to add the biggest prize of them all. “It's a dream to be in the final,” Omar Berrada, chief football operations officer at the City Football Group, tells select journalists from India during an online interaction on Wednesday. “Over the last 12 years, from the ownership to football staff across CFG, the club has always wanted to be in the Champions League final. It's been a journey that started with FA Cup win in 2011 and we have been able to win many domestic trophies. This is a result of a lot of hard work, patience and trust.” Despite their best efforts with Pep Guardiola at the helm, City had failed to move beyond the quarterfinal stage of the Champions League, until this season. Now they are in the final, one win away from winning the trophy that adds to their incredible domestic domination. “This is a result of the vision that the ownership had 12 years ago, developing a very strong academy, specific way of playing football, bringing in the right coach and players to play that way. We have a football director (Txiki) Begiristain who has been building the squad for many, many years, with the right balance,” says Berrada. On form, City will be favourites to win the Champions League, never mind the two losses against Chelsea FC. As winger Raheem Sterling told TOI earlier this week, “those two losses go out of the window.” Berrada knows City won’t be short on confidence or motivation. He feels, regardless of what happens in the final on Saturday, the team will continue to compete for top honours in Europe. “The Champions League is the most prestigious club competition. The Premier League is the best domestic competition, by far the best in the world, but it’s true that the Champions League brings in clubs from different countries of Europe and gives you that additional prestige if you win. “In the Champions League, there are so many different factors which are related to luck. But we have worked so hard to be in this position, I believe we will continue to be in the quarterfinals, semi-finals and final, hopefully winning often, because of the groundwork that has been done to put us in that position. “Whether we win or not on Saturday, we are incredibly proud of what we have done this season.

Along with his supporters, Borkar began throwing the chairs and tables around before MLA Krishna Khopde intervened and calmed them down.According to sources, the incident took place around 10 am and delayed the start of the camp for about two hours.Dr Rashmi Bhaisare, medical officer from Lakadganj zone, said she was not aware of the incident. “There was no damage to property or injury to staff,” she said.Borkar told TOI that he had nothing to do with the camp. “Local corporators should be taken into confidence while organizing any event in their wards,” he added.The city BJP unit had planned people-centric initiatives as a part of Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s birthday (May 27) celebrations. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, the BJP has organized blood donation, coronavirus tests, plasma donation camps etc.On Tuesday, BJP’s East Nagpur secretary Namdev Thakre organized the Covid test camp at Satnami Nagar. Two mobile Aapli buses with staff from the civic body were deployed to collect samples. Thakre had also put up a banner to spread the word around.Borkar, a senior BJP corporator of prabhag No. 23 and the former standing committee chairman, felt that since the camp was being held in his constituency, “I should have been informed”. Borkar then allegedly instructed NMC authorities to withdraw one of the buses and along with his supporters tried to stop the camp from starting. Thakre tried to placate Borkar. As he was unsuccessful, he informed Khopde. The camp then resumed.Recently, Borkar was in the news for his dispute with party corporator Jitendra Kukde over the post of transport committee chairman. Despite resigning from the post, Borkar had been trying hard to retain it.With the civic elections due early next year, senior BJP leaders have taken the intra-party differences between corporators very seriously, say sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ignored-bjp-corporator-tries-to-disrupt-partys-testing-camp/articleshow/82955014.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||HC: Need for anti-Covid publicity drives on lines of ‘hum do, hamare do’||New Delhi: Recalling an old jingle Hum do, Hamare Do to cite how effective it was, Delhi High Court on Tuesday advised the Centre and the AAP government to run similar campaigns for Covid-19. “You need to bombard the public with awareness messages about Covid helpline numbers. The amount of advertisement we used to see earlier on family planning hum do hamare do… it was there on DTC buses, radio, papers and everywhere, it actually worked. We need something like that now for Covid-19. Every war needs propaganda to keep people motivated,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed. The high court identified a “common thread” from the various issues flagged by the court-appointed amicus and noted a “lack of continuity and adequate publicity of most relevant and germane information to the public at large” The court pointed out that “various helpline numbers have not been broadcast as frequently and effectively as should have been done on a daily basis.” It directed the Centre and the Delhi government to “publicise all relevant helpline numbers and information through audio video mediums on a daily basis to educate people of facilities created for testing and treatment.” Asserting that there is a need for being little pro-active and agile, the bench said the advertisement must be a regular thing and a daily dose has to go out as it is like “a dose of medicine you have to give daily” and it has to be in people’s memory. It said Doordarshan and All India Radio are the mediums of the Central government which should be used to advertise every day. “People are aware of Covid-19 protocol. It is high time that you update them with Covid-19 helpline numbers, which is the most important part of the message. You have to be agile on your feet on this,” the bench said, adding that the government can get the message recorded and circulated. Covid helpline toll-free is 1075, Covid Helpline Delhi 011-22307145, Child helpline 1098 and senior citizen helpline 14567.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-need-for-anti-covid-publicity-drives-on-lines-of-hum-do-hamare-do/articleshow/82955019.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Jaipur||Covid-19: In Jaipur, youngsters are the most affected in second wave||JAIPUR: Young population in the 21-30 age bracket has been the worst affected in the second Covid-19 wave in the city. As per data, out of every four virus cases reported in Jaipur, one was in the 21-30 age group. Besides, the above 60 years population was safer in the second wave compared to the first one. According to Sawai Man Singh Medical College, the young population has suffered as the virus has mutated and become more virulent in the second wave. Also, the disease had progressed more aggressively. In May, 17,084 persons in the 21-30 group were found infected, accounting for 24.8% of the total cases reported. In April, the percentage was slightly higher at 25.4%. By comparison, the worst two months of the first wave (November & December last year) had shown a different trend. During this period, the above 60 years group was the worst affected due to Covid. In November, 20.3% of the total cases were from the above 60 group, and, in December, this was slightly higher at 22.9%. For the same period, the share of the 21-30 years population in the total cases was 18% and 17.7% for November and December, respectively. In the second wave, this has increased by around 7%, which is a noticeable spike. “The second wave is quite different from the first wave and affected a different age group. It is believed that the double mutant variant, which is more virulent than the first wave virus, is in circulation in the current wave. This could be due to the aerosol transmission of virus, which leads to wider and faster spread of the disease. It has also been seen that the HRCT remains normal in the first two to three days of infection. But after the lungs get affected, it shows in the HRCT report. A large number of young people got admitted for treatment during this wave, which is different from the first one,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent of the dedicated Covid-19 RUHS Hospital, run by the government. Other than the 21-30 age group, the city also reported a significant rise in infections among the 31-40 group. In the first wave, this age group accounted for 20.2% of total cases in November and 19.4% in December. But in the second wave, this has increased to 22.6% in April and 24.5% in May. However, infections among the 41-50 age group remained almost the same between 15 to 17% in the first and second wave, reporting no significant change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-jaipur-youngsters-are-themost-affected-in-second-wave/articleshow/82957191.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

I remained in the sea for around 14 hours holding on to my life jacket, before the Indian Navy personnel rescued me,” said Amit. To recall, Barge P305 sank in Arabian sea about 60 km from Mumbai after being hit by Cyclone Tauktae on May 16. Indian Navy ships were sent to rescue 261 people at the site. “I joined as a painter on the P305 Barge on February 10, 2019. On the night of May 15, our ship was stuck in the sea due to Cyclone Tauktae storm. Soon, we were asked to wear life saving jackets, as our vessel had broken free of its anchor shortly after midnight. This led to a puncture in the Barge and water started gushing in from one side. After some time, the rear portion of the vessel started sinking and it got flooded. Once that happened, we were all asked to jump into the water. Later, when all the crew members started jumping into the sea, I too jumped into the sea. After nearly 14 hours, I was rescued by the Indian Navy,” said the fortunate Amit, who had a narrow escape from the clutches of death. The status of many of his colleagues is still to be updated, he said, adding that, “Soon, I reached the hospital, and contacted my family at my native place in Kannauj and informed them about my well being.” Amit’s family and his village, saluted the Indian Navy for saving Amit’s life. His family members said, “We still can’t believe that he is standing alive in front of us. We all salute the Navy personnel for their brave efforts and for saving his life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/remained-in-sea-for-14-hours-before-indian-navy-rescued-me/articleshow/82957185.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The incident took place at Bakcha village under Sisolar police station of Hamirpur district on Monday. The wedding procession was supposed to leave for Asgaha Tamaura village in the district where the wedding of one Dharmendra Singh of Bakcha village was to take place. When the groom and his family were preparing to leave for Asgaha Tamaura village, the test report of the groom came in and he tested positive for Covid-19. The district authorities were informed, following which a police team reached the groom’s house and stopped the ‘baraat’ from proceeding further. “The groom was admitted to a quarantine centre, said Dr Anil Sachan, in-charge, Maudaha community health centre. “The groom has been quarantined at Sumerpur quarantine centre. We conducted an on the spot Covid test of his family members and as well as other guests and asked them to isolate themselves at their respective homes for nearly 10 days,” said Dr Sachan. Dr Sachan told TOI that the groom, Dharmendra Singh, underwent Covid test on May 22 and his wedding ceremony was scheduled to take place on Monday. “However, on the day his ‘baraat’ was to leave for the bride’s place at a neighbouring village, his report came positive. He and his family members tried to conceal the fact and attempted to go ahead with the marriage. Somehow, the information leaked and reached Maudaha community health centre following which a team of district and police officials reached the groom’s village and stopped the marriage procession from proceeding further. The officials later apprised the health department following which Dharmendra was picked up and sent to Sumerpur quarantine centre,” added Dr Sachan further. Subsequently, the wedding has been called off till the groom recovers completely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/groom-tests-positive-for-covid-19-quarantined/articleshow/82957198.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Not a single Covid case in 138 villages of badly hit Buldhana||NAGPUR: Buldhana district in west Vidarbha’s Amravati division is one of the top three worst-hit districts in the region due to Covid-19. But, there is a silver lining. Total 138 small villages in the remote parts of the district have not reported even a single case of Covid-19 right since the onset of the pandemic. After almost 15 months and two waves, not a single native of about 1.5 lakh cumulative population of these villages got infected. Authorities in the district said the credit goes to the villagers only as they followed Covid-appropriate behaviour and also made ‘farm quarantine’ mandatory for any guests and visitors. “We have report cards of all 1,420 villages in Buldhana district. Many of them have less than 10 cases or up to 5 cases. But, these 138 villages have not reported even a single case to date. The average population of each village is around 1,000. These villages are mainly from remote parts of the district,” said Rajesh Lokhande, deputy CEO of Buldhana’s zilla parishad. Even if being small in terms of population, Buldhana district has 83,241 to date, which is highest in Vidarbha after Nagpur (4.72 lakh) and Amravati (89,547). Case positivity in the district is still over 15%. Adjacent Akola and Washim districts also have a high positivity rate. In the second wave, cases are mainly coming from the rural parts of Buldhana. Buldhana district has 12 tehsils. Almost every tehsil has a few number of villages with no cases. Sagrampur, dominated by tribal and remote villages, has highest 29 of them while adjacent Jalgaon Jamod has 25 such villages. Khamgaon (16), Mehkar (12), Chikhli, Lonar and Buldhana (9 each), Malkapur (8), Nandura and Motala (6 each), Sindkhed Raja, Deulgaon Raja and Shegaon (3 each) have zero Covid-hit villages. ZP CEO Bhagyashree Vispute termed this is success story of these villages and said, “Villagers kept vigil, followed Covid-appropriate behaviour and kept the virus out till now in such challenging situation. It’s a big achievement.” Amol Bhivgade, a resident of Paturda village in Sangrampur, who was selected by his village to travel to city or towns for essential works, said this pattern can be followed by small villages. “I used to travel to Sangrampur, sometimes Buldhana for villagers’ works. We hardly allowed any senior citizen to travel outside,” he said. The district administration has already started vaccination in these villages and most of them will be covered by the end of May. Secret of these villages No entry | Entry to outsiders was strictly prohibited during both waves Sanitization | Govt staffers, drivers of essential supply vehicles etc had to undergo sanitization before entering village Masks | Must for outsiders visiting villages full-time during their stay Farm quarantine | If guests, visitors arrive with intention of longer stay, it was made compulsory for them to stay in farms outside village for 7 days Travel ban | Villagers hardly travelled to other towns; selected youths travelled only for important reasons||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-a-single-covid-case-in-138-villages-of-badly-hit-buldhana/articleshow/82955078.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cambridge International first board to announce board results||Mumbai: Even as SSC students are uncertain regarding the assessment pattern and the state is yet to take a decision on even holding HSC exams, their counterparts from Cambridge International schools, who had taken their board exams offline in March, have got their results. Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) on Tuesday announced the results of its March 2020 exam series that were held only in India. This year, of the 500 schools in India, only 336 opted for the March exams. Of the other two exam series held in June and November every year, the former has been cancelled in India owing to the second wave. Over 7,300 students in India received their class 10 equivalent International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and class 11 and 12 equivalent (AS and A Level, respectively) results. There are over 100 Cambridge schools in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Mahesh Srivastava, regional director, South Asia, Cambridge International, issued a statement saying that the success of the March exam was due to the hard work of teachers, students, parents and schools during these difficult times. Schools, students and parents were upbeat about the results being declared in time despite the second wave. Rakhi Mukherjee, principal of Utpal Shanghvi Global School, said: “We were not even able to carry out a mock session before they actually wrote their papers over 18 days in school,” said Mukherjee. Of the 172 students who took the IGCSE exams at the Juhu school, 42% scored above 90%. Of the 169 students who took the AS & A Level exams, 48% of all grades earned were A* (highest) and A. Dr Hanif Kanjer, director-dean of Rustomjee Cambridge International School and Junior College in Dahisar, was elated as the school got 100% results for the 14th year in a row. At Ryan Global School, Kharghar, all 22 IGCSE students passed with flying colours. “Most of them will continue will us for class 11 and 12,” said principal Archana Singh. She added that in the case of the cancelled June exam series, schools will have to submit grades to Cambridge based on three evidences of internal assessments. Cambridge will set standards for exam grades and align them with school-assessed grades in June. Malad’s Witty International School recorded one of its best scores so far with half of its students securing 90% and above in aggregate, said principal Bijo Kurian. The school’s average aggregate improved to 80% from 75% last year. Other boards like CBSE and CISCE are assessing students internally and may announce their results by July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cambridge-international-first-board-to-announce-board-results/articleshow/82957255.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Surat||72-year-old widow promised 100 years’ longevity, loses Rs 2 lakh||Surat: In her greed to live life as an affluent centurion, a 72-year-old widow living in Valsad had to wash hands off cash and jewellery worth over Rs 2 lakh to conmen. Nirmala Patel was approached by two men who claimed to be black magic practitioners and that they can make her live for 100 years. Accused Nitin Jogi and Rohit Jogi duped the gullible woman of her money through various bogus rituals till they were nabbed in a trap by Pardi police station cops. According to police, the duo had approached Patel around two months ago when they had come to collect donations for a temple. After Patel gave them Rs 1,000, the duo told her that they can help increase her longevity as well as get her a lot of money. Patel fell into their trap and gave them Rs 10,000 more. “Initially they took Rs 10,000 and their demand for money increased. On their demand, the woman also gave her gold jewellery worth Rs 1.3 lakh to them,” said sub-inspector B N Gohil of Pardi police station. After taking the valuables, they told her that they would return for the final rituals. Recently, they came again and asked for more cash from Patel. The woman asked for some time and informed her brother. Patel’s brother made her realize that she was being cheated and approached the police. Cops made a plan to nab them in the act and hid themselves in Patel’s house on Sunday. “When they reached, the woman signalled us and we arrested the two accused,” Gohil said. The duo confessed to targeting elderly people in villages and small towns who they identify when they go to collect religious donations. “We are trying to find out where else they have targeted people,” the PSI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/72-year-old-widow-promised-100-years-longevity-loses-rs-2-lakh/articleshow/82953087.cms||---

According to Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha, patients here are administered allopathic medicines, as well as herbs and Coronil, the tablet launched by Patanjali last year to support treatment of Covid-19. Patients are also encouraged to practice yoga to expedite recovery. At the inauguration, Ramdev had said that the centre will be used as an “integrated holistic treatment centre for Covid-19 patients” and claimed 99% of the patients admitted here will recover. Since it was opened, a total of 52 Covid-19 patients were admitted at the centre, of whom 17 succumbed to the virus (that puts the recovery at 67.3%). At present, three patients are undergoing treatment here. Shashi Sharma, a local resident whose daughter’s mother-in-law was admitted at the Covid Care Centre, said that she died due to lack of proper care. “She died on the very day we admitted her. She was not even given water,” she said. Notably, the centre admits only mild Covid-19 patients because it has 10 ventilators but no staff to operate these. So serious patients needing critical care are asked to go elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-ramdev-govt-covid-centre-patients-given-coronil-allopathic-drugs/articleshow/82953074.cms||MS Nawaz

He joined the college in 2006 and was very bright and committed to his work. We were able to arrange a bed for him in AIIMS but we lost him. He was initially admitted to a hospital in Alwar.” Jonwal was infected with Covid-19 around April 29 and left Delhi in the first week of May, she said. Initially, he was under home isolation. When his oxygen level dropped, he arranged for the gas at home, but had to be hospitalised in Alwar on May 10. He underwent treatment there but his condition worsened. The college principal said that around 35 teachers of the college, including her, have been infected by the virus till now. “There were one or two serious cases but they have all recovered,” she added. According to Dr Anupam Varshney, HoD of Zoology, Jonwal was brought to AIIMS with severe “Covid pneumonia”. “His oxygen levels had crossed 90 a couple of days ago, but his BP was low and in the early hours, he suffered a cardiac arrest,” she said. Jonwal’s wife was also infected but she has recovered and was taking care of him. Srivastava and Varshney said they both received long thank you messages from Jonwal 10 days ago for personally monitoring his condition. The department also held an online condolence meeting for him. Jonwal had written on Facebook about how the varsity should set up a Covid care centre for its staffers. At least 40 staffers of the varsity have succumbed to the virus till now.

Sources said searches were also conducted at their offices. This was related to a case registered against the veteran NCP politician in Mumbai. This was the first search by the ED in the case.The three associates, Sagar Bhatewara, Samit Issacs and Qadri family, are learnt to be close to Deshmukh and his family members, with business links and financial transactions between them. In the past, TOI had written about Bhatewara and Issac, when their names surfaced during the probe into the Adarsh scam too.Deshmukh or his office did not offer any statement regarding the searches conducted by ED.ED is learnt to have decided to swoop down on these three associates of Deshmukh after several financial dealings between them and the former home minister’s sons, Hrishikesh and Salil, were unearthed during investigations into the alleged money-laundering charges.ED teams, including officers flying down to the city from Mumbai, reached the residences of Bhatewara at Shivaji Nagar, Issacs at New Colony and Qadri family at Jaffar Nagar. The searches at these places and their offices continued for several hours.Sources said Bhatewara, whose name is associated with at least eight companies, owns several godowns and warehouses at different locations in and around Vidarbha. He is also owner of logistics and transport business. Bhatewara was also active during the election campaigns of the Deshmukh family, said a source. Bhatewara is a director in Rabia Properties, where Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh is also one of the directors.Isaacs, known for his partying lifestyle, was also involved as close business partner with the Deshmukh family in several ventures since almost a decade, said high level sources.The Qadris, one of the top builders and real estate agents, had also been close to the Deshmukh family for last several years.ED is learnt to have registered offences against former home minister Deshmukh following an FIR by CBI, which had lodged the case after ex-Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh approached the high court. Apart from Singh, another four petitioners had intervened, including one Jaishri Patil, seeking court’s intervention in the allegations levelled by ex-Mumbai CP that Deshmukh asked dismissed Asst PI Sachin Waze and two other cops to collect Rs100 crore for him from the bars in Mumbai.ED has already recorded statements of an Andheri, Mumbai, bar owner who had allegedly paid Rs2.5 lakh per month to Waze. The agency has also issued summons to four more bar owners. The ED sleuths have also recorded the statement of petitioner Patil.The ED is probing where Waze had extorted money and parking of funds so collected. They are examining the financial transaction of Waze, his family members and firms associated with them in the case along with Deshmukh and his kin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ed-searches-at-6-places-including-homes-of-three-deshmukh-associates/articleshow/82955108.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||State bars home isolation option, then reverses decision||Nagpur: On Tuesday morning, the state government announced that the option of home isolation will not be available for Covid-19 patients in 18 districts where the positivity rate is still high. By evening, however, the decision had been overturned. Now, though home isolation will be permitted, the emphasis will be more on admitting patients in Covid care centres (CCCs), especially in rural areas.The districts where home isolation was to be withdrawn included Akola, Amravati, Gadchiroli and Wardha in Vidarbha. Also in the list of 18 was Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Thane, Satara, Sangli, Latur, Beed, Raigad and Ratnagiri. The positivity rate in these districts is higher than the state average.The state did not issue any clarification on the change of decision but only released a revised note. The meeting was chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.“Patients in home isolation in these 18 districts should be brought down and should be negligible. We have realised that monitoring in home isolation was not effective and the the infection was spreading to other family members as well,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. Sources informed that withdrawing the option of ‘home isolation’ would have been a disastrous decision. A senior member of the state Covid task force told TOI that it would have resulted in fewer people turning up for tests, something the state cannot afford at this stage.“People who have no symptoms generally don’t wish to get admitted in Covid Care centres. If institutional quarantine would have been made compulsory, every positive patient would have to be admitted in CCCs. Fear and stigma of going to CCC is still there. This would have resulted in denial and discouragement towards tests,” said the member not willing to be named.A senior district official told TOI that the higher-ups had never discussed the idea of institutional isolation for everyone. “The announcement had come as a surprise because no district would have that many beds in CCCs. Even now, there is a careful selection of patients who are to be admitted to CCCs given the manpower constraints,” the official said.Many districts including those having higher positivity rate, have already resorted to initiatives like mass testing at marketplaces, random testing at checkpoints and testing through mobile vans. “These initiatives would have taken a setback if people would have opted out of tests fearing institutional quarantine. Therefore, the decision was revised,” added the member.However, the state government has made it clear that more emphasis should be given to institutional quarantine now as cases have started reducing. “We must avoid a spread of Covid through violation of home quarantine,” the revised note said.The state government also allowed gram panchayats to spend 25% funds from the grants received under the15th finance commission and also revenue generated minor mineral development fund. It was decided that Covid centres will be set up at the village level.Officials said that due to lack of monitoring in these 18 districts, the death rate too is going up. “Many patients who are in home isolation are landing up to the hospital in really bad condition,” said an official. A senior doctor from Gondia Medical College said that institutional isolation is the fundamental way to treat an infectious disease. “But the numbers are so overwhelming at present that it’s not a practical solution,” he said.Meanwhile, districts in Nagpur division can expect some relaxations in restrictions from June 1 or 3. Districts in Amravati division would have to wait longer as in Akola and Amravati — the two main districts — the positivity rate is still above 15%. Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana also have more than 10% positivity rate, but, they are not in red zone as positivity rate is reducing at a fast rate.Barring Wardha, all districts in Nagpur division have less positivity rate than the state average. Bhandara, Gondia, and Chandrapur have shown significant a drop. Focus will now be on Wardha and Gadchiroli.Home Isolation in Vidarbha45,592 | Patients under treatment in Vidarbha on May 2531,000 | In home isolation70% | Under-treatment patients in Vidarbha in home isolation78.4 % | Amravati; 81% Akola; 75% | Nagpur; 50% | Yavatmal; 58% Gondia10% | State Maharashtra eekly (May 17-25) positivityDistricts with positivity higher than the state average:Satara | 23%Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg | 21%Raigad | 18%Beed, Osmanabad, Kolhapur, Pune, Hingoli | 17%Akola, Amravati | 15%Solapur, Sangli | 13%Washim, Wardha | 11%||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-bars-home-isolation-option-then-reverses-decision/articleshow/82955136.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: From growing roses to veggies, pandemic gives Pushkar a bitter lesson in farming||JAIPUR: Umeed Singh Rawat, a farmer with five bighas of land in Nala village in Pushkar, had to take a tough decision to change his crop for the first time in three decades. Considering the raging pandemic across the state and nation, it was not easy. But as demand for his roses and ‘kalkatti genda' (marigold) fell to zilch, he had no other option but to shift to bitter gourd cultivation in April this year. The pandemic had led him into a financial crisis from April 2020 to April 2021 as he was forced to dump his produce into the well or offer it to cows. He then ran his tractor over the standing marigold crop to clear space for growing vegetables. “I have sown bitter gourd in three bighas. But I had to keep two bighas of land vacant as I don’t have money to grow anything. I have just sold my first crop of bitter gourd for Rs 10 per kg. I used to get Rs 50 per kg for ‘genda’ which best explains my situation,” said Rawat, who tilled the entire land by himself as he could not afford labourers. Rawat’s is not an isolated case among flower growers in Pushkar. The cultivation of profit making red and pink roses is being replaced by seasonal vegetables by farmers in their land in Pushkar near Ajmer. The complete ban on marriages, festivals, religious events and exports of flowers has forced farmers in the holy city to grow Chinese okra, tinda, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, Shimla mirch, gwar pods and chillies to sustain in the pandemic. Over 7,000 farmers are engaged in cultivating flowers in over 12 villages around Pushkar. They were earning Rs 1 lakh per bigha before the pandemic, but are now struggling to make even Rs 20,000 from a bigha by growing vegetables. The Chauhans family of six brothers in Pushkar is known as ‘phool wale’ for cultivating roses for the past one century. He is quickly converting their collective 80 bighas of land to growing vegetables and fruits. Hari Shankar Chauhan (56), the youngest in the family, has just sold his first vegetable crop of brinjal and Chillies, sown in a large part of his share of land, which fetched him 10% of what he earned by growing roses. “Since April 2020, I have been feeding my pink rose and 'gul dawoodi' to cows. The second wave has made us realise that if the flower market at all opens, it will remain highly competitive till the beginning of the next year,” said Chauhan, who had won a state award for farming in 2011. The flower cultivation is concentrated in villages such as Nadi 1 and Nadi II, Bhawata, Amba, Motisar, Bhagwanpura, Ganheda, Kishanpura, Devnagar and Kanas. The main species of flowers grown here are red and pink roses, 'kalkatti genda', 'navranga ganga', 'gul dawood', 'ashtar' and 'jafri', which are in high demand across the country and also in the international market, especially Europe. Poonam Marothia, president of the Flower Vikrata Mandi, Ajmer, says that people, who were engaged indirectly in the business, had suffered a daily loss of Rs 5 lakh. “One bigha of land will have 4,000-5,000 plants approximately. Every plant gives 25-30 flowers. Other than local consumption, exports, which brought us good money, are dead, forcing the farmers to look for alternative means of livelihood,” said Marothia. Dilip Singh Rathore, SDM, said the government was ready to help farmers and provide relief as per relevant provisions. The oldest reference to rose cultivation in the region can be traced back to Mughal ruler Jahangir who during his stay in Ajmer visited rose nurseries. The biggest consumers of roses are the 12th-century Khwaja Gharib Nawaz Dargah in Ajmer and the temples of Pushkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/from-growing-roses-to-veggies-pandemicgives-pushkar-a-bitter-lesson-in-farming/articleshow/82957234.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Delhi||Over 2/3rd of Delhi University students surveyed say not in state of mind to prepare for exams||NEW DELHI: A survey of over 1,100 students of Delhi University has shown that 68.2% of them are not in the right physical or mental state to prepare or appear for the online Open Book Examination (OBE) scheduled from June 7. The study was conducted between May 6 and 11 by the students’ union of Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR), which further highlighted that 50% of the students and their immediate family members who tested Covid-positive faced severe symptoms. The analysis was an attempt by the students to highlight the mental and emotional stress experienced by them to make out a case for not holding the final-year exams. The results of the survey have been shared with the university administration. It has also been endorsed by the students’ unions of 23 colleges, including Hindu, St Stephen’s, Kirori Mal, Hansraj, Sri Venkateswara and PGDAV. Among those students who participated in the survey, 27.2% had tested positive for Covid-19 and almost 54% of their immediate family members had been infected by the virus. Apart from this overall survey, the Lady Shri Ram College students’ union also conducted a study among their college students. It found that 29.8% of the students had tested Covid-positive and around 50% of their immediate family members had also been infected. A humongous 66% of them stated that they were not in the right physical and mental state to appear for the exam. C Karthika Sajeev, president of the LSR students’ union, said, “We have started a petition demanding the cancellation of the OBE. We also have a Twitter storm scheduled for Thursday as we want the administration to hear us. We strongly believe that if held, the exams will put students under an unimaginable amount of stress and many of them might not even be able to appear for it.” The study also mentioned that 47.6% of students did not have a stable internet connection. In the last OBE, around 56% of the students had faced problems in uploading answer sheets. Around 48% stated that they didn’t have the resources to appear for the OBE. “Earlier, many students used cyber cafes or other means to give the exam. Such means are unavailable now. Even conduction of OBEs needs the physical presence of some staff members and students in the office to operate the server/portal. This can put such people at a high risk, that is if they are even able to travel to the office,” said Sajeev. Delhi University has lost over 35 teachers and non-teaching staff in the second wave of Covid-19. The alternative suggested by students includes using the aggregate marks of previous semesters and internal assessments of the current semester.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-2/3rd-of-du-students-surveyed-say-not-in-state-of-mind-to-prepare-for-exams/articleshow/82953101.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Pune||Private hospitals in Pune see 80% drop in admissions, wind up fever units||PUNE: Some big private Covid-19 hospitals in Pune have recorded a nearly 80% drop in patients needing hospitalization and a few have wound up their dedicated fever units after a sharp drop in complaints of flu-like illness over the last three weeks from May 1. Infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag observed that typical as it was in many countries, the second wave saw a steep rise and steep fall with the plateau phase either short or absent. The maximum Covid-19 occupancy during the first wave at the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, among the biggest facilities in Pune, had reached 450 patients last September. It went up to 600-650 patients during the second wave in mid-April this year. “Currently, we have 210 patients. Of these, 60 are in the intensive care unit,” the hospital’s medical director Dhananjay Kelkar said. Inquiries seeking admission to the hospital have dropped by about 80%. Since there has been a significant fall in suspected Covid patients with flu-like illness, the hospital shut down its dedicated fever unit meant for medical consultation on outpatient department basis this week. “In April, we had over 450 suspected patients daily complaining of Covid-like symptoms at our fever OPD. The numbers dropped to 100 in the first week of May and slid further. We have temporarily closed down our fever unit after only five-six patients started approaching with flu-like symptoms,” Kelkar said. At Bharati Hospital, the authorities withdrew 75% of the staff from its dedicated fever unit meant for suspected Covid patients. “The fever OPD number has come down from 400 suspected patients daily to just seven patients now. The RT-PCR tests have come down from an average of 300 tests per day to just 51 tests per day,” the hospital’s deputy medical director Jitendra Oswal said. The facility also reported an over 80% reduction in patients needing hospitalisation. The hospital currently has 67 patients with 37 in the ICU. “Only two to three patients approach us for admission every day now. We have temporarily closed down some of our Covid wards. This is a complete turnaround. In mid-April, we had over 370 patients undergoing treatment and at that time, we often had no option but to refuse more admissions,” Oswal said. He said they saw a slow rise in the number of cases during the first wave and it had lasted longer. “During the second wave, we saw a quick rise in a short span, more numbers, and more ICU admissions. Besides, a sizeable number of children, adolescents and young adults needed hospitalisation,” Oswal added. Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital (ABMH), among the biggest Covid-19 hospitals in Pimpri Chinchwad, also reported a 50% drop in admissions. Compared with the urban areas where the daily number of cases has reduced to three digits, rural parts of Pune district continued to report a sizeable number of cases, and many report to ABMH. “Currently, we have around 140 Covid patients undergoing treatment with us with 35 patients in the ICU. We had an occupancy of 375 patients during the second wave,” the hospital’s chief executive officer Rekha Dubey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-hospitals-see-80-drop-in-admissions-wind-up-fever-units/articleshow/82957239.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Moga driver Satnam Singh, who died, was just 20. On Monday evening, a private hospital of Moga had called him to take the patient home. On getting there, he left the patient inside the ambulance and went inside the house to start the cylinder first. Sources said it seemed that gas had leaked out because of improper keeping of the cylinder, so while starting, it had exploded. The two injured people were taken to the Moga civil hospital, where Satnam was declared dead. His family has demanded an investigation. Ajitwal station house officer (SHO) Sukhjinder Singh said: "After legal formalities under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) police now look further into the matter." Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans has directed Nihal Singh Wala SDM Ram Singh to conduct magisterial probe and report at the earlier. He has aked people having kept oxygen cylinder at homes or other places to submit these at nearest health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/o2-cylinder-blast-kills-ambulance-driver-in-moga/articleshow/82957242.cms||---

Fifteen days later, Soumyadeep recovered and returned home on Tuesday, smiling at the medical team in PPE, whom he initially imagined to be “aliens”. The boy, who has delayed development and borderline autism, tested positive for Covid, along with parents Kishalay and Chaitali Rakshit in early May. While the parents recovered at their Agarpara home, Soumyadeep had to be admitted to nursing homes in Sodepur and Baguiati before being taken to Fortis Hospital in Anandapur. “He boy came to us with oxygen saturation of 83%-84%, very low BP, bad sensorium. A CT scan showed severe Covid pneumonia. He was also having repetitive seizures. We put him on non-invasive high-flow oxygen support,” said paediatric intensivist Rajesh Kumar Singh. As Soumyadeep’s sensorium improved, the boy would try to avoid doctors and nurses in PPE, recoiling in fear or getting agitated. Clinical psychologist Aparna Biswas counselled the boy and suggested his parents be allowed with him and room interiors be changed. “Soumyadeep wanted an airy and sunny room, a TV, good food and his parents. The hospital let his parents be with him,” said Singh. He was shifted to an executive room with a TV and the interiors were changed. With his parents around, he started accepting treatment. “We are lucky we got such a wonderful team and administration at Fortis,” said his mother, Chaitali. “Such stories inspire us to go beyond our call of duty. They teach us patience and compassion. We are proud of our team,” said S Trishna, PICU nursing in-charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-bends-rules-changes-interiors-to-cure-cov-boy/articleshow/82955161.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

IMA’s Uttarakhand chapter responded by writing to chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and demanding that Ramdev be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act. “As part of the conspiracy to convert the entire country into #Christianity, #Yoga and #Ayurveda are being maligned by targeting @yogrishiramdevjee. Countrymen, wake up now from the deep slumber otherwise the generations to come will not forgive you,” Balkrishna tweeted, attaching a clip from a website that had the photo of IMA president Dr JA Jayalal. His tagline asked: “Doctor or pastor”. पूरे देश को #Christianity में convert करने के षड्यंत्र के तहत, @yogrishiramdev जी को target करके #योग एवं #आयुर्वेद… https://t.co/emRVAm1TGF— Acharya Balkrishna (@Ach_Balkrishna) 1621841579000By Tuesday 9.15pm, the post had over 3,227 likes, 1,728 retweets. Later in the day, Balkrishna proceeded to tweet a series of screenshots of articles to support the conspiracy theory. Dr Jayalal told TOI, “You can see that this is how they respond to serious issues. My conscience is clear. I have never done or intended to do anything with religion in mind. You can go to the websites and read the articles to see how they are twisting it. IMA remains a secular and apolitical organization.” Jayalal’s predecessor, former president of IMA Dr Rajan Sharma, said, "Ramdev and his entire machinery had stooped to the lowest level. How do doctors respond to this? Both Ramdev and Balkrishna were admitted at AIIMS when they contracted Covid-19. How ungrateful they are towards the people who treated them. All I can say is that they have stooped low by bringing religion into this issue,” he said. Dr NS Bisht, physician to the chief minister of Uttarakhand, said, “When Ramdev has so much to say against allopathy and the doctors practising it, he must have all the answers. Doctors are human, not God. They can get infected with fungus, bacteria or a virus like any other person. But I wonder if swamis are gods, why do they seek treatment at hospitals, why can’t they treat themselves?” When contacted, Balkrishna’s secretary Gagan Kumar said he was in a meeting and not available for comments. Three days ago, Ramdev was heard saying in a video while addressing a group of followers at the Patanjali Yogpeeth campus in Haridwar that “allopathy is such a stupid and bankrupt (diwalia) science whose various treatments for Covid like chloroquine, Remdesivir, antibiotics, steroids and now even plasma therapy have failed and cost the lives of patients...it is true that lakhs of people have died due to taking allopathic medicines during this pandemic. Their number is far greater than those who died due to unavailability of oxygen.” Though Ramdev had apologised for his remarks after health minister Harsh Vardhan intervened to say such "extremely unfortunate comments can break the morale of health workers", he was back the next day to ask "25 questions to IMA on allopathy".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/top-ramdev-aide-sees-christian-plot-in-ayurveda-slight/articleshow/82953093.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||How universities in Delhi are gearing up for battles ahead||NEW DELHI: Higher educational institutions, which lost many staff members to Covid-19 during the past two months, have begun preparations for a possible third wave by rejigging health centres, acquiring oxygen concentrators and conducting vaccination drives. On May 19, JNU dean of students Sudheer Pratap Singh in a virtual discussion informed that there were no Covid-positive students on the campus anymore. He added that students in isolation centres would return to the campus. The administration had formed a Covid Response Team in April to issue advisories and manage the Covid-19 situation. Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said the varsity was now gearing up for a possible third wave. In an appeal to alumni, he stated, “There is an urgent need to upgrade the existing infrastructure. We want to establish a well-equipped Covid Health Centre, for which funds are required.” The university has asked the alumni to donate to the JNU Endowment Fund that was set up in February 2020. After the deaths of several professors and academics, other universities had also formed Covid response teams for providing assistance and relief to employees. Delhi University has seen the most number of deaths with over 30 teachers succumbing to Covid-19, including three senior administration members. The Covid Task Force that was formed for issuing advisories and notices has also pushed for restarting the Teachers’ Welfare Fund. A post-Covid recovery centre was also inaugurated at Patel Chest Institute. However, many teachers, including DU Teachers’ Association members, raised objections saying they wanted the university to set up a Covid relief centre for staff members. Janki Devi Memorial and Hansraj colleges have offered infrastructure for setting up Covid care facilities. DU plans to convert its hostels into a 200-bed healthcare facility. In a statement, DU said, “We will set up an oxygen plant that can fill 50-80 cylinders per day using the PSA technology, which is cheaper, safe and needs minimal clearances and approvals from the government.” Waseem Ahmed Khan, proctor of Jamia Millia Islamia and chairman of the corona control committee, said, “The Ansari Health Centre has been conducting Covid-19 tests and vaccination drives for staff members. We plan to improve our health centre and get more oxygen concentrators and other essential healthcare items to issue to our employees and their families when they require it. The proctorial team has two ambulances on standby. The committee is also looking at options for vaccinating those aged between 18-44.” At Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD), medical, physiotherapy and mental health tele-consultations were organised for staff members. Daily yoga sessions were also held for the administration members. The university now plans to conduct vaccination drives and set up a 40-bed healthcare facility. AUD vice-chancellor Anu Singh Lather said, “An intelligent assessment of the situation based on scientific inputs followed by humane policies on the ground have helped us so far. The pandemic is unprecedented. The only way we can see some hope on the horizon is by taking responsibilities collectively and standing by each other in such difficult times.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-univs-are-gearing-up-for-battles-ahead/articleshow/82953113.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Delhi||HC: Explain utilisation of Amphotericin B||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked Sir Ganga Ram Hospital to explain how it is utilising Amphotericin B, an antifungal drug used for treating black fungus, among its patients amid acute shortage and surging demand. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh also asked it to give details on the number of patients of black fungus, primarily those affected by the disease after recovering from Covid-19 and the method of distribution of the medicines among them. The high court decided to seek details directly from the hospital after the AAP government said the hospital was given on Monday night 360 vials of Amphotericin B, the injection administered to patients for treating mucormycosis (black fungus), but the latter told a patient it had run out of the drug after using it on other admitted patients. The bench said it wanted the hospital to explain on Thursday how it was using and distributing the medicine among the patients and asked it to file a report. The high court acted on the plea of an advocate who mentioned about the condition of her 80-year-old grandfather admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital with black fungus. She informed the court that due to efforts of the counsel for Centre and Delhi government, the patient had got six vials and these were administered, but they still needed more. On the court’s direction, one of the doctors of the hospital joined the proceeding and informed it that many patients were being administered the medicine according to their condition and requirement due to which 360 vials got used up. The bench suggested that if any unallocated stock of the injection lies with the drug controller, it be used for the treatment of the patient. Delhi government’s counsel told the court that on Monday, they had 670 vials of the medicine and after distributing it to hospitals, four were remaining. Out of Tuesday’s stock of 400, the government has distributed 396 and four are left. As of Monday, there were 475 cases of black fungus in Delhi, the court was informed earlier. Meanwhile, the Centre on Tuesday informed the court that the pricing authority NPPA had initiated the process to fix a formula to determine the MRP of oxygen concentrators, needed for Covid-19 treatment, as people were being charged exorbitantly. The process for fixing the formula is likely to be concluded soon and the court will be informed about the development on May 31, the Centre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-explain-utilisation-of-amphotericin-b/articleshow/82955167.cms||Abhinav Garg

Mehta (56) has a sprawling ashram on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway. The main complainant and two of her sisters-in-law filed the FIR against Mehta on May 4, alleging that he had repeatedly raped them in his ashram between 2005 and 2017. A day after the FIR was filed, another woman came forward and said she too was raped by Mehta, following which her name was added to the plaint. TNN “My husband had been a regular visitor at the ashram since 1998. Mehta had one day asked my husband to come with his entire family and that’s how I was introduced to him in 2005. Then I started visiting the ashram regularly. Initially, everything was fine and I used to stay at the ashram for three-four days every six months. During one such stay in 2005, I was called by the aides of the accused to his room. Once I was there, I was given some spiked drink and raped. Mehta repeatedly raped me in the ashram till 2017,” she said in her complaint, adding that her sisters-in-law were similarly exploited. “Every time I objected, Mehta told me it’s a blessing and threatened me with dire consequences if I told anyone about his sexual misconduct,” she said, adding that she was forced to confide in her husband only when the ‘godman’ wanted their 20-year-old daughter to stay at the ashram for a few days. The other complainant added in the FIR said she too was raped by Mehta many times during the same period. Not just she, the accused and his aides used to make eight-ten women stay at the ashram for “getting raped”. “Mehta’s aides are equally responsible as it is they who gave spiked drinks to the victims before raping them,” she said. Sources said that Mehta’s arrest was not easy since many politicians and influential people were regulars at his ashram. SHO Mukesh Choudhary of Bhakrota police station, under which the ashram falls, said in the past three weeks he collected evidence against Mehta and then called him to the police station on Tuesday for recording his statement, before arresting him. “The investigation has started. As per the protocol, medical examinations of the victims have been done by a medical board,” Choudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-godman-held-for-raping-4-women-between-2005-17/articleshow/82957248.cms||---

During month-long raids conducted by the department, as many as 11 persons have been arrested by the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA). A spokesperson of FDA said during investigation, it was found that the accused were allegedly selling Meropenem as Remdesivir vials by printing fake stickers of Hetero Labs Limited, a pharmaceutical company in India involved in the production of the crucial drug. Continuous raids led to the seizure of fake 277 drug vials having stickers of Covifor lyophilized powder (Remdesivir for injection 100mg/vial), the spokesperson said. He said during the raids, as many as 3,326 empty boxes of Meropenem were also found, assuming that the accused must have sold the antibiotics as Remdesivir vials by printing fake stickers. During investigation, it was revealed that Dilpreet Singh, director of Elfin Drugs Private Limited situated at Barson village, Nalagarh tehsil, Solan district in HP, was involved in sale of fake Remdesivir, the spokesperson said. Ambala SP said the vials recovered from the canal near Salimpur village under Chamkaur Sahib police station in Punjab were also related to the factory and the investigation in that link was ongoing. “Our team has verified the batch number of vials recovered in Punjab and in Ambala, which are same,” he said. On Sunday night, police had arrested Dilpreet of Phase 8B, Mohali. The FDA spokesperson said the food and drugs administration (FDA), Baddi, had sealed the premises of the firm from where the said drug stock was recovered. On April 20, the Ambala Cantonment police had recovered 24 injections Covifor lyophilized powder (Remdesivir for Injection 100mg/vial) from Paras, resident of Nandiyali village in Ambala district, and Kanishq of Defense Colony, Ambala Cantt, who had failed to produce valid documents for the drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-fda-busts-fake-remdesivir-racket-11-held/articleshow/82957259.cms||---
---||Delhi||Petition in HC for more crematoriums in Delhi||New Delhi: A public interest litigation has urged Delhi High Court to direct the Centre, Delhi government and the three municipal corporations to ensure electric or CNG crematoriums were installed in different parts of the national capital in view of the large number of people succumbing to Covid-19 daily. The plea by a social activist, Sunil Kumar Aledia, has also sought directions to the authorities to fix uniform charges for cremation of bodies at electric crematoriums in the city. The petitioner claimed that the rates ranged between Rs 500 at Sarai Kale Khan and Rs 8,800 at Lodhi Road. The petition, filed through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, has also sought a centralised online facility for the issuance of the death certificates so that general public did not have to travel physically to the local authorities for registering deaths. It has also sought that non-functional electric crematoriums be also made operational. “The huge number of Covid deaths that are occurring in Delhi are also owing to the environmental concerns. Therefore, to ensure people and gatherings at the crematorium are brought to the minimal, more number of electric crematoriums need to be installed, and those requiring repair shall immediately be fixed,” the plea stated. The plea is likely to be heard by the Delhi high court later this week. PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/petition-in-hc-for-more-crematoriums-in-delhi/articleshow/82986397.cms||---

The firm is also submitting documents for completion of Phase 3 trials for Covaxin to WHO, which will be done by the third week of June. On Monday, foreign secretary, Harsh Shringla, along with senior officials from the health ministry and the department of biotechnology met V Krishna Mohan and Sai Prasad of Bharat Biotech to discuss progress on emergency use listing (EUL) for WHO. The company started the process with WHO in April with an ‘expression of interest’. The EUL by the WHO, sources said, was likely to come through after a 60-day review of documents provided by the company, which could include a physical audit of BBIL’s units. Bharat Biotech is also hoping for approvals from Brazil and Hungary for Covaxin in the coming weeks, sources said, with final documents submitted. The company, which developed an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine with ICMR, is also in the final stages of negotiations with the USFDA to conduct small Phase 3 trial in the US. An FDA approval will go far in increasing global acceptability for Covaxin. In a meeting with MEA and health ministry officials, BBIL expressed confidence about obtaining approval, given its experience of getting its other vaccines pre-qualified by WHO, official sources said. TOI had first reported on Sunday that Shringla was likely to meet BBIL officials to expedite the process of WHO approval for Covaxin, which has been administered to almost 2 crore people till now. In the meeting with government officials, BBIL executives said regulatory approvals would all have retrospective effect. "BBIL is in regular touch with regulatory authorities in the above-mentioned countries. They are confident about the robustness of their dossier, as they have data for much longer duration — for antibody persistence after six months as well as eight months. It is one of the few companies that have published papers on all four Covid virus variants," a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pre-qualification-nod-for-covaxin-likely-by-aug/articleshow/82955268.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||Coimbatore||MGR wholesale market reopened||COIMBATORE: The MGR wholesale market in the city was reopened and allowed to function on Tuesday to ensure an uninterrupted supply of vegetables to the public during the week-long intense lockdown. The market would function as per government guidelines within the permitted time limit of 6am to noon. Speaking to reporters after inspecting at the market, city corporation commissioner P Kumaravel Pandian said that he had asked the traders to procure vegetables/fruits from other districts/states to ensure uninterrupted supply. The vegetables and fruits are sold through 165 private vehicles belonging to traders and 70 corporation-owned vehicles with the help of farmers’ markets in the city limit, he said, adding that they have been taking all the steps to prevent price rise. The corporation has set a target of operating about 500 to 600 vehicles within the city limits. While passes have been issued to 400-odd vegetable traders, some apartments have made their own arrangements and readied about 30 to 35 vehicles. In total, more than 500 vehicles are being operated to sell vegetables to the public, he said. Pointing out that the passes to traders to do mobile sales are given at the zonal offices of the corporation, Kumaravel Pandian said that they have also decided to distribute passes to both vehicles and pushcarts at the MGR wholesale market. A trader from the market said, “As the government had asked us to close the market, we had not placed fresh orders on Sunday and Monday and as a result, we had managed to provide only half the required quantity. After the corporation permitted us to reopen the market, we have placed our regular orders. The corporation officials have asked us to sell vegetables to the local vehicles before sending it to Kerala.” President of Coimbatore TK Market Anaithu Motha Vyabarigal Sangam M Rajendran said, “We have decided to sell vegetables for the lowest possible price for the next few days.” While speaking about the Covid-19 situation in the city, the commissioner said that they have been doing focused testing at multiple places, taking all steps to further increase the number of samples tested in a day and reduce the positivity rate. He said they had intensified the door-to-door survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mgr-wholesale-market-reopened/articleshow/82955285.cms||---
---||Chennai||Light at the end of tunnel for Tamil Nadu as Covid-19 cases begin to tail off||CHENNAI: The R-naught (R0), or the basic reproduction number for Covid-19 a key epidemiological indicator has dropped below 1 in Chennai to 0.9, showing the city’s cases are now shrinking as quickly as the public health authorities would like. Across the state, barring a few districts in the western and southern regions, it is inching close to 1 – the latest estimate standing around 1.08. Epidemiologists say R0 indicates how many new cases one infected person generates. “If the R0 is two, we would expect each new case of a disease to produce two other infections. With any R value greater than 1 the infection will increase, spreading through the population,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur. If the effective R is reduced below one, cases will come down. That explains why there has been a dramatic fall in cases along with a steady fall in R value. On May 13, fresh cases in Chennai dropped below the 7,000-mark to 6,991. Eleven days later, on Monday, fresh cases fell by another 2,000 cases to 4,985. “The indication of the falling curve became clearer with the fall in test positivity rate in Chennai,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. The average positivity rate, which was between 22 and 21 earlier this month, has dropped below this week for Chennai. Nevertheless, in high incidence districts such as Coimbatore, Tirupur and Theni, where R0 is above state average of 1.08, the test positivity rate is hovering around the 30s mark. Three of every 10 people tested are positive in these districts. In 15 other districts, the TPR is more than 20. This trend of sudden fall in cases was evident in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru with a fall in positivity rate and R value. “In projections for such kinds of highly infectious diseases, a parabolic curve is expected. The sharper the upstroke, the sharper the down stroke is likely to be,” said CMC director J V Peter. Public health experts say several factors would influence the peak and fall. The susceptibility of the population (number already immune by disease or vaccination), effect of the lockdown and public behaviour (in following infection control practices), all play a vital role. By reducing people’s movement, we have given lesser chances for the transmission of the virus. That’s what happened during the lockdown, said former public health official Dr K Kolandaisamy. But if the authorities really want this success to spread and swell, they must increase the presence of antibodies through vaccinations, ramp up screening, expedite the isolation process of positive cases and diligently follow quarantine rules and pandemic protocols, during and after lockdown. “It will be a tough journey but there seems to be no other path,” he said. Public health officials in the state agree. “Chennai is now an example for the rest of the districts to follow. We have already seen how the virus can bounce back. We are not letting our guard down. People shouldn’t too,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/light-at-the-end-of-tunnel-for-tn-as-covid-19-cases-begin-to-tail-off/articleshow/82955284.cms||Pushpa Narayan

The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy also directed the state to take steps and release other prisoners also to decongest the prisons and check the spread of covid-19 in jails. The court passed the interim orders on Tuesday, on a suo motu PIL proceedings to award suitable compensation by identifying the next of kin of the prisoners who have admittedly died an unnatural death as revealed by the National Crime Research Bureau (NCRB) during the period between 2012 and 2015 and even thereafter unless adequate compensation has already been awarded. When the plea, initiated in 2017 following a Supreme Court order, came up for hearing on Friday, senior advocate R Vaigai submitted that in addition to the several categories indicated for special treatment when the pandemic broke out last year, there was a further category of inmates of correctional homes, who may also be considered to be let out on parole or the like on a priority basis. Recording the submissions, the bench said: “The suggestion is wholeheartedly endorsed, and it is imperative that such category of inmates at correctional homes be also picked out for special treatment and allowed to return home or be granted parole or interim bail or the like, to ensure that both the mother and the child remain protected.” The court then adjourned the hearing to May 27 for the state to file further reports on compliance of the court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/decongest-jails-release-women-with-kids-hc-tells-tn/articleshow/82955336.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur: Black flags mark the day||New Delhi: Wednesday marked the completion of six months of the farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders. Designating it the day of resistance, huge crowds gathered at the Singhu Tikri and Ghazipur borders, wearing black clothing and holding up black flags. Reports aid black flags were also put atop houses and on vehicles in villages in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. In spite of the raging wave of Covid infections, hundreds of farmers from Punjab and Haryana joined the protests. At Singhu border, farmer Satpal Singh said the protesters did not plan to cause any disruptions in the lives of Delhi’s citizens but will silently protest at the borders to express their dissent with the central government’s three new farm laws. “We promised earlier that we wouldn’t go anywhere till the repeal of those laws and we are doing precisely that,” said Satpal. “We were here when the pandemic gripped the country and will stay here till everyone is satisfied by the steps that the government takes.” Harman, 25, accused the Centre of trying to defame the farmers and blaming them for the spread of the coronavirus. “The people in government are the ones who are unable to control the pandemic. When they are unable to find a plausible excuse, they blame the farmers, who have been sitting here, not roaming all over,” said Harman. “We have said this over and over again and will say it one more time: we will not budge till our basic demands are met, no matter what pressure the government brings on us.” The number of protesters, of course, is significantly lower than earlier, but the fervour and zest haven’t diminished. Said Baldev Singh, 50, “We come from a community that will take a bullet for a stranger. Since the very beginning of these protests, there has been no dearth of food or other comforts at any of these border protest sites, and I am sure it will continue to be the same. So, if the government feels that we will tire out or feel defeated and go back to our villages, we won’t.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/singhu-tikri-ghazipur-black-flags-mark-the-day/articleshow/82986550.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Lucknow||KGMU feat: Woman with rare disorder delivers healthy baby||LUCKNOW: A 35-year-old Covid-19 positive woman with a rare immune system disorder delivered a healthy baby girl after C-section surgery at KGMU. Doctors said both the woman and the baby are fine and have been discharged. The woman, Deepika Tiwari, was suffering from ‘Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura’ (ITP) in which patients immune system destroys platelets, resulting in internal bleeding or from the skin. However, the management and treatment of KGMU doctors helped patients in safe delivery. “Tears came out when I was told that my wife had delivered a healthy girl and both were stable,” said Sailendra Tiwari. Doctors said ITP can affect both children and adults. Children often develop ITP after a viral infection and usually recover fully without treatment. In adults, ITP is often long-term or chronic. It affects three persons in a population of 1 lakh. Dean, medical and head of obstetrics and gynaecology department, Prof Uma Singh said, “Deepika Tiwari with 38-week-and-six-day-pregnancy came to Queen Mary Hospital with complaint of abdominal pain on May 15 where she was found Covid positive. As per the protocol, she was shifted to Covid hospital at the RALC building. Tests showed her platelet counts were 18,000 cells/microliter and also confirmed her as a patient of ITP.” Since platelets help the blood clot, when their number decreases the risk of bleeding increases. If they fall below 10,000 platelets per microliter it might become difficult to stop internal bleeding even without any injury. Therefore, the KGMU gynaecology team transfused four units of platelets. Besides, Intravenous immunoglobulin 80 GM worth approximately Rs 3 lakhs was given free of cost to the patient, said Dr Uma. Prof Pushplata Sankhwar, faculty, obstetrics and gynecology department, explained that immunoglobulin is used to strengthen the body’s natural defense system to lower the risk of infection in persons with a weakened immune system. It also increases the platelet count. KGMU vice-chancellor Lt-Gen Bipin Puri congratulated the team members of the gynaecology department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-feat-woman-with-rare-disorder-delivers-healthy-baby/articleshow/82957288.cms||---

Sahil Nadar, Ranjit More and Arbaaz Khan were held and a Hyundai Accent used to kidnap a victim from Ghatkopar to Kalyan was seized. Police said Shabnam Divekar went underground after a victim lodged a complaint against her. The gang befriended businessmen on social media and persuaded them to connect via video, and later arrange a meeting. Meetings would be in hotel rooms, where the girl will get physical, and suddenly her gang members would pose as the husband and relatives, barge in, beat up the victim, threaten a rape case and demand extortion money. A businessman from Asalpha got lured by Divekar. “Within few days both started chatting and on Sunday decided to meet at a lodge in Ghatkopar, where the victim got physical and clicked selfies,’’ said Jitendra Agarkar. When the victim and Divekar came down, three friends cornered him and beat him up, showing obscene pictures, and threatening to lodge a rape case. “When the victim got scared, they bundled him into their car and took him to Kalyan, where they demanded Rs 1 lakh,’’ said Prashant Kadam, DCP (zone VII). The victim transferred Rs 10,000 and promised that that rest once he reaches home. Instead, he went to police on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trio-nabbed-in-sextortion-racket-one-on-the-run/articleshow/82957322.cms||Ahmed Ali

If the corona curfew had not been imposed, the Corona infection in the region could not have been controlled. This was necessary. Now the corona is under control, so we will end the restrictions gradually, he said. Local Crisis Management Groups will decide whether to open and when to open. Everyone said that the Corona curfew was necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/curfew-to-be-eased-from-june-1-cm/articleshow/82953167.cms||---

---||Delhi||Bail denied to man held for selling fake O2 cylinders||New Delhi: A man arrested for allegedly tampering with a fire extinguisher and converting it into an oxygen cylinder has been refused bail by a magisterial court, which observed that the possibility of him committing a similar crime couldn't be ignored. Metropolitan magistrate Bharat Aggarwal was acting on a plea for interim bail of Ravi Sharma, who was slapped with charges of cheating, criminal conspiracy, disobeying orders promulgated by a public servant under the Indian Penal Code and a related offence under the Epidemic Diseases Act. The man sought interim bail on the ground that he had earlier tested Covid-19 positive and hadn’t fully recovered. The court, however, underscored that the allegations against him were serious as he had reportedly been involved in converting fire extinguishers into oxygen cylinders. “Considering the gravity of the offence and involvement of the accused in cheating pertaining to equipment related to Covid-19, the court is not inclined to release him on interim bail,” the order stated. It also came on record that the investigation was pending and other accused were yet to be arrested. “In such circumstances, the possibility of the accused of tampering with evidence or again committing a similar crime, if released on bail, cannot be ignored,” added the court. Sharma’s counsel earlier contended that he was entitled to bail keeping in mind the jail decongestion guidelines laid down by the high-powered committee of the Delhi high court. The lawyer argued that Sharma was no longer required for custodial interrogation and therefore he ought to be granted bail. The investigating officer of the case, on the contrary, highlighted that the accused was involved in other cases and was a “habitual offender”. Meanwhile, another court of chief metropolitan magistrate Atul Krishna Agrawal refused to grant bail to a man, Rohit Srivastava, arrested in case of black-marketing of Remdesivir and other Covid-19 related resources. While the general public in Delhi is facing immense hardship, a few people have used this opportunity to make money by unfair means, the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-denied-to-man-held-for-selling-fake-o2-cylinders/articleshow/82986576.cms||Aamir Khan

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: No Covid trace in Khadra sewage||LUCKNOW: The Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) on Tuesday denied social media reports that traces of coronavirus were found in sewage water in Khadra locality of the city. According to reports, SGPGI was a part of an initiative by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) that aimed to find out the presence of coronavirus in sewage water in eight cities of the country including Lucknow, Hyderabad, Pune and Mumbai, among others. In an official statement, head of microbiology department, SGPGI, Prof Ujalla Ghoshal said the presence of SARS COV-2 RNA (ribonucleic acid) in sewage samples has “not been proven and require further studies”. Reports claimed samples were collected from three sites – Khadra, Ghantaghar and Machchli Mohaal – in the state capital on May 19 and the one from Khadra showed traces of pandemic virus. “Coronavirus spreads mainly through droplets of respiratory secretions of a positive patient and currently there is no evidence that it spreads through water. The virus has also been detected in stool samples of some patients but that presence was primarily a fragment of the virus,” she said. However, presence of coronavirus has been confirmed in sewage water in Hyderabad and Mumbai. This has raised questions like ‘whether it is a threat to public health or not’ or ‘if presence of coronavirus in sewage water can play a role on spreading infection in any way’. Experts are of the view that even if the virus is found in sewage water, the possibility of it being a public health issue is negligible unless proven otherwise. “Viruses have to be present in a certain quantity to be able to cause a disease in or through the host. This quality is measured in terms of cycle threshold value. As per rule, the lower the CT value, the higher are the chances of virus causing a disease and vice versa,” an expert said. “The average CT value of coronavirus from oral and nasal swab samples is around 15-18 whereas the CT value through stool samples of the same patients may range from 31-35. This means that even if the virus is present in the stool sample, it may not be potent enough to cause harm,” a microbiologist said. Informing that sewage water by itself is a cesspool of millions of microbes, including disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi, an expert in gastroenterological ailments said: “Even if coronavirus is found in sewage water, it is highly likely that it gets diluted in water to the extent that it either dies or remains present in an inactive state.” Studies, however, are still looking into the threat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-covid-trace-in-khadra-sewage/articleshow/82957314.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Hyderabad||Prices of essentials head north, burn deep holes in pockets||Hyderabad: It is not just fuel prices, even prices of edible oils, pulses and vegetables are giving jitters to citizens. In just a year, the retail prices of edible oils, including sunflower and palm oil, have shot up by 40% to 60%. For instance, according to the price monitoring cell of Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation, sunflower oil, which was Rs 98 per litre (packet) in May 2020, has now gone up to Rs 162, up nearly 66%. Similarly, palm oil price has gone up 40% compared to last year. Apart from oils, there has been 16% jump in red gram and Bengal gram prices and about 40% to 80% rise in prices of vegetables too. However, prices of some commodities like tamarind have dropped by 40% compared to last year, per kg rate was Rs 165 in May last, which now fell to Rs 100/per kg in the retail market. On the other hand, both super fine and fine rice rates have remained unaltered in the past one year. Officials attribute the steady rise in diesel rates to be a major reason for skyrocketing prices of essential commodities and vegetables in the past one year. The rise in fuel prices results in increased transportation charges, while other factors include labour charges and less cultivation of some crops. For instance, commercial crops such as sunflower, palm oil and ground nut oil cultivation was not matching with the demand. “The state government has been giving subsidies for palm oil growers and horticulture crops. But there is no significant jump in cultivation of those crops,” a deputy director of the agriculture department said. Civil supplies officials say shortage of agriculture labour and their wages was also leading to increase in prices of vegetables. “Generally, vegetable growers engage local labour for harvesting and other works. Due to Covid-19, lack of transportation facilities, the farmers are compelled to pay more for farm hands. Secondly, transportation charges almost doubled in the past one year,” an assistant director (price monitoring cell) of civil supplies department told TOI. He said the department has limited role in controlling prices. “The state government has been focussing and promoting only paddy cultivation. It should focus on other crops so that prices would be under control. Even at Rythu Bazars, the rates are high. There was no meeting held on price monitoring by either civil supplies or marketing department,” B Ezekiel, a resident of Malkajgiri, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prices-of-essentials-head-north-burn-deep-holes-in-pockets/articleshow/82955402.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||CMC to build spl Covid hosp for kids||Chandrapur: A special hospital for treatment of Covid-infected children is all set to come up in the city under municipal corporation. Former finance minister and MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar had been pushing for a separate Covid hospital for children in the light of impending third wave. Mungantiwar held an online meeting with collector and civic authorities over the issue and expressed concern over lack of special facility for treatment of Covid-infected children. He cited chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state-level action committee’s statements in this regard which cautioned all about the third wave hitting unvaccinated, particularly children, hard. “Hence, establishing a children’s Covid hospital is the need of hour,” he said. BJP-led Chandrapur Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken initiative to establish a fully-equipped Covid hospital for children following the insistence of Mungantiwar. The former finance minister said the proposed hospital would require Rs20 crore and suggested seeking funds from PM Cares, CM Care along with CSR funds from the WCL and other industries in Chandrapur. Mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar said the CMC has initiated the process for building the hospital and a formal proposal seeking land has been submitted to the collector. Two sites — one at the land adjoining Asara Covid Hospital of the corporation and other in Sarai Market have been suggested. “Once the land is sanctioned, the CMC would expeditiously take further action,” she said. Collector Ajay Gulhane said the proposal for allotment of land has been sent to land records department for scrutiny through the tehsildar and as soon the department clears it, express approval will be granted. Sources said the new hospital would have more than 100 beds. It would be a permanent facility for treatment of children under municipal corporation, but would be initially used for treatment of Covid-infected kids during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cmc-to-build-spl-covid-hosp-for-kids/articleshow/82955434.cms||Mazhar Ali

Bhavishi, who was attached with Belle Vue Clinic, had been on ECMO support at Medica Superspecialty Hospital for more than five weeks. “He was first being treated at our hospital. But since he needed ECMO support and our device remained occupied at that time, he was shifted to Medica. He was not only being a good doctor but also a good human being and a perfect gentleman,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon. Though the number of people needing hospital care has come down, especially among those getting infected after vaccination, the second wave has claimed at least 38 doctors in Bengal.

---||Chennai||PIL wants Covid awareness programmes on TV channels||Chennai: All satellite TV and radio channels must be asked to broadcast Covid-19 awareness programmes, vaccination and diet on daily basis in regional languages, a public interest writ petition filed in Madras high court has sought. Noting that news channels were repeatedly highlighting the adversity of Covid-19 infection, glossing the good news, the PIL-petitioner said: “Every day, the increasing death count is highlighted while the fact that a far greater number are recovering is mentioned in passing.” The petitioner, B Ramkumar Adityan, also claimed that such awareness programmes would help the government to tackle the situation in a better manner. In addition to these news are the adverse effects of complete lockdown. The longer the lockdown lasts, the greater will be the impact on psychological health, he said. “Apart from fear, anger and hope may drive our thoughts in ways that are unrealistic and unverifiable. The problem with isolation is that one has neither the resources nor the ability to check the truth of our own emotion driven thought processes,” he added. Therefore, it has become imperative for authorities to take a few measures to sustain people’s psyche and provide access to the pandemic-related information from authorised government portals made available to the general public – which shows correct information of the current scenario, the petitioner said. As a solution, the petitioner wanted the court to direct the Union to instruct the media to telecast awareness programmes on Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pil-wants-covid-awareness-programmes-on-tv-channels/articleshow/82955392.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Bhopal||250 children orphaned by pandemic in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: The pandemic has left at least 250 children as orphans in Madhya Pradesh, so far. Besides, another 1,200 have lost either their mother or father. These figures were known after the state government identified the kids orphaned by the pandemic to support them under a scheme announced by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. MP was one of first states to start identification of children orphaned by the pandemic after which the Mukhya Mantri Bal Kalyan Yojana was announced. Under the scheme the children who have lost both their parents will be provided a sustenance of Rs 5,000 per month till they attain the age of 21. If the child pursues his/her studies beyond the age of 21, the allowance would be provided till the age of 24. “As per preliminary work, we have mapped around 250 children and the work is still on. We had started work on identification of kids orphaned quite early,” director women and child development, Madhya Pradesh, Swati Meena told TOI. “The scheme is not limited to sanctioning funds, but is equally important in its implementation and follow up to ensure the well-being and interests of the children are safeguarded”, she added. Meena said, “We are going to initiate a community level dialogue for increasing awareness for the cause. Apart from it, the children who have lost single parent will also be covered under our sponsorship programme.” Joint director, women and child development department, Vishal Nadkarni said, “The legal guardian of the kids will be identified based on the provisions prescribed under the juvenile justice Act. First there will be home study report (HSR) and then social study report (SSR). Under HSR the home condition of the foster guardian is studied, like if any grandparent is alive but he/she is very elderly and is not in a condition to take care, then other relatives who are interested could also be considered, social study report is also important in the assessment.” “Even those children who are in child care institutions (CCI) and are being taken care of by the government will be eligible for the benefits after attaining the age of 18. And the scheme has no binding of having only two kids, as if there are more than two children of a parent and both parents have died, all are equally affected,” he said. Sources said that for the remaining1,200 children who have lost either mother or father to the pandemic, the government is planning to introduce private sponsorships. Under the scheme even private individuals or organisations will be able to sponsor a child by paying Rs 2,000 a month for the child. However, the scheme is yet to be fine-tuned. More importantly, the women and child development department is aiming at creating a level of awareness in community to encourage foster parents, for younger children, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/250-children-orphaned-by-pandemic-in-state/articleshow/82955424.cms||Amarjeet Singh

The state has decided to focus on infrastructure, essential equipment and medicines and manpower, he added. “At present the state has 120 paediatricians, inclusive of those working outside the government healthcare facilities. We have started talks with the Indian Paediatrics Association on how the government can utilise their services. If need be, that is if paediatric Covid patients are seen to be more in the third wave, then we are prepared to turn our existing Covid hospitals into paediatric ones. We have already started the process of procuring the medicines and equipment,” the chief minister said. Stating that a common SOP for government and private sector hospitals in coordination with AIIMS will be drawn up, Sawant said, “GMC’s paediatric department has already started carrying out training for all paediatric doctors and nurses in the government as well as private sector. We are also preparing counsellors to counsel parents, as it is important. We will be drawing counsellors already engaged with the education department, GSACS and the women and child department. We will also be training counsellors to counsel those who have lost their family members across age groups.” The state is also focusing on increasing monitoring of patients in home-isolation during the third wave. At present, a separate team of doctors is treating patients afflicted with black fungus in coordination with AIIMS, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-begins-preparation-for-third-wave-with-focus-on-young-ones/articleshow/82957388.cms||---

Now, out of 10,66,442 total cases reported in Vidarbha, 10,00,305 have already defeated Covid for a recovery rate of 93.7%. Increased recovery rate is a major indicator that the spread has significantly under control now. The recovery rate on May 1 was 81%.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Black fungus grips 13 more, lifesaving drug still missing||LUCKNOW: Even as another patient of black fungus infection or mucormycosis died on Tuesday and 13 more patients were admitted to various hospitals, for the second consecutive day, not a single patient out of the 40 admitted in private hospitals got the life saving drug Amphotericin B from Indian Red Cross Society-Lucknow (IRCS-L). Private hospitals have now even started refusing to take new cases saying there is no point in admitting patients and letting them die due to unavailability of Amphotericin B, the primary drug to treat the deadly infection. Though there is an adequate supply of the drug in government-aided hospitals, stocks have vanished from the open market following sudden rise in cases. Consequently, the health department had decided to make Amphotericin B available to people through IRCS-L. For this, attendants of patients in private hospitals have to get the prescription approved by the Lucknow divisional commissioner who gives consent after verifying the claim through an expert committee. This has added to the woes of the patients’ families because they have to first run from pillar to post to get the approval and then queue up at the IRCS-L office. Himanshu Mishra, whose father is battling for life in a private hospital on Shahmina Road, said, “Doctors say that without Amphotericin B injections my father’s life cannot be saved. It took me two days to get the approval and thereafter for the past three days, I have been coming daily to IRCS-L only to be sent back empty-handed”. IRCS-L chairperson Om Prakash Pathak said, “We are not able to provide the drug because there is no supply from the health department. We have informed health authorities about the crisis, but they have not responded.” Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “IRCS-L gets supply from UP Medical Supply Corporation, not my office.” The head of the corporation was not available for comments. Meanwhile, a 55-year-old man from Bihar died at KGMU taking the toll to 21. The man had contracted the infection as a post-Covid complication. Ten more patients were admitted to KGMU and three at RMLIMS, taking the tally in city hospitals to 206. Pvt hospitals might shift patients: Some private hospitals might refer mucormycosis patients admitted in their facilities to government institutes where Amphotericin B is available. President of All India Otolaryngologists’ Association, Lucknow, Dr Rakesh Srivastava said, “We took in a few patients hoping that the drug would be available soon, but now have started referring new patients to government facilities. Some patients are still hopeful about availability of the drug, hence don’t want to be shifted.” CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “Private hospitals can refer patients to government hospitals if they want after taking their consent. Government facilities have been told not to refuse any patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/black-fungus-grips-13-more-lifesaving-drug-still-missing/articleshow/82957348.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Coimbatore||Pace of Covid vaccination gains steam in Tamil Nadu||Even as complaints of vaccine shortage in some places continued, the pace of Covid vaccination appeared to pick pace across the state over the last two days. From 28,000-odd beneficiaries, the vaccination coverage tripled to 92,614 on Sunday which again grew at the same pace to cover 2.24 lakh people on Monday. The thrust of vaccination was clearly on those in the age group of 18 to 44 years going by the data of the health and family welfare department. Of the 2.24 lakh vaccinated on Monday, 1.89 lakh were in the bracket of 18 to 44 years. The coverage is expected to grow at a similar pace in the coming days too as several districts have intensified vaccination for those aged 18–44 years as well as improve focus on vaccination of those above 45 years. “We are not opening vaccines for everyone. It is being done in a phased manner as per priority. In the first phase, priority for vaccines is given to people with disabilities, auto drivers, those working for food aggregators such as Zomato and Swiggy,” health minister Ma Subramanian said. In Coimbatore, where several complaints of vaccine shortage poured in, 40,706 people in the 18 to 44 age group were administered the shots in the last four days, including the highest-ever of 12,842 on Tuesday. The district health authorities have distributed 14,200 vaccine doses to 88 primary health centres to be administered to people above 45 years from Wednesday. After the first day of the vaccination camp for high-risk people against Covid19 turned a damp squib due to the poor publicizing, the promotional measures initiated by the Trichy corporation on Tuesday yielded favourable results. Around 1,450 people belonging to the 18-44 age group employed in the high-risk sectors carrying out essential services were vaccinated. The civic body with adequate stocks in hand has planned to continue the drive for a week. In Madurai, however, officials said the vaccination drive did not turn out the way they wanted as only 1,300 came for getting vaccines on Tuesday. They expected more than 2,000 on day one. The camp held in K Pudur urban primary health centre alone inoculated more than 600 vaccines out of the 1,300. A health official from Madurai city however was confident of increasing coverage of people in the 18-44 years category from Wednesday onwards. “We are planning to inoculate 3,000 on Wednesday. The numbers will increase to 5,000 on Friday and on the weekends. We are mobilizing beneficiaries through their residents’ associations since it is the easiest way to reach out to people. Moreover, jabs will be provided to employees of TNSTC and railways will be sending teams to their work locations,” he said. Meanwhile, vaccination for 45 above category is being carried out throughout the city in all urban primary health centres. According to state health officials, nearly 92% of the vaccines supplied to the districts in the state were used. In districts such as Vellore, Erode, Ariyalur, Trichy, Coimbatore and Nilgiris, the vaccine usage against supply is above 95% while in Chennai it was 92%. Of the 19.9 lakh vaccines Chennai received, 18.3% has been used until Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pace-of-covid-vaccination-gains-steam-in-state/articleshow/82955477.cms||---

Police commissioner S N Shrivastava discussed an action plan with representatives from NSDC, Confederation of Indian Industries, Red Cross and other groups and expressed concerns regarding such families, which, he said, would need enhanced social support to develop skills to earn a livelihood. The initiative is part of Delhi Police’s Project Yuva, which aims to engage and steer streetchildren and youths towards the mainstream of the society while providing them with opportunities to realise their potential through skill development training. “Delhi Police has been operating 23 Yuva skill centres at its police stations in which more than 20,000 youths have been empowered through professional training in a number of traits,” Shrivastava said. “Initiative by #DelhiPolice calling on-board @NSDCINDIA @RedcrossIndian @FollowCII healthcare and training partners &NGOs for action plan to create trained, certified Covid health workers from #YUVA trainees. @CPDelhi laid down agenda to augment capacity for future,” Delhi Police tweeted. According to special commissioner Devesh Chandra Srivastava, North district has already launched the programme and rolled out its first batch of 55 trainees. “All details of the trainees are being shared with CII for placement,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-police-to-help-create-a-pool-of-covid-relief-workers/articleshow/82955524.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Assault claim by Khar murder suspect opposed||Mumbai: Contradicting Shree Jogdhankar’s claim that he too was attacked on the same night he was accused of killing his friend Jhanvi Kukreja (19) at a New Year bash in Khar, the prosecution questioned why he had told the doctor treating his injuries that he had suffered a fall. Opposing the 22-year-old student’s bail plea, the prosecution said no person who was attacked would stay silent about his attackers. The prosecution alleged that instead of focusing on studies, Jogdhankar was involved in drugs and had committed such a heinous crime. It added that since he was known to most of the witnesses, he may pressure or threaten them. In his bail plea, submitted through advocate Mahesh Vaswani, Jogdhankar claimed that he too was attacked on the staircase where he was sitting with Kukreja and he left to save himself. He said he could not, however, remember his att-ackers as he was under the influence of alcohol. The prosecution replied that Jogdhankar and co-accused Diya Padalkar’s (18) obscene behaviour had caused Kukreja anguish and due to her objections, they killed her. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-assault-claim-by-khar-murder-suspect-opposed/articleshow/82957407.cms||---

City-based organisation ‘Help Hyderabad’ launched the service free of cost to help elderly and specially-challenged Covid-19 patients who cannot visit hospitals and are living alone. The organisation, along with setting up a free quarantine centre, has been ensuring that elderly patients are able to reach out to them for help. “We used to get several requests from children of these parents living in foreign countries like US, Ireland, UK and Gulf to help their elderly parents who tested positive for Covid-19. However, our main aim is to help the elderly and others who are unable to go to hospitals or afford treatment at healthcare centers,” said Saba Qadri, secretary of the organisation. During the home care visits, the team of doctors and nurses check the patient’s vitals, monitor them regularly and prescribe them medicines based on their medical condition. “We were able to arrange breakfast also but our focus is mostly healthcare,” she Qadri. The organisation has a big team of doctors and four vehicles. The quarantine centre set up in a private school also has treatment facility for Covid-19 patients but does not have an ICU. If needed we shift the patients to the facility. We are constantly looking out for poor people who are disabled or when the entire family is infected,” she said. Qadri said that many Covid-19 patients are reluctant to visit hospitals as they fear the huge bills. “We wanted to begin the service during the first wave but could not as the medical community opened up to the idea only recently,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-ensure-covid-care-at-home-for-elderly-disabled/articleshow/82955447.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Trichy||Congress leader converts car into ambulance in Tamil Nadu||TRICHY: Booking a 108 ambulance in a village is no easy task while hiring a private ambulance will cost you a bomb. Realising these twin challenges at a time when the coronavirus is playing havoc with people’s lives, K Mahendran, a Congress general secretary, has converted his car into an ambulance to ferry patients to hospital. “My plan was to buy an ambulance so that people could use it in an emergency. But I chose to convert my car for the time being as an ambulance van would cost a minimum of 5 lakh,” says Mahendran. A native of Pattukottai in Thanjavur district, the 44-year-old has made changes to his SUV to accommodate an oxygen cylinder. What spurred Mahendran to do his bit was the non-availability of 108 ambulance service in remote towns like Pattukottai in recent days due to the overwhelming number of Covid-19 cases. “While private ambulances and taxis are another option, they are charging heavily for their services these days,” says he. Hailing from Thamarankottai village, 10 km from Pattukottai, he was moved by the death of a 60-year-old woman in the village due to non-Covid complications on Sunday. The family could not arrange a vehicle to take her to hospital as no one was willing to come. “Jipmer in Puducherry is about 180km from Pattukottai. Another family from the village had to spend 15,000 to take a Covid-19 patient to the hospital a few days ago,” he adds. Mahendran says anyone within a 30 km radius of the village can avail the car ambulance free of cost to reach hospital on time. L R Muthu, 28, a volunteer from the village, has come forward to drive the car for those in need. “We have arranged a separate room for Muthu to stay as he would travel with Covid-19 patients,” Mahendran said adding that the PPE kit for Muthu costs more than the petrol for the vehicle. Mahendran had discussed his plan with Velachery Congress MLA J M H Hassan, his friend, who has now arranged for two private travel vehicles to be used for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/congress-leader-converts-car-into-ambulance/articleshow/82955466.cms||Sampath Kumar

The amount was recently transferred to GACL’s bank account after the cybercrime cops investigated the online fraud and even reached out to the German police.According to the police, the GACL was defrauded by the hackers of International Organized Crime circle in March this year. “GACL sends raw material to the National Aluminium Company Ltd (NACL) at the Vishakhapatnam port. GACL has hired a firm to transport the raw material and both the companies deal with each other through emails,” the police said.The hackers intercepted the emails and monitored the regular dealings between GACL and the transport firm. The accused then changed the invoice number and bank account number in one of the emails and sent it GACL. The accused gave an account of Targo Bank that is located in Germany. The money that GACL was to pay to the transport firm was sent to the German bank and siphoned following which the company approached the police.The cybercrime sleuths tracked the email and investigations led them to the German bank. The company and the police then approached the legal authorities in Germany along with the cops there. After a joint operation, the German bank transferred the money back to GACL.

The number of samples tested, however, doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of people tested as a single person may have been tested several times, said experts. Multiple factors must be considered while arriving at the percentage of the population tested, said Dr N G Rajesh, professor of pathology at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer). “We cannot go by the number of samples tested alone. A person might have undergone several tests without any symptoms. People who need to travel have taken the test as it is mandatory. There may be still a major chunk of population in the interior pockets who have not been tested even once.” On Tuesday, the territory reported 1,237 fresh as 1,571 patients recovered bringing down the active cases to 15,475. Of them, 13,591 are under home isolation. Twenty-six patients died taking the death toll to 1,408. The territory has so far reported 98,219 cases of which 81,336 patients recovered. So far, 2.5 lakh people have been vaccinated (including the second dose). The population of the territory, which was 12.5 lakh as per 2011 census, is projected to grow to more than 14 lakh in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/26-deaths-1237-cases-in-pondy/articleshow/82955499.cms||Bosco Dominique

Hikes in fuel prices have only aggravated their woes, the union stated.According to the union’s president Shailendra Mishra, since March 2020, the restrictions have been imposed for trade, occupations or businesses. “We are the worst-affected on many counts. Since the strict curbs were announced, migrants including drivers and cleaners went back to their respective villages which created a workforce shortage,” union’s treasurer Sudhir Kapse said.“Most of them did not return and we could not effectively carry out our business. Even from the current scenario, it appears that it would take another six to eight months for the business to come back to normalcy,” he said.“All of us are aware about the extreme severity of Covid’s second wave and almost every second person among our families was infected. Consequently, it led to heavy medical expenses which caused additional financial distress at a time when the business was down,” said vice-president Nagorao Wagh.Mishra claimed that some countries like Nepal, Bhutan etc have taken the decision with respect to interest waiver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-hit-transporters-want-waiver-of-interest-on-loan/articleshow/82955519.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath reviews 18 divisions in 25 days post Covid recovery||LUCKNOW: In the past 25 days, chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited all 18 divisions in the state, reviewing the Covid-19 management in 40 out of 75 districts. On Tuesday, he completed his visits with a stopover at Gorakhpur from where he will visit districts that were impacted by encephalitis and could provide a roadmap for preventing Covid-19 in children. A government spokesperson said the CM embarked on these visits as soon as he recovered from Covid. “The CM tested positive for Covid-19 on April 14. He was in home quarantine till April 30. During this time, he held regular meetings with officers and held virtual interactions with experts. As soon as he tested negative, he went to inaugurate the temporary Covid hospital at Awadh Shilp Gram, built by DRDO, in Lucknow,” the spokesperson said. During his divisional reviews, CM praised the efforts of health workers, police officials, ASHAs, anganwadi workers and encouraged them to continue working for the welfare of people, said the spokesperson. He added that the CM also conducted surprise checks of the Integrated Command and Control Centres to take stock of the situation. In the middle of this, he met monitoring committees and interacted with people in containment zones. “The CM pushed for an adherence to the trace, test and treat formula to prevent the spread of Covid-19. He not only visited districts and took a ground report from officials but also visited hospitals and interacted with patients. He also visited villages to interact with residents and also met people in home isolation. He reviewed the distribution of medicine kits to people in home isolation and also inspected the arrangements being made for the third wave,” the spokesperson said. Over Wednesday and Thursday, the CM is slated to visit Deoria, Basti, Kushinagar and Sidharthnagar districts. The selection of these districts, said the spokesperson, is crucial in light of the third wave of the pandemic. “With continuous efforts, the CM has managed to halt the spread of encephalitis in these districts. The policy used for this will become a role model in preventing the spread of Covid among children, as is being expected in the third wave,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-reviews-18-divisions-in-25-days-post-covid-recovery/articleshow/82957433.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nautical advisor to probe cause of barge tragedy, check if SOPs flouted||Mumbai: The Director General of Shipping has appointed a nautical advisor to carry out a ‘marine casualty investigation’ and recreate using a simulator the incident that led to the capsizing and sinking of barge Papaa (P-305) on May 17 in the wake of cyclone Tauktae. The barge had 261 personnel on board; while 75 died, 186 were rescued in search and rescue (SAR) operations carried out by Navy warships around 70 km off Mumbai. The nautical advisor will lead a team of six-seven people who will look at various angles to find out the cause of the mishap and whether standard operating procedures (SOP) were violated despite weather warnings issued from May 11. Meanwhile, the Yellow Gate police probing the case of negligence filed against barge captain Rakesh Ballav have so far collected blood samples of four relatives for DNA tests to find out if there is a match with some of the bodies. Two more bodies were identified by relatives at the JJ hospital mortuary on Tuesday. “So far, 71 bodies have been found, while 52 have been identified and handed over to families. 19 bodies are still unidentified,” said Yellow Gate senior inspector Suhas Hemade. An official said the nautical advisor would be required to conduct a preliminary inquiry “in order to establish details of the voyage leading to the casualty and the causes including acts of incompetence, negligence or misconduct of the person/persons concerned.” The advisor can summon people for statements and demand production of all logbooks, documents or papers considered necessary for the inquiry, the official added. A source from DG Shipping told TOI, “The nautical advisor will use simulators on the computer to recreate the mishap so it can be determined if the barge had the capacity to withstand the gusty cyclonic winds while at anchorage.” The probe team formed earlier, comprising the DG Shipping, DG Hydrocarbons and defence ministry officials will gather information that could be used to prevent future accidents. An investigation may also assist in determining what changes might be desirable in the present regulations. The Directorate promulgates the ‘lessons learnt’ from such investigations through its website. Also, action will be initiated against those found violating SOPs, officials said. Police said they were also probing the sinking of Varaprada. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on Tuesday demanded a detailed probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nautical-advisor-to-probe-cause-of-barge-tragedy-check-if-sops-flouted/articleshow/82957483.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh high court expresses concern over mucormycosis cases||BHOPAL: A division bench of the Madhya Pradesh high court headed by the Chief Justice has expressed concern over increasing cases of ‘black’ and ‘white fungus’ in the state and grossly inadequate quota of medicines available for its treatment. The division bench of Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Atul Sreedharan, while observing that medicines available for treatment of the disease in the state are grossly inadequate, asked the state government to file a detailed response on the issue and preparations it has made to tackle the third wave of corona in the event it hits the state. The court also asked the state government to file a reply on the issue of coronavirus vaccination as well while placing the bunch of petitions related to coronavirus for next hearing on May 31. During hearing of the petitions, the court was apprised that the quota of medicines provided by the Centre to the state for treatment of ‘black fungus’ are insufficient following which the judges, while expressing deep concern over the situation, asked the Centre and the state government to file a reply on their preparedness to tackle the disease, which has now been declared an epidemic and the steps being taken to make all the necessary medicines required for treatment of the disease. The court further asked the state government to file a reply on its vaccination strategy, whether it is going to float a global tender to obtain enough vaccines and how it proposes to provide enough vaccines for the vaccination process to proceed smoothly. The court's directive came after it was informed that this month the number of vaccines available with the state government was less than the requirement. The court also ordered the constitution of a committee to decide on the rate list for Covid-19 patients by private hospitals. A petition raising queries on Ayshman Bharat scheme for free treatment of corona patients was disposed of by the court after counsel for the state government informed it that the government would also bear the cost of medicines of the patients in addition to free treatment following admission in a hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/hc-expresses-concern-over-mucormycosis-cases-in-mp/articleshow/82953329.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Many mucormycosis care hubs yet to get cost-free supply of key drugs||PUNE: Some of the private hospitals empanelled under the state government’s health scheme have not yet started getting the key anti-mucormycosis drugs for free for patients undergoing treatment at their facilities. Officials attached to the scheme said the designated care hubs should raise the request for free medicines with the district civil surgeon. Currently, 10 hospitals in Pune district have been designated as mucormycosis care hubs for cost-free treatment. More facilities are likely to be roped in under the scheme shortly. The state decided to allow free treatment, including the drug expenses, of mucormycosis — mainly a post-Covid fungal complication — under its Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY), the state-sponsored health scheme- last week. Every patient needs at least six to eight vials of liposomal amphotericin B every day and the cost of the same runs from Rs25,000 to Rs35,000 daily. Jitendra Oswal, the deputy medical director of Bharati hospital — one of the designated facilities for free treatment of mucormycosis in Pune, said, “We are not getting the key drugs like liposomal amphotericin B and other oral tablets for free. The district collector office allots us some vials. We have to pay the purchase charges to the distributor.” Amol Maske, the region head of the MPJAY scheme, said, “The 10 designated mucormycosis hospital under the MPJAY have to raise the medicine request with the district civil surgeon to get the drugs free of cost for the patients. The stock with the district collector is mainly allotted to those hospitals treating patients with mucormycosis but are not yet included under the scheme.” The 10 designated facilities in the district for availing the free treatment of mucormycosis are Symbiosis Medical College and Hospital (Lavale), Navale Medical College and Hospital, Bharati Medical College and Hospital, D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital, Surya-Sahyadri Hospital, Lokmanaya Hospital, Giriraj Hospital (Baramati), B J Medical College and Sassoon Hospital, Aundh District Hospital and YCM Hospital. “We shall soon rope in more hospitals under the scheme and extend the benefit of free drugs to more patients,” Maske said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-mucormycosis-care-hubs-yet-to-get-cost-free-supply-of-key-drugs/articleshow/82955549.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||Goa: Panchayats not doing enough on jab drive, say Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Hitting out at panchayats for “only harping on lockdowns”, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the local self-governing bodies are not coming forward to take up the challenge for vaccinating maximum persons in the age group of 45 and above in the villages. “It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that all family members, even their maids, in this age group are inoculated. Some have already started harping on lockdown again. But not a single panchayat has been able to achieve 100% vaccination in the above 45 age group yet. They could have worked towards it and proudly declared it. It is easy to declare a lockdown in the village. I would have appreciated if they had achieved the vaccination target. We may have even rewarded them,” said Sawant. It may be recalled that many panchayats declared lockdowns on their own late last month and early this month as Covid cases were on the rise. Villages were of the view that there has been a delay on the part of the state government to declare a lockdown. “Only the deputy collector and health officer in Canacona have done a very good job and achieved 75% vaccination. I congratulate them. They have meticulously maintained the record too. We still have 2.8 lakh doses available for 45 and above age group. All panchayats should come forward to achieve 100% vaccination in the group. Let them accept my challenge,” said Sawant. Around 45% persons in the 45 and above age group are yet to receive their jabs, he said. “Maybe around 10% of them are bedridden and cannot come out. But at least 30-35% persons should walk in and take the dose. The panchs, sarpanches and MLAs should take the initiative and see that this target is achieved. MLAs are only announcing in some areas that they have started Covid care centres, but they have not commenced anything on the ground. Only government Covid care centres are operating as of now,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayats-not-doing-enough-on-jab-drive-sawant/articleshow/82957496.cms||---

Identified as Vijeta Trivedi, the Mahila Congress president of Dhar district, she was trying to enter the CM House with bangles hanging from a clothes hanger. Vijeta was stopped by police much ahead of the entrance of the CM House, where she jostled with the women police officers. She said that she came to Bhopal to protest against the registration of FIR against former chief minister and PCC chief Kamal Nath. The woman argued that she wanted to meet CM Chouhan and gift him the bangles because “he had failed to control the Covid situation in Madhya Pradesh”. When the police officers were about to arrest her, she shouted and said cops were not keeping a safe distance and breaking Covid protocol. The Dhar Mahila Congress president was not accompanied by any other Congress workers. State Mahila Congress president Mandvi Chouhan died due to coronavirus complications last month and her post is still lying vacant. The state unit is looking for a suitable candidate to fill the vacant post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mahila-cong-neta-attempts-to-intrude-into-cm-house-held/articleshow/82953348.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Care centres should handle patients carefully: Officials||Coimbatore: In the wake of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, private sector players are setting up a growing number of makeshift hospitals and Covid care centres in the district to reduce the burden on hospitals. Most of them promise a capacity of 300-odd beds each and some even come with oxygen facilities. The health department feels such facilities should monitor the patients very closely this time since a growing number of patients require oxygen support and crash into a cytokine storm suddenly.Triplicane MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin has inspected the 200-bed Covid care centre being set up at the Government Arts College by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai). “All 200 beds will be equipped with oxygen facility. Patients will be able to access around five litres per minute,” said Rajiv Ramasamy, Credai secretary. “Doctors and nurses for the centre will be provided by the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. This is in line with the district collector’s request that the centre should mirror a hospital set up.”CRI Trust had last week announced a 100-bed makeshift hospital with oxygen facilities.Seva Bharathi Trust is, meanwhile, opening an isolation ward for Covid-19 patients with only influenza-like symptoms at Kongunadu Arts College, where they would be handled by two doctors, four nurses and 20 volunteers. “While we don’t have oxygen facilities in the centre, we have parked outside an oxygen bus, in which at least 12 patients could be provided oxygen for six hours in emergency cases. It will support them till they find a hospital bed,” said Prakash, one of the volunteers. The oxygen bus is sponsored by KGISL and other industrial organizations.Sharadha Terry Products and Kadri Mills have also opened a Covid care centre with more than 300 beds. The centre will provide free accommodation, food and medical care. “Our aim is to free up space in government hospitals, prevent spread from discharged patients and create awareness on post-discharge quarantine,” they said in a statement.Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “Covid care centre beds are crucial now, because this will help us reduce home isolation cases, which will in turn help reduce family clusters.”Officials say the Covid care centres should be careful in handling the patients. “While it is good to have a space for patients to isolate from their families, medical care is extremely important. They have to monitor patients’ saturation, number of days with fever and other symptoms to detect if their condition is getting worse. Blood tests and chest X-rays must be done, steroids should be prescribed if required, and blood sugar levels should be managed by doctors who are deployed there,” said a health department official. “If they follow all these procedures, we can prevent a patient from becoming severely sick.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/care-centres-should-handle-patients-carefully-officials/articleshow/82955605.cms||---
---||Delhi||No bail for Covid resource hoarder||New Delhi: It is not out of place to state that the general public in Delhi is facing immense hardship, both physical and mental, in securing medical equipment for themselves and their near and dear ones as a high number of people have got infected with Covid-19 during the second wave, said a court while dismissing the bail plea of a man arrested for allegedly hoarding and black marketing a large number of Covid-related equipment. “Accused claims to be a bonafide seller of medical articles/goods recovered from his possession but has failed to show any document that he had been lawfully purchasing and selling those articles. He has also failed to disclose the source of his purchase,” said chief metropolitan magistrate Atul Krishna Agrawal. According to police, the complainant in the case got in touch with Anand Gupta for an oximeter and reportedly bought one for Rs 6,000 though the price range was between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,500. After an FIR was registered following the complaint, a police party raided Gupta’s house and found 1,000 N95 and surgical masks each, 56 vaporiser-cum-inhalers, 655 digital thermometers, 100 oxygen masks, 150 pulse oximeters, four sanitisers, 30 nano-meter spray bottles and three coating machines along with 300 oximeter packing covers bearing a price tag of Rs 3,999. Gupta, it was alleged, could not show any permission or licence for storing the medical equipment following which police seized the goods and arrested him. The counsel appearing for the accused argued that his client had been in judicial custody for about 15 days and claimed most of these items were readily available in medical shops or general stores as well as on online portals. Two invoices regarding purchase of digital thermometers, vaporisers and oximeters were placed on record along with the bail application. The counsel claimed the items were not notified under Essential Commodities Act and the oximeter sold to the complainant had not been recovered by police. The public prosecutor contested that Gupta was involved in black marketing and hoarding of essential medical equipment in a pandemic situation. He also highlighted that the pulse oximeters had been notified under Essential Commodities Act on June 29, 2020 in a Union chemical and fertilizer ministry’s office memorandum. Opining that the allegations were “quite serious”, the court said a couple of invoices filed by Gupta were in the name of a company that appeared to have been engaged in the technical field, not medical arena. “The accused fails to show his connection with the said company... The pulse oximeters allegedly recovered from the accused are duly notified under the Essential Commodities Act...” the order stated. “Recovery of oximeter packing cover with inflated price of Rs 3, 999 shows that the accused intended to sell them at a much higher price than the actual MRP,” it underlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-covid-resource-hoarder/articleshow/82955606.cms||Aamir Khan

Members of a family, who recently came to Aurangabad from Jharkhand, said they were surprised to see absence of staff at different railway stations to check the RT-PCR test reports. “We first reached Manmad junction and later Aurangabad railway station, but nobody asked for the RT-PCR test reports that we were carrying as a precautionary measure,” one of the family members said. When contacted, authorities at South Central Railway (SCR) said respective local authorities were responsible for ensuring necessary compliance. “The railway staff ensures Covid appropriate behaviour among passengers on-board and on railway premises. However, checking of RT-PCR negative reports is the state’s order which is followed by the local authorities,” SCR public relations officer for Nanded division Rajesh Shinde said. As per official order, passengers coming to Maharashtra from other states must carry RT-PCR negative certificate that has been issued minimum 48 hours before entering the state. The restriction has been made applicable for people arriving from places of sensitive origins like Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and NCR region, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh as per the orders dated April 18 and May 1 and will be applicable to anyone arriving from any part of the country in to the State. When contacted, in-charge of the civic squad of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Pramod Jadhav said checking of RT-PCR negative reports would be ensured at railway station. “The ground-level staff have been asked to follow the order in question in letter and spirit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-checking-of-rt-pcr-reports-at-railway-stations/articleshow/82951354.cms||---

Temporary staff were roped in for a period of three months on a monthly honorary stipend of Rs20,000. “Temporary medical staff, paramedical staff and nursing staff recruited during the corona pandemic in Madhya Pradesh have all gone on indefinite strike in the state,” Nath tweeted on Tuesday. “During the corona pandemic, when the common man and government needed the service of these medical workers the most, then they put their lives at risk and served the people and the state,” Nath said. Nath said, “These corona warriors remained on the field and toiled for a year for Covid control, from sample collection to serving in the Covid care centres. They should be encouraged by the government.

Mohini works at the British deputy high commission in Chandigarh as a consular officer. This honour is conferred by the Queen in recognition of Mohini’s services to British people during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the UK government organised 66 special chartered flights, running from April 8 to June 5, which brought back nearly 18,000 passengers from 32 locations across India to the UK.

The number is expected to rise as the process of compilation of data is still on. Aurangabad district women and child development officer Harsha Deshmukh on Tuesday said the data is being compiled by the taskforce with help from different government authorities. “Different self-governing bodies and state-run and private hospitals have been contacted to trace such children. The database will be submitted to the state government for necessary action,” she said. Deshmukh said the state government is expected to declare relief and rehabilitation measures for such children. “There is a need to offer immediate relief to these children and chalk out welfare measures for their rehabilitation. To begin with, the government has reached out to these children through the taskforce and is expected to declare a slew of measures for them,” she said. The district administration has also set up helpline numbers 1098, 7400015518, 8308992222, 9370003517 for Covid-hit children. Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, the founder of Dnyana Devi Pune ChildLine, said the taskforce should join hands with NGOs. “These children are facing a high degree of trauma. The government has to deal with such children case-by-case with help of NGOs in order to ensure their emotional well being and protection of different rights,” she said, adding that the taskforce's future road map must be announced at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-orphans-12-children-in-aurangabad-231-lost-one-parent/articleshow/82951392.cms||Prasad Joshi

He described it as ‘a mockery of democracy’. He said while the widespread miseries caused by the pandemic on individuals and their incomes is taking its toll on the people, BJP seems only concerned about selfish politics and publicity based on falsehood. “BJP is more focussed on how to gain power rather than trying to address the miseries of the people,” he said. The people of UP, however, seem to have made up their mind for the 2022 assembly polls this time in advance, he said. He demanded that all the students should be vaccinated before planning the schedule of the Classes 10 and 12 board examinations. “People are dying due to mismanagement in every corner of UP and it is shocking that BJP’s state leadership is participating in a meeting chaired by the PM to give shape to election strategies for the next assembly elections in UP,” SP chief said, adding: “This is nothing short of making a mockery of the democratic system in a democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-poll-strategy-not-covid-is-bjp-priority/articleshow/82957495.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

After questioning, cops released the woman, a post-graduate in arts, on bail. According to the police, the couple was married for five years but had developed severe dispute for the past three years and were living separately. To harass her husband, the woman took the route of social media, police said. The 30-year-old textile businessman lodged the complaint with the cyber-crime police on May 22. Police had booked unidentified persons for defamation and other charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act. However, during investigation, the role of the woman was found. Probe revealed that she had created multiple Instagram accounts using her mobile phone. “Her husband had doubts on her as his private photos were available only with his wife. But he was not sure. Only during investigation we found that she had shared the images on social media out of anger,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/woman-held-for-sharing-estranged-husbands-indecent-pics-on-instagram/articleshow/82953360.cms||---

While 1,11,480 of the 1,46,805 people, who have tested positive for the virus in the district till date, have recovered from the viral infection, there are 34,353 active cases that are in home quarantine or medical care. Presently, the recovery rate stands at 75.9%. The day also saw the district registering 24 Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 1,072. Among the victims were two men aged below 30 years - a 29-year-old man who died four days after hospitalization and a 27-year-old man with bronchial asthma who breathed his last 11 days after getting admitted to a hospital. Another two were in their early 40s - a 42-year-old woman with morbid obesity who died eight days after hospitalization and a 40-year-old man who died in Tirupur government hospital three days after admission. The vaccination programme for the population aged 45 years and above has, meanwhile, resumed after the district received 15,000 doses of Covishield, of which 14,200 doses were distributed among the 88 primary health centres. Each centre has received 100-200 doses each. The vaccination drive will begin at 9am. Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “People who have been infected earlier can get inoculated 84 days after recovery and those who have taken the first dose can get the second dose after a gap of 84 days. People must bring their Aadhaar card and another id proof to get the shot.” The district administration reiterated that private hospitals must stick to the tariff fixed by the government and not to overcharge the Covid patients. The hospitals could get the patient’s bills reimbursed through the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme that has now tied up with 57 private hospitals. The cap is fixed at Rs 27,500 to Rs 30,000 per day for high-flow oxygen bed and Rs 32,000 to Rs 35,000 a day for non-invasive ventilation. The neighbouring Tirupur, meanwhile, logged 1,854 cases of Covid-19. The district tops the state with the highest test positivity rate of 32.8% during May 17-24 period, followed by Coimbatore (30.2%). However, both the districts are struggling to test more contacts of primary cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/phcs-get-14200-doses-of-covishield/articleshow/82955637.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Big push to 18+ vaccination drive with 10 lakh/week target||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to give a big push to vaccination in the age group of 18-44 years in June to minimize the spread of coronavirus in the third wave of pandemic. Sources in the state task force on Covid-19 vaccination have revealed that the state government has decided to undertake over 10 lakh vaccinations per week in the age group from next month. CM Yogi Adityanath has already announced the launch of vaccination for the young population across all 75 districts of the state. “The extent of suffering due to Covid-19 during the anticipated third wave will depend on the public response to the pandemic. Two key behaviours – adherence to prevention protocol and vaccination – will drive the containment strategy. The government has decided to act strongly on both the counts,” an expert, associated with the task force, said. To boost vaccination, the government will also hold dedicated camps for various categories like state employees, teachers, traders associations and community groups. To increase vaccination in rural areas, the state government has decided to take the help of Jan Suvidha Kendras to facilitate registration for people in the age group of 18-44 years. Health department officials said the government has a good stock of vaccine and is likely to get an additional 48 lakh doses by the end of May. The government has also floated a global tender for the procurement of four crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine which it is likely to receive soon. Meanwhile, at least 1,68,16,346 doses of vaccine have been given in UP. Of the total 1,34,33,811 recipients, 33,79,755 have been fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/big-push-to-18-vax-drive-with-10l/week-target/articleshow/82957520.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Chandigarh||All 26 Chandigarh municipal corporation contact tracing teams to carry on duties||Chandigarh: The number of cases of coronavirus has started decreasing in the past few days, but the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) will not reduce the number of contact tracing teams and all the 26 teams will remain functional. Since, all these teams have been divided for different areas of the city and maximum teams are working in the southern part of the city. Sources in the civic body said they will assess the situation for another week and only after that a decision will be taken by the senior officers of the MC. “It takes a huge mental exercise and time to form contact tracing teams and thus any decision to reduce these teams needs to be taken after keeping all the parameters in mind,” said an official. According to information, when the number of cases declined after the first wave of Covid-19, the contact tracing teams were reduced from nine to three. Thereafter, with rise in the cases, teams were again increased from three to nine, and from nine to 18 and finally from 18 to 26. “As cases started increasing, teams were doubled to 18. But now, a total of 26 teams are there. We have been keeping monitoring the situation and based on this, decisions will be taken,” said sources. The MC has been closely working with the health department and based on their report, they have been conducting contact tracing and other related exercise. Significantly, unlike last year, now all the departments of the civic body authority are fully operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-26-mc-contact-tracing-teams-to-carry-on-duties/articleshow/82953372.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Power firms prepare for worst, hope for best in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Private power utility CESC and state utility WBSEDCL have together deployed 1,500 technicians and labourers in Kolkata, Salt Lake and New Town to take up restoration work if winds generated by cyclone Yaas uproot trees and disrupt overhead power lines. But it will be civic teams from Kolkata and Bidhannagar along with Disaster Management Group (DMG) of Kolkata Police and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) entrusted with removing uprooted trees and snapped branches on power lines. “The cyclone shifting away from Kolkata may reduce the wind speed but at 60-70kmph, it is still potent enough to topple trees and disrupt overhead power lines along Kasba and Patuli connectors, NSC Bose Road, Behala, Thakurpukur, Lake Town, Bangur and Salt Lake. Around 150 teams of CESC and 64 of WBPDCL are in position to ensure there is no delay in repairs. But they will be able to work only when trees are removed,” a power department official said. While 80% of Kolkata has underground power cables and is unlikely to be affected by the storm, overhead lines remain vulnerable. During Amphan, prolonged delay in removal of trees had led to outages in vast localities for days with some places without power for up to 10 days. Both CESC and WBSEDCL will switch off power when wind velocity increases, both to prevent deaths from electrocution and to save the networks from further damage. Across the city, civic teams along with CESC have already pruned trees to remove weak branches. “Unlike last year when we had manpower issues, we have adequate teams in place. Also, there is adequate stock of materials, including cables, wires, poles and transformers,” a CESC official said. In addition to Bidhannnagar, 150 WBSEDCL teams will be deployed in East Midnapore that is forecast to take the worst hit in the state. “Six teams will be deployed in each of the 25 blocks in the district. In all, 1,050 people will be there to start restoration work after the storm abates,” a WBSEDCL official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/power-firms-prepare-for-worst-hope-for-best/articleshow/82953373.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Within two days of getting a job offer, there is so much controversy. All this is because the minister belongs to our family,” Dwivedi told local media persons on Tuesday. Speaking on EWS certificate, Dwivedi said, “We come from the family of farmers. EWS certificate is like an income certificate and is not permanent. It is made according to government rules. It was issued to me because I fulfilled the criteria.” “When I applied for the post of teacher in Siddharth University and Gorakhpur University in 2016, nobody knew that my brother would become an MLA or a minister. Both of us were struggling but no one would see that side of the story. I am struggling even now due to this controversy,” he said. Dwivedi said he worked as a research fellow in DRDO for three years and then as an assistant professor on contract basis for six months. “I then went to Banasthali Vidyapeeth (BV) in Rajasthan. There too, my job was temporary. I resigned from BV in July 2020 and returned to my village,” he said. Dwivedi said it was an honour for his family that his brother was a minister. “But he does not bear the expenses of my family. In future too, he will not be responsible for my livelihood. The controversy has come only because I am his brother,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ews-certificate-issued-as-per-rules-mins-bro/articleshow/82957548.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Heavy rain, high tide may sink large parts of city||Kolkata: If the high velocity wind had wreaked havoc in Kolkata a year ago when cyclone Amphan smashed into the city, it is heavy rain brought by cyclone Yaas, coupled with year's highest tide Sarasari Baan, that threaten to inundate large parts of Kolkata. While the heavy rain forecast is expected to be much more than the maximum 10mm per hour that the city's drainage system can tackle, the timing of the Sarasari Baan on Buddha Purnima means that for several hours, the drainage pumping stations will be unable to pump out water into the Hooghly on high tide. “Large parts of north, central and south Kolkata are likely to be inundated till the lock gates along the Hooghly can be opened to drain out the storm water,” a civic drainage department official said. Though the civic body has adopted several measures to combat severe waterlogging in view of the heavy to very heavy rainfall that the cyclone may bring with it on Wednesday, none of these measures will be effective till the tide turns. On Tuesday, the high tide set in at 12.43pm with the maximum tide surge of 16.7ft. Consequently, the lock gates were shut from 11am to 3pm. With KMC and irrigation department set to keep the gates shut from 11.30am to 4pm on Wednesday, roughly the same time when heavy rain is predicted to lash Kolkata, flooding is inevitable. “On Wednesday, the maximum tide surge will be 17.3ft, which is 3-4ft above the normal height of a tide. As a precautionary measure, we will shut the lock gates for four-and-a-half hours to prevent water from reverse flow into the city. If it pours during this period, inundation is inevitable. We will have no option but wait for the tide to subside to then start the heavy-duty pumps to drain out storm water,” the official said. Operating the pumps when the lock gates are shut will trigger a backflow and render the pumps defunct. A KMC drainage department official posted in a central Kolkata office said he was particularly worried over inundation of large areas of Rabindra Sarani (Chitpore), Bagbazar, Burrabazar, Netaji Subhas Road, Strand Road, BBD Bag, Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Chetla, Alipore, Kidderpore and NSC Bose Road (Tollygunge), among others, because of their proximity to either the Hooghly or the Tolly’s Nullah. With the electrocution of a youth in a waterlogged BBD Bag street still fresh in people's minds, the civic brass is not taking chances and are trying to evacuate hawkers and pavement dwellers from BBD Bag, Strand Road, Burrabazar and other areas located closer to the river. “ We are keeping submersible pumps ready in case we need them to flush out storm water from low-lying areas after lock gates are opened,” a KMC sewerage and drainage department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heavy-rain-high-tide-may-sink-large-parts-of-city/articleshow/82953365.cms||Saikat Ray

He said all medical college hospitals across the state have been asked to keep a separate ward with 15 to 30 beds to treat those affected by the fungal infection. They will be treated by experts from the ophthalmology and ENT departments. The situation in Tamil Nadu is not as grave as in Rajasthan or Gujarat, he said adding that the state has pressured the Centre for medicine to treat the infection. Earlier, health minister Ma Subramanian said a multidisciplinary expert medical team comprising ten members has been formed to identify the reason behind Covid-19 patients getting infected by mucormycosis. “Black fungus has been infecting people who are diabetic for a long time. With the approval of the chief minister we have identified 10 medical experts and had a preliminary discussion with them,” the minister said. adding that there are several theories doing the rounds on the infection. Subramanian inspected Covid-19 preparedness and chairing a review meetings at Tuticorin and Kanyakumari. The minister also said there is good cooperation from the Centre in handling the pandemic in the state. “The CM has been pressing for requirements with the PM and the (Union) ministers for health and industries and the state’s requirements are met. Former Union minister T R Baalu has been camping in Delhi for more than a week and is meeting ministers and officials from the departments concerned to get remdesivir and oxygen,” he added. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday requesting him to import Liposomal Amphotericin B drug for treating black fungus. Though the numbers are much lesser than Covid-19, mucormycosis causes significant increase in mortality rate. He said experts have told him that the specific drug of choice is Liposomal Amphotericin B, which is in severe short supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/181-black-fungus-cases-so-far-in-tn/articleshow/82955642.cms||---

This village is situated about 40 kilometres away from the district headquarters. Sources claim that migration took place due to vaccine fear. Village Chopra of Para panchayat wears a deserted look these days. The houses are locked and only elderly are left behind as almost 80% of the population has migrated to bigger cities. Those who have remained in the village claim that people have gone “to save their lives” from the vaccine. Villagers said, “Many people are dying after getting vaccinated. People are falling sick, so why should we get the jabs?” A village woman, Parvati, said, “People from this village have migrated to other cities after reports of deaths and disease.” A large number of villagers in this backward region of Bundelkhand continue to harbour misconceptions that impotency and death are caused by Covid vaccines. And when health workers reach out to persuade them for vaccination, they are ill-treated. Health workers now want police protection during their visit to the villages. Earlier, there was a lot of enthusiasm among the villagers when the vaccination began; almost 15,000 got their first dose in 78 village panchayats of the Badagaon health block. Vaccination officer, Dr P K Mohor, said, “People of Badagaon have resisted the second dose and only 964 people have got the second jab .” Collector Subhash Dwivedi did not respond to calls as TOI sought his reaction on the migration of villagers.

The CHB, on May 17, had started auction process of 79 freehold residential properties in different sectors of the city through e-tender process. Bidders can submit their bids against properties by May 31. A senior CHB official said they are hopeful of good response in the coming days as well. People are coming at these help desks and enquiring about dwelling units. One help desk each has been set up at sectors 38 (west), 49 and 51, and two at Sector 63. In the last auction, the CHB was able to auction 36 freehold dwelling units. The highest bidders were required to deposit 25% of the bid amount within five working days. However, six highest bidders could not deposit the 25% amount within the prescribed period and accordingly their earnest money deposit (EMD) amount of Rs 2 lakh each were forfeited by the board. Yashpal Garg, CEO of the Chandigarh Housing Board, said they have included these six freehold properties in the upcoming auction and in total 79 freehold units have been put up for auction. He said the board had adopted secrecy in the last auction and the same formula will be implemented this time too. The CHB has prepared a list of 270 properties, including 11 residential (leasehold), 109 residential (freehold) and 150 commercial (leasehold), for sale. The CHB has started auction of freehold residential units. The remaining properties will be put up for sale at later stages. To get a good response, the CHB had reduced the reserve price of the properties by 10 per cent. Not even a single bidder expressed interest in the auction of CHB properties held in 2019 as the reserve price was too high for both residential and commercial properties. This time, the CHB has decided to replace the e-auction process of selling properties with the e-tender process. In e-auction, the earnest money deposit (EMD) for participation cannot be paid online. A bidder deposits the same in the CHB account and submits a proof. The payment is confirmed by the CHB officers before allowing the bidder to participate in the e-auction process. Hence, number of bidders for particular property and their identity is not fully confidential. However, in e-tender, EMD can be paid online and there is no need of any approval and hence there is complete secrecy about the number of bidders and their identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/200-bidders-visit-chb-units-can-submit-bids-by-may-31/articleshow/82953389.cms||---

G Stalin, city deputy commissioner of police (law & order), said the cops would meet the elderly couples in person twice a week. “The senior citizens can also contact us at any time for any help. We are happy to render our services to them, especially during this pandemic time.” City police commissioner Deepak M Damor had earlier instructed the beat police officers to visit the senior citizens at their houses and keep in touch with them over mobile phone. They were also told to help such couples with groceries and medicines during the intense lockdown. The beat police officers said they had been meeting the elderly couples in the past two days. “Some couples asked the officers to arrange medicines for them. The beat officers in turn contacted the nearby medical stores and asked them to supply medicines to them. The officers have also directed vegetable vendors to ensure supply to some elderly couples based on their request.

Ambulances, even minibuses, are being kept on stand-by across police stations. All police guard rails and barricades will be removed. However, where it is absolutely necessary, cops are using chains and bamboo sticks along with cement slabs to tie the guard rails and ensure they are not blown away. “We have kept ambulances ready at certain police stations and minibuses are being pressed into service and placed at strategic locations so that everyone can be evacuated in a short notice,” said joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. On Wednesday, police held several meetings to cater to the emergency needs of Covid patients in the event of a heavy downpour or a storm creating obstacles for them to get medical attention. In addition, all parking under trees and Posta flyover have been stopped and traffic guards told to ensure that all such vehicles are towed away. Lalbazar has shared numbers where critical Covid patients can seek help while making their way to the hospital. For their better functioning, the KMC has divided the city into seven parts where seven separate NDRF teams will be stationed. While one team will be posted exclusively for the Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt, one team will be assigned for Behala. "There were 19 deaths in the city on the day of Amphan. Seven of them were in this part of the city. This is the reason why an Army column has been assigned to Behala," stated a police officer at Lalbazar. While the unified command centre at Lalbazar will issue commands, it will be largely the KMC coordinators — with help from the local OC — who will execute the work on the ground. The KMC and police have agreed that with wind speeds reaching 60-100 km/hr in the city during the cyclone, there will be two primary focus areas — removing fallen trees and putting special focus in the 55 wards (91-144) of the added areas where power outage will be a major challenge. That the men on the ground will have a challenging day on Wednesday became clear after borough or ward coordinators and OCs got calls from worried residents on Tuesday - especially in the added areas - to take care of several dangerously leaning trees in front of electric poles. Some callers also requested them to look after the needs of residents who are staying in the low-lying areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/focus-on-medical-needs-during-cyclone/articleshow/82953396.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The couple looked for work and the wife got employed as a domestic help. A few months later, their 17-year-old daughter was lured by a placement agency to work as a domestic help in Kirti Nagar. Hoping their hardship would end, she readily agreed to the job for which she was promised Rs 12,000 per month. However, on April 14, 2021, Bandhua Mukti Morcha, an organisation helping workers in the informal sector across the country, was informed by the mother that her daughter was being forced to work without wages, and also confined and beaten up. She said that two days ago, her daughter had contacted her and narrated her ordeals. Next day, the woman requested the placement agency to send her daughter back, but the principal employer asked her to leave. On April 15, advocate Vinod Kumar Singh of Bandhua Mukti Morcha and Soziio from Human Right Law Network met the subdivisional magistrate (SDM) of Rajouri Garden to request an urgent rescue. The next day, the girl was rescued. Her statement was recorded later before the SDM and an FIR was registered at Kirti Nagar police station. However, even after a month, no release certificate, essential for complete rehabilitation of a bonded labourer, was issued by the district administration despite three representations, prompting advocates Carolin Kasar and Osbert Khaling to file a writ petition in Delhi High Court. Even as the case got listed for May 25, the SDM called an urgent meeting on May 24 and issued the release certificate. The high court has disposed of the matter with directions to the respondent to comply with the plea and provide interim relief within seven days. Nirmal Gorana, general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, said the rescued minor bonded labourer should be rehabilitated on an urgent basis to keep alive the objective of Bonded Labour System Abolition Act 1976. In 2016, the Centre also implemented Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourers to enable such labourers live a life with dignity. Gorana has also appealed to the Centre to included domestic work under the schedule employment list as per Minimum Wages Act 1948.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-city-for-survival-girl-works-without-wage-beaten-up/articleshow/82955741.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Coimbatore||Man, 23, with cardiac tamponade gets new lease of life at CMCH||Coimbatore: A 23-year-old man who suffered two episodes of life-threatening cardiac tamponade - a condition where a large amount of fluid fills around the heart - within a month was admitted twice to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital which drained out the fluid effectively and sent him home after three weeks of observation and ensuring such episodes don’t repeat. The youngster was admitted to the hospital last month with breathlessness and very low blood pressure. An echocardiogram evaluation showed that that fluid had filled around the heart in the pericardium. A cardiologist team, headed by professor Dr T Munusamy and associate professor Dr J Nambirajan, drained out the fluid at the catheterization laboratory of the hospital by an emergency procedure of inserting a needle and tube through his abdomen wall and around the heart cavity. They drained out 2.3 litres of fluid and further investigation into the cause of the fluid accumulation found him to be suffering from tuberculosis. The patient was given medication for tuberculosis and later discharged, only to return three weeks later with another episode of fluid accumulation around the heart. The doctors repeated the procedure and drained 1.1 litres of fluid from him. The patient later underwent elective pericardial window creation, which is the removal of a portion of the pericardium thereby allowing the fluid to drain continuously into the peritoneum or chest. After three weeks of observation to ensure that such an episode didn’t recur, the patient was discharged. Cardiac tamponade can recur anytime within one and 12 months in cases of cancer, tuberculosis and autoimmune diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-23-with-cardiac-tamponade-gets-new-lease-of-life-at-cmch/articleshow/82955731.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a letter to health secretary Ravi Dhawan on Monday, he requested that persons with disabilities be permitted “to get themselves tested/ vaccinated without waiting in queue”. Joshi also requested for a separate and independent Covid testing and vaccination centres for persons with disabilities. “…in order to reduce the risk to the life of persons with disabilities you are requested to issue necessary directions to the subordinate authorities in the health department to open an independent taluka-wise dedicated Covid testing/vaccination centres and also give priority to the persons with disabilities to get themselves tested/vaccinated at the other Covid testing/vaccination centres without waiting in queue”. He highlighted Section 3 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, on equality and non-discrimination and stated that the ministry of health and family welfare issued guidelines for protection and safety of persons with disabilities as they are more vulnerable to diseases due to their physical, sensory and cognitive limitations. The government on Monday notified persons with disabilities as frontline/special category workers for vaccination. They will be administered the vaccine on production of a disability certificate issued by a government doctor, the notification stated. The disability rights association of Goa (DRAG) on May 7 wrote to the commissioner for persons with disabilities to prioritise vaccination for persons with disability and even provide door-to-door vaccination for persons with disability who have nobody to take them to health centres. President Avelino de Sa also asked that the authorities be directed to open special Covid centres, one in each district of at least 15-bed capacity, for persons with disability and their family members. He said that the facilities should have accessible toilets, parking facilities, and family members should be allowed to stay with special children. He stated that staff at Covid hospitals and care centres are not sensitised to handle persons with disabilities.

The decision to elevate Jayant, who was till now serving as RLD vice-president, was taken in party’s national executive meeting organised virtually in view of the pandemic. His name was proposed and backed by party’s national general secretaries Triloki Tyagi and Munshiram Pal, respectively, after which the national executive gave its approval. Addressing the executive meeting, Jayant pledged to follow the path shown by his grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh and father Ajit Singh. He said farmers and rural issues would be his party’s top priority. After taking over as RLD chief, Jayant tweeted, “I am honoured & mindful of the challenges ahead. Will try my best to strengthen our organisation & will value inputs as we collectively take our core issues forward. Am drafting an open letter to express my condolences & solidarity with all #Covid impacted families as a first step.” Jayant is replacing his father as RLD president at a time when the party faces a political crisis as the BJP is ramping up its organisational machinery ahead of the UP assembly elections due next year. According to political analysts, Jayant will face the challenging task of reclaiming lost political ground by consolidating the Jat vote bank which had shifted towards the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. They said Jayant will face the task of roping in the old guard while cultivating a new breed of workers to carve out a significant position for the party. Party sources said Jayant will have to search for fruitful alliances with other political parties to take on the might of the BJP. Jayant was at the helm of affairs when RLD struck an alliance with the SP and BSP in Kairana and Noorpur byelections. Jayant attacked the ruling BJP for not making enough efforts to stem the second wave of pandemic which reached alarming proportions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jayant-elected-rld-chief-vows-to-focus-on-farmers-issues/articleshow/82957590.cms||---

Saneesh, a bachelor, died two days after he celebrated his birthday onboard P-305. He was to return home this month-end. Joseph TT announced he would donate the entire compensation given by ONGC. “My father decided to contribute 50% to the CM’s Relief Fund and 50% to Suvarna Arts and Sports Club in Valiyaparamba, Kannur,” his brother Aneesh told TOI over the phone from Kerala. Aneesh said they lost communication with Saneesh, who was a rigger on the barge, two days after his birthday. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh resident Farooque Shaikh has been doing the rounds of JJ Hospital as his younger brother, Shabbir, 34, who was a cook on the ill-fated barge when it sank during Cyclone Tautae last week, is still missing. “Police have taken my blood samples to match it. My father keeps calling to inquire about Shabbir. I don’t know what to tell him,” said Shaikh. Rayaman Chauhan, 70, too has come from Uttar Pradesh to find out about his son, Umesh, 34.

Following the Centre’s cue, the new policy also allowed hospitals to hold vaccination camps at institutions, companies and gated communities, decentralising what was essentially an extremely controlled drive thus far. Sources told TOI that as soon as word spread about the easing up of the rules, a large number of corporate hospitals started reaching out to companies that had already made queries about holding vaccination drives for their staff and families. Interestingly, the state government also took the important decision of launching a vaccination drive for the category it calls ‘super spreaders’ from May 28. This includes delivery boys including those delivering LPG cylinders, ration shop owners, cab and auto drivers, vendors at rythu bazars, liquor shop owners and butchers. They have been called super spreaders because of the very high number of people they come in contact with daily. At a high level review meeting with state finance minister T Harish Rao, it was estimated that there are 25 to 30 lakh such super spreaders in the state who are divided in 25 categories. Each category is expected to have a minimum of one lakh people. Their vaccination will start in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area. Officials were told to take up a 100-day drive and vaccinate at least 1,000 super spreaders in each circle. Sources added that the state has purchased about 4.5 lakh vaccine doses from private companies which will be used to vaccinate super spreaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-eases-vax-rules-pvt-hosps-can-now-give-jabs-to-18-grp/articleshow/82959052.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A state government spokesperson said that the opportunity will lead to economic and social empowerment of rural women folk through ‘Smart Solar Shops’ and also help in providing solar power for the benefit of children in remote areas. He said the SHGs are making these solar lamps with the help of the government and CSR funds. The lamps are being made available to the school children for Rs 100 per piece against their market rate of Rs 500 per piece. Earlier, the state government had distributed over 28 lakh solar lamps made by 4,000 women to school children in 75 blocks of over 30 districts in the state. The initiative, the spokesperson said, is helping children in a great way in pursuing education, besides making women self-reliant. The women, according to the state government, have been earning a fair amount of money ranging from Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 per month.

---||Delhi||Plea in HC for compensation to widow of Covid patient||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought the reply of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and AAP government on a plea seeking compensation for the parents and wife of a Covid-19 patient who died allegedly due to failure of proper medical attention. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh also asked Delhi government’s Rao Tula Ram Hospital to respond to the plea, which claimed that the victim’s condition was critical, and his oxygen level was very low, yet the hospital did not admit him and he died waiting for an ambulance. The family has sought an appropriate compensation for the loss of life of the deceased due to complete mismanagement and criminal negligence of the authorities. The bench decided to make NDMA a party to the petition, after it found that the authority has fixed a minimum ex-gratia compensation to be payable to the kin of deceased on account of the pandemic. It asked for affidavits from Delhi government, the hospital and NDMA and listed the matter for further hearing in July. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi Government, informed the court about the Supreme Court’s order on the issue of compensation and added that the state government already has plans to compensate families of Covid-19 victims (deceased)by paying Rs 50,000 and this will be placed before the cabinet next week. The court was hearing the petition filed by the parents and wife of Naveen, who died of Covid-19 on the intervening night of April 26-27, allegedly due to want of medical attention and doctor’s negligence. The petitioners contended the oxygen level of Naveen was recorded at Rao Tula Ram Hospital to be 60%, yet medical treatment was denied to him. The family was asked to take away the patient who kept trying and waiting for an ambulance to take him to another hospital but even the ambulance driver refused to carry the victim after enquiring about his oxygen level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-hc-for-compensation-to-widow-of-covid-patient/articleshow/82955831.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Move to Centre after rift with MVA pays off for ex-DGP||Mumbai: When, a few months ago, Maharashtra’s Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal decided to lead the Central Industrial Security Force, his decision was criticized by his colleagues in the bureaucracy as well as in IPS circles. They said that that compared to the DGP’s post, his new assignment was insignificant. But now they feel it was a wise decision because, having joined the CISF, he got into the zone of consideration for appointment as CBI director. Apparently, Jaiswal had realized last year that he may not be comfortable with the new political leadership in the state, that is, the Maha Vikas Aghadi comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, led by CM Uddhav Thackeray. He began looking for Central deputation posts, and when he realized that a few posts in New Delhi had been lying vacant for a long period, he opted for the CISF. According to reports, cracks between Jaiswal and the MVA government had surfaced over postings and transfer of senior IPS officers. Jaiswal felt that postings for IPS officers in Naxal-infested areas should be mandatory and that those officers who had not completed two years of their term should not be shifted. As there was a “cold response” to his proposal, Jaiswal quietly opted for Central deputation. An IPS officer of the 1985 batch, Jaiswal was in 2018 a surprise choice for the Mumbai police commissioner’s post in place of Datta Padsalgikar, who was promoted then as DGP. It required the intervention of the PMO at that time to relieve Jaiswal, known for his honesty and integrity. Following the retirement of Padsalgikar, Jaiswal was appointed state DGP. Jaiswal, who began his career as Amravati additional superintendent of police in 1986, worked in Maharashtra in several capacities, and among the big cases he dealt with were the multi-crore Telgi stamp paper scam in 2005, the 2006 serial train blasts case as well as the Malegaon blasts case. As Mumbai CP, Jaiswal was instrumental in bringing in major changes in police administration, particularly the working hours of police personnel. Even as DGP, Jaiswal brought in new legal technologies to enhance the rate of conviction. It was during his tenure as DGP that Maharashtra set a new record in investigation as well as conviction, and some practices introduced by Jaiswal were implemented by neighbouring states. Significantly, fifty-eight-old Jaiswal’s appointment has sent shockwaves in the ruling MVA in Maharashtra. Currently, following a petition filed by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, the CBI has, on the directives of Bombay high court, filed a first information report against Deshmukh, along with a few others. The agency has recorded the statement of Deshmukh and a litigation is being heard by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/move-to-centre-after-rift-with-mva-pays-off-for-ex-dgp/articleshow/82959170.cms||---
---||India||Haryana man, 84, first Indian to get Trump cocktail||NEW DELHI: Mohabbat Singh, 84, from Haryana has become the first person in India to be administered the “famous” Covid drug cocktail given to former US president Donald Trump. Singh, who has been under treatment for the past five days, was given the drug over 30-minute intravenous supply on Tuesday at Medanta, Gurugram. The drug, Regeneron, is touted as a breakthrough treatment for certain patients as it shortens symptom duration and reduces viral load by fast acting antibodies. The first batch of the Roche drug with two antibodies — Casirivimab and Imdevimab — reached India on Monday. “This drug is different from convalescent plasma and entirely different from repurposed drugs like Remdesivir or Tocilizumab. Studies show that 80% of patients who took this drug didn’t need hospitalisation, and it also reduced death rate in addition to shortening the duration of symptoms,” Dr Naresh Trehan, director, Medanta, told TOI. The monoclonal antibody cocktail was used to treat Trump when he tested positive last year. Within a week he was back at work. Cipla is marketing the drug in hospitals at an estimated price of Rs 59,000 per dose. Only one dose is needed. “The antibodies built in a patient after this drug would last only three-four weeks even though it would have done its job to contain the virus,” Trehan cautioned. Normal antibodies in any Covid patient develop only after 14 days of contracting the infection. But in this drug the lab-made antibodies work instantly. “The only condition imposed by the government is that it should be used in patients above 65 with comorbidities and immunocompromised. Even those above 55 with cardiac problems can be given this drug,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, director, internal medicine, Medanta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/haryana-man-84-first-indian-to-get-trump-cocktail/articleshow/82961315.cms||Rohan Dua
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: 8 migrant workers drown in Sileru||VISAKHAPATNAM: Eight migrant workers drowned in Sileru river as two boats carrying them capsized midstream in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam on Tuesday. The victims were migrant workers from Odisha. The tragedy occurred when they were returning to their native state from Telangana. The migrant workers took the river route — which was swollen due to the release of backwaters from Sileru dam — rather than going by road to avoid police check-posts on AP-Odisha border. Sileru river serves as the boundary between Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Odisha has made it mandatory for people returning from AP and Telangana to undergo compulsory quarantine as part of Covid-19 containment measures. Police said a group of about 35 migrant workers was crossing the river to enter Odisha under the cover of darkness to escape police check-posts, when two of the boats carrying about 18 people capsized midstream. While 10 of them managed to swim to safety, eight others drowned. The workers hailed from Guntawada and Konduguda villages in Malkangiri district of Odisha. They had reached Sileru from Hyderabad after losing their livelihood due to the lockdown in the state. After crossing the Sileru check-post in a vehicle, they reached Jonnalamamidi village by foot, from where had they took the water route to cross the border and reach their native villages. About 17 people set off in two country boats in the first trip and crossed over to Odisha. In the second trip, 18 persons set off in two boats. When one boat capsized either due to overload or after hitting some object underneath the water, the panic-stricken occupants tried to jump to the other boat to save their lives, but that too sank. Six bodies have been recovered so far from the river, and the search is on to trace the remaining two bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/8-migrant-workers-drown-in-sileru/articleshow/82959067.cms||Nalla.Babu

AAP said that it seems Goans are being left at the mercy of the BJP high command once again and to add insult to the injury, vaccination of 18-44-year-olds have again been stopped. AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre said that with only 15 lakh Goans, it should not have taken the government more than a month to achieve 100% vaccination. “It is shocking that the Govt is procuring only 35,000 vaccines at a time and opening limited slots daily to hide its failures. At this rate, it will take more than a year to vaccinate Goans. Third wave will come and take more lives by then,” Mhambre said. On the government not releasing the details of global tenders, he said, “What is Sawant’s plan? Has he floated a global tender? Has he taken any proactive steps? Or is he again leaving Goans at the mercy of his BJP high command as usual?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-govt-has-no-plan-to-ensure-100-vaccination/articleshow/82957772.cms||---

On Tuesday, petrol was priced at Rs 100.19 per litre, while diesel was being sold for Rs 90.63 per litre.

They have requested both state and central governments to reduce the taxes and give relief. Avinash Kulkarni, a city resident, said there has been continuous rise in fuel prices during the last one year. “Earlier, I would spend around Rs 3,000 per month on my vehicle for travelling to office and for personal purposes, but the monthly budget has now gone above Rs 4,500 per month. We have completely stopped unnecessary use of vehicles,” he said. “Moreover, prices of pulses and edible oils have also increased at large during the last few months due to rise in fuel prices. Hence, the government needs to reduce the fuel prices as it leads to inflation,” he added. Mahesh Pawar, a farmer, said farmers resort to tractor-mounted equipment for carrying out farming activities. “Ploughing and other rates have increased by 30% during the last nine months due to continuous rise in diesel prices. The prices of fertilizers have already increased at large. Now, the rising diesel prices will increase our production cost. We want the government to provide diesel at subsidized rate to the farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/petrol-sold-for-over-rs-100/litre-in-nashik/articleshow/82953674.cms||Tushar Pawar

Around four lakh people residing within smelling distance — about a kilometre — of the dumping ground may not only heave a sigh of relief but also rejoice at the thought of breathing in naturally clean air in the future, for the KDMC has planned a park on the site. Spread over six acres, the Adharwadi dumping ground was set up outside the city in 1963. In the 1990s, many residential complexes came up in Adharwadi. Residents began demanding the shifting of the landfill from 2000. In 2007, a PIL in the Bombay high court sought the closure of the landfill. In 2015, the high court stopped construction in the city for a year, asking the KDMC why it had not resolved the landfill issue. In February last year, Vijay Suryawanshi took charge as the municipal commissioner and promised its closure. Deputy municipal commissioner, sanitation department, Ramdas Kokare was entrusted the task as he had a record of implementing the zero garbage campaign in other places. Kokare made it compulsory for residents to segregate dry and wet waste. The KDMC now makes biogas and compost from wet waste. “Instead of sending garbage at the dumping ground, now our garbage vans will directly take refuse to Umbarde and Barave treatment and processing centre,” Kokare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-four-lakh-to-breathe-easy-in-kalyan-with-landfill-closure/articleshow/82957810.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Delhi||Govt caps oxygen cylinder transportation charges||New Delhi: Delhi government has capped the price of oxygen inhalation cylinders (medicinal gas cylinders) so that people in need are not overcharged. An order issued by the health department on Tuesday stated that for b-type cylinders Rs 50 will be charged as maximum transportation cost per cylinder, Rs 150 for d-type cylinders and Rs 250 for jumbo ones. A committee was constituted under the chairmanship of deputy commissioner (transport) to examine the price capping of oxygen cylinders in the city by the refillers and supply of filled cylinders by dealers. It submitted the report on Saturday with the recommended rates. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority passed an order in September last year fixing the maximum price of liquid medical oxygen and oxygen inhalation (medicinal gas) in cylinder at the rate of Rs 15.22 and Rs 25.71 per cubic meter respectively (ex factory & exclusive of GST). The NPPA order is in force till September 30 this year. “It is directed that all the cylinders suppliers, refillers, dealers of medical oxygen in Delhi shall strictly comply with the order by NPPA,” the Tuesday order stated.

Many Homes are now receiving four to five cases a week against one or two in a month during the first wave. “The current dire situation of Covid-19 has proved to be very difficult for most senior citizens in the city. In the last couple of months, we have seen quite a few cases where people dropped their parents or relatives at our facility as soon as they contracted Covid-19 and never returned to see them,” said Dr Bongu Ramakrishna, who runs Mother Teresa Elder Care Centre at Karkhana. “The police are also bringing in senior citizens who are being abandoned after they contracted Covid-19,” Ramakrishna, who has lots of inmates who cannot pay a rupee, said. There are at least five patients at one old age home in the city now, who are still awaiting their families, who have cited various reasons for their inability to take them back. In one such heart-wrenching incident, 87-year-old inmate Anjamma, 87, (name changed), recently died waiting to hear from her family members. “The family members would call and ask about her health in the beginning but stopped calling after we informed them that her condition was deteriorating due to the after-effects of the coronavirus disease. After a few days, when we informed them about her death, they asked us to perform her final rites,” said Dr Ramakrishna. At least half a dozen old age homes that TOI spoke with confirmed a sharp increase in numbers of senior citizens being dropped at their facilities. Mohammad Abdul Wasif, general secretary, Fathima old age home in Falaknuma said, “We are receiving continuous calls, at least four to five calls in a day, about senior citizens looking for a place to stay. There is also an increase in admissions because people do not want to keep the elderly at home if they contract Covid-19.” Wasif said he is running out of space as they have a capacity of 55 people and currently there are 46 inmates. “There is also staff crunch and it is very difficult to manage when the inmates fall sick,” said Wasif. Shyam Kumar, advocacy officer, HelpAge India said the overall experience reflects a growing sense of vulnerability and uncertainty emerging as the common thread. “There are also cases where families have not come to take the bodies of their parents,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-scourge-hyds-elderly-shunned-left-in-old-age-homes/articleshow/82959079.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Lucknow||Covid cases dip, Uttar Pradesh government diverts oxygen to industry||LUCKNOW: The state government on Tuesday, decided to divert a portion of oxygen for industrial use, days after at least two industry bodies, IIA and CII, appealed to the government to split available oxygen between hospitals and industry with Covid on wane. In April, when the second wave struck and oxygen demand shot up, the government ordered industries using oxygen to divert it for medical purpose. From over 1,000 tons of oxygen supplied by the government till last week, the demand has now dipped to around 700 tons per day. As cases continue to plunge, officials say demand for the lifesaver will go down further. In the first pandemic wave, the state had managed with 300 tons of oxygen per day, but in the current wave, demand rose three-fold, forcing the government to divert industrial oxygen for medical use. “It has been decided that some of the oxygen can be diverted back to industries,” additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said. Last week, Indian Industries Association appealed to the government to distribute oxygen proportionately between hospitals and industries. Another appeal was made by CII, with UP chairperson CP Gupta saying they are receiving calls from industries, particularly stainless steel manufacturers and exporters, who need oxygen to purify liquid stainless steel. “They had to cease operations for a month after giving up their oxygen. Their electricity connection is between 8-12 MW, so they are forced to bear heavy fixed charges. These manufacturers employ thousands of people and are currently suffering heavy losses and are on verge of closure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-cases-dip-up-govt-diverts-oxygen-to-industry/articleshow/82957773.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||CM discusses 24x7 water supply with NDMC officials||New Delhi: To discuss a project for 24 hours of water supply in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) areas, a meeting through videoconferencing was held on Tuesday wherein chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and officials from the civic body were present. The meeting aimed to understand the scope of hiring a consultant who will be doing a detailed field survey and submit a feasibility report before implementing the project for the convenience of residents. The project was conceived in 2011, but it could not take off then for various reasons, including no response for bids. The ambitious project mainly includes reducing the wastage of water due to leakage, excess storage, ensuring equitable and smooth supply and making it easier for the staff to do meter reading from the control room or without entering the premises. “Today’s meeting was mainly aimed at understanding the scope of appointment of a consultant. We submitted the details to senior officials after the meeting and based on the direction from the government, further work over the project will be implemented,” said an NDMC official. Officials said that it would take at least six months for the consultant, after floating of tender, to complete the field study. “The consultant will be responsible for analysing the kind of meters that can be installed in houses and other properties to simplify reading exercise. As of now, there are conventional metres installed in houses wherein our workers have to mandatorily visit the premises to get the reading. The recent proposal gives the option for installing one out of two systems for meter reading—automatic meter reading (AMR) or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI),” said the official. In case of AMR, staff can do meter reading from up to 50-metre distance and without entering the premises, while in the second option, meters can even be read from a control room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-discusses-24x7-water-supply-with-ndmc-officials/articleshow/82955939.cms||Vibha Sharma

The undertrials — murder accused Pratik Suhas Sarnaik and house break-in accused Gundaji Tanaji Nandiwale — had tested positive for Covid-19 and were undergoing treatment at the CCC. The duo had managed to bend the iron rods of the window and escape from the facility in the wee hours. A complaint was registered by Kalamba jail authorities at the Rajwada police station. District police superintendent Shailesh Balkawade had formed three teams to nab the accused duo. The teams visited the houses of the families and friends of the undertrials and it was a daunting task for them as the accused did not have any mobile phone. Local crime branch police inspector Tanaji Sawant said the police teams traced every single person known to the undertrials and carried out raids several times on the basis of information they were getting. “On Tuesday we got information that they were spotted along Ichalkaranji road near Hatkanangale town. At around 1.30 pm we pinned down the location and our team surrounded the area. They were hiding in a sugarcane field and surrendered immediately after we spotted them,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/2-kalamba-undertrials-arrested-after-11-days/articleshow/82953693.cms||---

Doctors appealed to the MLA to spend a day in the Covid ward and then conclude whether the doctors are working hard or not.Members of various doctor and nurses associations shouted slogans against the MLA and said if any public representative had any problems with the treatment or management of hospital, they should ask and discuss the issue with the authorities of medical college and not humiliate the doctors publicly. Doctors said from last one year, the medical staff is working day and night. They claimed to continue their agitation till the MLA does not apologise.

---||Hyderabad||On the run for 13 years, fraudster caught in Telangana||HYDERABAD: On the run for 13 years after jumping bail, Srinivas Rao, an engineer, accused in 40 bank fraud cases, ran out of luck and got nabbed by police two days ago. To give cops the miss, he worked in a hotel, begged at Tirumala, and was last employed as a security guard in Bengaluru. On Tuesday, Karimnagar police commissioner VB Kamalasan Reddy said Srinivas was teaching maths and physics in a private college before he took to crime in 2006. “But in order to earn easy money, he joined hands with few other persons and created fake Kisan Vikas documents and pledged them in different banks and raised a loan of Rs 1 crore,” the commissioner said. In 2007, based on the complaints lodged by several banks, criminal cases were registered against Srinivas and his gang members at Karimnagar, Warangal, Hanumakonda, Hyderabad and Guntur districts of Andhra Pradesh. A total of 40 cases were registered against him and Srinivas Rao was arrested by Karimnagar police and sent to judicial remand, before he obtained bail in 2008. Out on bail, Srinivas first began evading court hearings and mandatory visits to police stations before he went missing and secretly took shelter in Hyderabad. “He took a different name and introduced himself as ‘Shashank Rao’ and earned a job at a private college as a lecturer. During this period, his wife got separated from him and he quit his job and moved to Vijayawada and started to work in a hotel, fearing his wife might inform the police about him,” Reddy said. Subsequently, he moved to Tirupati and was eking out a living by working at a hotel. But to his misfortune, he met with an accident and was thrown out of work. “Following the accident, he survived by begging at Alipiri in Tirumala to get at least one meal,” Reddy said. In 2018, his brother Sridhar lodged a missing complaint in Nizamabad and Warangal. Luck smiled upon Srinivas again after some residents of Nizamabad came across him at Alipiri and shared the information with Sridhar. With help of his brother, Srinivas moved to Bengaluru, where he got a job as security guard in 2018. “But the non-bailable warrants (NBWs) were pending for several years, and we were making every effort to nab him. Acting on a tip-off and analysis of the call data records of the accused and his relatives, we finally caught him two days ago,” said Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/on-the-run-for-13-yrs-fraudster-caught/articleshow/82959140.cms||Srinath Vudali

He said the issue is related to “Hindutva and is as important as Ram Mandir”. Raut also said that the ‘toolkit’ which was used by the BJP to target political opponents has backfired. “Bhagawat is a respectable person. He always expresses strong views on various issues. However, for the last few months, everyone has been silent, especially after thousands of bodies were seen floating in River Ganga,” Raut said, adding that people in the country expect pro-Hindu leaders in the country to clarify their stand on such issues. The Sena leader also slammed BJP on the ‘toolkit’ and said, “BJP’s tactics to target its opponents have backfired, and now they are putting pressure by conducting raids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bhagwat-must-take-stand-on-bodies-in-ganga/articleshow/82957913.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad pvt hosp resumes vax drive||Aurangabad: After private hospitals in metro cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur resumed the vaccination drive by procuring doses on their own, private health institutions in Aurangabad and Jalgaon, among a few other cities, too have rejoined the immunization drive. In Aurangabad, one private hospital was offering Covishield at Rs 900 per dose, and the same was being reflected on the CoWIN portal. As per the official data, the institution had administered around 182 first doses by Tuesday. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) immunization officer, said that a few more private hospitals were expected to resume the drive soon. “As per official guidelines, the AMC has not been providing vaccines to private hospitals since May 1. These hospitals can give vaccines to citizens above 18 years of age by purchasing the doses on their own. Registration on CoWIN is a must for such private hospitals,” she said. Dr Ram Rawlani, the chief medical officer for Jalgaon Municipal Corporation, also confirmed that one private hospital has started the vaccination drive. “The private hospitals will have to adhere to official guidelines,” he said. Civic activist Rajendra Datey Patil said the private hospitals joining the drive should not indulge in profiteering. “The private hospitals were part of the vaccination drive before May 1 and were giving doses at Rs 250 (for Covishield). It makes no sense for them to charge more now. The hospitals should take the mortal responsibility and must not overcharge,” he said. As per official data, municipal limits of Aurangabad have registered 2,95,788 vaccinations till Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-pvt-hosp-resumes-vax-drive/articleshow/82953742.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Parents, teachers, schools say cancelling exam not best, but only option||PANAJI: Parents, teachers and school heads said that the chief minister’s decision to cancel the Class X 2021 state board exams may have not been the best option academically, but was the only choice left with the state to protect the life of students in the face of the ongoing pandemic. President of the All Goa Secondary School Teachers’ Association (AGSSTA), Dattatrey Naik, said that when the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education had called for a consultative meeting over the exam, the teachers’ association had suggested that the board wait till May 30 to take a decision. “We had suggested that they should decide as per the situation around May 30. It is preferable that students should get to answer their Class X exams as they have been preparing for it for a long time now. Our reasoning was that if and when you decide to cancel the exam, the decision can be taken at any time. But active cases still remain high and there was no choice,” Naik said, adding that considering the lives of students, the association has to accept the government’s decision. Convener of the parents’ association FORCE, Savio Lopes, said that top scoring students will be at a loss. “It is very unfortunate that the exams had to be cancelled. The class toppers will be the losers. But considering the present situation and deaths mounting, I feel the priority is life over exams,” Lopes said. Anant Pissurlekar not only heads the Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association of Goa (HISTAG), but also has his child waiting for the state government verdict this week on whether the Class XII exams will be conducted. “The government has not given any priority to students during its vaccination drive. In this situation, it is risky to conduct the Class XII exam. Students can answer the Goa Common Entrance Test and other entrance tests and their aptitude for admission to professional colleges can be decided accordingly,” Pissurlekar said. The Goa Headmasters’ Association said that, during the consultation with Goa Board, they were one of the bodies to suggest that the Class X exams be cancelled. “We had already suggested why not cancel the Class X exam and evaluate students based on their internal assessment marks. As the Covid situation was not showing much improvement, the decision to cancel the exam is in the interest of the students. Given the pandemic situation, it was the need of the hour,” president of the headmaster’s association Mariano Valadares said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parents-teachers-schools-say-cancelling-exam-not-best-but-only-option/articleshow/82957911.cms||---

The corporations together run over 1,600 primary schools. In a press conference Pathak said the corporations have not yet started the tendering process for the procurement of books for these students. However, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the allegations are baseless. “The civic bodies do not do tendering for procuring books. The books are procured by Delhi government and provided to the corporations. Delhi government has not delivered the books yet,” Kapoor said. The payment for text books, too, comes from Delhi government’s Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan, which too has come last week after a delay of 46 days, Kapoor said.

---||Kochi||Ekm reports 200 dengue, 32 leptospirosis cases this year||Kochi: Ernakulam is witnessing a rise in vector-borne and zoonotic diseases with more suspected and confirmed dengue fever and leptospirosis cases reported till May 22 this year compared to the cases reported during the same period in the last two years. As many as 200 confirmed and 300 suspected dengue cases were reported between January 1 and May 22 in Ernakulam.  There were only 40 suspected and 18 confirmed cases during the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Meanwhile, 32 confirmed and 77 suspected leptospirosis cases have also been reported till May 22 this year. There were only two and one confirmed leptospirosis cases during the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Ernakulam also reported one suspected dengue death and three suspected leptospirosis deaths during the period this year. As healthcare workers are all occupied with Covid-19 duties for more than one year, door-to-door awareness drives regarding these diseases could not be carried out ever since the outbreak of the pandemic. As local bodies have been forced to invest their own funds for setting up first-line treatment centres and community kitchens, shortage of funds also disrupted activities at grassroots level to prevent the diseases. Health authorities feel these might lead to more dengue cases if the public fail to abide by the directive of authorities and observe dry days. “We have strengthened surveillance and sought the support of Kudumbashree workers to observe dry days from last month onwards. We have sensitized presidents of panchayats and other local body heads. So far, no outbreak has been reported in the district this year. We have distributed doxycycline tablets in view of rising leptospirosis cases for people engaged in high-risk works. Most dengue cases are likely to be reported from May-end till July. We are closely monitoring the situation,” said Dr Vinod Paulose, district surveillance officer for non-Covid diseases in Ernakulam. “Health workers cannot visit each house and do source reduction as they are busy with the Covid duty. It is up to each resident to ensure there is no source which will pave the way for breeding of aedes mosquitoes. Instead of growing money plants indoors in water, they should use mud. Most of the dengue cases currently reported are from indoor sources,” added Dr Paulose. Authorities expect that waterborne diseases would be reported soon as there was heavy rain in recent days and leptospirosis cases are expected to emerge a week later. People in cyclone-hit areas were given doxycycline at the rehabilitation camps. They advise people to follow hand hygiene and drink only boiled water. Avoid using non-cooked foods from hotels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-reports-200-dengue-32-leptospirosis-cases-this-year/articleshow/82953806.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the past few days, Sambhajiraje has already held meetings with community leaders from Kolhapur, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur, Nanded and will be holding a series of meetings with those from Jalna, Aurangabad, Pune, Nashik and Mumbai to decide the future course of action. This will be followed by three different meetings with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, former CM Devendra Fadnavis and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, before making the community’s stand public on Friday. During his visit to Nanded on Tuesday, Sambhajiraje held a meeting with Maratha community leaders to discuss future course of action. Later, he publicly stated that the state and Centre should find a solution to ensure reservation for the Maratha community. “Now we are exploring all the possible options including legal remedies left with the community as well as the state government. The community is getting restless,” he said. He also clarified that he is not interested in making political statements by blaming the ruling or opposition parties for failing to get the reservation. “My interest is only in getting reservation for the Maratha community. No one is showing interest in resolving the issue, but the political leaders are busy pointing fingers at each other,” he said. He also expressed anguish over a recent book penned by journalist Girish Kuber and demanded that it should be banned by state as well as central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sambhajiraje-resolving-maratha-quota-issue-is-govts-responsibility/articleshow/82953799.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||61% owners didn’t pay property tax in 2020-21||Nagpur: A total of 4,45,798 out of 7,31,420 property owners (61%) in the city did not pay a cumulative Rs135.98 crore municipal corporation tax in financial year 2020-21. Only 2,85,622 owners paid their property tax totalling to Rs114.46 crore. A senior official attributed this to Covid pandemic, which has severely affected financial condition of the people and it might have led to poor recovery of property tax. For 2020-21, the NMC had issued tax invoices to 7,31,420 property owners and calculated total property tax at Rs261.60 crore. The department’s data reveals that the biggest number of unpaid tax is from Laxmi Nagar zone where 45,138 property owners owe Rs23.16 crore to the NMC, followed by Mangalwari zone (52,454 property owners, Rs21.42 crore), Ashi Nagar (96,901 property owners, Rs19.92 crore), Dhantoli zone (10,755 property owners, Rs 6.74 crore). According to the data, the NMC had collected Rs241.23 crore property tax in the last fiscal. Of this, Rs114.46 crore was tax for 2020-21, while the remaining amount was arrears. Sources in the NMC’s accounts and finance department pointed out that the civic administration needs to strengthen property tax collection as it is the main source of revenue for the civic body. Sources also added that intervention by corporators too was responsible for mounting property tax arrears. “Many a times, elected representatives, including office-bearers in the civic body, succeed in preventing the civic administration from taking any punitive action, resulting in mounting of property tax dues,” admitted the senior official from the tax department, who did not wish to be named. With the civic body’s deteriorating financial situation, sources stressed that the reason for such a high outstanding revenue needs to be addressed urgently and stringent efforts should be made to reverse the trend of increasing arrears. According to the data, the NMC’s property tax arrears have already crossed Rs526.43 crore. Even the amnesty scheme launched in December, 2020, had evoked poor response. Around Rs400 crore property tax arrears were due from more than 3.73 lakh defaulters. Of which, only 50,548 property owners, who had defaulted on tax for years, had paid Rs43.88 crore dues. Sources pointed out that the NMC should adopt a two-pronged strategy to reduce such huge dues — focus on optimizing disposal in terms of numbers and allocate development funds on the basis of tax paid in every prabhag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/61-owners-didnt-pay-property-tax-in-2020-21/articleshow/82951869.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Kochi||Kerala: Surge in Covid cases alarming in Attapadi||PALAKKAD: There is an alarming increase in the number of Covid-19-positive cases among tribespeople in Attapadi as more than half of the new cases are reported from tribal hamlets in the current second wave. During the first wave, the tribal hamlets had zero cases. During the second wave, the tribespeople got infected mainly because outsiders intruded into the tribal hamlets, bringing Covid-19 virus along with them. On Tuesday, 59 Covid-19 positive cases were reported from Attapadi, of which 31 are tribespeople. Of the total 739 active cases under treatment now, 326 are tribespeople. Out of the total 1,882 Covid-19 positive cases reported so far in Attapadi, 558 are tribespeople, said health department officials. They said that more cases are reported from Pudur grama panchayat and 41 cases were reported from Mulli hamlet alone. A major problem is that there is only one ambulance for Covid-19 patients in Attapadi. This has created a lot of problems in transporting patients, said tribal activists. The tribal heartland of Attapadi hills, as big as Alappuzha district, earlier showed the world how to stop the Covid-19 pandemic virus, as not a single native of Attapadi was affected by the virus. A health worker said that this was a big achievement as this most backward region of marginalized people, where tribal children die of malnutrition almost every month, strictly followed the Covid protocol. But all these great achievements were lost in the second wave now. Tribal activists said that in the first wave of Covid-19 outsiders were not allowed to enter the tribal hamlets. But during the second wave a lot of non-tribals from outside intruded into the tribal hamlets close to the forest areas for illicit distilling of liquor. The illegal brewers had business with both the tribespeople and the non-tribals. Excise and other government departments failed to stop the illicit brewing and its trade, they said. Another problem is that isolation of Covid-19 patients is not possible as most houses have only one room. So the tribespeople are housed in isolation centres far away from their hamlets.

Even as most people are expected to remain indoors on Wednesday, when Yaas makes its landfall between Paradip and Sagar Island in the afternoon, hospitals will stay prepared to handle cases of fracture and cut wounds, something they had to take care of when Cylcone Ampham lashed a year ago. “We have kept two OTs on standby only to cater to emergency patients, who sustain any type of injuries during the cyclone. An extensive emergency medical team will also be stationed in the hospital,” said Simmerdeep Gill, COO at C K Birla Hospitals CMRI. Emergency medical teams of several hospitals have been kept housed either on their premises or in nearby guest houses. Hospitals have also kept additional cars to pick up senior consultants if any of the trauma patients requires their involvement. “We have kept two ambulances to assist any patient who sustained trauma injury to reach the hospital and another two cars to pick up senior consultants if the injury is very critical. A dedicated trauma ITU is also ready,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO at Peerless Hospital. From fire safety personnel and electrical engineers to oxygen coordinators, hospitals have accommodated these essential service employees in and around their premises. “At R N Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, we have put on hold whatever few planned surgeries were scheduled, so that our clinical team can focus on any injured patients during the calamity,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (East) Narayana Health. During Amphan last year some hospitals even got cases of fingers being mangled while trying to close windows. “In addition to our emergency medical team we have accommodated 133 employees in guests houses in and around the hospital as an exigency plan. Our hospital emergency helpline number will be activated round the clock,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO Belle Vue Clinic. Medica Hospital too has made arrangements for its emergency teams along with three surgeons staying in the hospital through the night. “Our 18 trauma ambulances (Karma) in association with Kolkata Police would be kept at strategic locations so that any injured patient or ones requiring emergency medical care can be rushed to the nearest health facility,” said Alok Roy chairman Medica Group of Hospitals. With the impending cyclone hospitals across the city have seen a slow discharge on Covid patients since the past couple of days. Hospitals said that many fit patients are shaky to go back home fearing trouble to reach the hospital during cyclone in case of an emergency situation. The state health department has also opened a control room at Swasthya Bhawan to coordinate with hospitals for emergency patients during the storm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-gear-up-to-treat-yaas-emergency-cases/articleshow/82953859.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Currently, only six foreign yachts are docked at the Marina jetty. However, all of them remain locked and vacant as the sailors have returned to their native place by air. With the monsoon nearing and restrictions in international travel prevailing, it is very unlikely for the Marina to survive from the impact caused by the pandemic. At present, there are two yachts each from Australia and South Africa and one each from Poland and New Zealand docked at the Marina. Usually, by April most of the berths in the jetty would be occupied by the yachts as sailors prefer to stay in the shore during the monsoon, due to adverse weather out in the sea. Kochi Marina is one of the most sought marinas in the region due to its proximity to international shipping lanes. “The rent for docking the yachts in the Marina is the only income now. Even though many yachters have inquired about the entry regulations amid the pandemic while they passed close to Kochi, none of them came to halt at the Marina so far. With the monsoons around the corners, no boats will be coming anytime soon,” said a Marina official. Moreover, the lack of maintenance of the floating jetty and high siltation increasing the shallowness of water in the berths remain a major concern. Though the issues were highlighted by the sailors and Marina officials to the Kerala tourism development corporation (KTDC), which owns the Kochi Marina, no actions were taken so far. “Many of the yachters have complained about the lack of dredging of the berth citing that the boat keels hit the ground due to shallow water. Also, the wooden walkway of the floating jetty is damaged in most places and almost all of the pillars that hold the jetty are covered with barnacles and remain rusty. There is a need of urgent maintenance of the Marina,” said a KTDC source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-second-wave-hits-operations-of-marina/articleshow/82953849.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The SDM’s action comes after district collector Suraj Mandhare ordered an investigation into the entire incident of clandestine excavation from the mountain. The SDM said they have already stopped the work and are finding details about the areas of excavation and its purpose. “We are already probing into the issue and asked the people to stop the excavation work. As the private party concerned had not taken any permission for excavation, we have registered an FIR,” Chavan said. “We have also sought reports from various state government departments concerned like forest department, irrigation, PWD about the ecological effects on the environment due to such excavation in the areas. The probe report in this connection is to be prepared and submitted to the district collector in the next two three days,” he added. Environmentalists alleged suspicious clandestine works were carried out for some construction work and said the administration should identify the people involved in activities and take legal action against them. According to Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist, the Bramhagiri houses rare species of plants and it will impact the ecology of that area. “We need to protect Bramhagiri which is the origin of Godavari river,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-admin-begins-probe-into-excavation-at-bramhagiri/articleshow/82953839.cms||Tushar Pawar

Chief conservator of forests Clement Ben said, “The prey base seems to be improving in the recently notified conservation reserve of forests in Kolhapur. The camera trap had not shown the presence of spotted deer in Sahyadri Tiger reserve area for the last seven years.” He added that the area has mostly rugged terrain, which deer families don't prefer. Usually, animals like barking deer, sambar, bison, wild boar are prey animals for the tigers found in the western ghats region. “The sighting of a deer herd in such rugged terrain is a good sign and a significant development ecologically. There is a need for strengthening the faunal monitoring mechanism in the recently notified conservation reserves owing to the tiger sightings and also its prey based animal count in the area,” he said. Wildlife researcher Umakant Chavan said, “Due to lockdown, the human interference and traffic movement is minimum and hence the wild animals are seen roaming freely through the forest ranges.” Last year, the state wildlife board gave conservation reserve tag to the Amboli-Dodamarg, Chandgad, Ajara-Bhudargad, Gaganbawda, Panhalgad, Vishalgad and Jor-Jambhali ranges along the Western Ghats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rise-in-prey-animals-in-conservation-reserves-is-key-ecological-development-say-foresters/articleshow/82953861.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Kochi||Kerala: Tribal settlements in Idukki hit by virus||IDUKKI: The increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the tribal settlements of the district has raised concern. As many as 1,382 positive cases have been reported from various tribal settlements in the district since the beginning of the second wave. Only less than 10 tribespeople contracted the virus in the first wave in the district. This time, the most number of positive cases were reported from Kurathikudi tribal settlement in Adimali where 120 people got infected. With the cases on the rise inside the tribal community, the forest and tribal officials have strengthened the prevention activities and awareness camps among the tribal population here. Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) Idukki district programme officer K S Sreerekha said, “During the Covid-19 second wave, several positive cases were reported from most of the tribal colonies in Idukki. Most of the tribespeople depend on the nearest towns for purchases, medical needs, etc. and they got exposed themselves to the virus. In Kurathikkudy, the tribespeople mainly depend on Adimali town for various needs and they got the infection from there.” The official also said that tribal communities follow community living system and it was one of the main reasons that triggered the virus spread among them. “In most of the colonies, five to six people are living in one or two rooms in a single house. If one person is infected, it naturally gets passed on to others as well,” said Sreerekha. The department continues to make arrangements to provide vaccines to tribespeople. The officials will visit each colony and vaccinate people. The final arrangements will be made after discussing with the district collector, she added. Marayoor tribal officer V Sureshkumar said that they distribute medicines and food items to the people and ensure that they follow the lockdown strictly. The people here are in self lockdown mode from April 26 onwards to prevent the inspection. Marayoor range officer M G Vinod Kumar said that the people ventured out to town and infected tribal colonies there. “A girl from Pooyakutty reached Marayoor and tested positive after the 24th day of her visit. In the forest settlements where the Muthuvan community lives, there are common halls named ‘Sathram’ where the male children and aged males spend the night time. This increases the chances of fast spreading once a case is reported there,” said Vinod Kumar. Meanwhile, no Covid-19 case was reported in the first tribal panchayat of Edamalakkduy inside Munnar forest division. Edamalakkudy is the only tribal settlement in the district where no one is infected in the Covid-19 second wave, said the project officer. “Remoteness and lack of public participation has helped the people in Edamalakudy prevent spread of Covid,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-settlements-in-idukki-hit-by-virus/articleshow/82953892.cms||Sandeep Thomas

It waited till the eleventh hour to decide on the Class X public exams. “The government and education department should have expected this situation and should have been prepared with an alternative. The same thing will be repeated next year also. The government/education department has neither any plan nor roadmap to go forward. A committee should be appointed as soon as possible to look into conducting of classes and exams,” Lopes said. The FORCE convenor said a strict time frame should be set for the committee and a blueprint should be ready with the government before the academic year starts. “If this is not done, then we will face the same situation in the new academic year as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parents-body-wants-panel-to-formulate-plan/articleshow/82957976.cms||---

Passenger trains from Tatanagar railway station to Hatia, Badampahar, Danapur, Chhapra, Chakradharpur and Kharagpur and a special express train to Ernakulam were cancelled on Tuesday. Ranchi division cancelled special express trains from Hatia and Howrah, passenger train between Ranchi and Kharagpur, Hatia-Puri Tapashwini Express. Bhubaneswar-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Puri-Anant Vihar Neelanchal Express, Anant Vihar-Bhubaneswar Special express, all of which have stoppages at Muri railway station, will remain suspended on Wednesday and Thursday. Manish Kumar Pathak, the senior divisional commercial manager at Chakradharpur division, said special patrols are being carried out to watch out for uprooted trees and snapped overhead electrical wires on railway tracks. “A control room has been set up and quick response train has been kept waiting in the wings. Four railway stations have been stocked with food, drinking water and medicine supplies for stranded passengers and railway personnel. We have also opened a helpline number and special ticket windows to handout refunds to the passengers whose trains have been cancelled due to the cyclone,” Pathak told TOI. Similarly, the Ranchi railway division has set up mobile control centres at Ranchi, Hatia, Muri, Lohardaga, Bano, Ramgarh and Suisa railway stations. “We have also readied a special train loaded with boulders, sand and railway sleepers. The train will head out and supply materials for track repair in case of a wash out,” Niraj Kumar, the chief public relations officer of Ranchi division, said. Railway officials in Ranchi and Chakradhapur are wary of Covid-19 in case of a major snag. “In case a track is washed out or other similar incident, we will need a manpower of 200 and above to fix the track. Social distancing will become a major challenge then. Already, around 200 of our employees are Covid-19 positive,” a senior official at Tatanagar said. The management of Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International airport is on standby mode. “Although we have not received any alert from the Met department for Wednesday, we are on standby,” Ranchi airport director Vinod Sharma said. Ranchi airport is currently handling eight commercial flights a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-rly-div-sets-up-mobile-control-centres/articleshow/82953496.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Dhanbad DC Uma Shankar Singh said on Tuesday that the arrangements have been made keeping the possible impact of cyclone Yaas in mind. He said, “Various departments like electricity, PHED and the Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC) have been directed to constitute quick response teams (QRTs) so that there is no disruption in essential services. The electricity department has been asked to remain prepared to resume power supply in case of any disruption at the earliest and the DMC has been directed to assist the electricity department in removing the trees or tree branches falling on electric wires due to gusty wind.” He added that all the hospitals in the district have also been directed to remain on alert. All circle officers and block development officers have been directed to constitute QRTs consisting of officer in-charges of respective police stations, circle inspectors and panchayat secretaries and to identify one school in each panchayat to provide shelter to those affected by the cyclone. “The BDOs have also been directed to keep JCB machines ready to remove uprooted trees on the national highways in their respective areas so that there is no disruption in the movement of vehicles,” the DC added. “At the moment we have not taken any decision on discontinuing the vaccination centres and we will take a call on this depending on the situation,” he said in reply to a query.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dhanbad-readies-oxygen-backup-for-smooth-supply-in-next-2-days/articleshow/82953423.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Ranchi hospitals stock up oxygen after health dept directive||RANCHI: Prominent Covid-19 hospitals in Ranchi on Tuesday said they have stocked up enough oxygen to last 72 hours. On Monday night, the state department of health, medical education and family welfare asked all hospitals in the state to stock up liquid medical oxygen and ensure that they have alternate sources of power to keep their medical equipment functional. The department’s directive was issued keeping in mind the cyclonic storm Yaas, which is due to make landfall in Odisha on Wednesday and head inland towards south Jharkhand the same day. Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), which currently has the capacity to treat 1,108 Covid-19 patients indoors, said it has stocked up 800 Jumbo D-type oxygen cylinders. “We have also procured two oxygen cylinder tanks and kept them on standby. Our own PSA Oxygen plant is fully functional and two of its tanks are full,” Dr Rakesh Ranjan, the chief medical officer of Rims, told TOI. After Covid-19 cases began declining, Rims consumes 80 D-type cylinders each day. On Tuesday, the work to install a new PSA oxygen plant, which has been donated by a Singapore-based company, began at Ranchi sadar hospital. “The plant’s commissioning will need some time. We have stocked nearly 700 B-type and C-type oxygen cylinders. We also have oxygen concentrator machines which can be used. As for power back up, all the five generator sets of the hospital have been prepped for exigencies,” Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said. As on Tuesday evening, the hospital had 92 Covid-19 patients, of which 27 were in oxygen support in the ICU ward. “Every private hospital in Ranchi has their own alternate power source. As far as oxygen supplies are concerned, each of them is stocking up enough,” Yogesh Gambhir, Jharkhand president of the Association of Healthcare Providers India and chairperson of Raj Hospitals, said. “Although Covid-19 cases have declined, our hospital is full with patients having post Covid-19 complications such as lung diseases. Because of this, oxygen consumption is high,” he added. Banna Gupta, the state minister for health and disaster management, on Tuesday directed the deputy commissioners of Ranchi, Khunti, Bokaro, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan to arrange for satellite phones in medical facilities in case communication lines are downed by the cyclone. Gupta also directed the DCs to ensure that oxygen manufacturing and refilling plants continue to supply liquid medical oxygen to other districts without hindrances. State-owned discom Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) said it is keeping its engineers and technicians on standby. “However, since our lines are overhead and open, there are chances that any fault will take several hours to be fixed. In hospitals, even a minute can prove costly for the patients. Though we are ready to respond at a moment’s notice, hospitals should arrange for alternate power sources,” JBVNL public relations officer M P Yadav said. Jharkhand currently has a cumulative power requirement of 2,400 megawatt each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/city-hosps-stock-up-oxygen-after-health-dept-directive/articleshow/82953557.cms||Dhritiman Ray
