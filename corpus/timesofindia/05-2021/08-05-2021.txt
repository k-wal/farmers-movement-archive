The members of The Calcutta Khilafat Committee, who organise the prayers, have decided to give it a miss keeping in mind Covid guidelines aimed at disrupting the spreading of the virus. Eid is one of the biggest festivals for Muslims around the world and offering Namaz on the morning of the festival day is the highlight for almost every member of the community. But the news of the cancellation of the prayers was appreciated and considered an important decision to prevent the virus from spreading further. Soon after the Friday prayers were over, imams announced that people must pray at home on Eid and only a very few people will be allowed to visit the mosque who will have to follow Covid-appropriate guidelines. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has requested everybody to avoid crowding at religious shrines. The government is also going to have a meeting with imams across the state next week over arrangements for Eid next week. “The members of the Calcutta Khilafat Committee have decided to go with the guidelines provided by the government on assembly of people and decided that prayers will not be held on Red Road this Eid,” said Sakir Randerian, president of the Calcutta Khilafat Committee. “Social distancing is very important to fight the virus and big assemblies must be avoided at any cost. Last year, too, the prayer was not organized due to the pandemic. Since the war to defeat the virus is still on, we have decided to do the same this year, which is in the best interest of everyone.” More than 2 lakh people attend the prayers on Red Road every year. People even travel from neighbouring districts to attend the prayers. Mamata Banerjee has been visiting Red Road since she became the chief minister in 2011 to extend her wishes on the festival day. “It is a pragmatic decision taken keeping in mind the welfare of every person in the state. If we have to defeat the virus, some tough decisions have to be taken. People must try to offer Eid prayers at home and avoid crowding the mosques for their safety and the safety of their family,” said Mohammad Imran Baig, a businessman in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-eid-prayers-on-red-rd-for-second-year-in-a-row/articleshow/82467271.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Hospitals raise oxygen shortage concerns||KOLKATA: The state-run Calcutta National Medical College Hospital (CNMCH) that started taking in Covid patients from April 15 with 50 beds now has 146 designated beds for the infected. The hospital is now facing challenges in admitting serious patients due to its oxygen supply capacity issues. DHS Ajay Chakraborty conceded there was an issue with the oxygen at the hospital, saying it was due to the increasing number of serious patients requiring oxygen therapy. “This is due to an unprecedented situation where people needing oxygen support increased. The principal has already ordered the agency to add another panel to augment the capacity of oxygen supply. Quality of care is the main objective and we are increasing the beds — both CCU and oxygen,” he said. JNM Hospital and Medical College in Kalyani, which functions under the West Bengal University of Health Sciences, has also raised concern about oxygen shortage. Some junior doctors even sat on protest on Thursday demanding adequate oxygen storage.  Health officials said the problem here, too, was due to there being more patients than the oxygen storage capacity. Oxygen supply is not an issue in Bengal yet, despite the massive increase in demand, officials said. Private hospitals and nursing homes depending on cylinders are, however, facing a crisis. They are getting the supply, but there is a problem keeping pace with the number of patients. “We have 60 Covid patients and 90% of them need oxygen support. The process of buying new cylinders is on so we can continue treatment,” said Govind Ram Agarwal, general secretary, Marwari Relief Society Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospitals-raise-oxygen-shortage-concerns/articleshow/82467274.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The call for the fast was initially given by the Catholic church and the other churches joined in. Under the archdiocese of Roman Catholic church, 300 priests in churches, educational institutions and other social service outfits fasted and prayed on Friday. The head of the Catholic church in the city, Archbishop Thomas D Souza, held evening prayers at Auxilium Church as hundreds watched online. The Church of North India-affiliated churches held three-hour virtual prayers in the morning where Bishop Paritosh Canning prayed for deliverance from the deadly disease. The call to Catholic priests came from Oswald Cardinal Gracias, the head of the Catholic world in the country, and found support among priests. This was supported by the National Council of Churches in India and the Evangelical Fellowship of India. “We need divine intervention,” D Souza said.  Canning said, “We, the spiritual doctors to our parishioners, can fast and pray to stand by them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/priests-on-fast-pray-for-pandemic-end/articleshow/82467284.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Comparison between these two months revealed high number of cases in April and less case fatality rate (CFR) compared with September last year.The city had recorded 1,18,348 cases in April, 3.19 times more than that registered in September last year (37,141). Fatalities were 1,223 in April for a CFR of 1.03% whereas it was 1,148 in September last year for a CFR of 3.09%.In the age group of 30 and below, 18 (0.17%) out of 10,813 had died in September last year. The number almost doubled to 34 in April but CFR was less compared with September last year. The percentage among total deaths is high in April (2.78%) than September (1.57%).The same was the scenario in the age group of 31-50 years. 269 (0.56%) out of the total 47,750 could not survive in April. CFR of this age group was higher in September last year as 222 (1.51%) out of the total 14,667 died. But the share of this group in total deaths increased from 19.34% in September to 22% in April.The highest number of fatalities was registered in the above 51 age group in April as well as September. CFR in April was very less at 2.8% as 920 succumbed as against 32,853 patients. CFR was 7.79% in September as deaths were 908 as against cases of 11,611 in this age group.The only change is that the share of this age group in total fatalities declined from 79.09% in September to 75.22% in April.“The decline in CFR in the above 51 age group may be due to vaccination. This age group is the most vulnerable. Many from this age group took the first dose in March of which a few went for the second dose in April. The authorities should conduct a study in this regard for confirmation. I feel CFR will further drop in this age group after the booster dose for this entire group is complete,” intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe told TOI.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Deaths were on the higher in the senior category in the second wave if one were to go by the NMC data. However, the number of young people hospitalized this time is very high compared with the first wave. Also, the infection was severe in young people in the second wave compared with the first,” he said.The scenario was slightly different in rural parts of the district. Of the 857 deceased in April, 30 (3.5%) were 30 and below. In the age group of 31-50, 257 (29.99%) died while 570 (66.51%) succumbed from the above 51 years age category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-infected-37745-below-30-years-99-91-recovered-in-city-in-april/articleshow/82466457.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

They are ready to provide medical oxygen to the hospitals for the ongoing pandemic,” he added. Explaining the modus operandi, Singh said, “The hospitals have to submit an application to the administration and upon approval, they can get their empty oxygen cylinders refilled from BSL. The GST charges will also be exempted.” He did not mention the date but said that the process is expected to begin soon. Besides the state government, BSL has been supplying liquid medical oxygen to Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra via road, railways and air for over a month now. “We are producing 150 tons of medical oxygen daily. If the private hospitals require it, they can approach the district administration and we will help them accordingly,” BSL’s chief spokesperson Manikant Dhan told TOI. Bokaro currently has nearly 3,000 active cases, while 400 patients are currently admitted at Bokaro General Hospital, sadar hospital and other Covid care centres, including private ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsl-to-provide-free-oxygen-to-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82467345.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A two-day meeting of the political affairs committee will be held on May 18 and 19 to finalize the revamp in the party. Earlier, at the meeting most leaders took the same stand and accepted responsibility for the defeat of the party. However, a few leaders criticized Mullappally Ramachandran, Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy for the poll debacle. In his opening remarks, Ramachandran alleged that he is being cornered for the poll debacle while defeat in elections is a collective responsibility. He alleged that there is an attempt to oust him unceremoniously. However, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, who spoke soon afterwards, made it clear that everyone has equal responsibility and hence there is no point in targeting a single leader for the poll debacle. Meanwhile, former chief minister Oommen Chandy said he is the first person responsible for the defeat as he was the chairman of the election committee. Both Chennithala and Chandy said they are ready to accept the decisions taken by AICC in the coming days. Soon, all senior leaders like K Sudhakaran, K Muraleedharan and VD Satheesan opined that there was no point in singling out leaders for the defeat. We all have a collective responsibility for this defeat and hence a thorough introspection is required. Not just cosmetic changes but a massive revamp right from the bottom level to the KPCC is required, they said in unison. There was a collective opinion that all jumbo district congress committees and even the KPCC should be dismantled and a new effective committee should come in its place. The meeting also decided to collect reports from mandalam, booth, block and district-level committees on what went wrong and where. KPCC general secretaries and party MPs, who were given charge of each constituency and district, will be meeting all candidates individually to collect their feedback.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/massive-revamp-on-the-cards-for-cong-in-kerala/articleshow/82467348.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Hemant launches website to facilitate booking of Covid beds||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Friday launched www.amritvahini.in, a centralised website managed by the state government’s department of health, medical education and family welfare. The website will enable Covid-19 patients and their relatives to book beds at Covid-19 hospitals across the state on a real-time basis. “Using the website or the mobile application, beds — both oxygen supported and non-oxygen supported — can be booked. However, if the patient does not turn up at the hospital within two hours of booking a bed, the bed will be allotted in another patient’s name based on the condition of medical emergency,” Soren said after the launch. Till 6pm on Friday, none of the 41 private hospitals and nursing homes in Ranchi, which has been designated as Covid-19 hospital, had any ventilator-equipped ICU beds available for booking. “What is the use of online websites if there are no beds in the first place?” Ashok Pal, the relative of a Covid-19 patient in Doranda, said. However, oxygen-supported beds and ventilator-equipped ICU beds were available at the Military Hospital in Namkum and CCL Hospital in Gandhi Nagar, the website said. Soren also inaugurated a WhatsApp number (8595524447) for Covid-19 patients in home isolation seeking doctor consultations over video calls, advice on diets and medicines. “As many as 800 patients were provided oxygen-supported beds through the Covid circuit initiative, which was launched a week ago. We have already arranged the delivery of medical kits to 43,000 patients living in home isolation. The efforts are underway to provide better medical facilities to the patients despite the growing challenges,” Soren said. However, patients living in home isolation challenged Soren’s claims. “Forget medical kits, there was no contact from district Covid-19 control helpline. I had a hard time getting my family members tested. I purchased pulse oximeters at four times the MRP myself and am consuming medicines under advice from private doctors whom I consulted virtually. There is a shortage of drugs at the pharmacies. There was no medical kit of any sort given to us,” Pankaj Jha, a Covid-19 patient living in Dangratoli area of Ranchi, told TOI over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-launches-website-to-facilitate-booking-of-cov-beds/articleshow/82467377.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Poll victory not just due to Pinarayi Vijayan, it’s a collective win’||KOCHI: Giving a message that CPM’S central leadership won’t allow an authoritarian rule in Kerala, the party mouthpiece – People’s Democracy– ran an editorial which stated the LDF victory in Kerala was the result of individual and collective efforts. As far as CPM and LDF are concerned, the new ministry will continue the tradition of collective work and individual responsibility, read the editorial. The editorial stated that the LDF government in Kerala was re-elected with a big mandate, which is significant. But, there is an effort by a section of the media to reduce this historic victory to the personality and role of Pinarayi Vijayan. According to them, it is the emergence of a ‘supreme leader or strongman’ that helped LDF win the polls. Nevertheless, the victory is the result of individual and collective efforts, stated the editorial. Given the criticism that Vijayan has been controlling the party and the government in Kerala, the views aired in the party mouthpiece assume significance. “The editorial testifies that the party has taken serious note of the portrayal of Vijayan as captain and supreme leader. The propaganda is spread by using the media,” said political observer NM Pearson. “It is good that the party has come forward to discuss the issue through an open platform. This will help purgation within the party. I think Vijayan himself will recognize the danger in promoting such campaigns,” he said. At the same time, CPM politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan declined to comment on the issue by saying that ‘let the media give their own interpretations’. Unlike previous election campaigns, the main campaigner for LDF this time was Vijayan. The CM-centred campaign led to some of the rank and file and sympathizers addressing him as captain. Media also gave publicity to such campaigns. Vijayan, who led the party as the secretary for three consecutive terms, has command over the party as well as the government. Still, the editorial gives Vijayan credit for his contribution in LDF scripting a major victory. Vijayan as the chief minister set a new standard in providing political guidance to policy making, always keeping public interest in mind and displaying administrative ability in getting policies implemented, the editorial stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poll-victory-not-just-due-to-vijayan-its-a-collective-win/articleshow/82467399.cms||---

So we contacted the state health department and are hoping that help reaches us soon,” Anand told TOI. Anand also said 12 ventilators, donated by NTPC and others at the HMCH last year, are now functional after restoration. Out of the 42 ventilators at HMCH, only five were operational. The district currently has 600 Covid-19 beds, of which 160 are oxygen-supported. Under its corporate social responsibility scheme, NTPC is currently constructing a piped oxygen supply line at HMCH and other hospitals. The officials of NTPC’s Pakri-Barwadih coal project said the management has provide the district administration with Rs 24 lakh from its CSR fund on Thursday to augment infrastructure at Covid-19 hospitals in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/technicians-arrive-at-hmch-to-restore-defunct-ventilator-beds/articleshow/82467408.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With lockdown in many states triggering a reverse migration of the workers, East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar has directed the district officials to identify buildings which can be readied as quarantine centres. Nearly 6.2 lakh migrant workers returned to Jharkhand during the lockdown last year. The state government has recently made it mandatory for all returning migrant workers to undergo Covid-19 tests upon arrival and stay at quarantine centres for a week if they test negative in Rapid Antigent Test (RAT). Out of nine blocks in East Singhbhum, five have reported less than 500 cases so far in the second wave while two have reported over 1,000 Covid-19 infections. Urban areas such as Jamshedpur, Mango and Jugsalai have reported nearly 35,000 cases in the second wave. The mortality is also much lower in the rural areas of the district (27) compared to the urban areas (739). In Ranchi, deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan on Friday inspected the quarantine centre which has been set up for migrant workers at the Tana Bhagat Indoor Stadium in Mega Sports Complex in Hotwar. A statement issued by the Ranchi district’s public relations department said that besides the medical facilities, sanitation, water supply and electricity, the quarantined migrant workers will also be provided meals by the administration. At Hatia railway station, migrant workers bound for other districts will be provided with buses, where they will be tested and quarantined for a week. “In case of migrant workers who are from urban areas, they will be quarantined at Hotwar and if they test negative through RAT after a week, they will be allowed to go to their homes,” the statement read. Migrants from rural parts of the district will be ferried to their respective block headquarters and will be tested through RAT and will be quarantined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/dists-scout-for-spaces-to-set-up-quarantine-centres/articleshow/82476334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The problem has become acute, especially in the rural parts of the district. In the city, pulse oximeters were being sold at twice their maximum retail prices as many pharmacies have run out of stock. “The oximeters, which are priced at Rs 1,500 a piece, are now being sold at Rs 3,600 and above. But since stocks have thinned, there is no other choice but to pay hefty amounts,” Manoj Kumar, a Sector-2 resident, said. Dinesh Agarwal, a local, said: “Tablets like B Complex, Vitamin C and Zinc capsules are missing from many drug stores. Most of them are saying that the supplies are not sufficient to meet the growing demands of Paracetamol, Azithromycin, Zincovit and other drugs as well.” “You cannot get all the drugs in one store and will have to invariably hop three to four shops,” Sujit Singh, a local, said. Druggists were attributing the lack of stock to panic buying. “With Covid-19 cases rising in the second wave, residents have purchased the medicines in large quantities and stocked them in their homes,” Brajesh Pandey, the owner of Baba Medical Center in Sector 4, said. Umesh Singh, a wholesaler of medicine, said: “At present, the supply of most of the medicines is less. In addition to general medicines, flow metres, steam dispensers and nebulizers are very much in demand. Many of the suppliers and their staff have also been infected. Due to this also the supply chain has been affected.” The district administration has directed the drug inspectors to ensure availability of medicines at the stores. Till Friday evening, the district recorded 13,942 Covid cases, of which 3,005 were active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-faces-medicine-crunch-prices-skyrocket-amid-cov-surge/articleshow/82467469.cms||---

Om Prakash Jaggi of the Punjabi Samaj said the move was necessitated by the rise in the number of deaths and the resultant shortage of timber in some crematoriums. As many as 50 bodies are being brought to the crematoriums on daily basis reportedly and with electric furnaces lying defunct at a couple of places, families of Covid victims have no option but to depend on wood for performing the last rites. Meanwhile, the community is also planning to open Covid care centres – equipped with oxygen-supported beds -- in nearly all the gurdwaras across the district. Earlier, the Sikhs had opened a Covid care centre at Sakchi. They are also providing meals to the Covid-affected families. Last year, all the gurdwaras here had provided meals/dry ration to the Covid patients and the migrant workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-city-sikhs-donate-40-tons-of-wood-to-2-crematoriums/articleshow/82467521.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

---||Kochi||Kerala: NDA nominee alleges BJP vote leak in Devikulam||IDUKKI: After a major setback in Devikulam constituency in the district, the NDA candidate alleged that he didn’t get a single vote from BJP in the assembly election despite the Tamil Nadu-model AIADMK-BJP alliance. The alliance fielded two candidates, in Idukki and Palakkad, under the NDA banner. But the alliance candidate S Ganeshan secured only 4,717 votes. The Tamil Nadu-based political party tried for a political space in Devikulam, where the majority of voters are of Tamil origin, but it failed. “In the previous assembly election, BJP got 9,592 votes in Devikulam. Where has the BJP votes gone this time? LDF got an unexpected victory with the help of some groups. I got only AIADMK votes. The AIADMK-BJP alliance was a big failure in Devikulam,” said Ganeshan. But BJP Idukki district general secretary V N Suresh refuted the allegation. “The alliance candidate has got only BJP votes and didn’t get any AIADMK votes. As per the alliance, the seat was for AIADMK and they fielded their candidate. But the nomination was rejected due to their issues, and they supported an independent candidate.” AIADMK state secretary G Shobakumar said that the less number of votes in Devikulam shows that the candidate didn’t get BJP votes in Devikulam. “R M Dhanalakshmi had filed nomination from Devikulam and Naseema Sharafudeen was fielded in Mannarkkad in Palakkad district. After the nomination of AIADMK candidate was rejected, AIADMK supported independent candidate Ganeshan, who contested on NDA ticket. Sharafudeen got 10,243 votes and it was the best performance for the party. The AIADMK central committee meeting will decide further on the alliance with BJP in Kerala,” said Shobakumar. It was an experiment based on Tamil Nadu-model where AIADMK was in alliance with NDA. The papers of AIADMK Devikulam candidate Dhanalakshmi and two other dummy candidates were rejected during scrutiny. In 2016, AIADMK candidate Dhanalakshmi bagged 11,613 votes in Devikulam and came third. BJP candidate N Chandran received 9,592 votes. CPM leader S Rajendran won the election with 49,510 votes against UDF candidate A K Mani who got 43,728 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nda-nominee-alleges-bjp-vote-leak-in-devikulam/articleshow/82467578.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Kolkata||Bengal: 2nd jabs at government units for private hospital recipients||KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Friday told all private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) to send their first-dose recipients to state-run centres for their second doses and also, sent a list of 173 units where their inoculation would be completed. The advisory came as the Centre turned down the state’s proposal to procure vaccines on the behalf of private hospitals.  During a meeting with private hospitals at Swasthya Bhawan on Friday evening, senior health officials reportedly conveyed their inability to get them vaccines.  “As the prices of vaccines vary for the government quota and private hospitals, we have been told the Centre turned down the state proposal to procure vaccines for private hospitals. All the members of AHEI (Association of Hospitals of Eastern India) will convene a meeting soon and take a look at how best to handle the situation,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua, who is also the AHEI president. “We have appealed to the government to take another look into the situation. Senior officials said they would give it a thought.” Private CVCs have been flooded with calls and inquiries from anxious citizens, whose second doses have already been due or nearing the scheduled date. “Every day, we are getting 50 to 60 calls from people whose second doses are due. We have no answer. We urge the government to bail us out,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. The number of second doses pending at private CVCs ranged between 2,000 and 10,000, depending on the number of sites they had been operating during the drive. But since May 1, the inoculation drive at private hospitals has been suspended as no vaccine has been available to them.  “We are not concerned about the first dose as we can start the drive once we get our own procurement. But people whose second doses are due are extremely anxious at this point of time. We are helpless as we don’t have any vaccine with us,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospitals. The government has also suggested micro-tagging of private CVCs with specific and select government units, which are on the list of 173. Once this is done, all private hospitals can tell their respective second-dose recipients to visit those state-run centres. “This is a welcome move by the government to ease the process of selecting CVCs. Once we get the list of centres, tagged with RN Tagore, we will share them with our eligible recipients,” said R Venkatesh Zonal, director (East), Narayana Health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2nd-jabs-at-govt-units-for-pvt-hosp-recipients/articleshow/82467582.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Cantor’s Giant Softshell turtle, one of the rarest turtle species in India and one of the largest freshwater turtles in the world, can grow to over one metre in length and weigh over 100kg. The finding of three nests along Chandragiri banks was possible due to community-led conservation initiative by conservation biologist Ayushi Jain. She is a research affiliate of Wildlife Institute of India, who had been in search of the turtle in Kasaragod for over two years. “It is the first time that an active nesting area and eggs of this rare and endangered turtle are found in the country. This discovery tells us that there is a breeding population in India of a species that was a mystery until now to the scientific world. It is extremely crucial information to direct focused-conservation efforts to bring back this turtle from the dangers of extinction,” Jain said. Abdulla Kunji, a local farmer from Mottal and who was part of the community network, found the three nestings. The nests had to be kept in artificial incubation as there was a risk of it getting flooded following the rise in water levels along the river banks due to the closing of dam shutters. The eggs were kept buried in river sand and provided heat needed for hatching. After around three months, six hatchlings that emerged so far have been released into the river and they are expecting more hatchlings in the coming week. Cantor’s Giant Softshell turtles, being elusive, spend most of their time under the river sand. The turtle is also known as ‘frog-faced softshell’ due to its odd facial features and is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List. The project to create a community network of key informants and trained locals who can rescue, rehabilitate and safely release the by-catches of the rare species was implemented with support from Zoological Society of London, National Geographic Society and Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund. Information on nesting behaviour of this species is a first in the country. Earlier, the only information on nesting of this species is from Cambodia and China. In the past 45 years, records of the species in India have been scarce. Based on published scientific reports, there are only 10 individuals recorded in the country before the project started. “Various anthropogenic activities like sand mining, unscientific dam construction, potential hunting and consumption of eggs by humans threaten the very survival of this species. The mitigation of identified threats to the nests will be addressed in the next phase of the project,” Jain said. Cantor’s Giant Softshell turtles were previously spotted in Valapattanam river, Kutiady river and from Varkala, among a few other rivers in the state though no population assessment has been carried out till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/rare-turtle-nestings-in-kasaragod/articleshow/82467620.cms||---

The hospital is one of the six institutes in India where the Phase-III trial of the vaccine will be conducted. The clinical trial team at the hospital is waiting for the nod from its internal ethics committee. “We have been selected as one the sites for the Phase-III India trial of J&J. Unlike other vaccines, this is a single-shot one. We plan to get 100 volunteers for the trial at our site,” said Peerless Hospitals director (clinical research & academics) and clinical trials specialist Subhrojyoti Bhowmick. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine has been developed by Janssen Vaccines in Leiden, Netherlands. Its Phase-III trial has already been conducted in various countries, including Argentina, the US, South Africa, Brazil and Chile, involving around 43,000 people. In January 2021, Janssen announced that 28 days of inoculation, the vaccine was 66% effective in a one-dose regimen in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, with an 85% efficacy in preventing severe Covid-19 and 100% in preventing hospitalization or death caused by the disease. This will be the first time the vaccine’s efficacy will be tried on the Indian population, involving around 600 volunteers. At Peerless Hospital, the trial team will attempt to enrol 100 people for the exercise. It will also be a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, where a section of the volunteers will get the actual vaccine and the rest placebo. All those administered the placebo will get the actual vaccine jab once the trial is unfolded. “This vaccine can be administered to anyone above 18 years of age. Even if they had contracted the novel coronavirus, they can take the vaccine after 15 days of the infection. Therefore, any volunteer willing to enrol for the trial but had been infected can come forward 15 days after the contraction,” said Bhowmick, who was the principal investigator of the Phase-III study of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine at Peerless. Debarati Kundu, another clinical trial specialist, will be the co-investigator this time. Covaxin trials were held at NICED, Kolkata. A viral vector vaccine, the vials can be stored in temperature ranging between 9 degrees Celsius and 25 degrees Celsius. It has already been granted emergency use authorisation by US Drug and Food Administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/peerless-to-hold-jj-shot-phase-iii-trial/articleshow/82467622.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Blood tests, too, getting delayed||Kolkata: Not just the Covid RT-PCR tests that are getting delayed, even other pathological investigations including blood tests required to monitor the health condition of Covid patients in home isolation is becoming a challenge. The lead time between sample collected and the result has increased to 72 hours or longer due to the pressure on laboratories. Among those affected are persons with comorbidities like sugar, cholesterol and high blood pressure. Such patients are prescribed a battery of tests including inflammatory marker tests like D-dimer and IL6 (interleukin-6) to assess if there is blood clotting. “These tests enable us to decide the future course of treatment including what drugs are to be prescribed, if a CT scan is needed or if the patient needs hospitalisation,” said Dr AK Ghosh, specialist in medicine. Several private labs are facing a shortage of enzymes and reagents required for these tests. The IL6 test reveals whether there is threat from a cytokine storm in the body or essentially a hyper-response to the virus from the immune system that actually causes more harm to the body than good. It is based on this test that a doctor prescribes steroids or Remdesivir. While it would take a day to get these test done till recently, the wait time has now shot up to three days for D-dimer and Ferritin test reports. Even the chest CT scan that usually takes 12 hours to a day to be prepared is now taking upto two days. Amitayu Sarkar of Sakher Bazar in Behala who was asked to undergo both the tests seven days ago after he felt heaviness in his chest was put on mild dose of steroids to control the Ferritin level. When he was asked for a repeat test, the lab informed him it would take at least three days to prepare the D-dimer report due to the long queue ahead. The labs believe this is a temporary congestion that will pass in a while. “Since we have multiple platforms for the same test, we have been able to manage gaps in supply from certain vendors,” said an official at Pulse Diagnostics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/blood-tests-too-getting-delayed/articleshow/82467650.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Nothing personal against Pinarayi: Muraleedharan||Thiruvananthapuram: Union minister V Muraleedharan said on Friday that his criticisms against Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan should not be interpreted as a personal attack on Vijayan. “I am not making any personal attack on him. I am only acting as a corrective force. BJP won’t run away because of the setback it received in the elections. We would continue to work as a corrective force in the democratic discourse. BJP would study the reasons for the erosion of votes in certain constituencies. There is no basis for vote trading charges. If votes are lost because of trade, Pinarayi Vijayan, who is also the politburo member of his party, should clarify whether CPM had sold off all its votes,” he said. Muraleedharan said BJP’s performance in Kazhakkoottam and Nemom, where its candidates finished second, were promising. He also alleged the involvement of jihadi elements in LDF’s election victory. He said BJP and CPM share a common reaction on West Bengal. “It’s total lawlessness there,” he said. Muraleedharan said he has brought to the notice of the concerned central minister about Kerala chief minister’s request for allocation of more medical oxygen. “Imported oxygen is being distributed in accordance with the needs of states. There will be more interventions on this front in the coming days. Despatch of oxygen to different states is being carried out using all available facilities, including oxygen trains. No state needs to be worried over its availability. They only need to ensure the availability of enough tankers for the movement of the consignments within the states,” he said. According to the Union minister, Kerala government could so far set up only two of the four oxygen plants sanctioned by the Centre and expressed worry over the same. He asked why the state government was not taking steps to regulate the Covid treatment charges in private hospitals. “The state health minister claimed last July that the rates were regulated. The astronomical charges demanded by private hospitals for Covid treatment is scary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nothing-personal-against-pinarayi-muraleedharan/articleshow/82467664.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Quoting docs, HC says Tocilizumab replacements more effective||Nagpur: In view of Tocilizumab’s severe shortage across the nation, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, while quoting doctors, noted that its replacement drugs such as Itulizumab, Dexamethasone and Methyl Prednisolone are more effective for Covid patients. “We request the medical fraternity to give a serious consideration to the Central government’s opinion for treating Covid patients with these alternative drugs, if the need arises on account of Tocilizumab’s non-availability,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said on Friday. During the hearing of the suo motu PIL where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae assisted by Nidhi Dayani, the centre informed that it had submitted an affidavit at the principal seat in Mumbai presided over by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta mentioning about the alternatives available to the Tocilizumab injections. “There are other alternative drugs which are equally efficacious in treating serious Covid patients. If Tocilizumab injections aren’t available, it’s not the end of the matter. Doctors can still consider prescribing the drugs which are said to be alternatives to Tocilizumab,” the affidavit stated. The judges reiterated to the Vidarbha Industries’ Association (VIA) to submit information about companies in the region, including their location, profit earned and other details. The intervener’s counsel M Anil Kumar had already submitted a list of 59 companies and VIA lawyer Jatin Kumar filed another list of firms that had spent their CSR funds in 2020-21. “If there are any members who aren’t cooperating and responding, we direct the VIA president to submit the names of such disobedient and erring companies so that further action can be taken in the matter,” the justices said. On the supply of Remidesivir, they pointed out that it would be convenient for everybody to understand the commitment shown by manufacturing companies if a chart providing details of its district-wise supply to Maharashtra and figures of daily production is furnished. Miffed over non-compliance of some of its orders, the bench directed government pleader Ketki Joshi to submit information in respect of the remaining issues, including commissioning of the Bhandara oxygen plant before the next date. “Today, it has been brought to our notice that even though a PSA technology-based oxygen plant at Bhandara has been installed, it’s yet to be commissioned. There are also several other issues in respect of which information would be required,” the bench said. Earlier, Aniket Nair, pleading for Cadila India Limited, informed that an affidavit has been already filed indicating that the company has complied with the HC directives. “As regards the company’s need to send Remdesivir as per daily quota allocated to it under the state-wise allocation made by the Centre, we would request Cadila to place on record all the details in that regard,” the bench noted before adjourning the hearing till May 12. HC lauds WCL, CIL & MOIL for granting CSR funds to fight Covid The bench lauded WCL, CIL and MOIL for generously donating substantial amounts under corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds at a time when they were urgently needed in the fight against Covid. “Our appreciation of the philanthropic gestures of their board of directors and the concerned committees should be communicated to them.” Earlier, WCL counsel Mugdha and Rohan Chandurkar informed that the company had released Rs 11.88 crore to the collector and requested for directives on its spending. Assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar informed that MOIL had allocated Rs 3.35 crore as per the HC directives. “A decision regarding spending of this fund on the lines suggested by us earlier shall be taken by the collector. We direct that the funds received from WCL and CIL be utilized for setting up oxygen-generation plants at the GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS as mentioned in their pact with the collector on May 4,” the justices said. The bench reminded the respondents about its order to take over possession of oxygen cylinders of private agencies, including Asiatic Oxygen on Kamptee Road and making them functional. Joshi, however, contended that the process will require a further 10-12 days for completion and sought time, which was granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/quoting-docs-hc-says-tocilizumab-replacements-more-effective/articleshow/82467677.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||India||Delhi has most Covid cases & deaths per million population||Delhi has the maximum Covid cases and deaths per million of all states in India. This is true whether we take into account all cases and deaths so far since the start of the pandemic or just those since the start of April this year. Of course, Delhi being a completely urban territory, the comparison with states can be misleading since the disease remains much more of an urban phenomenon than a rural one. Following Delhi in terms of deaths per million from April onwards is Chhattisgarh with Maharashtra not too far behind. If we consider all deaths so far, the two states flip positions. Uttarakhand, which has been less in the headlines, and Punjab round off the top five in terms of deaths per million since the beginning of April. Kerala has the second highest ratio of cases per million, behind Maharashtra on the all-time list and behind Delhi for the period since April 1, but its very low fatality rate means that in terms of deaths per million, it is way down in the list. Tamil Nadu to a lesser extent follows the same pattern. This analysis is based on official data on cases and deaths and hence may be understating the ratios to the extent that these are being undercounted. That also means that states in which there is less of undercounting will show up comparatively worse than those where the problem is more acute. The period since the beginning of April has accounted for 43% of total cases and 30% of all deaths in just over a month, a measure of how severe the second wave of the pandemic in India has been. As the graphic shows, several of the smaller states like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are among the worst hit in this wave viewed in proportion to their populations. In fact, in eight states — Gujarat (52%), Rajasthan (53%), MP (54%), Chhattisgarh (57%), UP (57%), Uttarakhand (54%), Jharkhand (54%), and Bihar (52%) — over half of all cases so far have come in just the 36 days since the start of April. In Jharkhand (68%) and Chhattisgarh (58%) over half of deaths too have come during this period while in Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttarakhand over 40% of all deaths have been in this five-week period.

---||Kolkata||Travel travails: Bus operators slash services for low passenger count, may suspend routes||Kolkata: A large number of buses vanished from the streets on Friday, causing immeasurable inconvenience for commuters. Now that local trains have been suspended to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, office-goers have to largely depend on buses. But private bus operators, who share nearly 70% of the passenger count in greater Kolkata, said commercial non-viability due to fewer commuters forced them to keep full operations on hold. Also, most bus workers could not make it to the depots owing to the suspended local train services. “Commuting has again turned nightmarish. I usually take a train from Khardah to travel to Kolkata, where I work at an office in Moulali. Now, I have to spend almost thrice the amount, and travek on overcrowded buses. The return journey is worse, with buses disappearing in the second half,” said Aloke Roy, a comuter. Bus operators on Friday again demanded fare revision, citing diesel price rise and the pandemic-induced financial distress. They also urged the state and the Centre to waive their EMIs, insurance premiums and to offer tax exemption. “The abnormal rise of diesel prices has crippled our operations,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. Suspension of train services has hit bus operators on two counts. “Without train passengers, our volumes go down. The fare revision alone may not revive the ailing public transport system. We want help from the Centre to be exempted of taxes and EMIs,” said Rahul Chattopadhyay of All Bengal Bus O Minibus Samannay Samiti. Moreover, operators said, many bus workers usually lived on the bus for a few days and returned home for a break. Now, they did not feel safe to do so. Also, those workers could not now commute to the city as local trains were not running. Pointing out the situation might worsen on the weekend, bus operators said 70 buses ran on routes 12C and 12C/1A on a normal day between Konchowki-Pailan and Howrah, but 20 plied on Friday. Route KB-15 connecting Anandapur with Satragachhi has 15 buses but three operated on Friday. The route might be suspended on the weekend. Route 215 withdrew services on Thursday and ran only 10 buses on Friday. Inter-district buses, however, took the advantage of suspended local train services. Buses from Kolkata to North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Midnapore stated they made profits. “After a long time, the sales have risen,” said Ganesh Hazra, a conductor on a Raichak-Kolkata route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/travel-travails-bus-operators-slash-services-for-low-passenger-count-may-suspend-routes/articleshow/82467697.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Vijayarghavan, in his article, alleged that the NSS general secretary came up with a public statement on the morning of the polling day to give a communal flavour to the efforts of those who wanted to torpedo the LDF government. In the article, he compared the situation ahead of the polls to ‘vimochana samaram’ where UDF and BJP in the state were hand in glove to lead several agitations against the Left government. He compared the role of the central probe agencies who tried to stall development here to the role played by the Centre during the vimochana samaram. Meanwhile, Nair said that the reference made by the CPM leader in the article against NSS is aimed at more provocation. “The source of such interpretations is the reply given to the media on the voting day. If NSS wanted to make a public statement against the LDF government it has the rectitude to do it much before that,” said Nair. NSS through its just and timely stand have opposed all political leaderships and governments. That was for social justice and not for any other benefits for NSS, he said. He also said that NSS differs with the LDF government on the issue of protection of faith. He also termed the reference made by Vijayaraghavan in the article as “meaningless” and part of the “hidden agenda of some to defame NSS”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nss-chief-cpm-spat-continues/articleshow/82467699.cms||---

Speaking at “Keraleeyam 2021” programme organized by the Press Club here, Balagopal alleged that like in 2016 assembly polls BJP and Congress had a tacit understanding. “In Kundara and Eravipuram, UDF received the BJP votes. While BJP had a drop in their vote share in these constituencies it recorded an increase in votes in Chathannoor , he pointed out. Balagopal said RSP state secretary AA Aziz’s statement that it would consider a change from the current political front was a positive sign. “LDF has already pointed out that RSP’s decision to join UDF for protecting the selfish interest of a single person was suicidal to that party. He alleged that media had indulged in character assassination in raking up issues like deep sea fishing,” he said. To solve the traffic bottle neck in Kottarakkara town would be a priority, Balagopal said. Steps to promote the agriculture sector would be taken, he added. J Chinchurani, who was elected from Chadayamangalam, said LDF could resolve the rift within the party in the initial phase. “There was no doubt about victory at any stage.

Realising the difficulty, a city-based paediatrician having his private practice, has started volunteering at the GMERS Gotri Hospital to lend a helping had to the doctors there. Dr Rahul Thanawala practices at Manjalpur and Akota in the city and is amongst the prominent paediatricians in the city. Last week, he decided to offer his services as a volunteer to any suitable government hospital in the city that is bearing the brunt of the pandemic and staff shortage. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials coordinated with the hospital that too agreed. “You can get beds, but not doctors. I realised that young doctors who have been working overtime may be finding it difficult to even take a break for a few minutes. I thought I could lend a helping hand that may be good enough to allow them a break,” Thanawala said. Thanawala has been assigned duty in the newly erected dome in the hospital compound which the Quick Response Treatment Centre. From here patients are taken to other wards. Thanawala said that he went for duty every day for three hours from 3pm to 6pm. He discontinued his OPD in one of his clinics to do this. “My family was concerned initially but understood when I told them that there were many like me who were exposed every day while treating Covid patients. I have had Covid once and have been vaccinated too. I take necessary precautions and stay away from my mother,” he said. Thanawala pointed out that the work is hectic in government hospitals these days. “Government should encourage other doctors to volunteer like this. Even doctors should come forward with help. This will take away a lot of burden on the staffers working continuously in these hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/paediatrician-skips-pvt-practice-to-volunteer-in-ncov-hospital/articleshow/82467713.cms||Sachin Sharma

The appeal follows the ‘drive-through’ vaccination initiated in two malls in Navi Mumbai that was kicked off on Friday with 140 individuals receiving the jab. Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) eastern region chairman Sushil Mohta said the large atriums of malls in Kolkata as well as spaces outside, including substantial parking facilities, that were currently unused or underutilized could be perfect for drive-in vaccination and that malls were ready to offer the space to ensure speedy and safe inoculation. “South City and Acropolis mall are ready to set up vaccination camps in the atrium. It is a large sanitized space. We have sanitation and crowd control measures in place. I have already suggested this to the state chief secretary and Home secretary,” said Mohta, adding that it could also be done in open spaces available in the malls including the parking lot. Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra, too, said the mall was being used as an infrastructure to vaccinate group employees. “We are currently equipped to offer 200 doses in a day. Once our inoculation is over, the facility can be extended for public vaccination if the government wants to utilize it. We have infrastructure for parking, toilets. We have set up chairs, outside the retail area for this,” said Mehra. Both Mehra and Mohta argued that getting Covid shots were safer in places like malls than hospitals that have turned into Covid facilities. SCAI has reached out to all its members and urged them to be part of the solution by providing space in their respective malls which will add on to the current vaccination camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malls-offer-space-for-vaccination/articleshow/82467714.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The inferior quality paddy is brought from Tamil Nadu at Rs 15 per kg and sold in the name of farmers through agents to SupplyCo at a procurement price of Rs 27.48 per kg, a profit of Rs 12 per kg. The paddy is brought from Tamil Nadu and included in the yield of farmers who did not sell it to SupplyCo’s procurement scheme. This fraud is done at the last lap of procurement, the farmers said. They said that SupplyCo has no system to stop the smuggling of inferior-quality paddy at low price from Tamil Nadu and sold for higher price through the paddy procurement scheme of the state at higher support price. In the current second crop of paddy in the district, SupplyCo procured a record 1.17 lakh metric tonne from 60,000 registered farmers so far.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/low-quality-paddy-smuggled-sold-to-supplco/articleshow/82467726.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||With no local trains, it’s back on cycles again to reach office||Kolkata: The pandemic fad of biking to work is back for the blue-collar workers as local trains are shut down once again due to the Covid lockdown. Gobinda Sardar is once again cycling from Hogla to his office at Salt Lake’s CGO complex. The 36-year-old contractual multi-tasking staff (MTS), as he is designated in his central government office, cycles eight hours a day, to and from the city, to cover some 120km from Dakshin Barasat in South 24-Parganas. “As soon as I reach home, I drop dead. It will be okay after a few days,” rued Sardar. Last summer, he had gone through similar ordeal. “When local trains resumed in November, I gave up cycling. Never imagined I would have to do this again,” he sighed. Driver Dilip Haldar, too, has resumed cycling from his Sonarpur residence to report to work at Ultadanga. “It took me an hour on local trains. Now, I bike two hours to work. The roads are empty since only 50% buses are allowed. It’s not all that bad,” the 40-year-old said. But Sardar carries a jerrycan of water, glucose and a plastic bag full of puffed rice to keep himself hydrated and somewhat full for these prolonged rides. He also stops at roadside tea shops, sits under the shade. His wife often calls to check how he was doing. “The government notification mandates 50% work-from-home (WFH). But Sardar’s job of running errands and carrying files can’t be categorized as WFH. Since he is on contract a daily attendance is a must,” his supervisor at CGO complex explained. “Kolkata, never known as a great cycling city, for reasons ranging from bad roads to traffic congestion and pollution, started pedalling with gusto during the pandemic. It may be tough for some people, but biking wards of Covid and helps maintain distancing,” said environmentalist S M Ghosh. Kolkata Police’s traffic department officials said since Thursday, cyclists are hitting the road in large numbers. “We can see them on Howrah bridge, coming in to the city from the districts. The number of cyclists peak around 9am. The flow reverses from 5pm,” said an official. Same for Diamond Harbour Road where cyclists from South 24-Parganas are seen pedalling furiously in the mornings and returning home, in relatively slower pace, in the evenings. It’s a compulsion because the fear of job-loss looms once again. Bablu Das, a worker at a manufacturing unit near Ruby hospital, said, “I start from my house at 6am to reach the factory at 9am. Without a bike, it would take me longer because of the multiple breaks en route.” He is using the cycle his daughter had received as a beneficiary of the state government’s “Sabuj Sathi” scheme. But not everyone feels up to the daily pedalling. Ajoy Parui, a 50-year-old gardener from Joynagar, said, “I am staying back at a friend’s in Jadavpur for two days so I take breaks from cycling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-no-local-trains-its-back-on-cycles-again-to-reach-office/articleshow/82467728.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat needs 1,600MT oxygen on May 15, Centre quota 975MT||AHMEDABAD: The state of Gujarat has requested the Union government to increase its present 975MT allocation of medical oxygen by projecting an estimated demand of 1,600 MT on May 15, because of the rate with which Covid-19 cases are rising in the state. In his affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on Friday, Gujarat chief secretary Anil Mukim stated that there is no increase in oxygen allocation to Gujarat despite repeated requests to the Centre. He submitted, “The Government of India has not increased the allocation to the state beyond 975MT and the same has been creating tremendous distress to the patients seeking hospitalization and oxygen therapy, resulting in denial of medical treatment to the needy despite availability of beds and qualified personnel in hospitals.” Similar words found place in Mukim’s request sent on May 5 to the Union home secretary and he requested the Centre to increase allocation of medical oxygen to 1,200MT for that day and 1,400 MT for May 12. “Please appreciate the seriousness of the issue and kindly increase the allocation at the earliest,” his letter reads. In it he mentioned that looking at the rise in Covid-19 cases and increase in oxygen supported beds in the state, there will be a requirement of 1,600MT Oxygen in Gujarat on May 15. Mukim wrote that on April 26, Gujarat needed 1,190MT oxygen as against supply of 975MT and it had requested for 190MT additional supply on that day. On April 26, total oxygen beds were 53,913 (5,837 ICU with ventilator, 6,735 ICU without ventilator, 41,341 NRBM/nasal cannula). For last week, with an increase in Covid cases, total oxygen beds went up to 57,684 (6,429 ICU with ventilator, 7,154 ICU beds without ventilator, 43,785 NRBM/nasal cannula) - an increase of 6.4% was witnessed. Mukim further wrote, “Accordingly, our requirement of oxygen has gone up from projected 1,250MT (April 30) to 1,400MT for today (May 5) and is likely to increase to 1600 MT by May 15th.” He further said that despite mobilizing additional sources, Gujarat is not able to meet with rising demand for Oxygen and in consequence, it is not able to operationalize additional 11,500 beds with oxygen line and medical team “just for want of Oxygen”. Mukim’s letter also said that Covid-19 cases are increasing in rural areas of Gujarat and oxygen shortage is causing enormous distress resulting in long wait times for hospitalization. On May 6, Mukim wrote another letter requesting the Centre to create a buffer stock of minimum 400MT of liquid oxygen for Gujarat. This was because Gujarat witnessed two shutdowns – at Sriram Oxy in Bhavnagar on April 25, and Linde in Bharuch on April 27. “With great difficulty, the stress was mitigated. However, should a similar disruption were to happen again, then that would have life threatening consequences,” his letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-needs-1600mt-o2-on-may-15-centre-quota-975mt/articleshow/82467737.cms||---

Data collected by officials has revealed that the number of deaths in the 45 to 60 years age group had gone up significantly. In March, 25% of Covid-19 victims were from his age group. It increased significantly to 32% in the month of April. There was only a marginal rise of 1% in deaths of persons below 30 years. This increased from 1% in March to 2%in April. A 2% rise was also seen in the deaths of persons in the 60 to 75 years age group. From 43% in March, this went up to 45% in April. While the percentage of deaths in the 30 to 45 years age group remained the same, a surprise was the fall in the ratio of deaths in the age group of persons over 75 years of age. This fell from 25% to 15%. This was the only age group that witnessed a decline. The data has been shared in percentages, but officials admitted that the number of deaths in each age group were much higher in April as compared to March. The overall toll due to the pandemic had also risen significantly in April. Sharing the data officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that the trends were totally in variance with the mortality trends during the first wave. “We have to broaden the definition of high-risk patients during the second wave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/virus-more-fatal-for-45-60-age-group-in-april-than-in-march/articleshow/82467742.cms||---

For some, who have smartphones, internet data will be recharged. JU has opened an FCRA account with a nationalised bank for this. “Going by the Centre’s recommendations, we have opened this account to receive contribution from former students living abroad. We urge them to help the university bridge the digital divide,” said a JU official. After educational institutes shifted classes to the online platform last year, many students at JU faced problems as they either did not have smartphones or their net connections were weak. To ensure all could attend online classes, the university raised funds and gave smartphones to 250 students. It has also been recharging the internet data for more than 900 students since August. Last month, VC Suranjan Das urged all university stakeholders to contribute so that more students could get smartphones. “Many who contributed last year have not been able to do so again due to the worsening economic situation. But amounts are trickling in. Several former students living abroad wanted to help,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mobiles-for-students-ju-plea-to-alumni/articleshow/82467748.cms||Zeeshan Javed

A division bench comprising justices Devan Ramachandran and Kauser Edappagath made the observation in the judgment reviewing the steps taken to implement the court’s order to avoid victory celebrations on election results day. In the judgment, the court said, “The seemingly unbridled and unrestrained euphoria of an inevitable and vital democratic exercise — the local body and state legislature elections — was in full display in the last few months and one can only rue in hindsight that, perhaps, if we had been collectively a little more careful, the present crisis could have been better contained. The prophylactic ‘SMS’ against Covid-19 — sanitiser, mask and social distancing — was unfortunately lost in the din of the electoral campaigns. There is a general sentiment that we let our guard down, but we cannot let it happen again.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poll-campaigns-added-to-covid-crisis-says-hc/articleshow/82467751.cms||---

Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said that almost daily, about 3-4 hospitals sent SOS for the fast-depleting oxygen supply during night hours when regular procurement is not possible. “We acknowledge the role played by AMC in ensuring the oxygen supply during extreme emergencies. They have also averted major crisis. But we decided to set up a central facility so that the hospital administrators don’t run from pillar to post at the time of emergency,” said Dr Gadhvi. AHNA officials said that with help of CII, a central facility is created at the Blind People’s Association (BPA), Vastrapur where the bank has started with 140 oxygen cylinders. The members wish to take the number to 400 once they procure adequate cylinders. Currently, the members have donated cylinders from hospital stock for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahna-starts-emergency-oxygen-bank/articleshow/82467754.cms||---

For Pravinsinh Baria — a pilot with the 108 emergency services in Panchmahal — saving lives is above the massive tragedy on the personal front. He believes it is better to serve people than sit at home grieving. Last month Baria’s father Saburbhai took ill with Covid-19. The septuagenarian man was rushed to a Covid hospital in April. Baria did not skip duty and continued working after admitting his father at the hospital. Saburbhai passed away on April 21. Baria could have taken a few days off duty in wake of the tragedy, but remained absent from duty only on April 22. “My father breathed his last on April 21 after I had finished my shift. I performed the last rites on the same day and had to take a leave only on April 22,” he said. But even as his father was under treatment, his mother, paternal uncle and aunt and his uncle’s son were hospitalized due to Covid-19 in Godhra. Baria, a resident of Khanpur in Morva Hadaf taluka of Panchmahal district, said that the mother was not informed about his father’s death as even her condition was serious. Baria’s mother Kamlaben passed away on April 25 along with his uncle, aunt and cousin (uncle’s son). “The deaths took place within hours from morning to afternoon,” he said. Baria said that after cremations, other rituals of his mother and father were performed together. “I had to take leave from April 25 to May 1 for the rituals. I joined duty on May 2,” he said. When asked about the reasons to join the duty early, Baria said “I feel that it would be better to serve the people instead of sitting at home and grieving.” He also believed that it was better to stay busy amidst the tragedy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/better-to-serve-people-than-sit-at-home-grieving/articleshow/82467761.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Kochi||Kerala high court sets aside KU professor postings||KOCHI: Kerala high court has set aside appointments made by Kerala University through a 2017 notification that resulted in denial of opportunity to candidates of general category, as teaching vacancies in different departments were considered as one unit and reservation was applied. Justice Amit Rawal said it would lead to 100% reservation in some of the posts in which only one vacancy was available. The court considered three petitions (WP-C No. 4592/2018 and others) filed by candidates through senior advocate George Poonthottam. The court said reservation cannot be applied by taking all professor vacancies as one cadre but it has to be made subject-wise. Otherwise, it would result in a single post being kept reserved exclusively for members of backward classes, in total exclusion to the general members of the public, thus violating constitutional provisions, the judgment said. Notification issued by the university on November 27, 2017, for the appointments was quashed by the court. As per the notification, the vacancy specified as one post in each department were kept reserved for various communities falling under reserved categories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-sets-aside-ku-prof-postings/articleshow/82467765.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Calls to 104 helpline down 85% from April 19 in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: The last fortnight may not have seen a drastic decline in the number of Covid cases in the city, but the number of calls received by the 24-hours 104 ‘Sanjivani’ or fever helpline has seen a drop of 85%, from its peak of 2,539 calls on April 19.  The city on Friday reported 3,744 fresh Covid cases and 5,220 persons were discharged from various hospitals. AMC officials said that since April 1, there was a considerable increase in calls to the helpline with the first 19 days of April registering increases between 3% and 29%. The highest increase of 29% was on April 5, when calls rose to 1,221 from 945 on April 4. Similarly, there was a 21% increase in calls on April 10 when 1,990 calls were received against 1,643 calls on April 9. Officials said that in April, the 104 fever helpline got over 51k calls at an average of 1,705 calls a day. “April was the month which had the most calls to 104 since May last year when the service was launched,” said a senior officer. The officer said even when cases were increasing in the first phase or after Diwali, the number of calls was not so high. Officials said callers were in desperation and till patients got a bed they would keep calling the helpline for advice or assistance. Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar said the drop in numbers shows a decrease in the number of people in distress. The helpline was instrumental in helping people in distress and could provide instant resolution too. AMC officials said that now as case numbers fall, calls to the helpline are also dropping. He said there it is possible that calls are dropping because people are opting for home isolation packages launched by several hospitals recently. He said that at the peak, people in home isolation also relied on 104, and this is reflected in the data. By mid-April, the situation was such that the helpline was not able to attend to all calls and was just giving directions over the phone. In many cases, instead of sending medicines, helpline workers just gave callers the names of the medicines and told them to get them from the local chemist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/calls-to-104-helpline-down-85-from-april-19/articleshow/82467771.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

During the resumed hearing on the matter, the division bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh said, “At this stage, we may point out that all the three states may consider setting up of a unified command centre as the working and business class have their workplace or residence in either of the three cities.” The order further read, “In case a joint strategy is drawn up, it may be easier to tackle the present crisis. In a situation like the one created by Covid-19 pandemic, paramount consideration with the governments should be of helping every human being irrespective of the state he belongs to. For better administration and to implement policies, parochial or other considerations should not stand in the way… In case, there is a common platform to deliberate upon the strategies to be adopted, it would be easier to tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic.” During the hearing, amicus curiae Rupinder Khosla pointed out that in view of the order of May 4 passed by the court, the supply of drugs through the private chemists, to whom franchise had been given, has been withdrawn. UT senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain submitted that the control and supply of drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab has been taken over by the director, health service, Chandigarh, and hoarding has been considerably curbed. A query, however, was put to him by the court as to whether these drugs can also be provided through a government-controlled drug centre, preferably in GMH-16, which is centrally located, on payment against a prescription. He submitted that the issue would also be examined on Friday itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/court-have-unified-command-centre-for-tricity-covid-mgmt/articleshow/82467773.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Thirty-nine-year-old Bhavesh Kukadiya had started a hospital in Rajpipla about three years ago and hundreds of persons have been treated there. The police said that 37 persons died during the treatment at his hospital, a majority of the death took place last year. “We suspect that the deaths that happened last year must be due to Covid. The investigators will seek his remand soon and interrogate Kukadiya,” said Himkar Singh, Narmada superintendent of police. Kukadiya is currently lodged in Vadodara central jail after he was arrested by the city police for creating fake Covid treatment documents to claim insurance money. During investigations, Vadodara police found out that the registration number he gave was in the name of a female doctor. After getting intimation from Vadodara police, the Narmada police started an investigation to find out if his medical degree was genuine. “He produced a medical degree and claimed to have completed his MBBS from Kyrgyzstan. We sent an email to the university which said that no student by the name of Bhavesh Kukadiya studied there. So, we booked him for forgery too,” Singh told TOI. The cops have booked five separate offences against him, two of which are by private citizens. “The 37 deaths we have mentioned are from the municipal records. We suspect that many more persons may have died at his hospital. We will question him about the source of his bogus medical degree and if anyone is involved in the racket,” Singh added. Kukadiya and his wife were arrested by the city police in January this year after investigations revealed that he had produced fake hospitalization papers to claim insurance of Rs 2.50 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-running-hospital-using-bogus-medical-degree-booked/articleshow/82467775.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Civil Hospital told to pay Rs 60,000 over lack of discharge summary||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, to pay Rs 60,000 compensation to a patient’s relatives because the hospital failed to provide a discharge summary when the patient left the hospital. The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission said the hospital did not provide a discharge summary to the patient and in the absence of this important medical paper, the patient and his family could not obtain expert advice. This was considered a deficiency in service and Rs 60,000 compensation was considered apt to meet the end of justice. Besides, the hospital authorities will have to pay Rs 10,000 to relatives of the patient for legal expenditure. The litigation was initiated by Natwar Chavda’s wife, Laxmi, and mother, Chancharben, with help from the Consumer Education & Research Society in 2008. The complaint was filed with the consumer forum of Ahmedabad district after Chavda suffered paraplegia following a surgery at Civil Hospital for removal of a kidney stone in July 2005. Chavda remained hospitalized from July 25 to February 2006 after the surgery, which left him paraplegic. He later passed away and his family members sued the hospital and the doctor who conducted the surgery, alleging medical negligence. The Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad district did not accept that there was medical negligence on the part of the doctor and dismissed the complaint. The family appealed before the commission and asserted that this was a case of medical negligence, but this contention was not accepted by the commission. However, the commission accepted the family’s argument that without the discharge summary, it was difficult for the patient to get expert medical advice. It said that the Medical Council of India has imposed an obligation on hospitals with a 2002 notification to maintain medical records and provide patients access to them. Besides the MCI notification, the consumer court also cited NABH and NHRC guidelines and cited observations of the Bombay high court to say that it is crystal clear that it is the duty of the hospital and the doctor to provide the discharge summary and medical papers within 72 hours of discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civil-told-to-pay-rs-60k-over-lack-of-discharge-summary/articleshow/82467808.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Trinamool colours fly high in Kolkata’s Hindi-speaking belt||KOLKATA: Just like the Hindi-speaking belt in the suburbs played a crucial role in Trinamool’s landslide victory in south Bengal, the Hindi-speaking population in central Kolkata played a deciding role in at least two Kolkata constituencies — Jorasanko and Shyampukur. Hindi-speaking voters, who had ensured leads for the BJP at both the assembly constituencies in 2019, seem to have turned away from the party. Vivek Gupta of TMC doubled the party’s lead from Jorasanko (which Trinamool’s Smita Bakshi had won five years ago). Among the 11 wards under this constituency, BJP led in 5 and TMC in 6. In the constituency that covers Burrabazar, Posta, College Street and Girish Park, the TMC always enjoyed dominance in wards like 37 and 38, which has a substancial Muslim population. But it is the results in certain wards which are represented by BJP councillors like Meena Devi Purohit, Sunita Jawar and Vijay Ojha that has surprised the party. BJP’s substantial Lok Sabha leads have eroded in these key wards. Purohit led her own ward, 22, by 3,117 votes. But even this margin was half of what BJP had gained in 2019. Similarly, in Ward 25, a lead of over 4,000 votes in 2019 has come down to 1,845. BJP this time led in wards 22, 23, 25, 27 and 42, while Trinamool led in wards 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 43. At Shyampukur, the party was ahead only in wards 21 and 24, with leads of less than 1,000 votes in each ward. BJP claimed that the Covid scare could have been a reason behind “poor polling”.  “People did not come out to vote. In Ward 22, merely 5,000-odd votes were cast out of 12,000 votes,” said Purohit.  Anindya Raut of Trinamool countered the findings. “The BJP tried to mislead the Hindi-speaking voters in 2019. The voters now know that TMC stands for inclusivity,” said Raut. Trinamool insiders point out how chief minister Mamata Banerjee tried to adopt the community since last year.  “In September last year, she had wished the Hindi-speaking people on Hindi Divas, announced restructuring of the state’s virtually non-functional Hindi Academy and revived the party’s Hindi cell,” said a party insider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-colours-fly-high-in-kolkatas-hindi-speaking-belt/articleshow/82467857.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Drunk businessman’s car mows down man, injures cop||KOLKATA: One person was killed and a cop injured when a luxury sedan, driven by an inebriated businessman, hit them near Rajdanga on Friday morning. Initially, the incident appeared to be a hit-and-run case but later it turned out to be an attack by the enraged businessman who was denied entry into a hookah bar-cum-restaurant, said police sources. Bars and restaurants have been ordered to shut down to contain the spread of Covid-19. According to witnesses, around 5.10am, the sedan, driven by Narendrapur-based businessman Rajdeep Sharma with two co-passengers, Chander Pal (32) and Abhishek Das (36), scraped past four cars and then smashed into another sedan parked along the pavement in front of the hookah bar. Tapan Dey (50), a rag-picker from Tiljala, was run over and he died on the spot. The constable Uday Biswas, who was on anti-snatching watch duty and reached the spot after learning about some trouble in the bar, received injuries on his hand while trying to stop the car. Shocked by the incident, locals and morning walkers dragged Sharma out of the car and thrashed him. He was later rescued by cops and admitted to a hospital. He was put under arrest. His two co-passengers were also arrested. The hookah bar owner, Rohit Rajput (31), was also arrested for violating the shutdown order. According to DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan, the bar was operating clandestinely in violation of the state government rules. Investigators said Sharma had intentionally driven into the luxury sedan to take revenge against the hookah bar owner. Cops are checking CCTV footage to ascertain the exact chain of events. Tea stall owner Sadhan Sarkar said that Sharma and his two associates had reached the bar around 5am. They soon left after a heated argument with the bar's security staff. “The three then came to my tea stall and began smashing things around. I asked them to spare me since I had nothing to do with what had transpired in the bar. By then, the security persons from the bar had stepped out. On seeing them, the three boarded the car and drove away,” said Sarkar. The car, however, returned after some minutes and rammed the parked car at breakneck speed, thus causing the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drunk-bizmans-car-mows-down-man-injures-cop/articleshow/82467909.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Medical teachers call off their strike||AHMEDABAD: Faculty members of six government colleges and eight GMERS colleges called off their protest on Friday after the government assured them that it would look positively into their demands. Professors and lecturers of six government medical colleges had launched a hunger strike on Friday morning to press for their demands, including higher non-practising allowance (NPA). The strike was called off soon after talks with the state’s health department. The protests came amid the raging coronavirus pandemic. The strike was called by Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) which represents about 1,700 teachers. About 700 teachers of GMERS colleges also took part in the strike. GTMA said the strike was called off after the teachers got a positive response from the state government. Some members of the association were, however, of the opinion that the protests should continue till there was a written order by the government accepting all their demands. “About 12-13 years ago, there was a similar situation when a strike was called off after getting an assurance from the government,” said a member of GTMA. “The government had, however, later accepted only a few of the demands.” GTMA president Dr Rajnish Patel and other senior office-bearers held a meeting with minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja and government officials in Gandhinagar. One of the main demands of the teachers is the payment of the non-practising allowance in line with the 7th Pay Commission Report. Another demand is the abolition of contractual appointments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-teachers-call-off-their-strike/articleshow/82467935.cms||---

The students, serving at SVP Hospital, move from one ward to the next offering music as tension-defeating therapy to patients battling Covid. Jaimin Rana, Zahira Khoja, and Bhranti Vaishnav were roped in for Sanjivani duty. Apart from carrying out their officially mandated tasks, they use music to infuse patients with positivity, making them smile. The popular game of Antakshari works as a potent remedy for corona blues. “I learnt to play the guitar when I was in Class XI and I have performed live on social media and at functions,” Rana said. “For the Sanjivani duty, we decided to do something different that could bring back smiles to the faces of Covid patients.” Usually a patient is always under stress when confined to a hospital bed, Rana said. “We thought that music could bring some joy,” he said. “We proposed the idea to the SVP management and it gave us special permission to perform in the wards.” Rana said that the group has so far performed at eight wards at SVP Hospital and the patients are responding positively. He said many patients sit up, film the performances, and even join in. “When we rendered our first performance, patients wondered what we were up to, but in time they joined us,” Rana said. “Some clapped, some sang with us, and some even started swaying to the tunes.” Rana said the group was aware that music therapy can bring some relief and the effects of the performances vindicated the notion. “Some patients keep humming even after we are gone,” he said. “These students of our nursing college affiliated to SVP Hospital came up with the suggestion to entertain Covid patients with their talent,” said the dean of SVP Hospital, Dr Pratik Patel. “We discussed it with our officer on special duty Dr Ashish Raja and gave them the nod.” The results have been wonderful, he said. “We have procured 10 Bluetooth speakers to play music and keep rotating them among various wards and encourage patients to play Antakshari and also housie,” Dr Patel said. “This is to entertain the patients who, otherwise, most of the time watch the news or read Covid-related articles on their phones.” Winners of Antakshari and housie are given token (and useful) prizes such as insulated water bottles. “If one person starts singing, it enthuses other patients,” Dr Patel said. “We have some more entertaining ideas in mind, which we are planning to roll out in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/antakshari-therapy-beats-covid-blues/articleshow/82468010.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Kolkata||Closure of city parks irks morning walkers, elderly||Kolkata: Residents from various localities, particularly senior citizens and those suffering from diabetes and other ailments that require a regimen of exercise to stay health, complained that parks in various localities had been shut down by an “overzealous” civic department on Saturday, despite no mention of it in the order issued from the state secretariat on partial shutdown list where restrictions have been imposed. Lawyer Ankit Agarwal, who lives near Rawdon Square that was opened with much fanfare a few months ago after nearly three decades under padlock, said he was shocked to have seen the park gates locked on Saturday. He did the rounds of a few other parks in the vicinity and found that they, too, were closed. “The civic authorities seem to require an excuse to shut down parks. We commend them for rejuvenating city parks that were in poor shape. But to close them without notice is arbitrary. This is the property of the city and every citizen has the right to use it,” he said. At Deshbandhu and Deshapriya parks, regular visitors were similarly taken aback to find them shut. Dinabandhu Mitra, a septuagenarian and a resident of R G Kar Road, said that keeping parks out of bounds did not make sense as people would then walk on road and that could lead to accidents. A KMC parks department official said parks were shut to avoid gathering of people. “We were asked to shut all parks to prevent people from gathering in an area. We will reopen all parks when the Covid situation improves,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/closure-of-city-parks-irks-morning-walkers-elderly/articleshow/82468056.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Now, the number of beds in 231 nursing homes treating Covid stands at 2,615. The increase was effected after the AMC promised uninterrupted oxygen supply. On Friday, 37 oxygen beds were given to four hospitals. In all, 22 cylinders were given to Hridayse Hospital and five each to Sparsh Hospital (Vatva), Yogeshwar Hospital (Ghatlodia), and Riddhi Medical Nursing Home (Maninagar). AMC officials said that of the 2,615 beds, 1,420 are high-dependency beds with oxygen supply and the remaining are isolation beds. The officials said that as on April 19, the city had only 151 nursing homes treating corona patients. The number is now 231. The officials said that apart from taking care of the oxygen supply in these nursing homes, the corporation has also ensured that medicines such as remdesivir are supplied. The AMC said that initially small hospitals and nursing homes had oxygen beds but due to the lack of oxygen supply, these facilities were not treating Covid patients. However, once the oxygen supply was given, they were roped in for Covid treatment. The AMC officials said that till 2pm on Thursday, 23 hospitals had sent messages for oxygen refilling. Four hospitals’ need was especially pressing and hence they were given oxygen from the AMC control room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nursing-homes-get-oxygen-boost/articleshow/82468060.cms||---
---||Rajkot||India timber hub stares at closure as payments worth crores pile up||RAJKOT: India’s biggest timber cluster at Kandla is staring at a grim future with payments running into crores of businessmen getting stuck with wholesalers across the country and migrant labourers leaving in big numbers in the last two months owing to the Covid-induced situation. Businessmen fear suspension of production activity if the severe liquidity crunch caused by the disrupted payment cycle continues through May. The timber units in Kandla are presently working at 50% capacity. Seventy per cent of India’s timber requirement is imported at Deendayal Port Trust (formely Kandla Port) and Adani Group’s Mundra port. The plywood industry and sawmills around Kandla supply processed wood to the wholesalers in all over the country. Navneet Gajjar, president of Kandla Timber Association (KTA) told TOI: “The usual cycle of payment is 60-90 days, but nearly 30% of the amount which comes to about Rs 200 crore is stuck because of lockdown-like situation and voluntary shutdowns by many industrial associations.” “Banks on the other hand refused to extend letters of credit for our timber import which has only added to the problems as nobody can afford to default on bank payment,” Gajjar said. Mukesh Bhartia, a plywood factory owner, said, “It doesn’t make any sense to have stocks when there is no demand in the market.

During the review meeting, he suggested that Indian Medical Association should be requested to run this facility at the hotel, which could be utilized by Chandigarh residents. The basic medical care and nursing should be provided in the hotel on payment basis. Meanwhile, the UT administration has decided to continue the weekend lockdown from 5am on May 8 (Saturday) to 5am on May 10 (Monday). The UT has allowed morning walks between 6am and 9am. However, a decision on weeklong partial lockdown will be taken in a meeting on Monday.  In the meeting, UT administrator expressed concern over the increasing Covid cases.

The department will make the exam-form filling process completely online for students for the next semester. The process is expected to start from May 15. SPPU has started declaring the result of the students online since the last 5 days. Compared to the offline mode which takes at least 30 days to declare the result, the online mode makes it possible to declare results in 7 days, university officials said. “It is easy to declare the result of subjects which have no practical/viva marks to be added, but in the ones where such marks need to be added, only theory marks are displayed in the student’s profile. We are planning to open the link to apply for the second semester examination by May 15 in a phased manner. Students who have failed in any of the theory subjects can automatically apply for backlog examination too while filling up the forms. Provisions will be done for all kinds of flexibilities needed during the form filling process,” Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation, said.Officials added that the entire form-filling process will be online so that students would not need to come to the college. “They will get the opportunity to fill up the form online and also pay for it online. The last time we did it for final- year students and this time we are doing it for all students. This decision has been accepted in principle and will now be passed in the board of examination meeting,” the official added.At the moment, the first semester examinations are going on and some courses like arts, will have examinations till May 30. Hence, the second semester examination will start in a phased manner so that there is enough time for students, Kakade added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-plans-to-roll-out-next-semester-exams-from-july-10/articleshow/82468099.cms||Ardhra Nair

These students had faced technical glitches during the examination such as inability to log in, activate the exam, abrupt submission of their answer sheet among others. The university had given students the option of reporting the grievances and a task force was constituted to review the cases in real-time and help the students. The students who suffered due to technical glitches on our part will be helped by the university, Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation, SPPU, said. “Up to May 1, we received more than 14,000 complaints from students. We have screened these complaints, verified the genuineness and we will be conducting the re-examination for about 9,400 students. The re-examination will probably be conducted after May 15. The details will be sent to the students on their personal login id,” said Kakade. The re-examination facility is being extended to students who appeared for the examination but either could not start or finish the exam due to technical glitches. “There were complaints like login not happening, or the examination ending abruptly without the student clicking on the submit button, or complaints about technical glitches within the system which had nothing to do with students. Such students will be allowed to appear for re-examination,” he said. However, the fate of around 5,000 students who have requested that they should be allowed to appear for re-exam because they were absent still hangs in balance. “These students did not appear for exams at all and now they are demanding that the university make special provisions for them. Examination can’t be conducted as per the whims and fancies of students,” an official who did not wish to be named said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-9000-pune-varsity-students-to-take-re-exam/articleshow/82468122.cms||Ardhra Nair

All the 27 patients in the ward were immediately shifted to another ward safely. The incident took place in ward 11 of the hospital where 27 patients were undergoing treatment at about 10.30 am. The ward on the ground floor of the hospital was used earlier for the treatment of mental health patients but was converted into a Covid ward following the rising cases. Due to sparks in the wiring, the room got engulfed in smoke. As the security guards present there noticed the smoke, they rushed there with fire extinguishers and doused the sparks. However, a huge commotion ensued because of the mishap. A team of firemen which is deployed in the hospital round-the-clock, too reached, but by then fire was doused. Following the orders of the district collector, the work of replacing the old wires started on Friday afternoon itself. In the past too, a minor fire had broken out in garbage strewn around in Covid ward of the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/spark-leads-to-panic-in-rajkot-civil-hospital/articleshow/82468126.cms||---

The normally beautiful area is now an eyesore and needs to be cleared of the discarded liquor bottles and plastic waste,” Shah said.He said several trees planted by the civic body has been damaged and need to be replanted before the monsoon.Shah said if the footpaths on both sides of the road — from the Nagras Road to Rutuparna society — are repaired and trees are replanted and looked after, then the new DP road can be used by morning walkers and will also look like a road in a smart city.He said repeated complaints to the municipal authorities in the past six months have gone unheeded.The group has also sought help from local corporator Amol Balwadkar and Pune MP Girish Bapat to no avail. “Whenever I raise a complaint on the PMC App, they close the complaint without resolving it. Sometimes, for the footpath issue, they claim funds have not been sanctioned. For the garbage problem, they close the complaint claiming it has been cleared up,” Shah said.Assistant municipal commissioner Jaydeep Pawar, who heads the Aundh-Baner ward office, said, “The garbage is dumped by walkers and at night by owners of chicken/mutton shops nearby. This used to be cleared up regularly, but we are short of staff and have floated tenders; the process would be over in a month. This problem would be resolved soon.”Pawar also promised action against those found dumping garbage in the area. “As for the footpath, temporary repairs are not possible as there is no budgetary allocation. The area comes under Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited. We will write to them in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baner-aundh-link-road-residents-tell-pmc-to-fix-footpath-clear-up-trash/articleshow/82468128.cms||Ardhra Nair

The accused, Shubham Singh Jat, Avinash Singh alias Fauji, Surendra Singh Jat and Bikesh Singh Thakur alias Parmar, were nabbed by the Rajkot crime branch sleuths who were camping in Haryana for past one week. One more gang member, Satish Singh Thakur from Morena in Madhya Pradesh, is still absconding. The gang had stolen 2.7kg of gold jewellery, 2kg of silver jewellery and Rs 2.5 lakh cash from Shiv Jewellers on April 26. Shubham and Avinash were held from Palwal and Bikesh and Surendra from Rewari. Police seized Rs 94,000 cash, 1.8kg gold jewellery worth Rs 61 lakh and 2kg silver jewellery worth Rs 70,000 from them. Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agarwal said that they just had footage of CCTV cameras in which three gang members were seen fleeing to Morbi on a bike. Based on their clothes and body language, cops suspected that they were either from Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh. Teams went to these states and while inquiring at Bharatpur in Rajasthan, police got a lead about Shubham. “We were inquiring about robbers using similar modus operandi and we got one lead and kept following it until we nabbed Shubham and later found Avinash,” Agarwal added. He said that Shubham, Avinash and Surendra had hatched the robbery plan when they were hiding in Rajkot following a road accident in Bharatpur. “They were involved in a firing incident in Bharatpur due to which they were unsafe there,” the CP told media persons on Friday. Avinash contacted Bikesh, who asked them to hide in his house in Rajkot for a couple of months. Bikesh used to work in Rajkot earlier but was in Mumbai before the robbery. On April 24, they asked Bikesh to come to Rajkot and Satish to manage cash and weapons from Madhya Pradesh. On April 26, Bikesh and Avinash kept a watch outside Shiv Jewellers while the other three went inside the shop wearing masks and threatened the owner Mohan Dodiya showing a gun and knife. They locked Dodiya in the iron cupboard and robbed the cash and jewellery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rs-85l-jewellery-heist-four-held-from-haryana/articleshow/82468131.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||IRDAI headless as pandemic rages||HYDERABAD: At a time when the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic is ravaging the country and patients are facing issues with insurance services, the top post at the insurance regulator’s office has fallen vacant. Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority of India (IRDAI) chairman SC Khuntia retired on May 6 without handing over the baton to anyone. And this post is not expected to be filled up anytime soon as the government has set May 29 as the deadline for aspirants to send in their applications for IRDAI’s top job.Even last time, when Khuntia was appointed as IRDAI chief in May 2018, the regulator was headless for over two months after TS Vijayan retired. The lack of urgency shown by the government in ensuring the appointment of a successor in a timely manner given the current pandemic situation came in for considerable flak from the industry. “When the government knows the retirement date, it can start the process at least three months earlier. While the usual business will go on… at the time of the pandemic, certain ‘stern’ decisions have to be taken, which only the chairperson can take with ease,” an industry insider said on condition of anonymity. He pointed out that the government could have at least extended Khuntia’s tenure till it found a new head. In fact, it was only on April 30 that the department of financial services, Union ministry of finance, invited applications from candidates for the post of IRDAI chairperson. However, an IRDAI official pointed out that the absence of a chairperson will not hamper decision-making at the regulator’s office as the ‘authority’ as per the IRDA Act consists of chairperson, whole-time members and part-time members. IRDAI currently has four whole-time members – SN Rajeswari, member (distribution), Parmod Kumar Arora, member (actuary), K Ganesh, member (life) and TL Alamelu, member (non-life). The IRDAI official pointed out that the structure addresses grievances of policyholders and the ideal thing for any policyholder to do would be to first reach out to their agent or insurance company. In case, the insurance company fails to address the grievance, the policyholder can reach out to the regulator via its integrated grievance management system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/irdai-headless-as-pandemic-rages/articleshow/82468138.cms||Swati Rathor

The teenager lodged a complaint of unnatural offences against Yusuf Mohammed Ali Chaki and also alleged that Chaki blackmailed him along with two of his accomplices. Charges of extortion and criminal intimidation were also invoked against Chaki, Tala Ibrahim Khaki and Alfaz Haji Khafi. The youth told police that he had befriended a woman on Facebook around 10 months ago. Chaki allegedly helped him tackle the woman after she began demanding money. Chaki had threatened the woman and got rid of the problem. Chaki called the teen to his ice-cream shop and sodomized him in return for the favour. Three months ago, Chaki sodomized him again. On May 4, Chaki again called the complainant to his shop where Khaki and Khafi were already present. The trio said they had a video of the act and would circulate it if he didn’t pay them Rs 5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/friend-sodomizes-blackmails-teen/articleshow/82468139.cms||---

GHAC said it has also ramped up capacities of all the temperature zones at the facility — from -15 to -25 degree Celsius as well as 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and is introducing the ‘cold super store’ as part of the extended pharma zone to mitigate any temperature excursions during unloading of pharma shipments. This is part of efforts to ensure an unbroken cold chain for Covid vaccine supply with an estimated 3.6 billion doses of various makes of vaccines expected to be produced by facilities in the Hyderabad region over the next 18-24 months, it said. “The entire pharma zone, including the expanding area is equipped with temperature and humidity sensors with alarm alerts along with CCTV surveillance to check temperature excursions in real time. The temperature recording and monitoring is being done with data loggers in exclusive cold storage for temperature sensitive cargo like vaccines and harmaceutical products,” GHAC said. GHAC, a WHO-GSDP (World Health Organisation-Good Storage and Distribution Practices), has, since January 2021, handled over 100 tonnes of Covid-19 vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gmr-doubling-capacities-for-vax-pharma-shipments/articleshow/82468143.cms||---

While the police did not get any suicide note, they are investigating the reasons for this extreme step. According to the police, Jayesh Jain (60) a resident of Rukhmani Nagar in Dwarka town of Devbhumi Dwarka district who tested Covid positive two days ago died under treatment sometime after midnight on Thursday. He was cremated in a nearby crematorium at around 4am on Friday and two hours later, the family returned home at around 6am. When the milkman came to their house at around 8:30am as per his routine, nobody opened the door for him. He then tried to go inside and found the door open. Upon entering the house, he was shocked to see the three bodies lying in the drawing room and immediately called the neighbours and also informed the police. The deceased have been identified as Sadhna Jain (57) and her two sons Kamlesh (39) and Durgesh (35). According to cops, the family was living in a rented accommodation and were engaged in catering business. However, due to the pandemic conditions, their catering business had closed down and they were now selling homemade namkeens in the town. Police inspector of Dwarka police station, G R Gadhvi said, “They returned home early in the morning after completing the last rites and probably were in state of shock. They had consumed pesticide. We are trying to contact the relatives.” Superintendent of police Devbhumi Dwarka, Sunil Joshi said that primary investigation did not find any angle of financial crisis that could have triggered the mass suicide. “It’s possible that they may have taken this extreme step in an impulsive moment. We are trying to talk to the relatives of the deceased,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/60-yr-old-succumbs-to-covid-wife-2-sons-commit-suicide/articleshow/82468148.cms||---
---||Pune||Ramzan this year is all about helping the needy||Pune: For the second year in a row, many are missing the sheer joy of iftars, which entail sharing meals with friends and families, but there is no dearth of fervour and heartfelt prayers for the less unfortunate. “I used to go to the food stalls at Kausarbaug every year with my family after breaking our fast to gorge on Ramzan specialties, but this year we are sticking to home-made delicacies,” said Mohammed Kashif, resident of Salunke Vihar. Navid Ansari, from NIBM Road, said, “Iftar is not the same as it used to be, but that’s a good thing because it has become healthier. Earlier, we used to bring parcels of kebabs and other Ramzan specialties from outside, but now we prepare these items at home. We get the required groceries, fruits and vegetables in the morning when the shops are open.” Sahil Abid, from Pimpri, said, “Fasting in summer is difficult when you have to go about your regular work. The heat in May is exhausting. One good thing is that like last year, we are getting to fast at home this year, too.” Many people have decided to donate towards Covid relief. Wasif Shaikh, a resident of Dhanori, said, “This year, we donated to a non-governmental organisation (NGO) providing financial and medical help to the underprivileged affected by the contagion.” Aliya Khatoon, resident of Hadapsar, said, “Many people have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, so we have donated in cash or/and kind. There are some daily wage workers in the area who have sent their families back home and are alone in the city waiting to get back to work. We have been distributing food to them for iftar and sehri. Some of or family and friends have donated fruit, food items and rations for them.” Rubina Khan, from Vimannagar, said, that it is important to support local business, especially during festivals, as they too deserve an income to be able to celebrate. “I have shopped for new clothes for my family from a lady who sells ethnic wear for men, women and kids from her home since she had to shut down her shop owing to lack of business for months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ramzan-this-year-is-all-about-helping-the-needy/articleshow/82468149.cms||---

Savex is betting on the extended demand for work-from-home tools due to the coronavirus epidemic. When completed, this would be Savex’s largest acquisition since it was founded 33 years ago by Anil Jagasia, an electronics and communications graduate from Mumbai’s VJTI. It previously purchased Uniserved Technologies, its first M&A, in 2019. Savex’s deal for Inflow shows how competitive the sector has become, said an industry observer. “Without a lot of capital, you will have to either give in or give up.” Inflow will complement Savex’s distribution of cybersecurity and workplace-computing solutions, sharpening its rivalry with industry leaders Ingram Micro and Redington. The BSE-listed Redington, the second-biggest player, is in discussions to acquire Brightstar Turkey, expanding its overseas play. Singhi Advisors, an M&A consultant, is advising Savex on the deal. Savex, with a revenue of over $2.5 billion, will be seeking Competition Commission of India’s approval on the deal. India’s anti-trust body looks into monopolistic scenarios played out in an M&A and clamps down on unfair practices. Savex, said people familiar with the matter, will acquire a majority stake in Inflow and then purchase the remaining share within a certain period. Inflow MD Byju Pillai will continue leading the $350-million company, which will become a subsidiary of Savex. Inflow, which was founded in 2005 by Pillai, grew quickly and resisted external funds. But now it feels the need for a strong financial backing. Savex and Inflow could not be reached for comments. According to merger and acquisition (M&A) data provider Refinitiv, of the 20 pending and completed deals so far this year, nine were in the technology and telecommunications sectors. Covid has changed the way people work and trade, fuelling growth in the services market, said Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at a research firm ISG. Service providers help clients configure devices at home with tools and solutions required for collaboration and remote working, he added. According to Savex’s website, every fifth laptop sold in India is through its network.

To ensure that only those teachers who did not receive any help from the state get the benefit from this move, the association has asked principals or managements to send a list of beneficiaries. “Teachers working in private schools have not received salaries for the past 13 months. We are trying to help by providing ration for two months so that they can survive until schools reopen,” said Mazher Hussain of COVA Peace Network. He said that even during the first wave they helped around 1,000 teachers with the donations received. “We are hopeful that this time too we will get enough donations to help about 1,000 teachers,” he said. In April, the Telangana government announced help — Rs 2,000 per month as financial aid and 25kg rice — for private teachers. However, the state had provided relief to only about 1.2 lakh teaching and non-teaching staff, whose details are available with the education department. “Almost all teachers have been struggling to make ends meet. It would have been better if the state gave relief to all teachers,” said Sindhu M, a private teacher. Some even took to Twitter to raise the issue. “I am a private school teacher. I did not the financial support given by the Telangana government. Sir, waiting eagerly for your positive response,” read a tweet from Srinivas Rao with handle @sriniva57110499 to @TelanganaCMO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/volunteers-to-help-teachers-who-havent-received-aid/articleshow/82468157.cms||---

Revenue officials on Thursday night raided the premises and recovered 22 vials which were not shown in the stock by its administration.  Hospitals have to send patients’ SPo2 reports and other documents to the collector office to get stock of vials. Sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Aastha Dangar got a request from Swaminarayan hospital located on the on airport road two days ago for a vial in the name of a patient who had incidentally passed away on May 3. However, Dangar granted the vial thinking that it could be a human error. Again, the SDM got another request for vials the next day in the name of the same patient. This time, she asked her staff to randomly call up the patient’s relatives. Taking to TOI, Dangar said, “We were surprised to find names of patients who had been already discharged post recovery were discharged were being used for getting the vials. Our team went to the hospital to verify the stock and found 22 vials in their possession while their stock report showed zero.” Prima facie, she said, it appears to be a black marketing racket. The SDM then informed the civic body about the irregularity as it issues authorization to Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jamnagar-hosp-takes-remdesivir-in-the-name-of-dead-patients/articleshow/82468161.cms||---

Lured by a trafficker named Fulchand, the woman, then a teenager, was living as a domestic help at a house in Janakpuri. Late last month, the woman contracted Covid-19. Her employers took her to a Covid-19 isolation centre in Sultanpuri area. There, she narrated her ordeal to a few inmates who were also from Jharkhand and expressed her desire to return to her parents in Kalyanpur. Courtesy the co-residents of the isolation centre, the woman’s story was soon out on social media and doing the rounds on WhatsApp. Shoba Kujur, a social worker and a former member of Chatra Zila Parishad, came across the woman’s story and got in touch with Chatra police. Piparwar police ran a background check of the girl and her whereabouts and found her identity to be genuine. Thereafter, the police station relayed the information to Chatra SP Rishav Kumar Jha. Assistant sub-inspectors Kamlesh Kumar Tirkey and Jacinta Minz were tasked with rescuing the woman from the national capital. The cops returned to Chatra with the trafficking survivor on May 1. She was taken to her native Kalyanpur village on May 5, where she reunited with her family. “I am thankful to Shobha di and police officials. I had appeared in my matriculation examination and waiting for the result in 2018, when I was lured by one man named Fulchand and taken to Delhi. I wanted to take up further studies but all my dreams have been shattered,” the rescued woman said. Nitesh Dubey, the officer-in-charge of Piparwar police station, said: “An FIR has been lodged against Fulchand and efforts are underway to track and arrest him.” The woman said that Fulchand first seized her mobile phone and after reaching New Delhi, he sold her to a man in Janakpuri and fled. The woman was forced to work from dawn till late in the night, but was not allowed to step out of the home or peep out the window.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/trafficked-chatra-girl-rescued-from-covid-care-centre-in-delhi/articleshow/82468163.cms||---

The NSUI members on Friday held a protest at the hospital demanding it to be a free treatment centre for Covid-19. Clad in PPE kits, masks and hand gloves, the NSUI members entered the Malla Reddy Hospital premises and raised slogans of ‘Malla Reddy down down’. The NSUI alleged that the hospital, run by Telangana cabinet minister Malla Reddy, is constructed on encroached pond land without complying the buffer zone rules. The protestors defaced the Malla Reddy board with a black paint and sat there demanding justice for the Covid-19 affected patients. “The government should ensure that treatment at the Malla Reddy hospital should be offered under the Aarogyasri scheme of the state government,” said Venkat Balmoor, state president, NSUI. The hospital security staff prevented the protestors before they informed the Dundigal police. The police came to the spot and took NSUI protestors into custody. “We have registered a case under section 447 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal trespassing and damage. Further investigation is on in the matter,” said a police officer from Dundigal police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsui-members-held-for-damaging-hospital/articleshow/82468166.cms||---

Incidentally, many of the Cantonment boards in the country have started Covid-19 treatment for civilians in their respective military hospitals. Upset with this inaction, the All India Cantonment Citizens Welfare Association (ACCiWA) demanded that LMA should follow the orders of the ministry of defence (MoD) and provide Covid treatment at the Trimulgherry hospital. “Secunderabad Cantonment is one of the largest populated Cantonments in the country. As there is no Covid-19 treatment facility, people are getting admitted into private hospitals and spending lakhs of rupees. We dont understand why LMA is not starting Covid-19 treatment at the Military Hospital,” said Jitender Surana, secretary, ACCiWA. ACCiWA also appealed to LMA to convert the Cantonment General Hospital in Bolarum into a super specialty hospital. When TOI contacted SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy, he said, “We are arranging beds and other infrastructure. Within a week we will start Covid-19 treatment at the Cantonment General Hospital in Bolarum.”  On Friday, close aides of Malkajgiri Lok Sabha member A Revanth Reddy met Ajith Reddy and said that they would donate stretchers, IV stands, tables etc. to the the Bolarum hospital. They submitted a list of items which they would provide to the hospital in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/treat-covid-19-cases-at-military-hospital/articleshow/82468171.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ranchi||Hemant Soren tweet on PM’s ‘lack of concern for Cov’ sets off storm||RANCHI: At a time when the people of the country are reeling under the growing number of cases of Covid-19 and reports of lack of coordination between the Centre and the states are surfacing almost every other day, a tweet by chief minister Hemant Soren criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s apparent lack of concern for the ongoing pandemic set off a storm on the micro-blogging site late on Thursday. While JMM and BJP leaders were quick in jumping into a fastest-fingers-first of sorts, hashtags like #JharkhandCM, #HemantSoren, #Mannkibaat and #ModiIstifado, most of which were linked to the reply and counter replies to Soren’s tweet, kept trending all through Friday evening. The tweet culminated into several BJP and Congress leaders, including chief ministers of various states, putting out tweets either praising the PM and slamming Hemant or criticising Modi. A huge chunk of replies also came in from the citizens of the country. In a counter to ‘Modi hai toh Mumkin hai’, JMM supporters came up with ‘Hemant hai to himmat hai’ while BJP leader Babulal Marandi retweeted the comments made by Union health minister Dr Harsha Vardhan, Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio, Mizoram CM Zoramthanga, Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, BJP leader from Assam Himanta Biswa Sarma and others praising Modi, and said Soren has failed as a CM who could not tackle the pandemic in Jharkhand. On Thursday, close to midnight, Soren tweeted, “Aaj adarniya Pradhan Mantri ji ne mujhe phone kia. Unhone sirf apne mann ki baat ki. Behtar hota yadi woh kaam ki baat karte aur kaam ki baat sunte (Today, the honourable prime minister called me up. He only delivered his own thoughts. It would have been better if he would have listened to and spoken about important matters).” Former Jharkhand CM and Union minister for tribal affairs Arjun Munda tweeted his response and said, “You should take note of the fact that at present, 3.5 crore people in Jharkhand are struggling with the pandmeic. Instead of criticising the PM and getting into who did what, you should take care of your patients. The honourable PM called you up to talk about fighting the pandemic in which the Government of India is with everyone. Instead of expressing your gratitude, you criticized him. PM showed his large-heartedness, whereas you degraded the dignity of the CM’s post.” Backing up Soren’s tweet, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “We don’t live in an autocracy so how is it wrong to express concerns before the Prime Minister? And if the CM thinks he was not given a fair hearing, he is bound to express his discontent because he has the courage to do so.” Several Twitter users with unidentifiable names and parody accounts replied by sharing newspaper clips about five patients dying at the sadar hospital in Ranchi due to disruption in oxygen supply and 35 of 38 ventilators going out of order at Hazaribag sadar hospital. Bhattacharya said, “The ventilators were provided by the Centre and these were the issues that Centre should have discussed with the CM, along with availability of vaccines and life-saving drugs, which are in scarce supply.” By Friday evening, Soren’s tweet gathered around 11.8 thousand replies and was retweeted 28.8 thousand times with as many as 70,000 users liking his post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-tweet-on-pms-lack-of-concern-for-cov-sets-off-storm/articleshow/82468172.cms||---

Besides a timely disposal of the compulsory licence (CL) sought by Natco for its Covid drug Baricitinib, there is an urgent need for resolving the issue of accessibility of Roche’s Tocilizumab and Gilead Sciences’ Remdesivir, which are facing huge stock-outs, and are simply not affordable. The experts also urge open licensing of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin to all potential manufacturers to scale up production, and improve supply and affordability of the Covid vaccine. “It’s surprising that the government has not taken proactive steps to address the situation so far,” JNU professor Biswajit Dhar told TOI. He added, “If not now, then when?” The government can take charge by authorising a generic company to manufacture the (patented) product under Section 100. There are existing public health provisions under patent laws which should be utilised now, as the WTO negotiations may extend over months, he added. The Doha declaration on TRIPS (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) and public health confirms that governments have the right to freely determine the grounds of issuing compulsory licences. “India should go to the (WTO) negotiations after addressing IP barriers on access to medical products. For this, the government can issue a government-use licence (under Section 100) or an emergency compulsory use licence (under Section 92) of the Patents Act for medicines like Remdesivir. Similarly, the scale-up of vaccine production is required through open-licensing of Covaxin to all the potential manufactures,” said K M Gopakumar, legal adviser for international health and development NGO Third World Network. Further, there is increasing indication that the government may not want to use the CL route, while companies are also not keen to take on Big Pharma and push for licences from the innovator, experts say. “Since CL decisions can be challenged at national levels, the legal proceedings can have a chilling effect on countries who contemplate this route for any essential patented drug and face pressure from trading partners and legal harassment,” an IP expert said. In April, according to media reports, Gilead Sciences filed a lawsuit before the Supreme Court of Russia, challenging the grant of the compulsory licence by the Russian government, and for allowing generic production of Remdesivir. Recently, NGO Jan Swasthya Abhiyan also sought direction from the Supreme Court on scaling up production of medicines and vaccines. It has also sought fixation of ceiling prices of vaccines and medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-must-tackle-patent-barriers-to-drugs-experts/articleshow/82468175.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Though the vaccination drive started in the third week of March, many are yet to take the first dose. Shortage of vaccine supply is making things difficult for the people. According to sources only 5,000 people have taken their first dose and 1,000 completed two doses in this area. “The state government is testing our patience by rescheduling the dates for the first and second doses. So many times they have cancelled. And when we arrive here we have to wait for a long time. I am waiting for over two weeks to receive my second dose. ,” said PLN Madhu, a resident of Bowenpally. He has been waiting to get the second dose for the last two weeks. Meanwhile, mild tension prevailed at the upper primary health centre in Bowenpally as some people entered into an argument with the health officials. There was a problem as some used different mobile numbers to register for the second dose. “Some people registered for the first dose with one mobile number and used a different number to register for the second dose. It is wrong as the system will not accept,” a medical officer told TOI. “Despite these problems we have managed to vaccinate about 200 people who have registered their names online. There is lot of pressure on us now as many are realising the importance of vaccination only now. Earlier, despite several pleas they were reluctant to get vaccinated,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/serpentine-queues-at-vaccination-centres-in-secbad-cantonment/articleshow/82468177.cms||---

The decision was taken in a high-level meeting held by DSPMU vice-chancellor S N Munda on Friday. Munda said, “The university would hold the examinations online owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. We are holding vocational examinations in the beginning as students of these streams are more tech-savvy and also have their own laptops and android phones. We also hope to hold science examinations smoothly. Some students of the humanities stream may face problems in appearing for the examinations due to lack of knowledge about gadgets.” He added that if the Covid situation improves by the time humanities examinations were held, the university would switch over to the offline mode. Munda said that even though it was a challenging task to hold online examinations, the university wanted to start somewhere and complete as much work as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dspmu-to-hold-online-exams-from-june-10/articleshow/82468179.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||HDFC Q4 net jumps 46% to Rs 3,924 crore||TNN Mumbai: HDFC on Friday reported a net profit of Rs 3,924 crore for the quarter ended March 2021, an increase of 46% over Rs 2,692 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Announcing the results, VC & CEO Keki Mistry said that disbursement of individual loans during the quarter was up 60% from the year-ago period, making it the highest growth rate in a decade. Mistry attributed the growth to the demand for larger houses post-Covid and increased transactions in metros because of special schemes such as stamp duty waiver by local authorities. The consolidated profit after tax was up 31% at Rs 5,669 crore. Shares of the corporation closed 2.7% higher at Rs 2,496 following the results. Mistry said that collection efficiency (an indicator of default risk) had improved from 96.3% in September 2020 to 98% in March 2021. Although the collection efficiency was now in line with the pre-pandemic level, HDFC has decided to set aside double the provision of what was required by the regulator because of uncertainty due to the second wave. “If we had gone by regulation, our provision requirement would have been Rs 5,491 crore, while we have set aside Rs 13,625 crore,” said Mistry. He said that the additional provision was made after analysing the corporation’s portfolio of borrowers who were employed in stressed industries such as hospitality and airlines. “The bottlenecks during the second wave are significantly lesser than what we experienced in March 2020. As of yesterday, disbursements since April 1 have already crossed the disbursement we achieved in the whole of the first quarter of last year,” said Mistry. As of March 31, 2021, the loans on an assets under management (AUM) basis stood at Rs 5,69,894 crore as against Rs 5,16,773 crore in the previous year. The corporation’s restructured loans stood at Rs 4,470 crore, which is around 0.8% of assets under management. Over half of this is on account of loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-q4-net-jumps-46-to-rs-3924-crore/articleshow/82468184.cms||---

He said it can be either company drones or third-party drones and they will just need to give a declaration before operating it within their premises within the stipulated height. The government bodies are looking at various aspects like corporate espionage and other challenges but it is expected to get solved in the next four to six months, he added. He pointed out that this move will help owners of large premises like manufacturing units or steel and cement plans as well as refineries operate drones in their premises to enhance security. Meanwhile, he told drone startups to focus on the software aspect as that will help them generate more value in the long-term. “The physical component of a drone is just around 20-30% of the value… a major chunk of the value comes from intellectual property (IP).. what you do when the drones fly…it is the software part that is crucial,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/permissions-for-flying-drones-in-own-premises-to-get-easier/articleshow/82468205.cms||---

Former education minister and BJP MLA Vasudev Devnani on his twitter handle posted that state government must cancel the Class X board examination as done by CBSE. Devnani posted, “The state government should decide to promote the students to the next class by cancelling the RBSE Class 10 examination, just like the CBSE Class 10 of the Central government. Lakhs of students of the state are still waiting for the decision of the government.” Last year, due to outbreak of coronavirus, Rajasthan government had postponed the board examination which were later conducted in June 2020. The state government has already postponed the examination till further notice. This year CBSE has cancelled the examination of Class X and postponed the examination of Class XII. Chairman of RBSE Dharampal Jaroli said, “We have not decided anything regarding conducting of examination. Once the situation becomes normal, a decision will be taken by the state government.” Meanwhile, Damodar Goyal, president of Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan, has also suggested that students of Class X should be promoted. “Inability to conduct board examinations due to severe Covid conditions is a fact and students eligible to appear therein are certainly under confusion. Ease in corona condition is not visible in next couple of weeks and rather third wave which might be worst is predicted. An early decision will help students and teachers to plan for next session. Therefore, students of Class X of Rajasthan Board should be declared promoted on the semi scientific formula designed by the CBSE. Many state boards have already taken a decision,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cancel-rbse-class-x-exam-due-to-pandemic-experts/articleshow/82468208.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, Ramanand said he sent a letter on May 3 to the DGP and the additional director general of police (law and order) seeking their help to decongest the 60 prisons in the state during the present Covid crisis. Ramanand said the number of jail inmates in Maharashtra has gone up to 35,000 presently from 26,000 in July last year. “If criminals are arrested in petty crimes like prohibition, gambling and disobedience and lodged in jails, it becomes difficult for them to secure bail from the courts. I have requested the DGP to direct all police stations in the state to exercise their discretion while arresting criminals in cases like murder, rape, robbery and dacoity but refrain from making arrests in bailable offences,” Ramanand said. “In the current pandemic scenario, it is not possible for us to lodge a large number of criminals in jails. We will allow criminals in all types of cases to be lodged in jails after the situation becomes normal,” Ramanand added. Additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh told TOI, “We will arrest criminals only when it is essential and permissible under section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if we need to arrest criminals in important cases, we then cannot think of bypassing the due process of law.” Singh said, “Most criminals arrested in various cases are getting bail from the magisterial courts on completion of their custodial remand because of the pandemic.” Prisons officials say the Bombay high court has issued a number of directions for decongesting jails. While 47 jails are overcrowded, 23 have inmates below their capacity. The state has nine central, 31 district and 19 open prisons, besides one open colony and 172 sub-jails. All put together, the jails have 34,747 inmates as against the total capacity of 24,097. This means the jails are 144% full presently. As per latest figures released by the prisons department, 5,411 inmates (including 187 women) are convicts, making for 11% of the total jail population. As many as 27,944 inmates (including 1,253 women) are undertrials, who account for 84% prisoners. In April last year, nearly 2,664 prisoners were released on emergency parole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jails-crowded-avoid-arrests-in-petty-crimes-state-prisons-chief/articleshow/82468209.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The graveyard spread across acres comes under the state Waqf board. Realising that the cremation ground is handling more bodies than usual due to Covid-19 infection and adding to the misery of the poor families. The graveyard offered the wood to Kapasan Nagar Vikas Samiti, a body in charge of the cremation ground. The Samiti welcomed the gesture and local administration provided free transport. Chittorgarh minority welfare officer Manzoor Khan told TOI, "Since the graveyard is under the state Waqf board, its committee members wrote to me urging that they wanted to hand over the wood lying on the land to Moksh Dham as a gesture of being together in sharing the suffering and joy." The graveyard is constructing a park which led to the cutting of trees. They were to sell the wood in the market. However, they realised that burials in the graveyard had increased. Appreciating the efforts, Mukesh Kabra, cashier at Kapasan Nagar Vikas Samiti, said the gift from the Muslim brethen would help in cremating at least 100 bodies. "The nominal charge for cremation is Rs 2,500 that too for those who can afford. Every cremation takes 5-6 quintals of wood which is unaffordable for many since the pandemic has robbed people of their livelihood. I can say that it can relieve us from financial stress by providing free wood to at least 100 deserving families," said Kabra. The wood was transported in a local body tractor on Thursday and Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/graveyard-provides-wood-to-the-cremation-ground-in-chittorgarh/articleshow/82468210.cms||Shoeb Khan

---||Jaipur||HC notice to Centre, Raj on different vax prices||Jodhpur: Rajasthan High Court has sought reply from the Centre on variable price structure of vaccines for Central and state governments and private hospitals.Hearing a PIL by Manish Bhunwal challenging the vaccine price differentiation proposed by the Central government and mismanagement of state government in dealing with Covid crisis, a division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Vinit Kumar Mathur issued notices to both the governments seeking reply by May 24. Petitioner’s counsel Nitish Bagri argued that the vaccine to be provided at different prices to the Union of India, states and private hospitals was against the statutory provisions of the law and was also in violation to the fundamental rights as well as constitutional rights of the citizens. “The Drug (Price Control) Order 2013, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy 2012, National Health Policy 2017 and Drug & Cosmetics Act 1940, do not provide for different pricing schemes for Centre and state,” Bagri argued. He further stated that the formula to derive Maximum Retail Price (MRP) was unified and only local taxes could be charged extra by the state as per their tax provisions. The petitioner also raised the issue of non-availability of oxygen beds, ICU-equipped oxygen beds and shortage of oxygen and medical supplies comprising consumable medicines and injections, which are essentially life-saving drugs in the current times, in the PIL. Terming it to be a gross mismanagement by the state government in dealing with Covid crisis, the petitioner stated that the Rajasthan government, in a notification issued on April 30, had stated that 95% of the hospitals were full while the current infection rate was hovering around 21%. Bagri argued that while the former issue has direct bearing on the financial aspect causing burden on states and general public for procuring vaccine, the latter pertained to non-implementation of provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005, wherein there is violation of Section 11 – National Plan by the Union government and violation of Section 23 – State Plan by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-to-centre-raj-on-different-vax-prices/articleshow/82468233.cms||---

It has already ordered more than 28600 units and is in the process of deployment.Raghu Sharma, minister of health & medical, said, “100 oxygen concentrators are reaching Jaipur from Russia and it will send more 1250 units next week. China is also sending oxygen concentrators.” A high-level committee represented by senior officials from CMO, Health and Medical Education, CII-Rajasthan, and Rajasthan Foundation is tapping multiple sources for the fastest supply of oxygen concentrators in the 33 districts hospitals. This team has reached out to global and domestic oxygen concentrator manufacturers and placed orders for 28695 units including 8,150 from Chinese and Russian companies. Subodh Agarwal, ACS Mines & Petroleum and chairperson of High-Level Committee for Supplies of Oxygen Concentrators, formed by CMO, said “As directed by the CM, the state government is in talks with multiple stakeholders such as CII, Rajasthan Foundation, district collectors, foreign donors, and industry associations who have collectively proposed to provide over 7,700 units of oxygen concentrators.”He said the committee is also in talks with companies based out of Dubai, Bangalore and Mumbai for another 15,000 units. “Looking at the urgency, we are aligning suppliers who are capable of supplying by May-end.”Currently, district-level hospitals have about 1261 oxygen concentrators and by mid-May, the total will reach over 3,400 units. “At the end of May, it will cross the 20,000 units. The rest of the orders will be delivered subsequently by the companies in June,” added Agarwal.Oxygen concentrators are mainly used for moderate cases and these can round the clock using electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/50k-o2-concentrators-in-pipeline-for-dist-hosps-deployment-from-mid-may/articleshow/82468240.cms||---

Also, three tankers were sent to Odisha on Friday late night to bring oxygen from Tata Steel, Kalinganagar. However, sending the tankers by road to West Bengal and Odisha will further delay the supply of oxygen from these states by 4-5 days. “The aircraft came to Jaipur on Friday to airlift the tankers, but the tankers were too large to fit in. So, we are sending the tankers by road to West Bengal. Three others will be sent to Odisha on Friday late night,” said an official.According to officials due to shortage of tankers, not a single tanker has reached Odisha as of now to bring oxygen from Tata Steel in Kalinganagar. The state currently requires 615 metric tonnes of oxygen per day and it would go up to 795 metric tonnes by May 15. Now, the number of tankers in Rajasthan has gone up to 36.Looking at the logistics issue, the central government has dropped the idea of supplying oxygen to Rajasthan from Panipat and an additional 30 MTs of oxygen will be supplied from Jamnagar (Gujarat), making it 70 metric tonnes. As against 615 metric tonnes of oxygen required, the Centre has allocated only 270 metric tonnes of oxygen. Of these, 100 MT is from Bhiwadi, 70 MT from Jamnagar, 60 MT from Kalinganagar and 40 MT from Burnpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/failing-to-airlift-three-tankers-sent-to-wb-by-road/articleshow/82468261.cms||---

Through this order, the government scraps the role of private distributors in the distribution of medicines. “All private hospitals and government hospitals will receive allocated drugs only through government-run RMSCL,” said an official. “Earlier, the private distributors were supplying to the private hospitals. Now, the private distributors will surrender all the drugs they receive to the government. The distribution of Remdesivir injections and other drugs will be distributed to private hospitals and government hospitals only after the approval from the district-level committees formed by the collectors. Jaipur police on Friday held three persons for black-marketing of Remdesivir injections in Dudu. According to police, they were trying to sell two injections at Rs 60,000. The state on Friday received 1500 vials of Remdesivir injections from Dr Redyy’s and 3000 vials from Zydus Cadilla. The state requires 15,000 vials of Remdesivir injections per day. The central government has scaled up the allocation of the drugs for Rajasthan to 1,41,600 vials up toMay 9. Among all the seven companies, Zydus Cadila will supply 43,000 vials, Mylan will supply 32,000vials, Cipla will supply 26,500 vials and Hetero will supply 24,000 vials of Remdesivir.

Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies said that judicious use of oxygen, using it only for emergency purposes, stopping of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) when the patient is having food or is not on the bed have played a vital role in reducing wastage. The facilities such as Sassoon General Hospital, the jumbo Covid units in Pune and Pimpri, the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital etc are saving at least six tonnes of oxygen per day. S Chokalingam, administrative controller, Sassoon General Hospital, told TOI, “We have managed to bring down the consumption through various means by stopping HFNO when the patient is not in bed, internal auditing and timely monitoring, among others.” Smita Zagade, deputy commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), told TOI, “Two weeks ago, there were close calls with oxygen supply at our bigger facilities, but the situation has improved a lot since then. The appointment of oxygen nurses, maintaining patients at the right oxygen level, use of prone position and preventing maximum leakages have proved fruitful. The oxygen supply has been streamlined, which also helped us to use it judiciously.” Shreyansh Kapale, dean, College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP) Jumbo unit, said, “We have managed to bring down the daily consumption from around 22 tonnes to 16 tonnes. We also created zones for patients needing less or no oxygen, and those needing high oxygen. We diverted oxygen with proper pressure in respective wards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/facilities-save-30-tonnes-of-med-gas-daily-after-audit/articleshow/82468281.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Besides, another tanker of 28 metric tonne oxygen reached Kota on Thursday evening that supplied 16 tonnes to New Medical College Hospital for distribution in government hospitals and the rest to Hadauti gas plant for private hospitals.The tanker for Kota would suffice to meet local demand for oxygen for about two days, said Kota collector Ujjawal Rathor, adding that the procedure as per the state government’s direction to meet the further demand of oxygen is under way.Of the 40 metric tonnes of oxygen in three tankers, each is estimated to be containing around 13 (13.3) tonnes that can hardly suffice the demand for one day in New Medical College Hospital (NMCH), said an official.Medical College Kota has not received any supply from the oxygen tanker that reached by train on Friday morning nor they have been informed of it so far, said oxygen generation and supply in-charge, NMCH, Kota Dr C L Khediya. However, they received 16 tonnes of oxygen on Thursday that filled 90% of their storage tank and 13 tonnes was currently in store, he further said.Currently, a total 575 patients are on oxygen support that included 150 on high flow oxygen and 50 on ventilator and around 2,000 oxygen cylinders, including liquid ones, are being consumed in hospital daily, he said. However, there is no crisis of oxygen in hospitals, but the demand is still high, he further said claiming there was no decline in admission rate in the hospitals. However the number of Corona positive cases is dipping day by day. The liquid oxygen plant at NMCH has also started liquid oxygen generation and the supply is on, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/train-from-jamnagar-with-3-tankers-containing-40mt-oxygen-reaches-kota/articleshow/82468291.cms||---

After the action has been taken, information regarding it will be sent to the control room following which a report of all the incidents will be submitted on a daily basis,” said an official.Around two weeks ago after TOI published a report regarding this matter, highlighting the plight of relatives of corona victims and patients who were being overcharged by ambulance operators, the department got into action and fixed the fare.Accordingly, following rates have been fixed by the department, Rs 500 for the first 10km. If an ambulance is used for taking bodies of Covid patients, an additional Rs 350 will be charged for sanitisation and PPE kits. After the first 10km, the fare for vans such as Maruti, Maxx and others will be Rs 12.5/km while for bigger vehicles such as Innova and Bolero, the rate per kilometre would be Rs 14.50.

He said that beds in many civic Covid facilities were lying vacant owing to unavailability of oxygen. Bagul said he filed the PIL since many people from the underprivileged sections of the society prefer civic facilities for treatment.

The board’s facility was ready last month, but it couldn’t start earlier because of the shortage of doctors and healthcare workers. R Haritwal, the DCB’s chief executive officer, said, “We managed to hire the required number of doctors and staffers for the facility. At present, we have made 30 beds functional. We are in the process of adding 20 more beds.” This is the only government-run dedicated Covid health centre(DCHC) in the cantonment area. The cantonment has closed down the general OPD at its hospital to avoid mixing of Covid and non-Covid patients, Haritwal added.“At present, two physicians, eight medical officers and eight nurses have been roped in for Covid duty,” he added. A total of 25 oxygen supported beds have been occupied at the facility, at present. “We are admitting patients from all areas, including the rural areas such as Junnar. As far as oxygen supply is concerned, we are managing it via three agencies operating out of Chakan and Katraj.” Sunita Joshi, the Cantonment’s resident medical officer, said, “We have shifted the general OPD and vaccination centre to a new place in the bazaar area. Adequate doctors and staff have been appointed for the same.”Raghuvir Shelar, former vice-president of the Cantonment, said, “Many patients from DCB jurisdiction couldn’t get oxygen-supported beds in other areas in the recent past. The new facility is a big relief for the locals. As it is government-run, the patients in need will get treatment in time.” A resident, Sanket Jadhav, said he had to wait over 12 hours to get a oxygen-supported bed in Pimpri Chinchwad a few weeks back. “This is a big respite for citizens of the cantonment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dcb-finally-inaugurates-dedicated-establishment-with-30-oxygen-beds/articleshow/82468318.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Chennai||City likely to get light rain for the next two days||Chennai: Chennai: The city woke up to surprise light showers over some localities on Friday. Weathermen said this was convective rainfall caused by moisture-laden easterly winds or seabreeze moving towards the land. They said such spells would continue for a couple of days but the rest of the day would be hot and humid.Private forecasters said with easterlies blowing deep inland and a trough prevailing, western Tamil Nadu could see moderate rainfall and the coastal regions light showers for the next three days.“We could expect isolated spells of rain over the parts of the city for the next three days early in the day and the rainfall shifts to interior Tamil Nadu as the day progresses,” said blogger Pradeep John.Skymet Weather chief meteorologist Mahesh Palawat said the moisture incursion and the presence of a trough from interior Karnataka extending to South Tamil Nadu may increase rain intensity over regions closer to Nilgiri hills. “This is how pre-monsoon showers will be,” he said.For the 48 hours, IMD has forecast light rain to occur in some areas of Chennai city and suburbs. The sky condition may be partly cloudy while the maximum and minimum temperatures may be around 36 deg C and 28 deg C.On Friday morning, areas in and around Nungambakkam, Aminjikarai, Choolaimedu and Koyembedu received light showers for less than five minutes. It didn't rain enough for either Nungambakkam or Meenambakkam stations to record it. Soon, the skies cleared over the city, but many suburban areas remained cloudy for some time.The maximum temperatures of 35.1 deg C and 36.1 deg C at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam were 0.9 deg C and 1.2 deg C below normal. The average maximum and minimum temperatures for the month are 37.1 deg C and 28 deg C.As the day progressed, humidity levels rose to 69% and 65% at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam.The IMD said for the next 24 hours, relative humidity may be between 50% and 90% over coastal and adjoining districts of Tamil Nadu.

A senior GCC official said that 300 beds will be ready by Tuesday and the remaining 500 in another week. Chief minister M K Stalin along with officials inspected the centre in Nandambakkam on Friday. GCC commissioner G Prakash and special officer on deputation to GCC for Covid-19, M A Siddique were present during the inspection. The centre totally has a capacity of 862 beds. The remaining 62 beds will be for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, who do not need oxygen support. Each oxygen-supported bed can serve upto 10 litre oxygen per minute. A 11 kl oxygen tank has been installed by the TN medical services corporation (TNMSC) on the centre campus, a senior official said. A distribution line and O2 flow meter has been installed for every bed. The CTC had emerged as a crucial Covid care centre (CCC) in the city during the first wave of Covid-19. However, addition of oxygen beds has been done only this year. Currently, as per the health bulletin on May 7, Chennai has only 258 oxygen beds available.

---||India||Delhi positivity rate 32%, tests down by 2.7L samples||NEW DELHI: While most states have increased testing in the wake of a surging second wave of Covid-19 infections, Delhi and Telangana have actually scaled down their testing by up to 3 lakh samples each in the last fortnight, between April 21 and May 4, raising concerns over efficacy of disease control in these states. Overall, Covid-19 tests went up by 19% during between April 21 and May 4 compared to the previous fortnight of April 8-21. Total all-India tests have gone up from 1.87 crore to 2.21 crore during the two fortnights. At a 32% positivity rate (total confirmed cases per 100 tests), Delhi has witnessed a surge of new cases, overwhelming its health system. The T-3 strategy (track, test, treat) is key to containment of the pandemic. However, instead of ramping up testing, Delhi has actually reduced it by 2.7 lakh samples in the last fortnight compared to the previous one. Total tests conducted by Delhi during the last two weeks (April 21-May 4) was 9.55 lakh against 12.26 lakh in the previous fortnight. Telangana is the other state where tests have come down by at least 3 lakh in the last fortnight. Bihar has slowed down but very marginally though it should be increasing testing. In terms of tests per million, Delhi continues to rank high with 8.8 lakh tests, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (5.7 lakh/m), Goa (4.5 lakh), Kerala (4.7 lakh), Karnataka (4 lakh), Telangana and Uttarakhand (3.5 lakh each). The problem with Delhi is that the rate of infection demands more testing. Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have conducted over 3 lakh tests/million, Gujarat (2.8 lakh) Maharashtra (2.3 lakh), UP (1.8 lakh), Rajasthan and West Bengal 1 lakh tests each. However, in absolute numbers, Maharashtra is at the top with 34 lakh tests (during April 21-May 4), followed by UP with 29 lakh, Karnataka (22 lakh), Gujarat (21 lakh), Tamil Nadu (17.25 lakh) and Kerala (17 lakh). A similar study in March had found that countrywide testing had gone up by 38% during the last fortnight of the month compared to the first two weeks. The total Covid-19 tests conducted during March 1-14 was 97.89 lakh which was augmented to 1.35 crore between March 14-27. The total fortnightly tests have now reached 2.2 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-positivity-rate-32-tests-down-by-2-7l-samples/articleshow/82468276.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Chennai||Chennai: Kin struggle to get docus for non-Covid deaths||CHENNAI: Amid the Covid pandemic, relatives of people who die of old age or other illnesses outside hospitals in Chennai and its suburbs are finding it difficult to cremate the bodies. To use a government-run crematorium, relatives or legal guardians of the deceased are supposed to get a death certificate (Form No.4A) from a doctor. This certificate has their personal details and cause of the death. But because of the pandemic, not many doctors are available to arrive at the deceased person's home and certify their deaths. “We had to pay Rs 1,500 to get a doctor after a day-long struggle,” said Varadharajan, a resident of Chitlapakkam, who lost his family friend on Thursday. Eighty-year-old Lisa from Old Pallavaram in Chennai died in the wee hours of Thursday. But her relatives and neighbours were unable to convince doctors at their residential community, nearby private clinic and Pallavaram Primary Health Centre (PHC) to issue a death certificate, said M Krishnamoorthy, her neighbour. In case of a non-availability of a doctor, existing government rules allow the relatives to reach out to the local body for help. The sanitary inspector at these offices can verify the reason for the death and order cremation. But in Lisa's case, Pallavaram Municipality's sanitary officer did not help. So after a day-long struggle, Lisa's family finally laid her to rest at a local burial ground, Krishnamoorthy added. Doctors, who expect us to come to them during normal circumstances, are not willing to help the families during such tough times. The last thing the grieving family wants is to run from pillar to post for a certificate, said V Santhanam, a resident-activist. In response, Captain G Raghavel, former state president of Indian Medical Association, said, “We used to give such certificates in the past based on familiarity and acquaintance. But many started misusing it to cover-up strangulation deaths and other crimes. In such instances, not only is the doctor's entire career gone, but they also become a party to the crime. So we advised our juniors to give certificates only to patients whom they have handled in the recent past". Santhanam in response said, “Influential people can get doctor certificates. But what happens to ordinary people, who can't afford to have family physicians? Also not many know that they can approach local bodies in case doctors are unavailable and the government should advertise this option, which is available from 2018.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kin-struggle-to-get-docus-for-non-covid-deaths/articleshow/82468342.cms||Ram Sundaram

The studies conducted by the researchers at the Centre for Genetic Disorders, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University revealed that the changed structure of double mutant and triple mutant are more dangerous than AP strain. “Our studies revealed that the changed structure of double mutant and triple mutant was hampered in the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) region area as compared to AP strain. Due to this, the double mutant and triple mutant are more dangerous than AP strain. Current situation of India already evidenced the increased surge of re-infection with these virulent strains (B1.617 and B1.618),” said the coordinator Prof. Parimal Das. According to him, the N440K variant of Covid-19, which is also called the AP (Andhra Pradesh) strain, is at least 15 times more virulent than the earlier ones and may be even stronger than the Indian variants of B1.617 and B1.618, according to experts previously. The N440K is a mutation, where the N (Asn), the amino acid named Asparagine at the 440th position of the spike protein changed to K (Lys), the amino acid Lysine. The Bioinformatics analysis carried out by Prof. Das and a Ph.D. scholar Prashant Ranjan showed that this change causes no structural changes around RBD region of spike protein which plays a very important role in interaction with ACE2 receptor and Antibody interaction. “With the help of ACE2 receptor SARS, CoV2 spreads infections in humans. If RBD structure gets hampered, antibody interaction will be disturbed,” he said, adding that this will eventually hamper the efficacy of the currently available vaccines and leading to the cause of increased surge of re-infection in humans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/double-triple-mutants-more-dangerous-than-ap-strain-study/articleshow/82468344.cms||---

---||Pune||Now, curbs on giving real-time Co-WIN slot availability data||PUNE: The Centre has put restrictions on multiple users and platforms that have emerged to provide real-time data on slot availability for prospective vaccine beneficiaries in their respective districts, senior officials of the Union health and family welfare ministry have told TOI. Ever since vaccination started for the 18-44 age group, several techies have been trying to develop programmes or running scripts for searching vaccine slots in real time using public Application Program Interfaces (APIs) on Co-WIN. This was inconveniencing people who are not so tech-savvy, said officials. An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. In fact, multiple portals have emerged which automatically search for new vaccination slots from the Co-WIN server and send it to users who have punched in their personal details for the service. Mazahir Poonawalla, a city-based working professional who tried something similar via a third-party programme, said, “These programmes automatically search for slots as soon as they are out on Co-WIN and send an alert to the user through email or SMS. The user can then log in on Co-WIN and book a slot, instead of being on the portal all day and refreshing it over and over again to find slots.” Poonawalla, however, said the method never worked for him. “I got an alert. But by the time I logged in on Co-WIN, all slots had already been booked. This means that thousands of users are using such programmes to find a vaccine slot and log in as soon as they get such alerts,” he said. “Techies and portals have been using the APIs openly available on the Co-WIN portal under the option ‘Open APIs’ to get access to vaccine slot availability in a district programmatically. Using the APIs on the portal, I made a programme with an internal application to see if it works. I hit the program multiple times in a minute to see if it found slots. But after multiple attempts, it stopped due to rate limitation,” a city-based IT professional told TOI on the condition of anonymity. The Co-WIN public APIs portal now states, “These APIs are available for use by all third- party applications. The appointment availability data is cached and may be up to 30 minutes old. Further, these APIs are subject to a rate limit of 100 API calls per 5 minutes per IP.” Experts said since the appointment availability data was now cached, it would now not show the slot availability in real time. This would ultimately render such portals redundant. Those desperately searching for slots in Pune and other cities have been resorting to these portals or individuals on Twitter, WhatsApp and other social media, requesting for such “scripts”. The users have to provide details such as mobile number or email address and district/pin code on these portals to get a notification on real-time data on slot availability. After reports that programmers were not only using Co-WIN APIs for getting alerts on new slots, but were also booking slots through these scripts, a senior health and family welfare official ministry told TOI, “ We are closely monitoring the system, checking for number of hits from various IPs and also the number of appointments made via these IP’s. Anyone found involved in any sort of hanky-panky will be known to us. We have introduced the CAPTCHA feature in the Co-WIN system while booking slots. This will ensure human intervention while booking slots.” The official added, “The appointment availability data is also cached, precluding the possibility of running a script to have early information about slot availability and informing others of it. This possibility has been closed because there are many who tend to lose vaccination slots to those who use such programs to get the slot first.” While ministry officials said that there was nothing wrong in using Co-WIN Public APIs to find appointment availability to help others find slots, the recent limitation has been introduced to ensure that those who are not tech savvy do not miss out on vaccine appointments to those with IT know-how. The official said the problem in booking the slots was due to the rush for appointments in the face of less vaccine availability. “The number of slots will increase in the coming days, as more and more states mobilize their vaccine supplies,” the official said.Cybercrime experts in Pune have been getting requests from acquaintances to develop such programmes using the APIs openly available on Co-WIN. The experts have warned the users to not rely on the third-party developers, as the information provided to them could be misused. Shweta Chawla, a digital forensic investigator and head at Pune-based SC Cyber Solutions Private Limited said, “The danger in such scripts is that somebody can hide a malicious code in it. If the script is sent to someone, it may have an additional code in it which may give a fraudster access to another’s system where it is run — be it a cellphone or laptop. We suggest people to just keep looking for the slots the normal way, instead of giving out details on such portals or links.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/now-curbs-on-giving-real-time-co-win-slot-availability-data/articleshow/82468359.cms||Neha Madaan

The website was inaugurated by divisional commissioner Dr Raj Shekhar and vice-chancellor, CSJM University, Prof Vinay Kumar Pathak. The commissioner said that it was a pleasure to witness that apart from the academic tasks, CSJM University has shown exemplary lead in serving people and helping the district administration during Covid pandemic. In past seven-eight days, a decline in the number of new Covid cases has been witnessed which continues to follow the receding trend, said Dr Raj Shekhar. He urged to people to stay protected by taking precaution and be prepared to brave the third Covid wave. The divisional commissioner said that there is was no shortage of oxygen, however, he admitted that there were challenges in its proper distribution. The CSJMU VC said that several students and faculty members of the university can help the district administration during the current pandemic time and added that the teachers of chemical engineering and material science should try to develop oxygen concentrator. He also said that the students of paramedical course should be trained beforehand for Covid management and also asked the head of the Institute of Health Sciences to workout a strategy for installation of oxygen plant on the university campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/csjmu-developes-website-for-info-of-hosp-bed-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82468360.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

The firm which collects debt for banks online and has good collection efficiency in new normal, is now wholly owned by the founder family. Spocto Solutions founder and CEO Sumeet Srivastava told TOI that the startup is already in talks with two-three firms in this regard. “We intend to raise some growth capital and acquire one or two similar sort of companies in the US. That will give us inorganic growth opportunities. Post that we intend to enter the western European market and then we will enter the south-east Asian market . This will take two to three years to start putting up the entire structure in place,” he added. Elaborating the growth projection of Spocto, he said, in terms of revenue it has been averaging five to six times revenue increase year on year. “This year, we intend to touch around Rs 100 crore topline. In the next five years, when we launch the platform in other geographies, we intend to touch a $100million revenue in the next four years and out of that 50% will come from international markets,” he added. This year, it expects to touch Rs 100crore revenue, of which 15% will be from international market. “Now, the product has stabilised and started performing, we intend to expand globally as I said,” he added. Srivastava pointed out that Spocto already has a strong presence in West Asia. “Four out of the top-10 banks are our existing customers in the middle east. In the next six months, we will put a key account management team and will open a fully owned subsidiary there,” he added. Srivastava also made it clear that Spocto wants to be a key player in the stressed fund segment also. “In terms of a stressed fund, I will partner with an ARC, where they acquire the stressed asset and I help them in recovering that. They have an established model. For India, we are in active conversation with two or three ARCs. In the US, unless I launch the product, the applicability in the local market and it will be futile to enter into an arc model,” he added. According to him, the next three years would be an opportunity for Spocto.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fintech-startup-plans-to-raise-20mn-from-us-mkt/articleshow/82468361.cms||---

Over 2,500 Covid suspects have been tracked in the rural parts of the district and their records have been uploaded on upcovid19tracks.in blockwise. A five-day special door-to-door campaign has been launched in Prayagraj district to find out hidden Covid suspects/confirmed cases in 23 blocks with an aim to contain the spread of the deadly virus in rural areas. Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer, Dr Rishi Sahai, told TOI, “Each medical team led by two members including ASHAs or ANMs (primary health worker) and a teacher or a member of the monitoring committee is covering at least five houses in a day. So far, as many as 1.96 lakh houses have been covered. He further added that over 60 teams have been assigned to conduct door-to-door survey in 23 blocks of the district between May 5 and 9. Dr Sahai further added that ASHAs and ANMs have generated case IDs of symptomatic patients in every village so that the health department team could collect their samples for antigen/RT-PCR test and the treatment could begin. Dr Sahai, meanwhile, said, “Once we are able to find out all the hidden Covid suspects, then we will be able to take corrective measures.” He also claimed that the department has launched a combing procedure in the villages under which each and every house would be surveyed for tracing Covid suspects and carrying out testing. As done in urban areas, teams have been asked to follow the 3T procedure—testing, tracking and treatment in the villages as well. Health teams have also been testing migrants who have recently returned to their native villages from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and other states. Besides, the eligible recipients are being encouraged to get vaccinated. ASHAs and ANMs are interacting with villagers to dispel the myths regarding vaccination, and promoting people above 18 years of age for getting vaccinated at the concerned community health centres. “We are apprising families in rural areas about Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said a health worker, adding, “We are visiting their doorsteps and briefing the Dos and Don’ts concerning the pandemic,” she added. The state government has recently ordered to conduct a five-day special campaign to collect samples from all the 97,409 revenue villages across the state with an aim to curb the spread of the deadly virus in rural UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/1-96-lakh-houses-covered-under-door-to-door-survey-in-23-rural-blocks-of-dist/articleshow/82468379.cms||---

As Covid cases surges across the state, Muslim clerics and scholars had appealed to people to offer ‘namaz’ for ‘Alvida Jumma’ from their homes. The clerics had also appealed to follow Covid-19 safety protocol during the Alvida namaz. Old city resident and social activist Haseeb Ahmad told TOI that “In view of rising Covid cases and lockdown across the city, people of the Muslim community in Nakhas Kohna, Khuldabad, Chowk, Ghantaghar, Shahganj, Akbarpur, Rasoolpur, Kareli, Gaus Nagar, Rajapur, Noorullah road, Atala, Mandsaur Park, Baidan Tola, and Dariayabad localities offered Alvida namaz at their homes. He also said those with four or more persons at their homes followed the covid protocol while offering the last Friday prayers. “Groups of five persons also offered ‘alvida namaz’ at prominent city mosques,” he said, adding that “while offering ‘namaz’ all devotees prayed for the end of the pandemic and national prosperity.” A group of devotees led by Kadir Bhai also distributed masks and sanitizer among people at Gadi saray area and appealed to them to remain in their homes and follow the Covid guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/alvida-namaz-heldwith-covid-protocol/articleshow/82468399.cms||---
---||Pune||Health experts favour live O2 tracking at Covid hospitals across Pune Metropolitan Region||PUNE: Medical experts have urged district authorities to start real-time tracking of oxygen availability at Covid hospitals on the lines of the online dashboard the administration has to monitor bed vacancies in health hubs across PMR. “Having a real-time dashboard will also ensure equitable distribution of oxygen among hospitals managing Covid-19 patients, besides avoiding panic situations. This will help doctors and the adninistration to focus on patient care, rather than on procurement of oxygen,” said medical and bioinformatics expert Rajeev Joshi. Currently, private hospitals in the Pune Metropolitan Hospital (PMR) have been told to submit information about requirements and availability of stock once or twice to the Food and Drug Administration official on a daily basis. “The situation in terms of oxygen utility, however, is dynamic and changes every minute. Sometimes, the oxygen consumption increases manifold within the day when the condition of some patients on basic oxygen support worsens and they have to be put on non-invasive ventilator support. Having a dashboard tracking real-time requirement and storage will be extremely helpful for everyone,” said Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati hospital — one of the biggest Covid hospitals in Pune. Currently, hospitals are calculating the requirement on a daily basis and accordingly taking decisions on when the refill of cylinders will be required. “A central online mechanism can even monitor the oxygen requirement of each patient undergoing treatment in addition to oxygen in the disposal at each hospital. It will be easy for hospitals to calculate the requirement. At the same time, the data will be available on the central dashboard for officials to quickly respond based on how much oxygen is available at each hospital,” said Joshi, who is also the former president of Indian Association for Medical Informatics and ex-professor of the department of health information and technology, Maharashtra University of Health Sciences. Public health expert Sanjeev Wavare, who is also the Pune Municipal Corporation’s nodal officer (Covid-19), said, “We currently do not have such a dashboard for hospital-wise medical oxygen requirement and availability.” “Such a system will definitely help us troubleshoot within time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-experts-favour-live-o2-tracking-at-covid-hosps/articleshow/82468422.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Elsewhere too the prices were in sight of hitting a century and diesel made new records after fuel retailers raised prices for the fourth straight day on Friday. This is the second century for petrol this year. Petrol price had crossed the Rs 100 per litre mark for the first time on February 17 in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, which has the highest VAT in the country. In the last four days since the retailers resumed daily price revisions, petrol has risen 88 paise per litre and diesel Re 1, erasing the reductions between March 24 and April 15. On Friday, petrol sold for Rs 102.15 a litre in Sri Ganganagar, Rs 101.86 in Anuppur, Madhya Pradesh and Rs 99.95 in Parbhani, Maharashtra. Pump prices are rising because state-run fuel retailers, who control 90% of the market, have started passing on the increase in crude prices since April 27. Crude prices are hovering just below $70/barrel, boosted by demand from the US and China. The high Central and state taxes are hardening the pinch for consumers. Taxes account for 60% of the retail price of petrol and 54% of diesel. The Centre levies an excise duty of Rs 32.90 per litre on petrol and Rs 31.80 on diesel. The retailers, who technically enjoy a 'free hand' on pricing, were informally told by the government to hold the price line after petrol prices rose to Rs 100 in several parts of the country ahead of the state elections, giving the opposition a stick to beat the BJP with. Poll-bound West Bengal and Assam were among five states that reduced VAT as a relief to consumers as the Centre refused to prune excise duty. The Centre instead blamed rising crude for record fuel prices. The Centre had in 2020 raised excise duty on petrol cumulatively by Rs 13 per litre and diesel by Rs 16 in two tranches on March 16 and May 5 when crude prices collapsed as the Coronavirus pandemic shut down economies. Fuel retailers adjusted the increased excise against higher margins resulting from cheaper crude and did not revise pump prices. But as states followed the Centre's example and raised VAT, retailers raised prices. Yet, consumers largely remained unaffected since only essential service vehicles were out on roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fuel-on-fire-petrol-zips-past-rs-100-mark-for-2nd-time-since-feb/articleshow/82468385.cms||Sanjay Dutta

They had received 9 lakh doses for this age group, and nearly 8 lakh doses have been distributed and utilised, so far, he added. “We have approached the Union government as many citizens who are due for the second dose are made to wait because of the unavailability of vaccines. Even after reaching out to the Centre repeatedly, adequate doses are not available for us. It is creating a hurdle in our vaccination drive,” he said. The state has vaccinated 1.7 crore citizens so far and can scale up the programme provided the Centre allots the vaccines in time, he added. He said the state government had also sought Covaxin doses as nearly 4-5 lakh of those beneficiaries are waiting for their second doses across the state. If the supply does not come on time, they would have to divert the doses purchased by the state for the 18-44 age group to those who need the second shot of Covaxin, Tope added.  The state had purchased three lakh Covishield vaccine doses and 4.79 lakh Covaxin doses. Another batch of 3.5 lakh doses of Covishield doses is awaited. “Overall we had made arrangement for 7.79 lakh doses for this age group . However, we are going slow as there are limited doses,” he added. The government is planning sequential vaccination in this age group where it will first vaccinate 35-44 age group beneficiaries to avoid crowding at the centres. They may also procure the Sputnik vaccine through the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccine-for-above-45-group-to-last-only-till-sunday-tope/articleshow/82474100.cms||Nisha Nambiar

If the supply does not come on time, they would have to divert the doses purchased by the state for the 18-44 age group to those who need the second shot of Covaxin, Tope added.  The state had purchased three lakh Covishield vaccine doses and 4.79 lakh Covaxin doses. Another batch of 3.5 lakh doses of Covishield doses is awaited. “Overall we had made arrangement for 7.79 lakh doses for this age group . However, we are going slow as there are limited doses,” he added. The government is planning sequential vaccination in this age group where it will first vaccinate 35-44 age group beneficiaries to avoid crowding at the centres. They may also procure the Sputnik vaccine through the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vaccine-for-above-45-group-to-last-only-till-sunday-tope/articleshow/82474099.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Dy CM slams Centre for exporting shots||Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday blamed the Union government for the ongoing vaccine shortage in the country. Speaking to reporters after the weekly Covid review meeting, Pawar said the Centre should have catered to the needs of all the states first before shipping out vaccines. He cited the example of Russia, which he said was exporting its homegrown vaccine only after vaccinating a significant portion of its population. “India started exporting vaccines before it even started the drive,” the deputy chief minister said. “The Union government should allow states to directly procure vaccines from abroad. I have also asked Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, Adar Poonawalla to ramp up production,” he said. While Maharashtra figures among the top states in the vaccination programme, it needs nearly 12 crore doses to ensure its 5.71 crore citizens in the 18-44 age bracket get both shots. Mumbai-based Haffkine Institute has started working on vaccine manufacturing, but it would likely take more than a year to produce at the necessary volume, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-slams-centre-for-exporting-shots/articleshow/82468437.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Power bills go undelivered as staff hit by Covid-19||HYDERABAD: Electricity consumers are worried as a majority of them have not received their power bills this month so far. Apprehension among the consumers is that they may receive inflated electricity bills again last year when they were served with hefty bills after lockdown was lifted. The Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSSPDCL) has been able to deliver only 30 per cent of the total 72 lakh bills up to May 7 in Greater Hyderabad and other areas in its jurisdiction. The reason cited was shortage of manpower who are down with Covid-19. Although the TSSPDCL has not stopped the billing process, it is unlikely to reach another 50-odd lakh consumers by May 12, the last date for delivery of bills. Even during the summer last year, the TSSPDCL had not raised bills as there was lockdown and the meter readers had not stepped out due to fear of Covid-19 infection. Though bills for three months put together were served later, there was public outcry that the amounts in the bills were inflated due to a change in the tariff slab. “If the bills are not raised for the power consumed in a month, the bill for two months would not be based on the same tariff slab. The number of electricity units consumed in two months would be more due to which the bill would be based on a higher tariff slab,” said R Krishnan, president of NG Towers in Shyamlal Buildings. The TSSPDCL is implementing various slabs under the non-telescopic tariff method, approved by the Telangana state Electricity Regulatory Commission. Last year, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had to assure the consumers from the floor of the state assembly that not a single additional rupee would be charged than the amount for the power consumed. TSSPDCL director (finance) P Narasimha Rao told TOI that they are following a twin-strategy this time as part of which the billing is being continued to deliver bills to as many consumers as possible by May 12. On the other hand, the TSSPDCL is also launching a self-meter reading application through which the consumers can capture the meter reading and upload it through their android phones, based on which the application will raise electricity bills, and the consumers can pay it online. This software application is likely to be launched in three to four days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/power-bills-go-undelivered-as-staff-hit-by-covid-19/articleshow/82468439.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Pune||Senior citizens throng sites amidst vax shortage||Pune: Vaccination sites across the city are reporting a rush of citizens above 45 years of age, who are due for the second dose amid a scarcity of Covishield doses. The scene was quite chaotic at the Gandhi Bhavan vaccination centre in Kothrud early on Friday morning, as senior citizens assembled there to collect tokens to reserve their doses. Social distancing norms were blatantly violated. The scene was no different at other centres across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. On Friday, 35,457 beneficiaries got shots across the district. Pune civic limits topped the vaccination list with 15,586 shots, followed by Rural (12,962), and Pimpri Chinchwad (6,909). The total vaccination includes 6,155 inoculations in the 18-44 age group in the district. Around 20,000 people in the 45-plus category received their second dose as well. The use of Covishield for the second and first dose may result in a shortage for the 45-plus group on Saturday and Sunday, if fresh stock does not arrive from the Centre, according to the deputy director of health services. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The shortage of vaccines has created a lot of issues for our vaccination drive and it is unlikely to be resolved in the next few days. The situation is likely to improve only after May 22, when the state can get its own quota of vaccines.” Mayor Muralidhar Mohol too issued a statement saying there will not be any vaccination drive for the 45+ category on Saturday. Vaccination for 18-44 age group will continue at Magar hospital, Sutar hospital, Laygude hospital, and Sassoon hospital. The centres will administer Covaxin doses only. In a statement, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has said vaccination for the 45+ category will not be held from Saturday due to lack of doses. The drive for 18-44 age group will be conducted across designated centres with limited doses. Ruby Hall clinic seeks nod for drive-in vaccination Ruby Hall clinic has sought permission from the divisional commissioner office for on-site and drive-in vaccination facility. In a letter, the hospital stated, “We would like to conduct a drive-in Covid vaccination service in a designated open area, where eligible people could drive in for the vaccination, complete registration, get vaccinated and wait in their own vehicles for observation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-citizens-throng-sites-amidst-vax-shortage/articleshow/82468442.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Pune civic body to set up first paediatric Covid unit||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is planning to set up a dedicated paediatric unit at the Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Yerawada for children diagnosed with Covid-19. The step is being taken in view of the rise in Covid cases among children during the second wave. There is a fear among many that the virus is likely to hit the children harder during the next projected spike/wave. Going by the PMC's records, the number of Covid cases has soared among children below 10 years of age during the second wave of the pandemic. There were 9,555 Covid cases registered in 10 months (between March and December) last year, whereas the cases surged to 10,610 in just five months between January and May this year. Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, PMC, said, “ We have started with the basic planning pertaining to the infrastructure. The setting up of an oxygen plant will take more time.. Initially, there will be 60-70 beds. The facility will be for children diagnosed with Covid-19 and also for their parents.” The facility will have 60 beds, of which 50 will have basic oxygen support facility and remaining 10 will be intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The civic administration is drafting a detailed plan, which is expected to be ready in next two to three months. Local MLA Sunil Tingre said that he has allocated Rs1crore for the paediatric unit through the MLA fund. “We will see that the unit gets operational at earliest. All necessary infrastructure will be in place in the next few days, including oxygen plant. Steps are being taken to get additional fund of Rs1.5 crore through the CSR”, he said. The civic administration has also initiated steps to recruit 10 paediatricians who will be posted at the unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-set-up-first-paediatric-ncov-unit/articleshow/82468443.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Pune: 2nd wave marks steep rise in panic & anxiety among kids||PUNE: From sudden panic attacks to staying wide awake till the wee hours to marked disinterest in any physical activity — children, primarily those between the ages of 9 and 14 years, are suffering mentally with the onslaught of the Covid second wave. Calls are pouring in from anxious parents seeking psychiatric consultations for their disturbed children. Senior citizens, who are having a hard time coping with the collapse of healthcare and disaster being witnessed in many parts of the country at present, are also on the same boat. “The situation is bad. Each day, we are getting at least six to seven phone calls from anxious and panicked parents worried about their children. Almost all of them said that their children were too scared, plagued by several kinds of complications ranging from panic attacks to insomnia. Deaths during the second wave of the pandemic have been extremely high and each day there are cases where people are dying due to the dearth of oxygen or beds. Children are gravely affected such a situation,” city-based psychiatrist Swapnil Deshmukh told TOI. A Kothrud-based couple started worrying after their 13-year-old son suddenly refused to study or play and constantly pleaded with them to be safe and ‘not die.’ “We took it lightly at first but then became worried after we found him weeping silently on a couple of occasions. He also refused to eat properly or play indoor games. We consulted a psychologist and have been asked to follow some steps to get him out of his present state of mind. He is better now but still has some way to go. I have to step out of the house every second day for chores and that is making him very scared,” the father, who requested anonymity, told TOI. Deshmukh said anxiety disorder was on a significant rise. “This is happening due to feelings of uncertainty and bad news coming in from all around and the death/illness of close ones. People are suffering panic attacks due to severe anxiety. Physical symptoms of anxiety include breathless, dry mouth and palpitations. These are sometimes getting confused with Covid symptoms as well. Insomnia (sleep problems) is also on the rise,” he added. Another parent told TOI that he was faced by the same problem on two fronts.  “While I found my 13-year-old son not sleeping and staying wide awake until 2am, looking absolutely blank, my 70-year-old father, who stays in Kolkata, also started calling me three to four times each day weeping profusely and pleading me to stay indoors. I consulted doctors and came to know about the problem. While I am following whatever has been advised to me, even I am extremely worried and stressed due to the current circumstances and my job,” the man told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2nd-wave-marks-steep-rise-in-panic-anxiety-among-kids/articleshow/82468448.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||5 Yavatmal hospitals told to refund Rs1.91L to Covid patients||Yavatmal: Five private Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCHs) in the city have been ordered to refund excess amount collected from 24 patients within seven days, failing which a penalty of Rs1,000 per day will be imposed on the defaulters which will be paid to the concerned patients. As per the order issued by district collector Amol Yedge, a total of Rs1,90,800 has to be credited to the account of the respective patients. After receiving complaints about overcharging by hospitals, the collector had appointed auditors to verify the treatment and bills given to the patients. After receiving the auditors’ reports, the erring hospitals were asked to explain their position within 15 days. On finding the DCHs’ replies unsatisfactory, the administration rejected their claims and asked to refund excess charges recovered from Covid patients. The administration has already fixed Covid-19 treatment charges and the same was informed to all private hospitals treating Covid patients. Flouting the directive, the hospitals had recovered excess amount from the patients, the auditors’ had found. The administration has warned the erring hospitals of action under Section 51 (C) of the Disaster Management Act. The amount ordered to refund is: Ujawane Hospital (Rs81,700 to 7 patients), Rathod Hospital (Rs18,600 to 4 patients), Shah Hospital (Rs16,600 to 5 patients), Saishraddha Hospital (Rs47,900 to 7 patients) and Dhawane Hospital (Rs26,000 to 1 patient) making a total of Rs1,90,800. Earlier, relatives of a deceased Covid patient from Ghatanji tehsil had ransacked Shah Hospital alleging overcharging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-yavatmal-hospitals-told-to-refund-rs1-91l-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82468449.cms||---
---||Pune||Citizens feel the heat as shop closure makes coolers and fans inaccessible||Pune: Ameya Joshi, who works at a private bank, has been eagerly waiting since a couple of weeks to get an air cooler at his home but has been unable to purchase it as shops are closed and deliveries, on hold. With restrictions likely to be extended for two more weeks, Joshi says he is unsure whether he will be able to buy it this summer. Satara road resident Vijay Soni said, “I wanted to fix new fans and also provide coolers at my parents’ home on Bibvewadi Road since the existing ones are not working well. But I cannot do it till the restrictions are lifted. I tried to purchase it online but delivery is an issue.”IT professional Ramesh Hegde said he had shifted to his new home in February and wanted to install an air conditioner and get a new refrigerator. “I will have to postpone the plan till the market reopens,” Hegde said. Shopkeepers said they have been getting multiple enquiries but are being unable to cater to the demand because of restrictions and added that sales could be allowed, at least for home deliveries. “Generally, we start getting orders in February and March. April-May is peak season for us. Shops are being closed for the second consecutive year. Instead of a complete closure, the administration can allow home deliveries, which is beneficial for citizens as well as shopkeepers. Keeping shops closed for a month cannot be a solution,” said Umesh Deshpande, a shop owner. Citizens said they were also facing difficulties in accessing repairs and maintenance of air conditioners, coolers and refrigerators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-feel-the-heat-as-shop-closure-makes-coolers-and-fans-inaccessible/articleshow/82468452.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Total lockdown not needed, will challenge cases’ data in HC: Pune mayor||PUNE: A day after the Bombay high court told the state government to consider imposing a total lockdown in Pune due to the high number of Covid-19 cases, Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol on Friday said the data submitted before the HC appears to be misleading and there is a plan to file an affidavit before the court challenging the data. Mohol said there was no need for a total lockdown in Pune as the situation was under control in the city and that Covid cases have reduced in the last few days. Mohol said the data furnished before the HC also included figures from Pimpri Chinchwad and the rural parts of Pune district. The city’s active caseload has dropped to 39,000, which is less than Mumbai’s, he added. Manjusha Idhate, chief law officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “We are filing a detailed affidavit before the court mentioning various steps taken by PMC in Covid-19 mitigation and the current status of cases, beds and availability of oxygen in hospitals. We have started working on the affidavit and relevant data.” However, sources in the PMC said the civic body is not a direct party in the matter and, hence, a senior legal team had not been appointed to represent it. Only, an officer was told to assist in data submission, they added. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who held a Covid review meeting here on Friday, also said that Pune’s data furnished before the court included data from Pune city, Pimpri Chinchwad and the rural areas. Pawar said the decision about a lockdown will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He, however, welcomed Mohol’s move to approach the court with relevant data. “The mayor is the first citizen of the city and he has the right to take up the issue. The chief minister will take a final decision as the HC has told the state government to look into the matter,” he said. Mohol said, “It appears that old data about Covid-19 cases have been furnished to the court. The data has shown over one lakh cases in Pune. This must be the collective figure of the entire district, which includes areas in the PMC, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and rural parts. The situation has improved a lot in the city in the last two weeks. The active caseload has dropped from 56,000 to 39,000 and the fatality rate has dropped too. Seven oxygen plants are being set up by the PMC.” Mohol said the affidavit is being filed before the HC to prevent confusion and fear among the citizens pertaining to cases and restrictions. The cases have declined because of various measures taken and the restrictions imposed since the last few weeks, he claimed. “In the current situation, there is no need for additional lockdown in the city. We will submit latest relevant data in the affidavit to explain the status,” he added. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said Pune’s situation was slowly stabilizing and the positivity rate has now come down to 20%. He said lessons can definitely be learnt from not just the Brihanmumbai Mnicipal Corporation but any other city that is doing good work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/total-lockdown-not-needed-will-challenge-cases-data-in-hc-mayor/articleshow/82468458.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Mad scramble in Jaipur markets ahead of lockdown||JAIPUR: Markets in the city witnessed a huge rush after the state government announced on Thursday night that there would be complete lockdown from May 10 to 24. The announcement created panic as people came out in large numbers to buy essential items and groceries on Friday morning. Although shops of essential items like grocery and vegetables will remain open, people fear that they would not be allowed to venture out like last year and hit the markets to stock-up their supplies. Binni Taneja, a resident of Raja Park, went to the market at 8am to purchase grocery items. “I know guidelines will allow us to go out in the morning, but I don’t want to take any risk. What if the government decides to shut down the entire market? Situation this year is worst than the last year. We need to be prepared,” said Binni. Many people were seen at the departmental stores, vegetable markets in the Walled City area. At Ghat Gate, Chandpol Market, Johri Bazaar, people were seen loitering everywhere. A grocery storeowner at Chandpol Ramkishan Gupta said that people have bought sacks of wheat and pulses and some were purchasing soaps, shampoo, snacks for at least one month.  “People are a bit panicked and stockpiling for a month. Even people who purchased just a few days ago are buying extra items,” said Gupta. President of Chandpol Vyapaar Mandal Subhash Goyal said, “There was a sense of panic in the last two days. Although people are aware about the lockdown guidelines, they are scared. The virus impact is severe this year. Hence, on Friday, relatively a huge crowd was seen in the market. People were stocking up vegetables and grocery items like masalas, wheat flour, edible oil, pulses. People should, however, stay at home as even while purchasing in the markets, they are exposing themselves to the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mad-scramble-in-city-markets-ahead-of-lockdown/articleshow/82468459.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC caps rate for ‘Covid hotels’; task force begins preparing for 3rd wave||Nagpur: Hotels, marriage halls and similar establishments operating as Covid Care Centres (CCC) can now charge only up to Rs4,000 per day as an all inclusive tariff for room rent plus specific medical assistance. This order by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) came late on Friday evening, a day that saw a flurry of decisions at the district and state level to prepare for the apparently inevitable Covid-19 third wave. While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered the constitution of a task force comprising paediatricians to protect children from the third wave, guardian minister Nitin Raut sought Rs100 crore for Nagpur’s fight against Covid-19. NMC’s order makes it clear that all step-down facilities (non-hospitals) being used to treat asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 have to follow the upper limit on the charges. The order says that Rs4,000 upper limit must include “routine monitoring and investigations, oxygen charges, consultation, bed charges, nursing charges”. At the same time, the order does clarify that these step-down facilities can charge actuals to the patient for any other services. However, the ‘extra’ services must be provided only with the patient’s consent. With a growing consensus that the third wave is likely to affect children, the state government has started with an action plan. After CM Thackeray announcement earlier in the day about preparing safety protocols for children’s safety, divisional commissioner Sanjiv Kumar constituted a task force comprising senior doctors. Kumar asked the task force to prepare a concrete plan about requirement of beds, medical equipments and supplies, medicines etc to ensure that Nagpur is prepared to safeguard and treat children afflicted with Covid-19. At a meeting between Kumar and senior doctors of the task force, discussions over much needed ICU, NICU etc for children was the focal point. Kumar has proposed a special 200-bed facility at AIIMS to treat children. Fever clinics will also focus on identifying children who may need to be tested and/or treated further. Guardian minister Raut has sought Rs100 crore from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to help Nagpur prepare for the third wave. Raut said funds will be needed to purchase equipment and ramp up infrastructure well in advance. The district collector’s office informed that Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) has donated Rs11.88 crore for the fight against Covid-19. District collector Ravindra Thakare informed that a four-member committee has also been set up to monitor oxygen supply and distribution. Plans to set up oxygen generation plants at rural hospitals are also moving forward in Kuhi and Narkhed talukas. Raut will be taking a detailed review tomorrow of both, the current situation as well preparations for the third wave.

---||Pune||Pune hospitals see drop in OPD patients with Covid-like symptoms||PUNE: Major Covid hospitals in Pune are witnessing a consistent drop in suspected Covid patients coming to their fever units for medical consultation on an outpatient-department (OPD) basis. “Till last week, we would have 270 to 300 suspected patients daily complaining of Covid-like symptoms. The number dropped to 100 three days ago and, on Friday, we had only around 50 suspected Covid patients at our fever OPD. Although premature, we can say the surge is on the wane,” said Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. The hospital currently has 500 Covid patients. “Inquiries continue to be more for admissions in our intensive care unit (ICU) than for beds providing basic oxygen support. These are mainly the patients who were admitted for early hypoxia (blood oxygen saturation going below 92%) in small and medium-sized hospitals and needed admission in our ICU when their condition deteriorated,” Kelkar said. Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati hospital, said, “We have recorded an almost 60% drop in suspected Covid patients coming to our fever OPD. The next two weeks will make it clear whether the current surge is on the wane or not.” The Pune Metropolitan Region, comprising areas under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and zilla parishad (ZP), collectively reported 9,034 confirmed Covid cases and 144 deaths on Friday. As for patients recovering for Covid-19, the figures have consistently remained on the rise. On Thursday, the region had reported 6,289 recoveries whereas there were 8,188 recoveries on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-see-drop-in-opd-patients-with-covid-like-symptoms/articleshow/82468461.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The court adjourned the case to May 17 for further hearing. The court, it may be recalled, heard the plea on maintainability of the petition last week as it was filed by a person who was not connected to the case and held that even third parties could file such pleas if there is an element of public interest in it. BR Madhusudhan Rao, principal special judge, in his order, said that he was relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court that held that third parties too could file such pleas in such matters. The judge heard the discharge pleas filed by the accused in the Penna Cements chargesheet and adjourned the case to June 15. The petition was filed by Penna Group chairman Penna Pratap Reddy, who urged the court to discharge him from the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bail-cancellation-plea-counters-to-be-filed-by-may-17/articleshow/82468463.cms||---

She is currently staying in the US and may not be able to come down due to the pandemic, it said. Stephenson is the de facto complainant in the ACB case filed against Congress MP A Revanth Reddy and others who are facing charges of trying to bribe Stephenson to get him vote in favour of TDP nominee Vem Narender Reddy in the 2015 MLC elections. Revanth was with the TDP at that time. Last week, the ACB court recorded the depositions of Stephenson and a few others. Their cross-examination by the accused would be done on May 10. On May 31, 2015, the ACB laid a trap and caught Revanth and others while they were trying to lure Stephenson with Rs 50 lakh and a promise to give Rs 5 crore more. The TRS leadership came down heavily on TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu, charging him with engineering the conspiracy from behind the screen. The ACB mentioned in its chargesheet that several TDP functionaries were in touch with their party chief before executing this conspiracy, but did not make him an accused. Revanth made Stephenson speak to Naidu over the phone before handing over the cash. There were reports in 2015 that the ACB sent the voice sample to the forensic science lab to ascertain the authenticity of the voice. But, nothing much was heard about this after that. The ACB initially said that it could not trace the source of Rs 50 lakh cash. Later, it linked the cash to Vem Narender and his son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/acb-stephensons-daughter-dropped-from-witness-list/articleshow/82468480.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao gave 10 of the 14 posts of mayor, deputy mayor, chairperson and deputy chairperson to women though all these posts were not reserved for them. Women corporators of the TRS were unanimously elected as mayor and deputy mayor of Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation and Khammam Municipal Corporation. Elections for chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of five municipalities were also held on Friday. Women were elected unopposed as chairpersons of Siddipet, Jadcherla and Kothur municipalities. The posts of chairperson of Nakrekal and Atchampet municipalities were not reserved for women. The posts of three deputy chairperson also went to women unanimously. With Friday’s election, major municipal corporations in Telangana like Greater Hyderabad, GWMC, Khammam and Nizamabad are headed by women. The ministers in charge of each urban local body opened the sealed covers on Friday in which the names finalised by KCR for the top posts were mentioned. A whip was issued and all the corporators and councillors elected these candidates by raising their hands after the completion of swearing-in ceremony. The TRS had won a majority of wards in seven urban local bodies and the opposition Congress and BJP parties were not even in a position to contest the mayoral elections.  Ponukollu Neeraja won unopposed as mayor of KMC. The post was reserved for women.

This has increased the footfall in the market and the mandi association has been demanding to either increase the timing to open mandi or keep the mandi shut for two days a week. Street vendors and small shopkeepers who cannot open their outlets due to corona guidelines have turned vegetable vendors because it comes under essential services. According to the Muhana Mandi Association, around 3,000-5,000 people visit the market every day. Muhana Mandi Association has declared shutdown on May 8 to keep the footfall in control. According to the guidelines, essential services are allowed to open from 6am to 11am that has created further congestion in the vegetable market. Rahul Tanwar, president of Muhana Mandi Association, said, "Due to the five-hour timing and people going out of business, there is a rise in the number of vegetable vendors. To earn a livelihood, people are rushing to the market. If the government increases the timing of the market then the crowd can be controlled or else this place may become dangerous. We will be writing to the district collector soon regarding this." Majority of the street food sellers, delivery boys and pan shop owners have started selling vegetables. In Raja Park and Malviya Nagar, people with stalls selling different street foods have taken up the profession of vegetable sellers. Instead of street food items, they are selling vegetables in their carts. It is, however, unlikely, that government will allow vegetable markets to remain open after 11am due to rise in corona cases. Muhana Mandi Association has demanded to keep the mandi closed on Saturday and Sunday as weekends are more crowded and the association wants to prevent the mandi premises from turning into a super spreader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rush-at-muhana-mandi-as-people-stock-up-veggies/articleshow/82468504.cms||---

Case fatality rate (CFR) has increased in first week of May to 1.75%, which is higher than all four weeks of April. This is due to decline in cases and continuation of high number of deaths. The district registered 48,165 recoveries in first week of May as against 34,357 new cases. This led to fall in active cases to 62,298 on Friday. There were 76,706 active cases on April 30. The decline in weekly cases along with TPR, CFR and recoveries being more than new cases indicates April was the peak of second wave, and cases are likely to drop further in second week of May. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “Cases will plummet in the district from second week of May. Scenario of second wave in the district is similar to that registered in other countries.” TOI had on Friday reported the state government projected decline in active cases to 40,919 and 3,208 surplus beds in hospitals in the district by May 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-second-wave-begins-to-recede-in-1st-week-of-may-in-dist/articleshow/82468534.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The accused Yogendra Mehta (55), who runs an ashram in Bhakrota has been accused of drugging and raping two women in his compound. The complainants have accused the godman of raping them since 3 to 15 years ago, while they were at the ashram for special prayers. The medical examination of both the survivors was done, which the police say will not establish anything and that just a formality has been done. Mukesh Choudhary, SHO, Bhakrota police station said that they have recorded statements of the survivors. “The investigation has started with the testimony of the victims. Soon the godman will be questioned in the case,” said Choudhary. The report says that the godman is very influential in the area and reportedly has a link with several of those in power. The survivors have said that the godman and his aides are exerting pressure to drop the rape charges. The complaint says that female disciples of the godman arranged women for him every day. “They first follow the man who attends the daily prayers at the Ashram and pursued them to bring the entire family with them. When the entire family comes, the godman through his female aides, allegedly persuaded the males to leave their women at the compound for special blessings,” said the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-yet-to-question-rape-accused-godman/articleshow/82468539.cms||---

But the task ahead for him will be challenging considering the heat felt by the previous AIADMK government in managing the NEET crisis, introducing new syllabus and preparing students for competitive examinations. The AIADMK government was criticised for lacking coherence in taking decisions pertaining to the school education department. Mahesh has to ensure that students are not left out of academic activity, especially when schools are closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An MCA graduate, Mahesh, 43, was re-elected from Thiruverumbur for the second time, defeating AIADMK’s P Kumar by a margin of 49,000 votes. DMK sources say chief minister M K Stalin wanted to give special attention to the school education department. Apart from planning new reforms, the government is considering innovative experiments to enhance learning in schools. To incorporate these reforms, the party wanted a relatively young minister for dynamic decision making. Thangam Thennarasu was of the same age as Mahesh when he was made school education minister in the M Karunanidhi-led DMK government 10 years ago. Above all, Mahesh’s accessibility to the Alwarpet residence of Stalin on Chittaranjan road at any given time will make decision-making swifter. Adding to this, T Udayachandran, previously secretary to school education department who received commendation from the Madras high court for his work in revamping the state board syllabus, has been appointed as one of the secretaries to the CM. He is likely to advise the CM on the reforms to be made in the school education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thiruverumburs-1st-min-has-task-cut-out/articleshow/82468567.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan high court's notice to government over closure of meat shops||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Friday issued notice to the state government on a petition challenging the conditions of licences to meat shops asking it to close shops on festivals associated with a particular community as discrimination on the basis of religion. "The single bench of Justice S P Sharma issued notice to the state government seeking to reply within six weeks on a petition by Abdul Hameed Qureshi, a meat shop owner in Jaipur," said Kaleem Ahamed Khan, counsel for the petitioner. He said the government had imposed certain conditions including closure of meat shops on certain days while granting licence to his meat shop. The condition includes the closure of meat shops for 16 days in a year apart from every Tuesday of a week. Apart from that the local bodies department had issued an order on April 3 that on April 25 (Mahaveer Jayanti) all the meat shops/abattoirs would be closed. The petitioner said the state had already declared 16 holidays in a year and on every Tuesday. But the same is not applicable to the fish markets. The petitioner said that out of the 16 holidays, four are of national importance like Republic Day, Shaheed Diwas, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti, which are common to all. But the other 12 holidays including Tuesdays are associated with a particular religion (Hindus). This is an infringement on the right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution, said the petitioner. The petitioner said he professes Islam and practises according to Islamic Shariat. If state government itself imposes conditions of banning selling meat on certain days in favour of Hindus, the state had to take into account the religious sentiments of the petitioner as well by ordering closure of liquor shops and meat shops selling pork in the month of Ramzan. But it is not practically possible in a country which comprises multiple religions and communities. In a secular country, the official orders favouring a particular religious group thus to be quashed and set aside, pleaded the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-to-govt-over-closure-of-meat-shops/articleshow/82468568.cms||Joychen Joseph

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Friday announced there would be no inoculation of this age group on Saturday for lack of doses. This would be the first time even centres administering Covaxin will be shut in the city. The civic body is likely to get 29,000 doses of Covishield on Saturday afternoon, which will help resume the programme on Sunday. Vaccination of 45+ age group, HCWs and FLWs was badly affected between May 1 and 5 due to shortage of doses. But NMC continued vaccination at three Covaxin centres — two at GMCH and Mahal Diagnostic Centre for these categories. The civic body received 20,000 doses of Covishield on May 5, allowing vaccination to resume on May 6 and May 7 at 87 centres of Covishield in government hospitals, NMC’s primary health centres and satellite centres. The stock was reportedly exhausted on Friday. NMC requested and received 3,000 doses of Covishield from Zilla Parishad (ZP) on Friday evening. The state government has also reportedly allocated 29,000 doses of Covishield, received from the central government, for NMC. These are likely to reach on Saturday afternoon. Vaccination is likely to resume normally on Sunday and Monday with the help of these 32,000 doses. For the first time since vaccination started on January 16, two centres at GMCH were totally shut on Friday for lack of doses. Third centre of Covaxin at NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre continued inoculation. The centre has very few doses. Therefore, NMC decided to close down all three centres for Saturday. These centres will continue to be affected on Sunday also, if the civic body does not get doses of Covaxin on Saturday. NMC will continue vaccination of 18-44 years age group at six centres on Saturday, as doses for these were supplied separately by the state. Considering shortage of doses and rush at centres, NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar on Friday issued a letter to all centres, making it mandatory to give priority to second dose for 45+ category. “There should be separate counter and queue for second dose. First priority should be given to people who registered online for first dose. Then, centres should distribute tokens to walk-ins, subject to availability of doses,” he said. Large number of people from 45+ age group are due for second dose and witnessing inconvenience since last week of April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vax-for-45-in-city-today-due-to-lack-of-doses/articleshow/82468571.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Trichy||Trichy hosps to get more oxygen-equipped beds||Trichy: Stating that the Trichy district administration is mulling to increase the number of oxygen supply equipped beds, district collector S Divyadharshini on Friday appealed to people not to rush to hospitals for mild Covid-19 symptoms. Speaking to reporters after inspecting the Covid-19 situation along with monitoring officer for Trichy Reeta Harish Thakkar, the collector said that plans are afoot to push the number of beds with oxygen supply at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH). “We have around 400 oxygen enabled beds at the MGMGH. The process of adding 200 more such beds is under way,” she said. The collector also mentioned about the plan to add 40 and 60 oxygen equipped beds each at the government hospital in Srirangam and government headquarters hospital in Manapparai. She said that there was no complaint of medical oxygen being sold in the black market and asked the people to report to her in case of such incidents. On the availability of oxygen at MGMGH, the collector said that the hospital has been equipped with a 20kl capacity tank which gets recharged as and when necessary. On the surge of fresh Covid-19 cases in Trichy, the collector said that the increase in number of samples helped them identify the infection at the early stage. “When we identify them early, it helps us treat them with tablets,” she said. Responding to the need for increasing the beds in the government and private hospitals, the collector appealed to the people not to seek hospital admission for Covid-19 patients with mild symptom and instead stay in home isolation. Patients with moderate symptoms can be kept at the Covid care centres (CCC). “Patients need not panic. Those with severe symptoms will need hospitalisation,” she said. She said that out of the 42 containment zones in Trichy, 26 in the corporation limits have the highest number of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-hosps-to-get-more-oxygen-equipped-beds/articleshow/82468574.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Some hotels take in mild Covid patients sans tie-ups with hospitals||Jaipur: After testing positive with mild symptoms, Praveen Jain (name changed on request) went to a hospital. The doctor gave him medicines and advised home isolation. Fearing he might infect others at home he called a few hotels in Jaipur for self-isolation. After a dozen calls to as many hotels, he found one which accepted him. The deal was for Rs 3,000 per room night including taxes, tea, breakfast and two meals. For many like Jain, who are Covid positive with mild symptoms, it’s hard to find a bed in hospitals or a room in a hotel. The government has no policy for addressing the problems people like Jain face. Many hotels said they cannot take in Covid positive people. Not that they cannot set aside a floor dedicated for such patients but the government guidelines are silent on it. As per the existing rules, the hotels need to have tie ups with hospitals for keeping only asymptomatic cases. Recently, a hospital in Jaipur tied up with two hotels for this purpose. But hardly there other examples where hospitals have entered into tie ups with hotels in the state though the trend has picked up in other cities of the country in the past few weeks. There are a large number of people like Jain who have been refused beds in hospitals even though the health minister and the secretary have said on multiple occasions that there are enough beds but oxygen is a problem. When TOI contacted the hotel where Jain stayed, the general manager, requesting anonymity, said he is giving only accommodation and food and has set aside a dedicated floor for such people. “It’s a humanitarian crisis. People are suffering because of lack of medical facilities. If people like Jain have no other option, they will have to stay at home and infect others. In the current wave of the pandemic, it is seen that if one member of a family gets corona, all get infected. So there is a demand. The government needs to look at allowing isolation for people in hotels even if there is no tie up with hospitals,” said the general manager. There are others so go for tele-consultation or buy packages from hospitals for home treatment. “There are also a large number of cases where people buy packages for home treatment and stay in the hotel. Of course, there is a safety issue with our staff but we are taking adequate measures so that no one gets infected,” said the hotelier. It’s not mandatory for hotels to allow check-in only after the guests produce RT-PCR negative report. The guests are generally asked to fill up a form stating that they don’t have Covid like symptoms. So, the possibility of asymptomatic patients checking in cannot be ruled out as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/some-hotels-take-in-mild-covid-patients-sans-tie-ups-with-hosps/articleshow/82468584.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: No clarity on operation of cabs & autorickshaws||JAIPUR: The state government prepares to enforce strict lockdown from May 10-24. However, there is still no clarity on certain issues. According to an April 30 order, the government had exempted all shops selling food articles, but meat and fish markets were not allowed to function. While the government has been particularly careful not to disturb the livelihood of the people during curfew and exodus of labourers due to lockdown the ambiguity on the opening of the meat shops for limited hours is baffling. The order did not mention closure of meat shops as such, but police are not allowing them to open during the curfew, complain meat shops owners. The government while allowing vegetable markets and other shops, the meat shops and fish markets also offers livelihood of thousands of people and is also related to the culinary and eating habits of a sizeable section of the population. The meat shop owners on condition of anonymity said the police did not allow them to open their shops. Similarly, the government had banned all public transports from Monday during lock down but there is no clarity on the services of Uber and Ola services and autorickshaws. If Uber and Ola are not allowed to function, how could people coming to the state by air and rail could reach their home or hotel without any mode of travel available to them. State home department officials said Ola and Uber could ply their vehicles from airport and railway stations but there still is no clarity in the order issued by the home department on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-clarity-on-operation-of-cabs-autorickshaws/articleshow/82468607.cms||---

It’s the same caliber of ammunition used in the 5.56 Insas assault rifles, which the Indian Army is phasing out. The bullets supplied to the US are of NATO specification, making it slightly different from that used is the country, said sources.The Insas rifle too is made by the ordnance factories and is the first indigenous assault rifle.The consignment took off for Chennai from the Varangaon factory near Bhusawal. This is the first major export order bagged by OFB for small arms’ ammunition to a developing country like the US. The OFB has also bagged repeat order of similar quantity, which would be despatched soon, said a source in the organization.The factory is also working on an order to make around 4 lakh rounds of the 9 mm ammunition, which is used in the Kalashnikov (AK series) rifles, said a source. The order for the 9mm rounds has come from Israel. The bullets will be mainly pumped into the private users market apart from use in law enforcement, said a source.This comes as a major boost for the ordnance factories, which have been under fire these days for alleged inefficiency and lack of quality in products, leading to plans for converting it into a public corporation from a government department at present. “The order was bagged directly through an independent agency. It was cleared as ammunition fit in the quality criterion and the factory could also come up with competitive rates,” said a union source.Made on NATO specifications, these bullets are made entirely of lead. The rounds supplied domestically have a mix of lead and steel. The lead bullets have more lethality, a source said. This serves dual purpose of private possession and also by security forces, said a source.Even as the Indian Army is phasing out the 5.56 Insas rifles as it was reported to be disadvantageous, the production of rounds continues at the factories. This is for the rifles that still remain in use by the forces. Apart from the Army, even the paramilitary forces have been using the Insas, which was put into use during the Kargil war. The Army, however, does not find it too suitable for counter insurgency operations.As for the 9mm ammunition, which is being made by the factory, it will have a different primer and the propellant system as compared to that in bullets made at present, said a source.Meanwhile, the orders for making 5.56 Insas rifles itself has come down to negligible levels because of the Army’s plans to phase it out, said OFB sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/under-fire-to-improve-ofb-ships-11-million-bullets-to-us-market/articleshow/82468621.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Mumbai||Digital divide: Mumbai youths hog rural vax slots, anger locals||Mumbai: Faced with few vaccination slots and high demand, many in the 18-44 age group from the cities are taking advantage of the poor connectivity and tech backwardness in rural areas to book appointments there, leading to unrest among the locals. Health officials from Shahapur and Murbad talukas of Thane district said at least 95% of the slots at the 12 vaccination centres are being booked by people from Thane, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai and even Mumbai. At the Shendrun primary health centre in Shahapur, which administers 100 doses daily, only five locals got vaccinated on Friday. The rest were from outside the village. Vaccination centres in other Thane rural areas, like Bhiwandi rural, Badlapur, have the same problem, but people coming from outside make up 25% to 50% of beneficiaries. The tension is still there, and has led to arguments. Ajay Sharma (30), a resident of Bhandup, tried unsuccessfully for four days for an appointment in Mumbai. “Then a friend who lives in Thane said there were slots available at a centre in Bhiwandi. I quickly booked a slot for myself,” said Sharma. “It was just a 45-minute drive to the centre.” Many people from Vasai-Virar are easily getting appointments in smaller centres in Palghar district for vaccination. This has irked locals, who are demanding that some slots be reserved for them or the online booking system be done away with. In some areas, local leaders have threatened to stop outsiders from coming into the villages for vaccination. Subhash Pawar, vice-president of Thane zilla parishad, said they have met Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde and demanded that there should be a pin code system for online booking so that only locals can benefit. Public health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI they have received several such complaints and locals are bound to be upset. But the state government cannot allow walk-ins for the 18-44 age group as it will lead to chaos when vaccine supply is limited and erratic. Dr Tarulata Dhanke, Shahapur medical health officer with 9 vaccination centres under her jurisdiction, said, “We are going as per circular and cannot stop people from other cities if they get online appointment. If the state government brings any new rules, we will follow it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/digital-divide-mumbai-youths-hog-rural-vax-slots-anger-locals/articleshow/82468652.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Chandigarh||Woman loses husband, struggles for 2 days to get his body||Jalandhar: A bereaved woman was allegedly made to run from pillar to post to get the body of her husband, a suspected Covid patient who was declared brought dead on Wednesday, from the Civil Hospital mortuary. She alleged that she was not properly guided and was made to shuttle between different places as she was unable to understand the procedures. The process was expedited when a few journalists reached the civil hospital and came to know about her plight. “My husband Jatinder Singh started feeling uncomfortable all of a sudden on Wednesday and we called an ambulance. However, our neighbours closed their doors when they came to know that my husband was seriously sick. When we brought him to the hospital, doctors said he was already dead and then we kept the body in the mortuary,” said Adda Hoshiarpur resident Suman. She said that she came to take the body on Thursday but nobody guided her properly. “The fellow at the mortuary asked for a slip from the hospital but I had none. I have been unable to understand procedures,” said Suman. She said her 26-year-old daughter fought with a nurse as she believed that her father was not treated properly and was not dead when he was brought to the hospital. The woman said she did not have the money for cremation or to hire an ambulance to take the body to the cremation ground. “When I came here today, a local resident who came to know about my condition gave me Rs 1,000 for cremation or to hire an ambulance to transport the body. I don’t know the person but he told me to take the body to a certain cremation ground and he would also pay for free cremation,” she said. When the media got wind of her situation, things moved quickly and she got the body, along with a PPE kit. When questioned, mortuary in-charge Dr Kam Raj said, “He was a suspected Covid patient and was to be cremated according to Covid protocol. The matter came to my notice only today and the body was handed over to his wife immediately. We also provided PPE kits to the family as per laid down procedure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/woman-loses-husband-struggles-for-2-days-to-get-his-body/articleshow/82468635.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Lockdowns, inconstant rules wreak havoc on travel plans||PUNE: A week ago, 45-year-old Harish Dhame, a resident of Pimpri, booked air tickets to Chandigarh. On Thursday, he found out that travel regulations to the Union territory had suddenly changed. “I came to know only on Thursday that Chandigarh has mandated a negative RT-PCR report issued within 72 hours of travel. I got a message from the airline that I wouldn’t be allowed to board without the report. I must travel on Sunday and so far, I haven’t been able to get a report. I have decided to cancel my trip,” Dhame, a businessman, told TOI. Frequently changing travel regulations, and many states enforcing lockdowns, has caused no end of trouble for several rail and air passengers. Many were caught on the wrong foot by sudden changes in travel regulations, while others had to cancel or postpone their trips due to lockdowns. This showed in the recent passenger traffic figures released by the Pune airport. On May 4, just 838 passengers arrived, 745 left from the Pune airport on 10 flights. On May 5, there was a slight improvement — 1,128 passengers arrived and 1,109 departed. But there was a plunge on May 6, with just 665 passengers arriving and 839 departing. Kamlesh Dorap, who was to travel on business to Rajasthan on May 9, cancelled his trip. “I came to know Rajasthan was imposing a total lockdown from May 10 to 24. I cannot take a risk as my family is here. I cannot afford to get stuck there,” he said. Rahul Yadav, a student who planned to go to Kerala on May 12 to attend a wedding, too dropped his plans. “Kerala is under total lockdown from May 8 to May 16 and even though transport from the airport has been allowed, I don’t want to get stuck,” Yadav said. Train bookings too were getting cancelled. Subh Sinha, who had to go to Kolkata from Pune on May 9, said, “I got a message stating an RT-PCR negative report was a must. I had chosen to go by train instead of taking a flight as I couldn’t get a report on time and so, postponed the trip to July.” Geeta Sarkar, PRO with South Eastern Railway, confirmed that those without reports would be tested at the originating station. Airlines too said the situation was not ideal for them. “Call centres are flooded with calls, as are our social media platforms,” an airline staffer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lockdowns-inconstant-rules-wreak-havoc-on-travel-plans/articleshow/82466781.cms||Joy Sengupta

Chavan had shot herself dead with her service pistol in her quarters on March 25.The court perused the FIR as well the suicide note written by RFO Chavan before committing suicide. “On perusal of the material, prima facie we are of the view that the prayer of the petitioner as far as quashing of the FIR is concerned can be considered by the court,” it said on Friday. The high court issued notices to the respondents for final disposal returnable on June 14, 2021. The court also allowed investigations to go ahead in the suicide case. Reddy had also sought relief from the high court against rejection of his bail application by Achalpur sessions judge SK Mungilwar. The lower court had on Wednesday rejected his bail application. The suspended top officer is in magisterial custody.On Thursday, justice VM Deshpande heard the bail application moved by the main accused and suspended deputy conservator Vinod Shivkumar through his lawyer Firdos Mirza and issued notices to the respondents.

---||Chandigarh||PPA termination will create power crisis in state: PSPCL||Patiala: Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), in reply to a letter sent by the state government, has claimed that termination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with independent power purchasers (IPPs) will lead to a power crisis in the state. PPAs have been blamed for high electricity tariffs in the state. Now, the view of the Punjab’s sole power distribution company could trigger a fresh round of criticism for Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and the Congress government in the state. The PSPCL has issued the reply after Punjab principal secretary (finance) K A P Sinha had, in a communication in December last year, pressed for a need to revisit PPAs while pointing out the high cost of power fixed by private thermal plants, or IPPs. The principal secretary said the agreements were burdening Punjab consumers with Rs 1,000 crore annually on an average. However, in the reply, PSPCL said the state’s energy requirement for 2019-20 remained at 56,547 MUs, of which the contribution from the state’s three IPPs remained at 17,761 MUs, or 31.4% of the total demand. “Thus, without contribution from IPPs, the demand of Punjab could not have been met,” reads the letter. While rising electricity tarrifs have been an issue in Punjab, the Congress had in its 2017 election manifesto promised to revisit PPAs. With the Congress’s term set to come to a close in 2022, there have been demands for their cancellation from within the Congress and by rival parties AAP and SAD. In the reply, PSPCL said a maximum of 6,400MW power could be imported from outside the state. “To meet peak demand, which is well in excess of 13,000MW, an internal (within state) generation of at least 6,600MW is required to be maintained. IPPs alone contribute 3,920MW from internal generation. It is thus evident that without IPPs’ generation, PSPCL cannot meet its peak demand,” reads the letter. PSPCL said the rise in demand for power was nearly four times the increase in transmission capacity in the last six to seven years in the state. “During the financial year (FY) 2013-14, available transmission capacity for importing power from outside the state was 5,300 MW; it is now 6,400MW. On the other hand, maximum demand met during 2013-14 was around 8,900MW and this rose to 13,145MW in 2020-21. Only with the addition of 3,920MW capacity of IPPs, the PSPCL has been able to cope up with rising demand of the state,” said PSPCL. In the letter in December, the principal secretary had said that surplus generation capacity led to the PSPCL paying Rs 1,500 crore, during 2019-20 fincial year, only towards fixed cost against surrendered power. The principal secretary had indicated that provisions in the PPAs enabled the government utility to pay fixed charges for only three years if the agreements were terimnated. He said the state would have to pay for another 20 years, thus bleeding the state exchequer and burdening consumers, if the deals were not cancelled. PSPCL added, “Since the present transmission import capability of the state is severely limited, IPPs generation cannot be replaced with outside state power. Moreover, building or strengthening of transmission system is a time-consuming process and requires consistent efforts from state tuility in coordination with CEA/Power-Grid. Therefore, in the present scenario, termination of PPAs would lead to the severe power crisis in the state.” PSPCL added IPPs in the state have a variable cost of Rs 2. 98 per unit to 3.74, whereas PSPCL’s own per-unit thermal plants have a variable cost exceeding Rs 4 per unit; therefore, scheduling power from these IPPs is more economical. PSPCL chairman cum managing director A Venu Parsad confirmed the development. “We have sent the letter as a reply and maintained that termination of PPA would lead to power crisis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ppa-termination-will-create-power-crisis-in-state-pspcl/articleshow/82468666.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Mumbai||Wheel of life: How CISF cop, pilots saved the day for Nagpur-Mumbai air ambulance||MUMBAI: In his nearly three-decade-long career, Capt Keshri Singh had never heard of an entire wheel of a Beechcraft KingAir C-90 falling off mid-air. It is such a rare possibility that the cockpit of the turboprop aircraft is not designed to warn pilots about missing wheels. Had the CISF constable at Nagpur airport not noticed the wheel fall away on takeoff on Thursday evening, the unaware pilots would not have carried out a belly landing in Mumbai airport, Capt Singh told TOI on Friday. They would have instead put down a fuel-heavy aircraft onto the runway only to find it drop heavily to one side, send sparks flying and possibly turn into a ball of fire. Clueless without checklist, says 2nd-time lucky pilotCapt Keshri Singh says they had no option but to do a belly landingIt wasn’t the first time that Capt Keshri Singh, involved in an air ambulance’s belling landing in Mumbai on Thursday, had luck on his side. “In 2004, Capt Singh was involved in an accident in Kota, Rajasthan, after his Cessna 206 aircraft hit an electric pole. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, but he and the six passengers on board survived. He sustained grievous injuries though,’’ said a source. In Thursday’s serious incident, an inquiry has been initiated by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation announced it will conduct an audit of Jet Serve Aviation Pvt Ltd, the operator. “There is no checklist on landing with a lost wheel and belly landing is what most pilots come across only in flying school textbooks. But we had no option,” said Capt Singh. “About 30 minutes after our 5pm takeoff post refuelling in Nagpur, the air traffic control (ATC) informed us about the wheel. I couldn’t believe it. I had them send a photograph to our company to verify if that wheel was indeed ours,” he said. The final confirmation only came after the pilots carried out a low fly over Mumbai airport runway 27, flying at 200 feet with lowered landing gear. The air traffic controllers binoculared in and confirmed the aircraft had only one wheel left on its main landing gear, apart from a nose wheel. The problems had now only begun. Because of thunderstorm activity over Pune, the pilots had uplifted over four and a half hours of fuel in Nagpur. For over two hours, the pilots circled around, burning fuel in preparation to belly land—land without lowering the handicapped landing gear. On the Beechcraft, though, landing lights come on only when the landing gear is lowered. The plane then descended without landing lights. In the dark of the night in a hazy weather, the pilots aimed to touch down on the portion of the runway that was foamed to dampen sparks. The engines were cut at 50 feet to prevent fire on touchdown, and back in the passenger cabin, the three passengers braced for impact. “We finally landed with no injury to any passengers on board. I would have never known we had lost a wheel had that CISF personnel not made the life-saving observation,” said Capt Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-clueless-without-checklist-says-2nd-time-lucky-pilot/articleshow/82468693.cms||Manju V

"It may be useful to talk about location, timing and intensity of infection instead of waves and their number... If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all the places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends much on how effectively the guidance is implemented at the local level, in states, in districts and cities. The guidance about precautions, surveillance, containment, treatment and testing," Prof VijayRaghavan said.

"There have been peaks and falls in different places in India and all over the world in different times. It is useful to understand how and why the rise of infections takes place, how the strength varies, how they fall and what can happen subsequently...Infections rise when the virus has opportunities to infect humans," Prof VijayRaghavan said. Times ViewThe job of principal scientific advisor entails immense responsibility, especially when an epidemic is raging across the country. Every word he utters publicly ought to be well thought out. Changing one’s position glibly within days on such a critical issue doesn’t inspire confidence either in him or the government.Explaining the process of bringing down the rate of infection or containing it, he said the infection falls when the number of people vulnerable to the infection falls drastically. This can happen because people who have been infected earlier are unlikely to be re-infected for sometime. Besides, vaccination gives immunity and people are also protected with the use of masks and maintaining physical distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-days-on-govt-expert-recalibrates-stand-on-3rd-wave/articleshow/82468722.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Delhi||Loss of day’s work, fear of impotency: Why men in slums are hesitant to take the C-jab||New Delhi: More men are hesitant about being vaccinated for Covid-19 than women, according to a ground survey conducted by an NGO in 48 slum communities in west Delhi. The reasons for the reluctance to roll up the arm for the protective shot include the fear of coronavirus infection after getting the jab, losing a day’s work to go to a healthcare centre, fear of post-injection impotence, inadequate information on how to get the jab and lack of an Aadhaar card. In the survey, conducted by NGO Protsahan India Foundation, which has been working in the slums of Dwarka, Uttam Nagar and Vikas Nagar, most residents also expressed distrust about the vaccines. “It is just saline water,” said one individual. Others said the government was supplying wrong or fake vaccines to the healthcare centres. Sonal Kapoor Singh of Protsahan said, “This hesitancy was higher among men than women. Some people told us they did not know where and how to get vaccinated. Others revealed that they did not have an Aadhaar card, which is required while registering for the jab.” Gauri Devi, 42, a domestic help in Vikaspuri, is among the few who have opted for vaccination. “I have taken both doses because my employer requested me to get it done,” Devi disclosed. “But my husband has been scared of the vaccination, especially after he saw me having a slight fever and bodyache after the shots. I explained to him that this meant the vaccine was working, but he was not ready to listen.” The social conditions in the localities, mostly inhabited by daily-wage workers, also played a part in engendering a pessimistic view of vaccines. As some respondents pointed out, they shared community toilets, so it was unlikely that the vaccine could protect them against Covid. The survey reported, “Some are of the belief that pregnant women or breastfeeding women should not get vaccinated as they might die. One of the old women from the community stated that a pregnant woman died in their neighbourhood after getting the first dose of the vaccine.” Alongside the reluctance to get vaccinated, there was also an unwillingness to get tested for Covid. Though almost every household reported family members with cough and fever, very few had opted to get tested, mostly because they feared that testing positive would deprive them of work and income. In any case, with several people living in cramped rented spaces, isolation or social distancing was well near impossible. In order to address this hesitancy, Protsahan will transform its four child protection centres into vaccination awareness support hubs by May 20 and reach out to 6-8 lakh individuals. “We have partnered with Noora Health and independent digital influencer artists to start our work without delay,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/loss-of-days-work-fear-of-impotency-why-men-in-slums-are-hesitant-to-take-the-c-jab/articleshow/82468779.cms||Shradha Chettri

On Thursday afternoon, Avala was posted at one of the watch towers at Nagpur airport, where the air ambulance VT-JIL heading from Durgapur to Mumbai had landed for refuelling. As the plane took off, Avala saw what appeared to be a tyre falling off from the rear, at a distance of 400 metres from his post. He quickly called up his bosses at the control room. This led to quick action on the ground, ensuring safe landing of the turboprop aircraft with five onboard at Mumbai. The Beechcraft King Air C 90 belonging to Jet Serve Aviation was travelling from Durgapur to Mumbai, said airport and AAI sources. “My duty is to keep a watch on the entire area, which includes the runway and a sizeable area in the vicinity. My eyes were turned towards the aircraft. It had just taken off when I saw the wheel had fallen off,” says Avala, who is from Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh, and had joined the CISF in 1990. “The only thought that came to my mind was I must save the lives of those onboard. I quickly called up the control room and reported to Security Operational Control Centre.” CISF director general S K Jaiswal has announced a cash reward of Rs 10,000, the top force honour of a DG commendation disc and certificate for Avala, said a CISF statement. — Shishir Arya||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-thought-of-saving-lives-cisf-cop-who-saw-wheel-fall/articleshow/82467420.cms||Shishir Arya

She was received by Kanpur cops at Delhi airport and was later taken to a police station in Noida, where her statement was recorded. Police commissioner, Kanpur, Asim Kumar Arun, had approached the authorities in the ministry of external affairs, who pursued the matter with the Indian embassy in Muscat. He also wrote to the Indian embassy in Muscat and the police was in constant touch with the officials in Oman. DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil said, “The woman’s daughter had approached the Kanpur police and pleaded with senior officials to rescue her mother from human traffickers. We got in touch with our counterparts in Jalandhar who contacted the Indian embassy in Muscat. The Indian embassy approached the authorities in Oman and got the woman rescued. She was in captivity for over a year.” “She reached Sharjah on Thursday evening and landed at the Delhi airport on Friday. After completing legal formalities, we will further take the woman to her native place in Jalandhar,” he added. The DCP said the police have collected vital clues about three more women hailing from Unnao (Uttar Pradesh), Goa and Sangrur in Punjab, who have been held captive by a woman in Oman. “We have informed the authorities and are hopeful that they will also be rescued soon,” he added. Kanpur police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun thanked the ministry of foreign affairs for taking up the case on priority and helping the woman. Earlier in April, Kanpur police had arrested two members of a human trafficking gang, Atiqur and Muzammil, following a complaint by an Unnao resident. The complainant alleged that the accused promised a well-paid job for his 40-year-old wife in Oman. However, she landed in the house of a ‘kafeel’ (guarantor), who forced her to do household work for menial salary. The arrested persons confessed that they were part of a well-organised international human trafficking racket and sent 19 people, especially women, to foreign countries against hefty commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-woman-rescued-from-oman-with-kanpur-cops-help/articleshow/82468859.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Chandigarh||'Be strict during lockdown protests', says Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: With Covid cases rising rapidly, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday authorised deputy commissioners to impose any new and harsher restrictions, as needed, within their respective districts, but made it clear that no dilution of existing curbs would be allowed, except for opening non-essential shops and private offices on rotation. He also directed the DGP to strictly enforce weekend lockdown in the state and deal stringently with any violations in view of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)’s anti-lockdown agitation on Saturday. Asserting that the morcha, an amalgamation of 32 farm unions, could not “dictate terms” to the state government, Amarinder warned of strict prosecution in case of violation of any restrictions. He said if any shops were opened in violation of the restrictions, owners would be prosecuted. Chairing a high-level Covid review meeting, Amarinder authorised DCs to take any decision on opening non-essential shops or private officers on rotation, after taking the local MLAs and other stakeholders into confidence. However, DCs cannot impose any restrictions on inter-district movement, he said, underlining the need to allow free flow of people and goods on the highway network of the state. The new curbs, if any, and the opening of shops on rotation will come into effect from Monday, he said. Responding to DGP Dinkar Gupta’s remarks that districts wanted to adopt different models for phased opening of shops, Amarinder said the decision on working out the local systems rested with the DCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-to-top-cop-be-strict-during-lockdown-protests/articleshow/82468860.cms||---

The talks at Raj Bhavan continued for an hour. The same team, led by MHA additional secretary Govind Mohan, had met the state chief secretary, home secretary and DGP at the secretariat on Thursday, soon after it reached Bengal. The members had also visited Satgachhia and Nodakhali in South 24 Parganas, and spoken to local residents to understand ground realities and assess damage. The MHA team landed in Bengal three days after a letter to the state government on May 3, enquiring about the law and order situation, allegedly failed to elicit response. The ministry also sought a report from the Bengal governor on May 6. Dhankhar tweeted that he was waiting for a report sought on May 4 from the state home secretary on “post-poll violence and vandalism”. Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla sent a reminder to chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay on May 5, referring to the MHA’s May 3 letter, urging that the report be immediately submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-member-mha-team-calls-on-dhankhar-over-post-poll-violence/articleshow/82468863.cms||---
---||Delhi||Allow vaccination for above 18 at 20 of our centres: EDMC to CM||New Delhi: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has sent another proposal to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for allowing vaccination for people above 18 years at its 20 centres from the next week. The list includes four new sites in North East district, seven in East district and nine in Shahdara district where ample space is available to create more jab stations. “Starting a vaccination facility for 18+ will only help people to get maximum benefits and get their family members inoculated easily. A lot of beneficiaries from nearby areas are daily enquiring with our staff about these facilities,” said mayor Nirmal Jain. Officials claimed that the details were shared with the three district magistrates during a meeting last week. “We proposed the new sites to the district magistrates on April 26 but there was no confirmation from the other side. Later we got to know that none of our proposed sites was approved and rather our four centres was taken out of the renewed list issued last week,” the letter stated. Till last week, EDMC was doing vaccination at 20 centres with 25 stations and vaccinated 1.03 lakh beneficiaries above 45 years. Jain said the chief minister had been informed that all arrangements at new sites were in place, including doctors, paramedical staff and 60 auxiliary nurse midwives. “We are keen to help the government to cover all beneficiaries. The move will help in minimising rush at existing centres.” Vaccination at some of these centres for 45+ people is seeing a limited turnout, Jain said. Some of the proposed sites are maternity homes at Yamuna Vihar, Sonia Vihar, Khichripur and Vishwakarma Park, Shahdara Polyclinic, Ayush Panchakarma centres near Swami Dayanand Hospital and Geeta Colony, and school health scheme centres at Mansarovar Park and Jhilmil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allow-vaccination-for-above-18-at-20-of-our-centres-edmc-to-cm/articleshow/82468865.cms||Vibha Sharma

As of now, 23,502 undertrials and prisoners are lodged in 25 jails in Punjab. After visiting Faridkot jail on Friday to take stock of preparations to deal with Covid-19, Punjab jails minister said that since the start of Covid in March 2020, 60,000 tests have been conducted on inmates in over 13 months and 3,294 have tested positive so far. Presently, 650 inmates are Covid positive and lodged under strict protocols at designated places. In all, 5,813 inmates above the age of 45 years have been vaccinated.

---||Kolkata||Trinamool Congress: Central team’s visit pointless, this is interference||KOLKATA: Both Trinamool Congress and BJP have expressed unhappiness over the itinerary of the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) team that is now in Bengal to probe incidents of post-poll violence. The four-member team, led by an additional secretary, visited multiple villages and neighbourhoods in Satgachhia and Nodakhali of South 24 Parganas over several hours on Friday. Central force officials, along with a large contingent of local police, accompanied them. Criticising the MHA team’s visit, Trinamool MP and senior leader Sougata Roy said: “This MHA team is bogus. It has no meaning. Only a few days back, new ministry has taken over. The chief minister has effected changes in the police administration. She has given a call to everybody to bring peace. During this time, the coming of the central team is unwarranted.” Roy added that since police and law and order were state subjects, the central team could have at least spoken to the state government before undertaking the tour. “This is pure jumping the gun and interference in state subjects. I don’t know if this would serve any purpose but I am strongly critical of this interference by the Centre,” the leader said. Saokat Molla, two-time MLA from Canning East, said he personally inquired about “sporadic instances of trouble” in Satgachhia and Nodakhali but didn’t find anything “alarming”. “Nothing major has happened in Satgachhia and Nodakhali. There have been some sporadic instances of trouble but they are not of the stature that demands a central team of officers to visit. I believe these visits are intended to create disturbance in the state,” Molla said. He added the BJP leadership was using the central machinery as a desperate step to regain lost ground before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “They are not willing to accept people’s verdict. I strongly condemn this central team’s visit,” Molla said. BJP leader Abhijit Das, who was earlier in charge of the district, said the team should have visited areas such as Bishnupur and Diamond Harbour, where he alleged there was severe arson and rioting. But, he added, due to lack of coordination, the team went to Satgachhia, Falta and Nodakhali. “The central team should have been properly guided by party leaders as many party workers had suffered in a big way. They have been attacked and their property damaged and looted,” he said. Even former Satgachhia MLA Sonali Guha, who shifted allegiance to BJP, said there was no party leader present when the central team visited Satgachhia. “They need to be properly briefed about the ongoing violence, but there was lack of coordination,” she said. Sufal Ghatua, a district leader of BJP, said the central team went “on its own” and so could not be guided by BJP leaders. The team went to Falta and Satgachhia, where violence took place on Thursday, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-central-teams-visit-pointless-this-is-interference/articleshow/82468876.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: To pacify Marathas, state scraps promotions quota||Mumbai: Two days after the Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota, the state government sought to assuage the community by reversing an order which had kept 33% government vacant posts for promotions from the backward classes. The posts will now be filled on the basis of seniority. The state’s general administration department had issued an order in April 20, 2021 keeping 33% posts vacant for promotions from backward class communities such as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribe (VJNT) and Special Backward Classes. The remaining 67% posts had to be filled on the basis of seniority. On Friday, the state cancelled the April 2021 order. It now says that all 100% posts will be filled on the basis of seniority, without any reservation. Sources said that it’s a political decision to tone down the anger of the Maratha community which blames the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for the SC decision scrapping the Maratha quota legislation. Congress leader and energy minister Nitin Raut tried hard to convince the cabinet to keep the 33% quota vacant for the ‘reservation in promotion’ posts, subject to SC order. When asked whether the decision to scrap the 33% quota is politically motivated and connected to the Maratha quota, he said, “The possibility cannot be ruled out. I have decided to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and our leader Balasaheb Thorat to discuss this issue.” Subhash Gangurde of the Maharashtra Rajya Madhyavarti Karmachari Mahasangh said that this is injustice to the backward classes. “Only relief is that the state will decide not to demote those who already got promotion,” said Gangurde. There are over 30,000 employees in the state, whose promotions have been put on hold by the state following the Bombay HC verdict of August 2017 that struck down state government resolution (GR) granting reservation quotas to government employees at the promotion stage. A 2004 GR provided 33% reservation in promotions for certain communities for officials at the under-secretary, deputy secretary and secretary levels in various state departments as well as in bodies like the BMC and BEST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-pacify-marathas-state-scraps-promotions-quota/articleshow/82468879.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fresh claimant for Kanjurmarg Metro depot plot||Mumbai: The 1,600-acre Kanjurmarg plot, a portion of it sought by the state government for the Metro car shed, has a new claimant. On Friday, one Rajesh Khat-adia of JSM Real issued a public notice making a claim over the entire sprawl, through Ramas-ubbu Chandrasekaran. People in the know of the pending litig-ation over this plot said they haven’t heard their names before. The Kanjurmarg Metro depot plot is already mired in controversy with the Centre and state government both claiming ownership over it. But they are not the only ones. Large parts of the over 1,600 acres have also been claimed by the erstwhile Khot Sir Yusuf, his assignee Bafna and the Garodias, who is a salt pan lessee, and a host of other people. Of the 1,600 acres, the state has sought roughly 100 acres for the Metro depot. However, the Union government has objected to the state attempting to take away this land. The Bombay high court has stayed the state’s claim over this land. Local activists told TOI that a few months ago, a message had gone viral on social media stating that free houses will be given to all those encroaching on this plot. This resulted in a stampede of slumdwellers setting up huts on the plot overnight. “Today’s notice shows that the long list of claimants over this plot has just got longer,” said activist Zoru Bhathena. Last year, the Garodias had moved the HC staking claim over the land. TOI has earlier reported that the Garodias had already been paid Rs 471 crore by Shapoorji Pallonji & Company Ltd as part of a development agreement. Documents accessed by TOI show the deal for the 500-acre sprawl in Kanjurmarg and Bhandup—which the Garodias say they control—is worth Rs 521 crore. The salt commissionerate, that comes under the central government, challenged the family’s claim. The HC had said the Centre and its lessee, Mahesh Garodia, had made out a “very strong case” to stay the collector’s order to transfer the 102 acres of Kanjurmarg land to MMRDA for a Metro car shed. A state-appointed committee had said the government will save Rs 1,580 crore against land and construction costs, if an integrated Metro depot at Kanjurmarg is set up. The panel’s report said that while the Aarey plot can accommodate only 30 rakes, the Kanjurmarg one is large enough to hold 55.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fresh-claimant-for-kanjurmarg-metro-depot-plot/articleshow/82468892.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

On Friday, the 21-year-old’s mother Basanti and her elder son Gobinda met Cooch Behar Trinamool president Partha Pratim Roy at his home in Cooch Behar town and accepted the job of a home guard for a family member.  The job offer was announced by Mamata Banerjee after she took charge as chief minister for the third time. Gobinda, a pramukh of BJP’s Shakti Kendra, will take the job. Ananda too was a BJP activist. Initially, the Barman family had refused to take any help from the state government and had rejected a Rs 5 lakh cheque a day after Ananda was killed. Along with Gobinda, the next of kin of four others killed in CAPF firing on poll day at Jorpatki village too will get jobs. The affected families have already received Rs 5 lakh compensation each. They too met Roy at his home on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sitalkuchi-death-anandas-family-accepts-govt-job-offer/articleshow/82468910.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

The party would also stay away from the assembly speaker’s election on Saturday. “We are not going to attend the assembly session called to elect speaker of the House tomorrow. This is not for Saturday only. We won’t take part in assembly sessions till violence continues unabated in the state,” Ghosh said after meeting BJP legislators in the Bengal assembly on Friday. Ghosh asked party MLAs to return to their constituencies and stay with party workers and victims’ families. “Our party workers are being killed. Many have been rendered homeless. They can’t come back home. We have to put an end to this terror. Party leaders should provide them support in this hour of crisis,” he said. On Friday, a Malda village woke up to a macabre incident when they found bodies of two students hanging from a tree in Mothabari assembly constituency. The feet of one touched the ground, as was the case with Hemtabad MLA Debendra Nath Roy. Minor injuries were also found on both bodies. Malda BJP leaders claimed the two students were active supporters though police didn’t see a “political” hand. BJP Bengal co-minder Amit Malviya used his Twitter handle to condemn the deaths of Manoj Mandal (18) and Chaitanya Mandal (17). “Every political murder according to WB police is either a suicide or fake. Only in Bengal, people commit suicide by hanging themselves while their legs are folded and feet touching the ground,” Malviya wrote. Manoj, a labourer’s son from Kalachandtola village in Mothabari, had hogged limelight last year for his brilliant performance in higher secondary examination. He had made it to the top 20 on the HS merit list with 491 score. His close friend Chaitanya, of the same village, too was a good student. On Friday morning, the boys were found hanging from a tree with the same rope around their necks. Local panchayat member Basudeb Mandal alleged the two were killed and strung from the tree. Malda SP Alok Rajoria said neither family had named anyone as responsible for the deaths. “We have received no complaint from the families against anybody who could have murdered them. We have traced the shop owner from whom the rope was bought by one of the victims,” the SP said. Malda Police, which took away the bodies for autopsy, tracked social media posts by one of the boys. “The posts suggest he had been going through trouble,” the officer added. Some of Manoj’s neighbours said the two boys had got hooked to cellphones when their college was closed amid Covid pandemic. They added that the duo used to play online games and were chided by family members after the two lost substantial money. BJP Malda president Gobinda Mandal, however, didn’t buy this version. Claiming the two students were active BJP supporters, he said: “I won’t jump to conclusions. But police should investigate properly before labelling it suicide. This is serious when the state has been witnessing large scale post-poll violence.” Trinamool MLA Sabina Yeasmin said: “BJP should refrain from doing dirty politics with the dead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-mlas-will-skip-assembly-sessions-till-violence-lasts-dilip/articleshow/82468957.cms||Rohit Khanna

It already has a distribution tie-up with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for Sputnik V. “Sputnik Light too will be distributed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in India but after the necessary approvals,” a source told TOI. Dr Reddy’s officials refused to comment on the development as the company is in the silent period ahead of its quarterly financial results announcement next week. The single-shot Sputnik Light could prove to be a major booster for India’s vaccination drive, which has run into a major shortage of vaccine for even the second dose, as it could cut down on logistical challenges, said experts. Sputnik Light has shown an 79.4% efficacy after 28 days of administration, as against the 92% efficacy demonstrated by the two-dose Sputnik, and will be priced below $10 per dose, RDIF had said. Meanwhile, the 1.5 lakh doses of the Sputnik V first dose that arrived in Hyderabad on May 1 are undergoing testing at the Central Drugs Laboratory at Kasauli after which they are expected to be ready for rollout around mid-May. Dr Reddy’s is using the first shipment to test out the cold chain, both in the rural as well as urban settings, to ensure that the supply chain is in place. The company is yet to announce the pricing for Sputnik V, which has a global uniform price of $10 per dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-may-distribute-sputnik-light-too/articleshow/82469036.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Foreign aid to set up Covid field hospitals in Birbhum, Purulia||KOLKATA: The cresting second wave of Covid-19 has underlined the need to revamp healthcare infrastructure in rural Bengal and prompted two nonprofits — Liver Foundation West Bengal (LFWB) and Covid Care Network (CCN) — to set up field hospitals with donations from foreign institutes like John Hopkins University, US. Two such facilities are in the pipeline at Birbhum’s Nagari and Labhpur while two more are coming up in Purulia. Birbhum currently has 4,670 active Covid cases with 877 fresh ones being reported on Friday. Purula reported 296 fresh cases, taking its total to 3,112. While the numbers are far less compared to Kolkata and North 24 Parganas, what is alarming is the fact that these districts had reported daily cases in only double digits during the first wave. Experts also pointed to fewer tests in the rural belt, insinuating that the actual number of cases might be higher than on official record. “Villages are in the grip of this second Covid wave, but people are reaching district hospitals late. Infections become severe by then, reducing chances of effective treatment. The field hospitals are meant to administer initial care to Covid patients in villages,” said Dr Abhjit Chowdhury, a mentor to CCN who is also associated with LFWB. Each field hospital is expected to have 25 beds, oxygen support and telemedicine facilities. A designated team of doctors and nurses, along with informal healthcare providers who have attended government training, will run the show. Patients diagnosed with severe infection and in need for better care will be referred to district hospitals. “The upcoming projects are being funded by donations from institutes and organisations like John Hopkins University and Heal India. As more donations pour in, we will set up field hospitals in other districts too. This is a war-like situation and we cannot leave villagers to fend for themselves against the pandemic,” Dr Chowdhury added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/foreign-aid-to-set-up-covid-field-hospitals-in-birbhum-purulia/articleshow/82469045.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Against this demand, we received only 577MT on Thursday, which is just 59% of the total demand,” Chadha said on Friday while releasing the oxygen bulletin. “After the high court’s and the Supreme Court’s rebuke on May 5, the central government gave 730MT, but it was 153MT less the next day.” He added that plans to increase the number of beds would be possible only with a regular supply of oxygen. The MLA said the courts had constantly mentioned that just by supplying 730MT medical liquid oxygen on one day, the Centre couldn’t fulfil its responsibilities. “The supply of oxygen is supposed to be regular on a daily basis. We cannot be transferring sufficient oxygen and giving it to our patients on one day because of increased supply, and completely deprive them on another day because the Centre decreased our supply. I would like to reiterate that this demand of ours isn’t one-time or temporary, but for a quantity that we need on a daily basis,” he added. According to Chadha, the five parameters of oxygen supply that the Centre must stick to are “regularity, continuous, systematic, through declared sources, and steadiness”. He said increasing the number of oxygen-equipped beds from the current 21,000 to up to 40,000-45,000 would need regular and uninterrupted supply of oxygen. On Thursday, Delhi government received SOS calls only from nine hospitals, a significant drop from 50-60 calls per day a few days ago. “To these nine SOS calls, we delivered 5.10MT oxygen. Approximately 909 beds were on oxygen support in these nine hospitals,” Chadha added. On SOS calls from hospitals, the MLA said hospitals usually called us in an emergency situation, stating that they had oxygen left for just 1-1.5 hours, and something must be done immediately. “We have been creating SOS reserves that have oxygen in sufficient amount. These reserves will be stocked in various places in Delhi, from where oxygen will be supplied to hospitals in an emergency, if the regular supply can’t be initiated for them,” the MLA said. Steps to tackle oxygen crisis helping hospitals: Govt Delhi government issued a separate statement on Friday claiming several steps taken by it to handle the oxygen crisis had brought relief to hospitals. According to it, government officials received an SOS call from Indian Spinal Hospital at 2.30pm on Thursday and 1MT oxygen was provided to it immediately from the oxygen response point created by Delhi government. “Another SOS call was received from Lok Nayak Hospital at 12 noon. The hospital’s oxygen demand was met without delay and 2 metric tonnes of oxygen was made available to it,” it stated. Similarly, Irene Hospital in Kalkaji asked for oxygen around 4.30pm and three cylinders were sent. Kukreja Hospital, which called at 10.05am, also got three cylinders from the Rajghat depot, the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-o2-supply-cut-again-41-short-of-demand-says-chadha/articleshow/82469044.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||250 beds at Gurdwara Rakabganj Sahib may be open by tomorrow||New Delhi: A 250-bedded Covid-19 facility set up at Gurdwara Rakabganj Sahib is likely to become operational on Sunday, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) said on Friday. The facility was inspected by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain earlier this week and will be receiving healthcare workers from Delhi government. The facility will also be linked to a hospital for further care if the condition of a patient deteriorates. DSGMC, however, said it is looking to further scale up the number of beds, with 200 more beds likely in the coming days. “The facility was inspected by Jain, who was impressed by the arrangements. The government has asked us to increase the number of beds to around 450 and we are exploring how to do so. Some beds may be added here, while other gurdwara halls may also be made operational,” said DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa. Sirsa told TOI that by next week, another 100-bed Covid-19 facility will become operational at Gurdwara Damdama Sahib, in addition to the 200 new beds to be added. The gurdwara is already providing ‘oxygen langar’ sewa as well. Sirsa said the 100 beds planned were in works for some time, with Gurdwara Bala Sahib also being looked at as an option to become a Covid-19 facility. “Even before the request to arrange for 450 beds, we were already working on creating 100 beds at Damdama Sahib. We have the existing infrastructure and the kidney facility will be shifted to the first floor. Other gurdwaras and halls are also being considered,” said Sirsa. “We will limit the facilities to a few gurdwaras as it will be easier to manage and all the infrastructure can be put at one place.” Gurdwaras in Delhi, including Rakabganj Sahib, Bangla Sahib and Sisganj Sahib, have been operating their kitchens as per normal, preparing ‘langar’ that is distributed each day to the hungry across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/250-beds-at-gurdwara-rakabganj-sahib-may-be-open-by-tomorrow/articleshow/82469095.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Delhi||Offline, off track: No hashtag help for these hapless people||New Delhi: Social media has frequently proved to be a blessing during crises. But what about those who have no access to the online platforms but are in dire need—need a Covid hospital bed or oxygen support or have lost their employment and are hunting for jobs? “I lost my grandmother to Covid-19 a few days ago and it was only later that I learnt that many people got help through Twitter. Had I tweeted my plight, who knows my grandmother would have been alive today!” said Hari, a car cleaner in Paschim Vihar. Disheartened by his helplessness during his grandmother’s illness, Hari is planning to return home to his village in Guwahati, Assam. Neelam has a similar story. “I came to Delhi from Meerut hoping that my relative would be able to avail of better treatment here,” said the 28-year-old. “Now, I only wish we had stayed back. We aren’t getting a hospital bed anywhere and I have used up most of the money that I had brought with me.” When asked if she had tried getting help on social media, Neelam said, “I am an illiterate woman. I don’t even have a basic phone. I am using my relative’s phone in Delhi and don’t know anything about Twitter and Facebook.” Perhaps Nilabh Kumari, 54, could have got leads to domestic work had she been knowledgeable about social media. She has been fighting big battles for a year. She lost her husband in an accident last year which left her as the sole breadwinner for her family of six. Last week, she lost her job. “I was working as a household help in Rajouri Garden, but both the families I worked for had members testing positive for Covid and asked me not to come then onwards,” said Kumari resignedly. “In the span of a week, I lost jobs at both these houses. Earlier, my husband and I collectively earned up to Rs 9,000, but after his death, working double the hours, I was making Rs 5,000. One of my daughters has tuberculosis.” Ranjana too was let go at a beauty parlour in east Delhi’s Preet Vihar. “I used to do the cleaning and mopping at the salon, but last month, when the Covid cases started to rise, the owner asked me to leave, giving me a month’s salary as compensation. With the lockdown in operation, who will employ me?” she sobbed. Carpenter Santosh is also in dire straits, having been prohibited from visiting the homes where he had hitherto been working. “Everyone has asked me not to come to their homes, and I don’t get calls for assignments,” he shook his head in dismay. “It’s like I am reliving the days of last year, only that things are actually worse this time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/offline-off-track-no-hashtag-help-for-these-hapless-people/articleshow/82469120.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Delhi||AAP MLA gets high court notice over allegation of hoarding oxygen cylinders||New Delhi: Delhi High Court issued a notice to AAP cabinet minister Imran Hussain on Friday over allegations that he was hoarding oxygen cylinders and asked him to respond and appear in court on Monday. The court directed, “Let a notice be issued to Imran Hussain, MLA, AAP Delhi. Let notice be served on Imran Hussain telephonically, through WhatsApp. His email be provided to the court master. We direct Imran Hussain to file a reply and remain present,” the court directed. Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also issued a notice to the Delhi government, with senior advocate Rahul Mehra assuring the court that if there was any truth in the allegations about the minister or any other person involved in similar acts, action would be taken. The petitioner’s advocate, Amit Tiwari, described the allegations as being “broad in nature”. He referred to a Facebook post and photos to indicate that Hussain had allegedly distributed cylinders in his constituency. The court, however, asked if Hussain was procuring the cylinders from outside Delhi. There would be no need for an enquiry if Hussain was not “eating away at the allocated quantity of oxygen” meant for hospitals and nursing homes in the city, the court said. “Even gurdwaras are providing oxygen,” noted the bench. Mehra said that if there was any veracity to the allegations, the “strictest possible action” would be taken, irrespective of the person’s identity. “The party doesn’t matter, names don’t matter. There will be maximum possible punishment,” Mehra said, to which the bench responded, “There will be contempt action by us. Let’s be very clear.” The court had earlier asked the Delhi government to appeal to the public to surrender oxygen cylinders if not needed and not hoard them. “There has to be a quid pro quo… For this purpose, roping in RWAs is a good idea. If this is done at their level, there is an understanding that if you are surrendering a cylinder, you’ll be given one as and when required,” the bench said Mehra had also informed the bench that oxygen supply to Delhi had improved pursuant to court orders and if the capital continued to receive the allocated quantity of the gas, the state government would be able properly plan the distribution to all the hospitals and even individuals quarantining at home. “We need to see how to bring all hospitals in the fold, also the people in home quarantine,” Mehra said. Keeping in mind the economically weaker sections, the bench suggested the Delhi government consider supplying such families with oximeters, some basic medication and perhaps a steam inhaler. Reusable items such as the oximeter and steam inhaler could be returned after recovery, the bench suggested. The court said, “These things could be provided to the patients such as people below poverty line or those drawing rations through the public distribution system — that strata of society.” But the bench also wanted the state government to consider including senior citizens in such a scheme, including those who lived alone or were disabled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-mla-gets-high-court-notice-over-allegation-of-hoarding-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82469161.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Chandigarh||Punjab readies for jabs to 18-45 group||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday asked officials concerned to prepare for vaccination of priority groups in the 18 to 45 year category in government hospitals from Monday, as the state was expecting 1 lakh doses to arrive from the Serum Institute of India (SII) over the weekend. Vaccination of priority groups identified by the state government for Phase III should start as soon as the doses arrive, Amarinder said. The state government has identified 18-45 age group construction workers, teachers, government employees and those with co-morbidities as high-risk individuals for priority vaccination. The chief minister, who was chairing a virtual Covid review meeting, directed all government employees, except those with medical problems, to get vaccinated. While the labour department will coordinate vaccination of construction workers and their families, to be funded by BOCWWB, DCs have been asked to coordinate vaccination of government employees. Vaccination of co-morbid categories will also be planned by DCs, with only advance registration and slotting of vaccination sites to be allowed. The state government had ordered 30 lakh vaccine doses from SII for the Phase III vaccination and the Government of India has now allocated 3.30 lakh against this order to Punjab for this month. Meanwhile, the state government will explore utilisation of some components of the state’s World Bank loan for purchase of 10,000 Oxygen concentrators, along with tankers and O2 plants and vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-readies-for-covid-jabs-to-18-45-group-from-monday/articleshow/82469177.cms||---

However, the government must also ensure that bureaucratic hurdles are removed,” chairman of the National Council for MSME of Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Manguirish Pai Raiker, said. Reacting to the slew of measures announced by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, Raiker said the Centre must complement the RBI’s efforts by stepping in and tweaking compliance and bureaucratic norms to make government procedures hassle-free. “Very good incentive for banks to promote lending to the MSME sector,” said Raiker while reacting to the decisions taken by RBI. “Now the government should step in to stem the rot caused by the second wave of this pandemic. It is time for the government to stand by entrepreneurs, support, supplement and promote them instead of creating bureaucratic hurdles.” Raiker said many entrepreneurs who used to run small and micro enterprises have lost their lives, leaving the future of these units in jeopardy. “The takeover should be smooth, banks and government procedures should be tweaked accordingly and quickly,” he said. Das announced several policy steps to offset the economic impact of the second Covid-19 wave on MSMEs and small businesses. Das said small businesses and MSMEs having aggregate exposure of up to Rs 25 crore, and who have not availed restructuring under any of the earlier restructuring frameworks (including under the Resolution Framework 1.0 dated August 6, 2020), and who were classified as ‘standard’ as on March 31, 2021, will be eligible to be considered under Resolution Framework 2.0. “Our demand is for continuation of the restructuring process which ended on March 31and also that SME I units be included to benefit from it,” Raiker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-must-do-more-to-lift-stress-on-msmes/articleshow/82469178.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MMRDA tweaks Malad jumbo centre’s tender condition after bid rigging claims||Mumbai: The MMRDA on Thursday relaxed tender conditions for the construction of the jumbo Covid centre at Malad following claims of bid rigging and cartelization by the BJP. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is setting up a 2,000-bed Covid care facility, including ICU beds, in Malad (W). After BJP corporator Vinod Mishra complained to MMRDA chief R A Rajeev about the clause for bidders to have built at least one Covid hospital measuring a minimum 6,700 sqm in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in last one year, the latter directed that it be tweaked to ensure fair competition.“It’s hard to understand how the MMDRA had come to the magic figure of 6,700 sq m and that too inside MMR. After our intervention, the MMDRA has removed the condition and now contractors who have built centres even outside MMR can also participate in the bidding process,” Mishra said. Clarifying that it was not a “restrictive” condition, Rajeev told TOI: “We had put the clause so that we get bidders whose quality of work could be verified. We have now relaxed the condition after some complaints...”Mishra said similar restrictive conditions were placed by the BMC in the tender floated for Mahalaxmi jumbo Covid centre—bidders should have built at least one jumbo centre or similar facility in Maharashtra. In his letter to urban development minister Eknath Shinde, Mishra claimed that “a jumbo Covid centre mafia in Mumbai is promoting rigging of tenders and creating a new cartel of contractors. To prevent this...such restrictive tender conditions must be deleted”. Additional municipal commissioner (City) Sanjeev Jaiswal said he will examine the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mmrda-tweaks-malad-jumbo-centres-tender-condition-after-bid-rigging-claims/articleshow/82469191.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

This hit the frequency of services and led to long queues at bus stops. Commuters alleged that BEST failed to run the wet lease buses till Friday evening. “The BEST-owned buses are plying but they are not able to cater to the office rush. We have to wait for nearly half an hour to get a bus,” said a commuter from Dadar, Prakash Mane. Another passenger said that the new government directive of not allowing standees and having only 50% occupancy required more deployment of buses. BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade, claimed that there was “adequate deployment of BEST-owned buses”. Varade said that the protest was held by drivers of the wet-leased buses. “This issue needs to be resolved by private agencies,” he stated.

Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said a special team was set up to locate the company and trace its owner. “The team traced the accused and found that Bundwal had been running the ambulance service in the name of Cardiacare Ambulance Pvt Ltd. He was arrested and booked for cheating,” Goel said. It was further revealed that Bundwal had been running this profiteering racket for the past one month and had cheated numerous people. “We found out that the accused himself is an MBBS doctor and has been running the ambulance business for the past two years,” the DCP said. It was also found that one of his victims, from DLF Gurgaon, had recently hired an ambulance from his company to carry a patient from Gurgaon to Ludhiana and was billed Rs 1.2 lakh, she added.

However, the former MLA’s mobile phone was still in switched-off mode on Friday and he has not made a public appearance so far. “My husband is not missing and is in Hyderabad with our family. He is busy with personal work. He has not gone to Maharashtra as claimed in a section of the media. I did not try for the CM’s appointment on Thursday or met any minister to help us. Madhu will come out soon,” Shailaja told TOI on Friday evening. Reports surfaced that Madhu had gone missing soon after former minister Eatala Rajender’s land issue surfaced. Madhu is a close aide of Eatala. Party sources said the former MLA is trying to meet chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao as TRS working president KT Rama Rao was undergoing treatment for Covid-19, but all his efforts have gone in vain. His wife met minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy and spoke to Karimnagar district ministers — Gangula Kamalakar and Koppula Eshwar — to emphasis that her husband would respect the party’s decision on Eatala. There were allegations on Madhu’s role in advocate P Vaman Rao and his lawyer wife murder near Manthani a few months ago. Madhu, however, denied the allegations against him and police arrested some of the accused, including his nephew Bittu Srinu, in the murder case. On the other hand, some of Madhu’s followers, including ZPTC and MPTC members, on Friday claimed that he had gone to Maharashtra on personal work and would be back soon. They said at a press conference in Manthani that Madhu used to move closely with Eatala as the latter belongs to erstwhile Karimnagar district (Manthani was part of erstwhile Karimnagar district before it came under Peddapalli district). Meanwhile, Manthani TRS leaders said Madhu’s phone number continues to be switched off and claimed that he had left without gunmen. However, family members said the gunmen were very much with Madhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/putta-madhu-in-hyd-on-personal-work-says-wife/articleshow/82469246.cms||Koride Mahesh

The former minister is believed to have told them that despite his run-in with chief minister Amarinder Singh, he will remain with the party and continue to raise the sacrilege issue. Sources said that despite Amarinder’s attempts to quell the discontent in the Punjab Congress by holding meetings with MLAs and also bringing up the sacrilege issue at the cabinet meeting, a group of legislators, including two cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi, has got in touch with Sidhu. The MLAs have also been holding discussions and met on Wednesday. “More than rallying behind Sidhu, the MLAs are worried about the political implications of the negative perception of the Congress government over the sacrilege issue. They want to go into a huddle to take the issue forward and Sidhu can definitely act as a cohesive force as he has already been highlighting the delay in justice in the case. Sidhu did not approach the MLAs, it is the other way around. The worry over the sacrilege issue has made the leaders sink their differences,” said an MLA. The MLAs have also been trying to clarify that the churning is specific to the issue and not to open a front against the chief minister. “The attempt is not to target the party or the chief minister. The idea is to find a way to fulfil the promise of bringing the culprits of the sacrilege cases to book at the earliest,” said another MLA, who was unable to attend the meeting. There has been a churning in the Punjab Congress ever since the probe report on Kotkapura firing case was rejected. The MLAs had also conveyed their anxiety over the negative public perception of not doing enough on the issue to the chief minister in a series of meetings. They pointed out that it could dent their poll prospects in the next assembly polls due in 2022. Meanwhile, Capt Amarinder has openly hit out at Sidhu and even said that “the door is closed” for the cricketer-turned-politician. No MLA, apart from Jalandhar (Cantonment) MLA Pargat Singh has openly supported Sidhu so far; they were also subdued in their criticism of Sidhu after Amarinder openly challenged him to contest against him from Patiala in the next assembly elections. “By coming together, the MLAs can take Sidhu’s help in raising the matter with the party high command at some stage,” added a party leader. Sources said the MLAs want that the new SIT to probe the Kotkapura firing case should be constituted without further delay to show some visible action in the case before the elections. So far, there has been an eerie silence in the Congress camp on the sacrilege issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/regrouping-in-punjab-cong-over-sacrilege-mlas-open-channel-with-sidhu/articleshow/82469259.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Hyderabad||Temple land: 5 plot owners move HC||Hyderabad: Land owner Sada Satyanarayana Reddy and four others on Friday approached the Telangana high court and moved a house motion urging the court to accord protection to their land plots in Devarayamjal village in Shamirpet mandal of Medchal Malkajgiri district. They expressed apprehension that the revenue authorities may dispossess them of their land. Justice T Vinod Kumar is likely to take up this house motion on Saturday. The petitioners challenged a GO (No. 1014) issued on May 3 by which the state government constituted an inquiry commission to study the status of the land plots in Devarayamjal. Their counsel K Pratik Reddy said they are praying to the court to set aside the GO in respect of the petitioners who have got nothing to do with the temple land controversy for which the government had constituted the committee of four IAS officers. However, the government said scores of land plots belong to Sri Seetha Rama Swamy temple in the village. “Now, the government is trying to evict us from our land on the ground that our plots belong to the temple,” Pratik contended. “There were orders from the court in the past that we cannot be evicted from the plots because the temple could not prove its title over the land,” the petitioners contended. They said that they all belong to one family and possess 80 acres in the village. They alleged that the inquiry committee surveyed the land without even issuing a notice to them. “We are now apprehending that we may be dispossessed,” they said in their plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/temple-land-5-plot-owners-move-hc/articleshow/82469265.cms||---

DDA has offered 67 of its community centres, apart from open spaces that are provided for weddings and other social functions, to set up of Covid Care Centres and other related facilities by hospitals, government organisations, residents welfare organisations or NGOs. DDA has also offered other vacant plots in its possession for setting up oxygen plants or other such facilities. “Considering the current pandemic situation, there has been a demand for augmenting Covid-related infrastructure in the city,” a DDA official said justifying the move. “Also, due to the pandemic, use of community halls for social purposes is coming down,” he said, adding that DDA is providing these halls following requisition by Delhi Disaster Management Authority and the district authorities. “In view of above, it has been decided to offer DDA community halls on as-is-where-is basis for any Covid-related infrastructure temporarily, for maximum six months, till such time this corona pandemic is prevalent,” he said. As per the policy, available on www.dda.org.in, the community halls can be utilised for any Covid-related infrastructure, including Covid-19 wards, out patient departments, quarantine and isolation facilities, storage facilities for medicine and other hospital supply, oxygen storage and supply, and as dharamshalas or waiting rooms for patients’ relatives. Any other use may be permitted by the DDA vice-chairman if he is satisfied that the facility will be used for mitigating the pandemic, the official said. In case of multiple requests, the government or any local body will be given first priority, followed by any other government agency or public sector undertaking, registered charitable organisations with past track record, charitable hospitals, other hospitals or nursing homes and RWAs. DDA is also considering proposals for allotment of vacant land on temporary licence basis for maximum six months to hospitals or charitable institutions for additional Covid facilities, oxygen plants and other ancillary facilities. The allocations will be made on a first come, first serve basis, subject to the order of priority. The community halls will be provided on nominal charges, DDA said. While the usual daily charge varies between Rs 5 and Rs 10 per square metre as per the location and the category and Rs 3 to Rs 5 per square metre for open spaces, the charges for the Covid fight are Rs 10 to Rs 20 per square metre per month for community halls and Rs 6 to Rs 10 for open space. The security deposit for these halls is 1.5 times of the total booking charges for weddings and other social functions but when used as a Covid facility, it will be five times the charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-offers-its-open-spaces-halls-to-ramp-up-covid-infra/articleshow/82469278.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Water shortage: SC refuses to hear DJB plea||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain Delhi Jal Board’s plea on alleged shortage of water supply from Haryana and Punjab and asked it to raise its grievances before the Upper Yamuna River Board. A bench, headed by Justice Nageswara Rao, passed the order after considering the report submitted by an SC-appointed high-level committee, which examined water levels at the reservoirs in Wazirabad and also its water quality. The committee found that the water level was sufficient for maintaining supplies to Delhi and that the ammonia content was well within the permissible limit. The expert panel report said, “Haryana is releasing more than 1,050 cusecs of water from Munak headworks to Delhi as against the latter’s share of 719 cusecs, thus providing Yamuna water to Delhi as per the Upper Yamuna River Board allocations existing as on date.” The DJB, in its plea before the SC, said, “Delhi is in the throes of a severe water crisis due to lack of sufficient water supply through river Yamuna, which is compounded by increased demand for water from hospitals and households due to the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, as well as the onset of peak summer and several religious festivals such as Ramzan. The water level in Wazirabad pond has fallen to a low of 667.3 feet (as against a level of 674.5 feet when full) as on April 30.” The high-level committee’s report to the SC said, “Water quality of Yamuna river water at Palla site was good to support aquatic life. Ammoniacal nitrogen level was 0.6mg/litre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-shortage-sc-refuses-to-hear-djb-plea/articleshow/82469293.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||MC offers Rs 23cr from Covid cess to admn||Chandigarh: The municipal corporation has asked the Chandigarh administration to take around Rs 23 crore from them for vaccine or other Covid-19 related expenditure if they need finances for such things. The move is quite crucial, especially at a time when UT is purchasing vaccines in significant numbers to give doses to all eligible people and making other Covid-19 related expenditures. Since, Rs 23 crore has been offered from the Covid-19 cess, the civic body authority has been getting this from last year, imposed by the UT administration, and till date, the authority has received around Rs 27 crore in this pool. The amount is being maintained by the account section of the municipal corporation, Chandigarh. “Out of total Rs 27 crore, which we received as Covid-19 cess so far, around Rs 4 crore has been spent over multiple Covid-19 related things since last year. While the remaining amount of Rs 23 crore is still there. Therefore, we have written to the Chandigarh administration that if they need the money, they can take the same any time,” said a senior officer. This Covid-19 cess was imposed on sale and purchase of liquor in the city and soon after imposing this new cess, the authority started getting significant amount of money on monthly basis. “The Covid-19 cess was imposed on every kind of liquor like whisky, beer, wine etc. and the cess was five per cent on liquor. The collected amount from the cess directly comes to the civic body authority,” said sources. Though, the Covid-19 cess was imposed during the earlier stage of the ongoing pandemic last year, the authority has been receiving good amount of money since the beginning. Earlier, the authority was unable to spend even a single penny out of this kitty, as it was asking for permission from the MHA. But, later they got the permission and thus, the civic body authority started spending the money after preparing a list of works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-offers-rs-23cr-from-covid-cess-to-admn/articleshow/82469317.cms||Deepak Yadav

After battling for Covid-19 infection for 14 days at a hospital in Dombivli, Bhoir is back home and has resumed all her daily chores. Bhoir’s family was worried when she was critical in the hospital. Her oxygen saturation levels had dropped till 70 per cent and she had major lung infection. With doctor’s support and a great will power, Bhoir beat Covid. Talking about her grandmother’s Covid battle, Vijay Mahatre, a family member said, “We were worried, but she fought bravely. She barely rested for two days and has resumed with all her daily activities at home. We are really thankful to all the doctors who are working round-the-clock.” The doctor who treated her also claimed that it is like a miracle in the case of Sundrabai. Dr Sheetal Chaugule from AIMS hospital said, “When the patient had come for the treatment she was serious and for 12 days she was kept on high oxygen flow in the ICU ward as she also had lung infection but we are happy that by all our doctor's efforts she finally got cured”.  “She is one of the eldest patients we cured at hour hospital and it debunks the misconception that it is impossible for an elderly person to fight Covid” said Dr Milind Shirodkar who runs the hospital. “All you need is willpower.

The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) issued a circular to this effect on Friday evening. After the central government issued an advisory asking states to utilise the services of resident doctors (who are in their final year) for Covid work till the first-year batch joins, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research recommended postponing the exams. The conduct of NEET-PG has been postponed till August 31 and therefore there is no clarity on when first-year students will be able to join. As resident doctors require at least a 45-day study leave before their exams, it is impossible to relieve them now, when Covid cases across the state are yet to drop significantly.

---||Chandigarh||17-45% non-Haryana Covid patients admitted in 7 districts||Chandigarh: It’s official: many Covid patients holding non-Haryana domicile, largely from Delhi NCR region, are undergoing treatment in hospitals in seven districts of the state. Besides Gurgaon and Faridabad, the remaining five districts where patients from Delhi and other states are rushing for admissions are Jhajjar, Sonipat, Rohtak, Palwal, and Yamunanagar, according to figures calculated by a special team of Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) for facilitating data of beds. Rohtak topped the tally with 45.9% of the total hospitalised patients in PGIMS and other government and private hospitals from outside the state, as of May 5, according to the data. Yamunanangar comes next, with 39.80%. Gurgaon, which tops the table in the active cases, ranks number three, with 39.29% of the total patients taking indoor treatment, not from the state. Similarly, the figure is 38.76% in Faridabad district, 27.67% in Sonipat, 19.05% in Jhajjar and 17.39% in Palwal. Referring to Gurgaon and Faridabad, senior officials of the health department said non-Haryana patients are more owing to the availability of good treatment and proximity to New Delhi. These two districts have some of the best-known private tertiary care centres, they said. “As far as other districts are concerned, it is only due to easy availability of beds and tertiary care. In fact, the admissions are not just limited to these seven districts, we have information of Delhi patients in Rewari, Mahendergarh, Bhiwani, Hisar, Panipat, and even in private hospitals of Ambala and Kurukshetra. We are taking the data from various portals,” said an official. Haryana health and home minister Anil Vij said the data is a reflection of two different aspects. “First, for us, a patient is a patient, irrespective of his or her origins or domicile. Second, we are duty-bound to attend and give treatment to all those who approach us. But, yes, the benefits announced by the state government for BPL and general patients should be limited to those having Haryana domicile,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/17-45-non-haryana-covid-patients-admitted-in-7-districts/articleshow/82469358.cms||Manvir Saini

Highlighting that Goa is witnessing the biggest health emergency in recent history, the association also appealed to make it mandatory for those entering the state to either have a negative RT-PCR test, both doses of the vaccine, antibody test or 14-day Covid-positive certificate. “As per the ICMR advisory those having a 14-day Covid-positive report and those having had both shots of their vaccine should be allowed. Along with the person who has Covid antibodies certificate. For those having had their second shot, a fifteen-day period after the second shot should have elapsed,” the association stated. Hours before the chief minister announced a curfew beginning Sunday, the association had submitted a letter to the to chief minister Pramod Sawant and tourism secretary Ashok J Kumar seeking a three-week statewide lockdown to break the chain of Covid infections, avert further loss of lives, give the healthcare system and health workers a much required breather and give administration an opportunity to ramp up infrastructure. The trade body had sought a five-day notice prior to the implementation of the curbs to prevent panic among citizens. The association provided a list of essential industrial units to be exempted from the lockdown and asked for travel permits for their employees.

Directly controlled by the city police commissioner, it had officers in the ranks of additional deputy commissioner, inspectors, sub inspectors, head constables and constables. The station IS staff members were appointed by the inspectors of respective police stations.

On Friday, the department had announced that the earlier deadline of May 6 had been extended to May 16. In a letter addressed to transport director Rajan Satardekar, taxi operators pointed out that people are facing hardships in moving about, especially in areas where panchayats have gone into a self-lockdown, making it difficult for them to visit the department to submit their feedback. “In the revised rates, columns like luggage charge, rates for AC car, 50% return fare outside municipal limits cannot be seen. Also, since the last notification, the rate of petrol as well as oils, tyres and spares of vehicles have increased, so also the imposed taxes,” the letter signed by North Goa Yellow and Black Taxi Association president Sunil Naik said. Naik said the taxi operators want to wait till the intensity of Covid cases subsides before they can meet to discuss the revision. Satardekar, however, said that three months is too long a time. “It is up to the government ike to extend the deadline. But it is is linked with the installation of digital meters – which is a time-bound matter. We may not be able to give such a long time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/extend-fare-revision-by-3-months/articleshow/82469392.cms||---

Make use of health checkup packages||Coimbatore: There were 3,085 Covid-19 patients, who were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and unlikely to get worse, in home isolation in the district as on Friday night.In the wake of a growing number of people without comorbidities developing breathlessness even after a week of mild symptoms, hospitals and organizations are coming up with home isolation kits.PSG Hospitals is one among them. It has launched Covid Sanjaya, a home care assistance priced at Rs 7,000. Vinod, its coordinator, said, “We offer patients a daily teleconsultation session with a doctor to discuss their symptoms and medications. We also have a nurse on call facility round the clock to get their doubts cleared.” According to him, 15 people have registered for the service since Wednesday, when it was launched. The hospital also assures ambulance service and admission, if required. Thermometer and pulse oximeter would, however, cost extra.In another initiative, a group of five doctors have come together to offer Kovai Home isolation care. The package, which is priced at Rs 3,500, comprises a video call consultation with a doctor, phone calls with a doctor for five days and a kit of triple layer masks, monitoring sheet, thermometer, pulse oximeter, sanitizer and medicines.Dr Karthik Chandrashekhar, one of the team members, said, “We are talking to laboratories to take blood tests of patients three days after they tested positive for the virus and scan centres to do a lung CT for patients, who we think require it.” More than 10 people have signed up for the service so far.City-based Inhouse Medical Care is also in touch with the health department to launch its own Covid care package.Health officials and private hospital doctors suggest opting for a system where patients are monitored by a doctor through the isolation period. “We recommend home isolation rather than Covid care centres, if people have a separate room or house,” said Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health.Dr A Raja, health officer with the city corporation, said it was advisable for those in home quarantine to be monitored by doctors. “It will ensure that they don’t become victims of late hospitalization and develop other complications by then.”Another official said early detection of drop in oxygen saturation level to below 95% was always better than rushing for hospitalization when the same plunges to 70% or 60%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/in-home-isolation-make-use-of-health-checkup-packages/articleshow/82469415.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Mucormycosis a death sentence once it reaches the brain’||MUMBAI: Mucormycosis, which has a mortality rate of over 50% and can lead to blindness, is sweeping through parts of Maharashtra. Hospitals in Mumbai that are treating dozens of such cases from northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha said its spread is assuming epidemic proportions, so much so that regions have started facing a shortage of anti-fungal medicines. Parel’s Global Hospital, which has started a dedicated clinic for mucormycosis after witnessing a surge in cases during the first wave, has 18 patients admitted at present. ENT surgeon Dr Milind Navalakhe, who is a part of the team that runs the clinic, said they have admitted 31 patients, of which 25 are from outside the city. “Cases of mucormycosis have exploded in the state, and the government needs to urgently intervene. Medical centres across Maharashtra, particularly, Vidarbha, must be seeing a 100%-200% rise in cases,” he said. At the Global Hospital centre, six patients have lost their entire upper jaw, while one has lost an eyeball due to the infection. Parel’s KEM Hospital has 25 patients undergoing treatment for mucormycosis at the moment. Dr Hetal Marfatia, professor and head of ENT, said that almost all patients are from far-off districts and have come at an advanced stage. The infection typically starts growing from the nose, upper jaw and then travels to the brain. “Once it reaches the brain, it’s almost a death sentence,” she said, adding that from treating a handful cases annually, the hospital is now seeing 3-4 referrals daily. Suhas’s cousin Ajay, also a businessman, said that their doctor could diagnose it and administer the first shot of anti-fungal medicine before they travelled to Mumbai. Jalgaon-based ENT surgeon Dr Sanjeev Zambane said he has been seeing a minimum of two mucormycosis cases in a day. “Previously, we didn’t know the disease so well. But now most doctors here recognise it,” he said. The bigger challenge now is treatment, since anti-fungal medicines are not just in short supply but also very expensive. “The anti-fungal drug amphotericin B has to be given either with posaconazole or isavuconazole. These medicines cost anything between Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 per day and have to be taken for three weeks,” Dr Zambane said, adding that none of the government hospitals have these drugs. In pre-Covid times, the ‘black fungus’ mucormycosis used to be rare and seen mainly in immunocompromised people. However, after the pandemic, three factors have led to an exponential rise—Covid itself, diabetes and abuse of steroids that lower immunity. “The moulds that cause the infection commonly exist in the environment, but those with unfit immune systems can’t fight it,” said Dr Sameer Bhargava, head of ENT at Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle that currently has four cases under treatment. He said they have started creating a database of mucormycosis cases. Dr Navalakhe said that mucormycosis requires a multi-departmental and an aggressive approach. “It cannot be treated conservatively where you save a part of the nose or the palate, because it will continue to spread. Worryingly, we are seeing several cases of inadequate treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mucormycosis-a-death-sentence-once-it-reaches-the-brain/articleshow/82469417.cms||Sumitra Debroy

During a visit to the area on Friday afternoon, it was witnessed that people were gathered in large numbers, thus continuing putting lives in danger by not following social distancing. Sources in the police department said around 22 to 30 challans are issued at the grain market daily to those who don’t wear a mask. Baljinder Singh Bittu, federation of sectors welfare association (Foswac), said, “The grain market should be allowed for only wholesale purposes. People should stay inside their homes and wait for vegetable vendors or visit the nearest market. Delivery options are always there.” Some people were found wearing masks, while many of them didn’t care to wear the same and a few others were not wearing it appropriately. It is not the first time that the grain market, where people throng to purchase groceries, has come into the limelight where Covid-19 guidelines are not being followed.

For this, the patient or their attendants will have to apply online. Dr Amit Agrawal, additional principal secretary to Haryana CM, issued necessary guidelines to district nodal officers and secretaries of the District Red Cross Society. Many Covid patients are getting treated in home isolation, he said. In addition, many patients with other diseases require oxygen. With the introduction of the facility of refilling oxygen cylinders at home, such patients will be highly benefited and their families will not have to line up to refill cylinders, while this will also curb the black-marketing of the cylinders in the market, he added. A portal — http://oxygenhry.in/ — has been created to facilitate refills. Voluntary organisations can register on the portal, which will create their login credentials. As soon as a patient registers for oxygen cylinder refill on this portal, the applications will be available to both the NGO and the Red Cross Society. Once the request is accepted, either by a Red Cross Society or an NGO, the information will be reached via SMS on the given mobile number of the applicant. he applicant will also have to upload the photo of the oxygen level in the oximeter and the Aadhaar number with the application besides giving the age and address of the patient. This facility will start from May 9. The Haryana government’s decision to refill oxygen cylinders comes on the same day as chief secretary Vijai Vardhan in a written reply to the high court regarding the suggestion made by amicus curiae on providing oxygen to Covid patients at home to avoid rush at the hospitals, said oxygen support cannot be supplied in an ordinary manner. In his reply on behalf of the Haryana government, the chief secretary told the HC that only those patients who have no or mild symptoms are being treated at home. “A patient with no or mild symptoms, who is at home would not require any oxygen support. Even otherwise, oxygen being highly inflammable cannot be supplied in an ordinary manner and rather the cylinder cannot be used without the due supervision of medical team and if a patient actually requires the oxygen support, he cannot be treated only with the oxygen support at home and has to be admitted in any clinical establishment etc. under the supervision/ observation of medical team,” he stated in the reply. The HC was informed that patients under home isolation/quarantine are being monitored regularly by medical teams. “Moreover, the government of Haryana has already constituted district-level monitoring committees and in such an eventuality, if the committee is approached for supply of oxygen at home, the visiting medical team will... endeavor for admission of patient in hospital and if it is not possible then the oxygen support will be given temporarily under the strict supervision of medical team to ensure adequate treatment and safety,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-to-start-o2-cylinder-refill-at-home-but-chief-secy-reply-to-hc-different/articleshow/82469421.cms||---

Although councillor Surjit Singh Baba was elected council president in the presence of Punjab food supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, the opposite group within the Congress declined to accept him as chief and elected councillor Suman Devi as the head, claiming support of nine out of 17 councillors. Faridkot MP Mohammad Sadique’s son-in-law Suraj Bhardwaj also supported Suman, alleging factionalism in the party not only at lower level but also at the top level. Earlier, a similar scene was reported in Barnala and 10 councillors, including those from the ruling Congress had boycotted election of president at Mansa. At some other places too Congress failed to keep its flock together. Uproarious scenes were witnessed when the election meeting concluded at Jaito Municipal Council office and nine councillors owing allegiance to Suman Rani came out in a huff. Suman Rani said, “I was the candidate for the post of president but the authorities did not conduct any election and did not listen to us. They announced Surjit Singh as president even though I had majority as SAD and independent councillors were also with me. We do not accept this election and demand re-election.” Suraj Bhardwaj alleged that injustice had been done to the Congress leader having majority. “Authorities should have tested who had the majority but here that was not done and now we have elected Suman Rani as president and Rajni Rani as vice-president,” he said. MP Mohammad Sadique said that the party failed to act as per the criteria of majority as Suman Rani had majority but was not elected president. “The party should have acted as per majority. I will take up the matter with the party high command,” he said. President elect Surjit Singh said he had the majority and was elected. Earlier, Punjab food supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MP Mohammad Sadique and Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon met councillors at market committee office where councillors are learnt to have assured to go by party directions. During the meeting at the municipal council office, names of Surjit Singh as president, Suman Rani as senior vice-president and Jatinder Bansal as vice- president were proposed. BOX: Covid guidelines violated Covid guidelines were thrown to the wind during the election as a large number of persons had assembled inside and outside Jaito municipal council office. The winning camp held celebrations whereas the Suman Rani camp raised protest with a large number of persons accompanying the councillors.

So far, the initiative, that aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation, has received over 2,000 unverified or suspicious messages from readers for verification on the WhatsApp number 9819432222. And our expert panel—made up of reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government—have been busy clearing the air by tapping into their credible bank of sources. In the last few weeks, the panel has not only called out wrong information regarding the availability of oxygen portable cylinders, but also dismissed absurdities such as “eating chikoo will keep you away from Covid” and “unmarried women should stay away from the vaccine” with a bold red stamp that cried: “This message is fake.” Recently, an article in The New York Times proposed that the real drivers of such contagious misinformation are social and psychological forces that make people prone to sharing and believing falsehoods. Given that those forces are on the rise in the wake of deadly second wave, help TOI vaccinate you with the truth. Forward all dubious, anxiety-causing messages to our expert panel, and let the green tick in the Times Verified logo counter the tyranny of the grey curved arrow of forwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-toi-breaks-the-chain-of-over-1200-viral-fake-news/articleshow/82469452.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||3 Covid health centres to come up in Nilgiris||Udhagamandalam: The district administration has created Covid health centres (CHC) to provide treatment to moderately affected patients. This will free up at least 50% of beds with oxygen support facilities in government hospitals for emergency purposes. On Friday, Youth Hostel with 70 beds in the town was turned into a CHC. At least 23 Covid patients from the Ooty Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) were shifted to the CHC-Youth Hostel on Friday. Duty doctors will man the CHC round-the-clock while physicians would make visits to the centre twice a day. “This strategy is mainly to keep 50% of beds in the four government hospitals in the district free for emergency purposes,” collector J Innocent Divya said. There are 369 beds, including 254 with oxygen support, in the four government hospitals - Ooty GMCH, Coonoor GH, Kotagiri GH and Gudalur GH besides eight private hospitals. Of the total beds, 286 are occupied by patients as of Friday. “A hospital with 30 beds run by Cordite factory at Aruvankadu and another with 35 beds run by Cantonment Board at Wellington will also be identified as CHCs from Monday,” Divya said. At least 81 patients at government hospitals are being treated under oxygen support. At least 25% of the daily new cases of the virus require oxygen support. Hence, patients are classified under three categories such as severely affected, moderately affected and mildly affected by the virus. While severely affected Covid patients and patients above 60 years are admitted to the government hospitals, asymptomatic and mildly affected patients would be treated at Covid care centres. As of now, three Covid care centres with over 300 beds are functioning in the district. “If the situation demands we would create more Covid care centres,” the collector said. On Friday, the Nilgiris registered 161 new cases of Covid-19 taking the tally to 10,633. As many as 733 active cases are being treated at various health facilities besides home quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/3-covid-health-centres-to-come-up-in-nilgiris/articleshow/82469453.cms||---
---||Goa||After Goa State Industries Association backs lockdown, industrial bodies call it detrimental||PANAJI: Goa State Industries Association (GSIA), Confederation of Indian Industry and Verna Industries Association (VIA) on Friday said that a mandatory total lockdown is detrimental, particularly if it includes manufacturing industries. The three industry bodies differed with Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry and said that shutting down the state will not only deliver another body blow to the industry and the state’s economy but will also adversely affect the thousands of daily wage workers in the state. GSIA, CII and VIA also said that imposing a state-wide lockdown without a proper plan in place to contain the novel coronavirus will be meaningless. Chief minister Pramod Sawant announced a 15-day “state-wide curfew” from Sunday onwards but did not specify if industrial estates would be allowed to function. “Manufacturing industries were just getting some orders and many of the orders are still in the pipeline with fixed delivery time schedules,” said GSIA president Damodar Kochkar. “Total closure of industries will create panic amongst the workers, who may leave the industrial estates and not return even after the lockdown is lifted.” VIA president Pradip da Costa agreed with Kochkar and said that instead of imposing a complete lockdown, the state government should clamp down on violations of Covid-19 protocols and also ban all public gatherings. A day earlier, GCCI said that in order to prevent Goa’s health care system from collapsing, a complete lockdown needs to be imposed immediately. Kochkar said that GCCI represents traders and professionals who can “absorb the shock of a total lockdown” which the manufacturing sector cannot. “We at VIA, completely accept and agree that the healthcare sector is totally overstretched and strained currently, to the point of total collapse,” said Da Costa. “But, a total lockdown without a deep drawn containment plan (vaccination drive) with some prophylactic means is just about pushing the problem from today to tomorrow, for it to flare up again.” A total lockdown, said da Costa, will affect the migrant contract labor in the state which comprises 70% of the whole informal workforce in the state. The economic crisis will probably be worse than the health crisis for the migrant labourers, he said. “In the interest of industry, a complete lockdown in the state would cause grave economic losses and hardships due to abrupt stoppage of industry functioning, disruption in the working process line of various industries which are already struggling due to the consequences of the earlier lockdowns,” said CII Goa chairman Atul Jadhav. Kochkar has urged the government to permit manufacturing and construction activity to continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-gcci-backs-lockdown-ind-bodies-call-it-detrimetal/articleshow/82469455.cms||---

---||Salem||Temple priest beats women devotees, held||NAMAKKAL: The Namakkal police on Friday arrested a temple priest who was seen thrashing women devotees with a whip and later with a long stick in two videos that went viral on social media. The priest identified as S Anil Kumar, 40, of Sangili Karuppasamy temple near Kamalakaradu in Velagoundanpatti village of Namakkal district, used to beat the women devotees as a form of exorcism to ‘relieve them from evil clutches.’ In one of the videos that have surfaced on social media, Anil Kumar is seen slapping a woman devotee repeatedly and disrespectfully speaking to her. He grabs her hair, lifts her and gives a hard beating. He then starts beating her repeatedly with a whip. Several women, apparently the family members of the victim, are seen standing around. One of the women in the group complaints to the priest that she doesn’t sleep the whole night. The woman, unable to bear the beating begins to weep. The godman then ends his act with one more slap on her face. In the other video, a middle-aged woman pleads with the priest to leave her alone. But the man grabs her by the hair and beats her mercilessly with a long stick. Even as the woman cries unable to bear the pain, the man pushes her down on the floor, stamps on her body and asks if she would look after the children properly. The woman begs to leave her assuring him that she would do so, after which he lets her go. This woman is also whipped several times before the priest chooses a stick. The Velagoundanpatti police said that these videos were taken six months ago. “But no one has ever come forward to complain against him,’’ police said. This man had come to this village three years back and has been practising this for a long time, a police officer said. Though people from Velagoundanpatti do not visit him, those from other places of the state and some even from neighbouring states would visit him. He was booked under three counts of IPC including assault and voluntarily causing hurt. He was also booked under the Woman Harassment Act and sent to the Rasipuram sub–jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/temple-priest-beats-women-devotees-held/articleshow/82469484.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Saddened that no meeting called with MPs over sacrilege: Bajwa to CM||Chandigarh: Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Friday wrote to chief minister Amarinder Singh, demanding a meeting of party MPs from the state to discuss “threadbare” the issue of sacrilege and developments in the Kotkapura firing case. “I am saddened to write this letter to you as no meeting has been called with the MPs from Punjab to discuss the cases of sacrilege and police firing and violence at Bargari, Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura after the previous meeting was cancelled. The recent high court verdict is a major setback in ensuring that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice, as this issue is of great sentimental significance to the people of the state,” Bajwa stated in his letter. He added that a meeting with the MPs to discuss this issue was called on May 4 but cancelled due to the pandemic. “I understand the seriousness of the pandemic and keeping this in mind, I did not raise the issue at the meeting you called to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the state. The pandemic is a matter of life and the sacrilege cases are a matter of our identity. We cannot forget our promises to the people of Punjab,” he added, “I request you to call for a threadbare discussion (either physical or virtual) with the members of Parliament from the Indian National Congress so as to ensure a viable plan of action can be formulated at the earliest. It has been over two weeks since the judgment was made available,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/saddened-that-no-meeting-called-with-mps-over-sacrilege-bajwa-to-cm/articleshow/82469485.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC relaxes its no walk-in rule after ugly scenes at vaccination centres||MUMBAI: The first day of BMC’s no walk-in rule had a chaotic start at most vaccination centres. Many unaware of such a direction came without appointment. As the crowd swelled and refused to leave without the shot, some centres relaxed the ‘no walk-in’ rule for a few hours. BMC had announced late on Thursday that those above 45 years wouldn’t be allowed to walk in unless they were coming for a second dose of Covaxin or were healthcare or frontline workers. At Govandi's Shivaji Nagar maternity home, things got out of hand and police was called after hundreds gathered to collect a token were upset to learn that an online appointment was needed. At Parel’s KEM Hospital, officials vaccinated senior citizens without an appointment for a few hours after the crowd got restive. However, by noon, most centres had stopped walk-ins. On Friday, 41,107 vaccinations were done in the city, a drop from 60,153 on Thursday. Numbers could further dip on Saturday as centres are running low on stocks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the drive could slow down if they don’t receive fresh stocks. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state had less than one lakh vaccine doses left of the nine lakh doses it received from the Centre three days ago. Tope also said the public health department has proposed sequential vaccination to prioritise the 35-44 group and those with co-morbidities. “We have administered 2.15 lakh doses to 18-44 age group, but stocks are limited. We have received 4.9 lakh Covaxin doses and another 3.5 lakh Covishield doses have been assured. Till the time we do not have adequate stocks, we are proposing to proceed with sequential vaccination for the older population in the 18-44 age group and those with co-morbidities,” he said. Government is considering diverting Covaxin doses purchased for the 18-44 group to meet demand from the 45+ or their second dose. RR Pillai (86) and wife Padma (76), residents of Hill Garden at Manpada, Thane, said they were waiting for a second dose of the Covaxin jab since the last 40 days. “Someone told us about a walk-in facility at an Andheri hospital after which we drove them down, only to be told that stocks had dried up there,” said their son-in-law Shashi Kumar Nair. Health minister Tope said nearly 4-5 lakh in the state who were administered Covaxin are awaiting a second dose. “We have requested the Centre…if they do not supply, we may have to give from the other quota.” Serum Institute of India chief Adar Poonawalla has told Maharashtra that his company would be unable to supply Covishield doses till May 26. Tope said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a phone chat with Poonawalla, who is in London. On Thursday, the state could vaccinate 4,55,109 after a lull early in the week due to shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-relaxes-its-no-walk-in-rule-after-ugly-scenes-at-vax-centres/articleshow/82469514.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Chandigarh||Himachal curfew: Deserted markets, streets on Day 1||Manali: Cities, towns and villages in Himachal Pradesh wore a deserted look as “corona curfew” was implemented in the hill state on Friday. There was almost no major case of violation of the curfew. Very few people stepped out in Shimla, Solan, Kullu, Dharamshala, Una, Bilaspur, Solan, Chamba, Manali, Hamirpur and other areas. The few who did step out did so to buy groceries, vegetables, milk, medicines and other essentials. Many shops received no customers. Despite permission, most restaurants and dhabas remained closed. Some grocery shops did not open either. A number of police checkposts were laid and patrolling was stepped up to check violations. There were reports of police asking people in private cars not to venture out but on the whole, people cooperated with the police. Police also checked shops, dhabas and public buses for violations and requested people to maintain distance from each other. Mandi SP Shalini Agnihotri said, “Everything is peaceful in the district. We are requesting people not to come out of the houses without reason. Police teams are patrolling markets, villages, national and state highways to ensure compliance of corona curfew.” Kullu SP Gaurav Singh said besides 18 teams of the district police, 76 cops and 115 home guards had been deployed to check violations. “The teams are ensuring strict compliance of corona curfew and are checking containment zones and guarding Covid centres. A total of 30 Rustom volunteers are also helping us in compliance of Covid safety protocols.” Shops, dhabas and restaurants can remain open till 6pm but most of the shops were closed in the afternoon as they had no customers. Shops in Bilaspur district will remain open from 6am to 2pm. Vidya Sagar, a vegetable seller in Manu Market said he had his last customer after waiting for about one hour. “The entire market is empty. We had enough customers on Thursday as people flocked the market just before corona curfew. All shopkeepers are waiting for customers,” he said. Public transport is allowed to operate at 50% occupancy but most buses had no passengers. Some were operating with just one or two passengers. Although the state borders have been kept open for tourists, tourism movement to the state has almost stopped. While many hotels in the state closed operations last month, many others did so following imposition of corona curfew as they had no guests. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said people of Himachal have cooperated with the government for effective implementation of the corona curfew. “Reports are coming from all the districts that there were no violations and people are supporting the corona curfew. We have tried to balance curfew and businesses. Hopefully, this will help the state in controlling Covid cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/himachal-curfew-deserted-markets-streets-on-day-1/articleshow/82469521.cms||Suresh Sharma

Calling Congress’s criticism as “bizarre”, Puri said the government knows its priorities. In a series of tweets, Puri said, “...India’s healthcare budget for just this year was over Rs 3 lakh crore. We know our priorities.” Puri also referred to the proposal during the UPA government for construction of a New Parliament. However, the present government has gone for complete revamp of Central Vista, which includes construction of a new Parliament building, PM house, Vice President’s house, redevelopment of Rajpath, construction of new Central Secretariat buildings and a massive conference centre. Puri said, “Congress doesn’t stop at hypocrisy. Look at their shameful double-face. During UPA, Congress leaders wrote about the need for a new Parliament building. The Speaker in 2012 wrote a letter to the urban development ministry for the same. And now they have the gall to oppose the same project." The minister also alleged that Congress wants to distract people from monumental governance failures in their states by “spreading lies”. The minister said the Congress party is resorting to “cheap politics” despite knowing this project creates direct and indirect employment for thousands of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers in these times. Puri also accused Congress and its allies of splurging on reconstructing an MLA hostel in Maharashtra and building a new assembly building in Chhattisgarh, adding, “If that is fine, what is the problem with Central Vista?” Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted to say, "Central Vista is criminal wastage.

R M Mathivanan, who is also the president of the party’s auto union, was with the AIADMK earlier and had done a similar thing in 2016, when the late J Jayalalithaa was elected to power. A retired record clerk with the Coimbatore Central Prison, Mathivanan joined the DMK four years ago. “I have ferried 75 people till 4pm since morning and I will charge just Rs 1 per person till the end of the day, to express my gratitude and share my happiness with the public for electing the DMK to power after 10 years. I have travelled about 50km-60km so far. It’s okay to sacrifice the wage for a day. People are appreciating both the DMK and me, and it makes me happy.” He said the number of people stepping out of their house has come down (and hence the number of rides) because of the pandemic and lockdown restrictions. Meanwhile, DMK cadres distributed sweets and celebrated the party’s victory. At Gandhipuram and in front of the DMK office at Vadakovai, party incharge Sethuram garlanded the statue of former chief minister the late CN Annadurai and distributed sweets to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/auto-driver-offers-rides-at-rs-1-for-electing-dmk/articleshow/82469548.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccine seekers criss-cross dists in search of a jab||Bhuleshwar resident Rajesh Rathod said he spent half of Friday refreshing Aarogya Setu app and the Co-Win page. “I hit a jackpot though, I got an appointment in 20 minutes,” he said, standing in the queue at Parel’s KEM Hospital. Another successful vaccine seeker, a 22-year-old, who managed an appointment for his 82-year-old grandfather’s second dose, said three of his friends “launched an attack” on Co-Win from three devices. “We got it for the BKC vaccination centre after multiple attempts,” said the Bandra resident. He said he his friends in Delhi stayed up the night to see if appointments would be easier to get around 3-4am. On Friday, a security code was added to the steps on Co-Win, apparently to stop bots from booking the appointments. A sure hack, he said, was to try searching for centres using districts rather than pin codes. Another revelation for authorities was that vaccine seekers were crisscrossing districts to get the shots. As slots opened in Mumbai, many from the neighbouring areas such as Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira Road grabbed the slots. Rajkumari Gupta, a resident of Ghodbunder Road, said five of her previous appointments at nearby centres had got cancelled due to vaccine shortage. So, when she got the sixth confirmed appointment at a Parel centre, she just booked a cab and got there. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said instances of residents from outside Mumbai booking slots in city hospitals have been noticed. “We are hoping the 200-odd centres starting in the community from next week will solve this problem,” he said. BMC has also decided to open appointment slots at a fixed hour so that people don’t have to keep scrolling all day, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccine-seekers-criss-cross-dists-in-search-of-a-jab/articleshow/82469561.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vanraj Bhatia, composer par excellence, dies||Mumbai: Vanraj Bhatia, whose music deepened the content of arthouse cinema in the 1970s and who cheerfully cocked a snook at the omnibus, 150-piece orchestra of mainstream Hindi cinema, passed away on Friday following a prolonged illness. He was 94. Bhatia had for long been combating age-related health problems. Although steeped in Western classical music, Bhatia was only too willing to dip into Indian folk and traditional melodies to underscore a film’s narrative. The lingering, feather-soft flute which laces key scenes in the movie Manthan or the melancholy notes of Tamas, the much-acclaimed television show based on Partition, are a testimony to Bhatia’s range and style, say connoisseurs. In a career spanning nearly four decades, the immensely talented composer teamed up with ace filmmakers such as Shyam Benegal, Kumar Shahani, Aparna Sen and Govind Nihalani. Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar, Yesudas, Arati Ankalikar-Tikekar and Preeti Sagar have sung under Bhatia’s baton. His oeuvre included cinema, television, theatre and ad campaigns. He scored more than 6,500 jingles, including the iconic Liril ditty. After he bagged Ankur, Shyam Benegal’s first film in 1974, Bhatia sealed a formidable partnership with the renowned filmmaker, rustling up, it is said, a tally of 16 films, including Nishant, Bhumika, Sardari Begum, Suraj ka Satvan Ghoda and Mandi. ‘Tumhare bina jee naa lage ghar mein’, the lilting, laidback number from Bhumika, rendered by Preeti Sagar, poignantly evokes the sepia-tinged black-and-white era in which the film is set. ‘Mero gaam katha paarey’, from Manthan, had won the heart of Prince Charles during his visit to India, it is said. The song has since been adopted by the Amul milk cooperative as its anthem.  Bhatia’s music offered a fresh interpretation of characters caught in the flux of life in contemporary India, said experts. He also scored for 36 Chowringhee Lane, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, Junoon, Kalyug, Saza-e-Maut, Pestonji, Hip Hip Hurray, Mohan Joshi Haazir Ho, Tarang, Droh-Kaal, Massey Sahab, Susman, Antarnaad, Mammo and Naseem, among many others. Bhatia’s background score-only Hindi films include Ajooba, Bekhudi, Beta, Chamatkar, Ghatak, Pardesi, Chameli and Damini. He also wrote the score for The Householder, a Merchant-Ivory film. He wrote the opening lines of TV series such as Khandan, Wagle ki Duniya, Naqab, Lifeline and Bharat Ek Khoj, based on late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s ‘Discovery of India’. Born in Mumbai in 1927, Bhatia, an Elphinstonian, joined the Royal Academy of Music in London and the Paris Conservatory to study Western music. On his return to India, he had a brief stint at the Delhi University as Western musicologist. He joined Benegal in the 1970s. Bhatia won the national award for best music direction for Tamas (1988). The Sangeet Natak Akademi award came in 1989. For his contribution to cinema, he was awarded Padma Shri in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vanraj-bhatia-composer-par-excellence-dies/articleshow/82465153.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Coimbatore||Ambulance pilots, emergency medical technicians render selfless service||Coimbatore: The demand for emergency medical technicians and ambulance pilots has been on the rise since the caseload started to peak in the second wave of the pandemic, which in turn has shot up their workload. TOI talked to a 26-yearold emergency medical technician, who along with his 108 ambulance pilot, had transported several Covid patients from across the district to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and Covid care centres in the city before Friday noon itself. He was in a hurry, as a patient was waiting for them at his residence at Vellalore to be taken to the CMCH. But his job isn’t limited to just ferrying the patient. He also ensures bed availability and speedy completion of admission process, by staying in constant touch with nurses/hospital authorities. The emergency medical technician said he would be transporting at least another 10 patients to hospitals before completing his 24 hours duty and going to bed. “An ambulance transports a minimum of 10 to 15 patients to Covid care centres and hospitals from different parts of the district. Everywhere patients are waiting for us. For instance, if we are ferrying a patient from residence to Codissia, there would be another patient waiting to be taken to the ESI Hospital, where too a patient would be waiting for us to be moved to the CMCH based on doctor’s recommendation.” Pointing out that they had been receiving a lot of calls during the night hours, he said their workload has increased by at least three times compared to the normal times. “However, we are getting a full day off after working continuously for 24 hours.” An ambulance pilot said the beds in hospitals and Covid care centres would be fully occupied most of the times, forcing them to move from a centre to another in search of beds. “If the beds aren’t vacant and patients are stable without much symptoms, they will be asked to home quarantine. In the case of patients with breathing troubles, our last resort is the CMCH, where we will somehow convince the doctors/nurses with the help of our superiors to arrange a bed.” He said they were fully aware of the risk they were taking. “On our day off, we isolate ourselves from our family members as a precautionary measure. So, there is no risk of us transmitting the virus to them.” S Selvamuthukumar, manager of 108 ambulance, said they were taking all the necessary steps to reduce the stress of their pilots and emergency medical technicians, as their workload has increased in the recent times. At least 58 ambulances are functioning in the district. “We have increased the number of ambulance for Covid patients to 20 from 10 to reduce the workload of our employees. And their shift is changed once in 45 days. We are also meeting them directly to motive them. All of them have been advised to take vaccination. This apart, we are planning to conduct virtual counselling sessions for them.” He said an ambulance would pick up a maximum of three people together to reduce the number of trips, if there were multiple cases in stable condition from a same area. “It helps lessen the burden of our employees. Other ambulances will also be roped in during tough situations. We will also coordinate with doctors to find beds for patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ambulance-pilots-emergency-medical-technicians-render-selfless-service/articleshow/82469584.cms||Nivedha Selvam

According to sources, a 30-bedded ward has been proposed, but is initially starting with 10 beds. Despite efforts by the health department, locals from Sattari would hardly come to the Valpoi CHC for treatment in the initial stages of the infection as they were afraid of being referred tofar-off hospitals. “Due to this delay, many people developed complications and were at the risk of losing their lives. So, through this initiative, we hope that people with mild symptoms can take treatment at Valpoi,” said a medical official at the CHC Valpoi. He said that people are still not serious about the pandemic and neglect the norms for Covid treatment . People should come to hospital and get tested once they develop symptoms, the medical officer said. Currently, there are 707 active Covid cases under the jurisdiction of the Valpoi CHC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/10-bed-covid-facility-set-up-at-valpoi-health-centre/articleshow/82469600.cms||---

Speaking to reporters after the weekly Covid review meeting, Pawar said the Centre should have catered to needs of all states before shipping out vaccines. He cited the case of Russia, which he said was exporting its home-grown vaccine only after vaccinating a significant chunk of its population. “India started exporting vaccines before it started the drive,” he said. He said the state has the capacity to step up the vaccination drive, but the shortage was causing a disruption. Pawar said he has been in touch with vaccine manufacturers and said there were barely any doses left to give booster shots to those over 45. “The Centre should allow states to directly procure vaccines from abroad. I’ve asked Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, to ramp up production,” he said. Mumbai-based Haffkine Institute has begun work on the vaccine, but may take over a year to produce the necessary volume, Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-vax-exported-before-home-need-met-says-ajit/articleshow/82469635.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Since vaccines slots are not available in all hospitals and primary health centres in the city, he booked his vaccine dose at Kothur PHC in Mahbubnagar and got his jab. This is not an isolated case. With non-availability of vaccines in the city till month end, several people are going to neighbouring districts such as Mahbubnagar, Sanga Reddy, Ranga Reddy, Medak and Vikarabad for vaccines where slots are available. Some hospitals in Patancheru and Sadashivapet in Sanga Reddy are within 50 km from the city. Sources said that in the city, the government has been allotting only 100 doses to selected primary health centres each day and 200 doses to big hospitals in view of shortage. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Thursday informed PM Narendra Modi the state requires 2 lakh to 2.5 lakh doses every day, and it has not been getting enough doses. Health department officials said the slots are lying vacant in rural areas as many people don’t know how to book slots online as the government slot booking on CoWin website is mandatory. Secondly there are not many takers in rural areas as there is a hesitancy among people on taking the vaccine. Interestingly, vaccines slots were available till Thursday in some government hospitals like Panjesha in the Old City, but were filled as people from other parts of the city registered on it. “Earlier, doses used go waste in some rural areas as there were not many takers and once the vial is opened, 10 people should be administered. Now, people are coming from Hyderabad and there is zero wastage,” a doctor working in Ranga Reddy PHC said. “Though we have to travel far off places for vaccines, there is no rush for vaccines in surrounding district hospitals,” said Rama Devi B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-slots-available-many-rush-to-small-towns-for-jab/articleshow/82469647.cms||Koride Mahesh

While the city faces shortage of raw water supply, DJB has issued an instructional order rationalising water supply across Delhi, but has also said “special attention shall be paid to the hospitals treating Covid-19 patients to ensure that there is no shortage of drinking water in hospitals”. DJB has clarified again the supply to hospitals and other healthcare facilities is not under threat for now. While Delhi has an installed capacity to supply 930MGD water, it is currently facing a shortage of 60-65MGD. A senior official said written instructions had been issued to junior engineers who would remain in constant touch with the hospital authorities to ensure supply of sufficient quantities of water. The order states that apart from regular line supplies, water tankers will be used if need arises. “Delay in supply of drinking water to the Covid-19 hospitals shall be viewed seriously. All chief engineers to monitor water supply to the Covid-19 hospitals,” it adds. The water supply has been affected in many parts of Delhi, especially the tail-end of the command areas. “The situation is aggravated due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic and the peak water demand during the summer months,” DJB has stated. However, it has said, all necessary efforts are being made to efficiently manage the available water and ensure minimum inconvenience to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-to-ensure-adequate-supply-to-covid-hosps/articleshow/82469655.cms||---

---||Delhi||No one should die of lack of oxygen: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that the oxygen situation in Delhi was improving and directed officials to ensure that no one died of lack of oxygen. The CM chaired a meeting on the Covid-19 situation in Delhi and directed the district magistrates to pay surprise visits to vaccination centres and relief camps to monitor preparedness and convenience for people. He also asked officials to work at vaccinating all eligible people in Delhi within three months. “Now that Delhi has received oxygen, no one in the capital should suffer any longer. All the hospitals in the city should increase their beds and every district magistrate should arrange new oxygen beds in their districts so that no one died due to inaccessibility to oxygen,” the CM said at the meeting. Kejriwal also pointed out that any impediments in the distribution of oxygen had be to removed to ensure little or no disruption in the supply of the gas. “The oxygen we get should be used efficiently. We must try to prevent oxygen wastage,” he directed officials. “If we can, we should save oxygen and return it to the central government so that it can be used in some other state.” The state government is also working on the installation of 48 oxygen plants to boost the availability of the gas in the capital. “As soon as these plants reach Delhi, they should be installed immediately. These 48 plants have a production capacity of 40 tonnes of oxygen,” the CM noted. “This will further help improve Delhi's oxygen situation. We have to prepare long-term plans and build the capacity of oxygen storage on a very large scale in Delhi. We should also create a special capacity for the storage of the gas.” Kejriwal also expressed displeasure at home isolation patients still not being given oximeters as promised. “In all cases, patients recovering from Covid at home should be given oximeters,” he emphasised. All district magistrates have been instructed to visit hunger relief centres located in their districts every day to ensure that the poor did not face any problem with fooding and to ensure all amenities and medical care were being provided in shelters, old-age homes and orphanages. Mindful of experts warning of a possible third wave of infections hitting the capital in the near future, Kejriwal said, “We will be able to stop the third wave of corona from coming to Delhi only by being able to administer vaccines to everyone here as soon as possible. We need to recruit retired doctors, nurses, and medical staff on a large scale and complete the task in the next three months. Whoever wants to help society should join Delhi government in carrying out this work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-one-should-die-of-lack-of-o2-cm/articleshow/82469666.cms||AlokKNMishra

In an order issued on May 6, the Delhi government said People arriving in the national capital from Telangana and AP through any mode of transport would have to undergo 14 days of mandatory institutional quarantine. Following the order, airlines and tour operators were flooded with calls from anxious passengers inquiring about cancellations, RT-PCR test, quarantine facilities in Delhi and refunds. “I am a resident of Delhi and had planned this trip two months in advance to visit my family for a week. Due to the restriction, I have cancelled my trip for now as I had sought only one week of leave. If I continue my trip, one week would go into quarantining myself,” said Kumud Bandhu, a customs employee who works at Krishnapatnam port. Many other passengers were forced to cancel their travel plans owing to the restriction, while some rushed to get their RTPCR test done and rescheduled their flight. “My sister and my niece were supposed to travel from Hyderabad to Delhi on May 7. Post the restriction, we had to reschedule the flight to May 8, giving them enough time to get an RTPCR test done,” said Ibrahim Usmani, media analyst for a US-based firm. Many international travelers who had connecting flights from Delhi too were in a dilemma on the requirement to land in the national capital. “@DelhiAirport I have first connect flight from Hyderabad to Delhi on May 12, 4:15 pm and on May 13 1:05 am Delhi to Chicago.

---||Navi-mumbai||Covid-19: Stable graph in Mumbai, but Maharashtra clocks sharp spike in deaths||MUMBAI: Despite a dip in cases, Covid-19 fatalities continue to remain high. Maharashtra reported 54,022 daily detections and 898 fatalities on Friday. Total caseload fell short of the 50-lakh mark by 3,000 cases. Total fatalities rose to 74,413, inching close to the 75,000-mark. The graph in Mumbai was stable with 3,040 cases and 71 deaths on Friday. The city's tally and toll on Thursday was nearly identical at 3,020 and 69 respectively. “In pandemics, every peak is followed by a drop in cases. Mumbai is at that stage,'' said a BMC official. Even the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is reporting a dip though in a few pockets cases were on the rise and the local administration had imposed lockdowns. Thane collector on Friday evening imposed additional curbs in Badlapur-Kulgaon municipal council from Saturday till May 14; similar restrictions were imposed in 56 villages in Kalyan Rural May 10 to May 14. All essential shops selling groceries, milk and vegetables will remain closed there. Only exceptions would be medical shops. Home delivery of essentials would be allowed though.

---||Ahmedabad||Demand falls, dyestuff makers operate at low capacity||AHMEDABAD: Dyes and dyestuff manufacturers across Gujarat have cut production following a significant reduction in demand from domestic and international markets. Most of the dye plants are, at present, operating at a lower capacity of 30-40%, say industry players. “Dyes and dyestuff industry is facing a tough time as the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the market. Majority of players have reduced the production and their units are operating at 30-40% capacity,” said Yogesh Parikh, immediate past president, Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers Association (GDMA). The textile sector consumes majority of the dyes and dyestuff produced in the state. With garments and apparels not being the priority of consumers, the demand from the sector has slumped substantially. As against the months of January and February, the current demand of dyes and dyestuff has plummeted to 60%,” Parikh added. Gujarat is a major hub of dyes and dyestuff production and houses about 1,500 dye manufacturing units. The total size of this industry in the state is estimated at Rs 25,000 crore per annum. “Dye-making plants are not operating continuously. Some operate for half a day, while many others run only one shift as against the usual three shifts,” he said. Exports have also declined due to the reduction in export orders from countries such as Turkey, Bangladesh, and Indonesia following lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 in these respective countries. Industry players opine that the demand took a beating in April and it is expected to remain sluggish even in May. Meanwhile, spiralling prices of raw materials have further added to the woes of the industry, say market players. “The price of basic raw materials such as benzene, acetic acid, aniline and acetic anhydride has almost doubled. As a result, the production cost has also gone up,” added Bhupendra Patel, former president, GDMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/demand-falls-dyestuff-makers-operate-at-low-capacity/articleshow/82469720.cms||---

---||Delhi||Hospitals breathe slightly easier||New Delhi: Looks like things are finally improving for hospitals in the context of oxygen supplies. Several hospitals told TOI on Friday that they weren’t as hesitant as two days ago in admitting new patients. “Yes, the situation has improved. The SOS teams work round the clock to ensure the hospitals don’t run out of oxygen,” said Dr Narin Sehgal of Sehgal Neo Hospital, the scowl of the past few days no longer on his face. “However, the reduced gas allotment and uncertainty of supply are still irritants.” HAHC Hospital in Hamdard Nagar breathed in relief when its newly installed oxygen generator began working on Friday. Dr Ajaz Mustafa, medical superintendent, said, “There is certainly an improvement in oxygen availability. We have also tried out the oxygen generator and to our relief, it works. Now, we even have vacant oxygen beds for critical patients.” Doctors believe that with the setting up of oxygen plants and generators on hospital premises, the situation is likely to further improve in the coming days. With each institution generating oxygen for its use, the general supplies could be diverted to those hospitals with critical patients and those needing more oxygen. Most hospitals told TOI that while the problems related to liquid oxygen supply had diminished, refilling of cylinders was another matter, often taking 10-12 hours. “Refill stations are in distant locations and the queues are very long,” said an official of a 50-bedded hospital. “When our vehicles set out with our cylinders, we don’t know whether they will be back in time or we will again be in a tight spot.” The official said his hospital had located refilling stations outside Delhi and were sending their cylinders there. Other hospitals are sending staff to Hardwar and Himachal Pradesh towns to refill cylinders. At Shanti Mukund Hospital in Karkardooma, SK Saggar, CEO, admitted that liquid oxygen was being supplied regularly. However, refilling of oxygen cylinders remained a hassle. “A team from our hospital goes out every day to hunt for refilling stations,” said Saggar. “This also means our oxygen requirements are not yet being fully met. So, we have been teaching patients breathing exercises to enable us to discharge them and free up the beds because there are some patients with mild symptoms who also need oxygen support. As it is, our staff is overworked, with a big number of them getting infected with the coronavirus. In fact, I can tell you that 90 doctors and other staff members tested positive for Covid earlier.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-breathe-slightly-easier/articleshow/82469752.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Positivity rate in Mumbai drops further, is now 8.6%||MUMBAI: There was reason to cheer in Mumbai early on Friday as the positivity rate in Covid tests dropped to 8.6%. Of 35,224 tests carried out on Thursday, 3,039 tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. “If we exclude cases referred from outside Mumbai, the rate is possibly lower,” a civic official said. The drop in positivity rate in Mumbai comes at a time when the BMC has been criticized for a drop in the number of tests. “Since March 2020, we have focused on targeted testing,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Instead of randomly testing people, the BMC has tested high-risk contacts and people working in essential services who are at higher risk of contracting the virus, among others. “With the lockdown, crowed places such as malls and railway stations have no crowds. We have fewer tests, but our positivity rate has been dropping steadily,” said a doctor from the public health department. A week back, on April 30, the city’s daily positivity rate was 9.9% -- a sharp drop from 30% on April 3. A senior doctor from a BMC hospital said it is the nature of a pandemic to register a drop in positivity rate after the peak. Accordingly, in the many places across India that haven’t reached the peak yet, the positivity rate is higher. A report in TOI on May 7 mentioned the positivity rate in Goa was a record 41% over a 14-day period between April 21 and May 4. In the same period, the positivity rate in Delhi was 31.7% and in West Bengal it was 29.6%. In all, 13 states had a positivity rate over 20. In Mumbai, the drop is witnessed across all wards. In congested Dharavi, the number of cases have dropped from 99 on a single day in April to 18 on May 7. “We tested aggressively to bring down the positive numbers. The partial lockdown also helped as crowding reduced at many places. With fewer cases, the high-risk contacts that need to be tested have reduced,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward. Samajwadi Party MLA and Byculla corporator Rais Shaikh said there is no denying the positivity rate is coming down for Mumbai, but one also needs to look at the rising number of deaths. “The second wave has been all about the rapid rise in the number of deaths. This is because there is no clear treatment protocol and everyone is doing as they please. There has also been inadequate intensive care, worsening people’s suffering,” Shaikh said. Colaba corporator Makrand Narwekar said there is a need to conduct more tests. “The dropping positivity rate is a welcome sign, but we need to test more to get a clear picture. The drop (in testing) I fear is because the civic body does not have the health infrastructure needed to fit everyone if required,” said Narwekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/positivity-rate-in-mumbai-drops-further-is-now-8-6/articleshow/82469760.cms||Richa Pinto

The state got an allocation of 51 oxygen generators and work relating to them will begin within two days. He said that for patients needing oxygen supply at Gandhi and TIMS, provisions are being made with oxygen at the entrance before they are shifted in. Saying that there is no medicine shortage in the state, and oxygen bed capacity has increased to 15,000 in the state. He said 50 oxygen and ICU beds are occupied both in government and private hospitals. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Friday said that technical staff, mechanics, and police needed to get oxygen tankers from Odisha and Bellary in Karnataka. To reduce the travel distance, a green channel has been approved by the railway department. The Centre on Friday allocated 1.45 lakh Remdesivir injections to Telangana. A total of 53 lakh injections were allocated to all states. Separately, the government also appealed to the people not to misuse home isolation kits unnecessarily. “It has come to our notice that those who are not symptomatic also pressing for such kits. Using steroids and other medicines not required will be dangerous,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gandhi-hosp-to-get-more-o2-supply/articleshow/82469780.cms||---

The competitive exam, which is not mandatory, is conducted by the Maharashtra State Examination Council (MSEC). The exam was earlier scheduled for April 25. In each district, 100 students each from Classes V and VIII get an annual scholarship of Rs 1,000. On Wednesday, MSEC instructed examination centres (civic and private schools) to organise classrooms and supervisors. The move has upset schools and teachers, who have demanded that the exam be further postponed. School authorities said classrooms have been shut for a year. “It makes no sense to open them and ready them for one exam,” said the principal of a school in Mahim. “How do you expect students to be in centres when Covid is at its peak?” asked Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad. The Parishad has sent three letters to the government to postpone the exams as scrapping them would hit financially weak students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teachers-protest-offline-scholarship-exams/articleshow/82469788.cms||Sandhya Nair

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that he continues to get pleas for oxygen cylinders, which suggests that the situation has “really gone out of control”. The party also launched a mobile helpline vehicles to pick up Covid-19 patients and to carry oxygen cylinders for hospitals. Kamat said that chief minister Pramod Sawant must take note of the oxygen crisis and act immediately. “Goa is reeling under the Covid crisis, but the BJP government has made no efforts to ease and control the situation,” said Kamat, adding that the government has once again let down the people by announcing a “state-wide curfew” instead of a full-fledged lockdown. “The chief minister fears to utter the word “lockdown”. Goans were expecting a big decision but Sawant announced curfew.

A 1,000 litre per minute (LPM) capacity plant will be set up at Civil Hospital and two 200 LPM oxygen plants will be installed in Sohna and Pataudi. Two days after Gurgaon MP Rao Inderjit Singh announced the plan for six new oxygen plants in the city, officials said that the work on the Sohna plant has already begun. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the agency assigned by the union government for civil work at the oxygen plants, carried out a site visit in Sohna and is likely to begin civil work soon. In a district advisory committee (DAC) meeting on Friday, deputy commissioner Yash Garg said: “A 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) capacity oxygen plant, based on PSA technique, will be set up at Civil hospital in Sector 10 and two 200 litres per minute capacity oxygen plants will be set up in government hospitals of Sohna and Pataudi.” He added the plants are expected to be functional by the end of May. Meanwhile, Singh confirmed that the NHAI has carried out site visits. “It will soon prepare drawings and start civil work. Once the civil work is completed, Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and HLL Infratech will begin the installation of the plants,” he said. “I am hopeful that the oxygen plants will be set up and functional in 30 to 45 days. The plan is to make the plants functional before the third wave hits the country. The departments concerned have been directed to strictly adhere to the deadline,” added Singh. After completion of the first phase, the government will set up an oxygen plant of 500 litres per minute capacity in Mandikheda hospital of Mewat. The NHAI has also carried out a site visit and will begin civil work soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/work-on-o2-plant-starts-city-to-have-three-by-may-end/articleshow/82469810.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

This is the fourth time in the last five days that the number of new cases remained below 20,000. On Thursday, 19,133 fresh cases were reported. There are 91,035 active cases and over 11.8 lakh people have recovered, according to the health bulletin issued by Delhi government. The infection tally rose to 12,92,867 on Friday. The positivity rate stood at 24.92%, a bit higher than 24.29% a day ago. The death toll rose to 18,739. On Thursday, 335 people had succumbed to the viral infection. Of the 22,097 hospital beds for coronavirus patients in the city, only 2,175 are vacant. As many as 50,425 patients are in home isolation and the number of containment zones is 50,785, according to the bulletin. A total of 1,14,657 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Thursday, out of which 80,306 were those who got their first dose, the bulletin stated. There are a total of 22,192 Covid beds in the city of which 19,932 are occupied. The total number of ICU beds is 5,612 of which 5,561 are occupied. ICU bed with ventilator support is available in only one hospital in Karol Bagh. On the brighter side, the recovery rate has picked up. In the last one week, nearly 1.5 lakh people have recovered from the infection. “The lockdown has really helped reduce the spread of the disease. It should continue for a few more days to gain complete control over the disease and expand the health infrastructure to cope up with the patient rush,” the official said. Nearly 85% of Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and they recover under home isolation. However, the remaining 15% who have moderate to severe symptoms require hospitalisation. “Hospitalisation is necessary if oxygen saturation reduces to less than 94%, or patient complaints about altered sensorium, confusion, headache and dizziness. Chest pain could be a sign of cardiac involvement,” said a senior doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-under-25-for-second-day/articleshow/82469814.cms||---

The overall drug sales in the domestic market jumped at Rs 15,662 crore in April as compared to Rs 10,337 crore in the same month last year. “Covid second wave has further boosted the sales of drugs having direct or indirect role in treatment. Companies operating in Covid treatment therapy segments have gained substantially through bumper sales for the month,” the research further added in its monthly update. The industry players, however, also maintained that the growth rate looks higher because the overall sales were very low in April last year on account of the nationwide lockdown in that month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pharma-sales-grow-51-in-april/articleshow/82469811.cms||---

Experts have warned that children and young adults below 18 will be largely impacted during the third wave as it is this age group that is out of the vaccination net. “We had a comprehensive meeting with paediatricians on Thursday and it was decided to form a task force. This expert panel will guide the state in framing treatment guidelines, set up health infrastructure for children,” said Tope. A senior official said that during Thursday’s meeting, which was chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and, it was decided that paediatric ventilators, neo-natal wards and even Covid care centres for children be made available. The state government has issued purchase order for 3 lakh anti-viral remdesivir vials after completing documentation and approvals required. This was part of a global tender called by the state for import of oxygen-related equipment and the injection. Tope onFriday alleged that most pharmaceutical companies were not supplying remdesivir as per the quota allocated by the Centre for the state “The Union government has fixed the quota of remdesivir vials to every state, but most pharmaceutical companies are not supplying vials as per quantity allocated.

---||Goa||Goa: Panchayats, NGOs help home-isolated, but crumbling health system poses challenges||MARGAO: While the state disaster management authority has sought the assistance of panchayats and urban local bodies in monitoring the status of home isolation Covid patients, several of these elected bodies as well as voluntary organisations have been rendering this service ever since the first wave of the pandemic broke out in the state last year. However, with the state’s health infrastructure crumbling this time, the efforts of these groups haven’t been supplemented by institutional support mechanism, thus rendering their efforts that much inadequate in saving more lives, sources actively associated with such voluntary groups told TOI. Former sarpanch of Aquem-Baixo, Siddesh Bhagat said that the panchayat, in association with young volunteers from the village, began the task of providing assistance to home isolated patients since April 2020. “Now during the second wave, we have been advising people to go in for home isolation immediately upon the onset of symptoms, and not to wait for their test results. We make arrangements to collect their test reports and home isolation kits from primary health centers and deliver them to their homes,” Bhagat said. While the state disaster management authority has also asked local bodies to help to provide these patients with ambulance support in case of the need for their hospitalisation arises, voluntary organisations are facing huge problems in making an ambulance available, as also a bed in a hospital. Shortage of oxygen and oxygen regulators in hospitals has exacerbated the problem. “How many patients are you going to put in home isolation when their oxygen levels are dropping and you have neither beds nor oxygen in hospitals,” national member of Red Cross, Dr Jorson Fernandes said. He gave instances of two of his patients in home isolation needing hospitalisation, who got beds only after waiting endlessly outside the hospitals. Ambulances, too, are not readily available at primary health centres to take patients to the hospital. “In one case, I tried to get an ambulance from several health centres, but none was available as all had patients inside on oxygen support,” Bhagat said. Fernandes has helped organise training sessions for youth volunteers for home management of Covid patients. The volunteers are trained in managing patients, even those having comorbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, etc. He, however, suggested that the government rope in medical students to tide over the crisis of shortage of trained medical and para-medical manpower. “The government could very well use its fleet of over 1,500 medical students to monitor patients in home isolation. The students will also be benefitted and will be more than willing to render their services during this pandemic. During the pandemic you have to take everybody onboard,” Fernandes said. Monitoring the health of elderly patients staying alone is another challenge for voluntary organisations. Bhagat said they have been able to overcome the problem by use of video calling to get their oximeter and pulse readings recorded. Bhagat, who is also coordinating with two other neighbouring panchayats, spoke about his plans of setting up a helpline for those in need of assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayats-ngos-help-home-isolated-but-crumbling-health-system-poses-challenges/articleshow/82469819.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The city is currently getting 45 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen supply as against the demand of 60 MT. “Oxygen usage of the hospital is as per the patient’s requirement. The oxygen requirement of a patient on a bed with oxygen will vary from a patient on ICU or ventilator bed. This data on the number of patients on oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds are supposed to be updated by the hospitals every day on HRHeal portal.

---||Delhi||'CT scan useful, but not needed for all Covid cases'||NEW DELHI: Should you get a CT scan done to assess the damage caused by Covid-19 to the lungs? A recent comment by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria stating that one CT scan causes radiation exposure that is equivalent to 300-400 X-rays has raised concern about this. Indian Radiological and Imaging Association (IRIA) was quick to rebut such claims. Modern CT scanners use ultra-low dose CT, which has radiation comparable to only 5-10 X-rays, the association claimed. But the concern about use of CT scan remains. “Most diagnostic centres do not use ultra-low dose CT. It is, therefore, wrong to say radiation exposure caused by a CT scan is equivalent to 5-10 X-rays only,” said a senior radiologist.  “The machine used at our hospital causes radiation exposure of around 2 milliSieverts. An X-ray chest, on the other hand, causes radiation exposure of 0.01 mili Sieverts,” he added. Dr Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said that CT scan was an important diagnostic tool in Covid-19 management but it must be used judiciously. “If a person is confirmed positive for Covid-19, he or she need not undergo a CT scan to assess lung damage. An X-ray is enough for that. We need CT scans in patients who test negative in RT-PCR but have typical disease symptoms. It may also be required in severely ill patients to rule out complications such as pulmonary thromboembolism,” Dr Kumar said. “Currently many patients are being asked by treating physicians to undergo CT scan if they have fever or cough for more than five to seven days. This is totally avoidable,” he said. At Apollo hospital, doctors said they have started using high resolution MRI of lungs as a radiation-free alternative to CT scans in patients with Covid-19. “It is a little more expensive but in case of MRI, the risk of radiation exposure is almost nil,” said a doctor. Covid-19 is a systemic disease that affects multiple organs but the most affected organ is the lung. Nearly 85% of patients suffering from Covid-19 have mild symptoms. They don’t need aggressive treatment or tests such as CT scan or MRI to monitor the disease progress. Dr Guleria said CT scans were useful indeed in select cases but he was voicing his concern against overuse of the diagnostic tool. “The UN data also shows that one CT scan causes radiation exposure of seven milliSieverts. The US FDA states the same,” said the AIIMS director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ct-scan-useful-but-not-needed-for-all-covid-cases/articleshow/82469822.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The organisation said that in the past six days, they have received about 1,100 calls and they could help 170 people. Of 170, they assisted 100 people in finding a hospital bed, 25 with online consultation, and remaining with plasma, and financial help, among others. “I was moved by the plight of the people,” said Kalam Vamshi, who is behind Little Hands Organisation in Telangana, adding that there are resources somewhere, and people are struggling to find them in other parts of the city or state. “We wanted to bridge the gap with the help of our rapid response team,” he said. Vamshi said he is producing two movies under his production house, and has decided to take a break, along with some of the team members, to help people. He said his friend Phani Raj Patimeeda is the founder of Little Hands Organisation, which is working to create awareness about girl child hygiene and rural primary education in Andhra Pradesh. “During the first wave, they started helping people with Covid-19 related issues. I wanted to do the same in Telangana, and decided to do it under the same banner,” said the 34-year-old adding that they is a need for more volunteers. Phani said that since past few days there have been close to 800 requests for oxygen, which are pending. “Most calls we receive are for oxygen supported bed in a hospital or for an oxygen cylinder. Our 40 member-volunteer team across the world is working round the clock collecting data, digging, verifying it and finally passing it on to the needy,” he said. Koushik B, one of the volunteers, said that while they are able to close some requests in hours, some are taking days together. “Last night, we could close 20 requests — financial help, counselling. But, there requests which are pending from past three days,” he said. “Both my mother and father tested positive for Covid-19, and there is no one to look after them as I stay in Karimnagar and they stay in Warangal. We are all scared, especially my parents. That’s when I decided to get my parents counselled and approached Little Hands Organisation. They provided counselling at free of cost,” said K Ramya, adding that her father is slightly more confident after counselling session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/flooded-with-calls-for-help-every-day-this-team-of-volunteers-is-up-to-the-task/articleshow/82469824.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

An IAS officer with a BTech (electronics), two engineers from National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, and eight ITI students installed an oxygen generation plant at Jawaharlal Nehru Government Medical College in Chamba district this week, after the company which was supposed to install the equiment said it would take a month to send engineers. Chamba SDM Shivam Pratap Singh, a 2017-batch IAS officer who brought the team together, took the initiative of installing the plant in view of the dire need for oxygen in the district. The plant, which became operational on Friday, would now meet a majority of the district’s demand for the lifesaving gas. The samples of the oxygen gerated by the plant have been checked, said the SDM. Shivam Partap said the plant machinery had arrived in the district over a month-and-a-half ago, but it couldn’t be installed for want of engineers. “Due to a high demand for engineers from across the nation for installing oxygen plants, the private company which was to set up the plant in the medical college expressed inability to send engineers early,” he said, adding that according to the company, the engineers could come only after a month. Shivam, a Btech from Pantnagar University, said it was he who decided to install the plant with the help of local engineers. The plant was among the seven oxygen plants sactioned by the central government for Himachal Pradesh, one each in Chamba, Mandi, Dharamshala, Shimla, Tanda, Hamirpur, and Nahan .Oxygen production has started in Dharamshala, Mandi, and Shimla plants, whereas the remaining plants remain unfunctional. On Friday, the plant in Chamba became operational. “Since there was no point in wasting the time. I knew my engineering background could help me install the plant, so we arranged two engineers from National Hydroelectric Power Corporation and eight ITI students. Together, we successfully installed the plant going through the instructions,” said Shivam. As there was a need to check the sample of oxygen produced by the plant, the Chamba administration contacted the private company, which sent an engineer for the job. Shivam said the plant would generate oxygen for 80 cylinders every day as against a demand of 120 oxygen cylinders which are refilled in neighboring Mandi and Kangra districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chamba-sdm-ropes-in-2-nhpc-techies-8-iti-students-to-get-atmanirbhar/articleshow/82469826.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Pawar said that hotels and permit rooms must be granted four instalments to pay excise duty. “They should be given concession in electricity bills and property taxes too,” Pawar said. He also asked the state government to draft a scheme, Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme, prepared by the Centre. “Recently, the Centre extended the scheme till June 30, 2021,” he said. Pawar said that in the wake of the second wave, the state had to further extend prohibitory orders which has had an adverse impact on the hospitality industry in a big way. “Quite a large number of small and medium business are facing closure. In such circumstances, it is essential to grant relief and concessions to these sectors,” Pawar said. —Prafulla Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hospitality-sector-needs-govt-relief-in-mumbai-pawar-to-cm/articleshow/82469828.cms||---

They were arrested. Customs said a high alert was declared at the airport based on information and inputs from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) that narcotic drugs from African countries was likely to be smuggled into India. A couple, who arrived on a Qatar Airways flight (QR 528) from Johannesburg via Doha, was intercepted at the exit on suspicion of carrying narcotics. When questioned, they appeared nervous and gave evasive replies. They were identified as Deborah Eliah, 46, and Felix Obadia, 45. They were carrying two stroller bags each as their check-in baggage. When the baggage was examined, it was found that there was a false bottom in which plastic packets were concealed. In each bag, five plastic packets containing a white coarse powder were found. The packets were sprinkled with some spicy powder to camouflage the odour. The powder tested positive for heroin. It was seized under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, read with the Customs Act. On questioning, it was found that Eliah was travelling to India for medical treatment in a super speciality hospital in Bengaluru along with her attendant Felix. They were travelling on a visa granted to them on the basis of communication from the hospital. As they could not get a direct flight to Bengaluru, they had landed in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-100cr-heroin-seized-at-city-airport-2-held/articleshow/82469829.cms||---

A consignment of oxygen from Vizag is due to reach the city around midnight through oxygen express,” said Singh. “I have also been assured that the oxygen express will keep on delivering oxygen to Ghaziabad every two days,” he added.Singh also said the district hospital is now equipped with oxygen concentrators. “Five oxygen concentrators of 20 litre capacity have been procured, which can be used by 10 to 20 patients at one go,” said Singh. “An oxygen plant will be set up at GS hospital in Dhaulana. The formalities have been completed,” he added.Singh also issued a warning to private hospitals for turning away patients due to “so-called” lack of oxygen. “There is ample supply of oxygen and if it is used in a judicious manner, there will be no shortage as the administration over the past few days has taken a number of measures to ensure steady supply of oxygen,” Singh said, adding stringent action would also be taken against people hoarding cylinders and medicines.Private hospitals, especially the smaller ones, have been among the worst-hit due to the demand-supply gap. Over the past fortnight, several of them sent out SOSs to the administration with their oxygen stocks close to running out.Municipal commissioner Mahendra Singh Tawar said against daily demand of 83 tonnes, Ghaziabad was getting only around 56 tonnes. “We are getting about 25 tonnes from Inox and 25 tonnes from Goyal Gases and an average 300 cylinders per day from BHEL in Haridwar,” said Tawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/big-supply-deficit-in-gzb-vk-says-oxygen-trains-to-bridge-gap/articleshow/82469832.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cops urged to avoid arrests in petty crimes||Pune: Maharashtra’s additional director general (prisons) Sunil Ramanand has requested the state director general of police (DGP) to issue instructions to police personnel across the state to only arrest criminals involved in serious offences and not those involved in petty crimes, in a bid to decongest jails in the state due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. Speaking to TOI, Ramanand said he sent a letter on May 3, to the DGP and the additional director general of police (law and order) seeking their help to decongest 60 prisons in the state during the present Covid crisis. Ramanand said the number of jail inmates in Maharashtra has gone up to 35,000 presently from 26,000 in July last year. “If criminals are arrested in petty crimes, like prohibition, gambling and disobedience, and lodged in jails, it becomes difficult for them to secure bail from the courts. I have requested the DGP to direct all police stations in the state to exercise their discretion while arresting criminals in cases like murder, rape, robbery and dacoity, but refrain from making arrests in bailable offences,” Ramanand said. “In the current pandemic scenario, it is not possible for us to lodge a large number of criminals in jails. We will allow criminals in all types of cases to be lodged in jails after the situation becomes normal,” Ramanand added. Additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh told TOI, “We will arrest criminals only when it is essential and permissible under section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if we need to arrest criminals in important cases, we then cannot think of bypassing the due process of law.” Singh said, “Most criminals arrested in various cases are getting bail from the magisterial courts on completion of their custodial remand because of the pandemic.” Prisons officials say the Bombay HC has issued a number of directions for decongesting jails. While 47 jails are overcrowded, 23 have inmates below their capacity. State jails have 34,747 inmates as against the total capacity of 24,097. This means the jails are 144% full presently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cops-urged-to-avoid-arrests-in-petty-crimes/articleshow/82469831.cms||Asseem Shaikh

DMRC received a loan from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) recently and it has come as a boost for the Phase IV project. “Three major tenders of DMRC Phase IV’s underground sections have been recently floated. These are all being funded by the loan received through JICA. All the three tenders floated so far are for the Aerocity–Tughlaqabad Metro corridor,” a DMRC spokesperson said. The spokesperson said that the loan agreement between the Government of India and JICA for sanction of loan for Delhi Metro’s Phase IV expansion was signed in March this year. “The amount sanctioned is Japanese Yen 1,19,978 million, which is equivalent to Rs. 8,390 crore approximately,” he said. Out of the three approved corridors of Phase IV, work had first started on the longest corridor between Janakpuri West and RK Ashram Marg in 2019. Last year, DMRC shifted its focus completely to the smallest corridor—the 12.6 km long Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor.  Work, however, has also been going on at the elevated section of the Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor, which features DMRC’s first double decker viaduct, which will have a 2.5 km long section between Ambedkar Nagar and Saket G Block stations with a road flyover on lower deck and metro viaduct on the upper deck. The three new tenders floated by DMRC include a tender for construction of underground stations at Aerocity, Mahipalpur, Vasant Kunj and Kishangarh along with a tunnel through Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). The total length of this section is about 6.1 km and the tender will be opened on June 1 this year, the spokesperson said. The second tender is for the construction of Chattarpur, Chattarpur Mandir, IGNOU and Neb Sarai stations, along with tunnelling through TBM. The total length of this section is about 6.5 km and the tender will be opened on June 22 this year, he said. The last tender is for a tunnel from Sangam Vihar to Sarita Vihar depot with construction of stations at Maa Anandmayee Marg, Tughlaqabad Railway Colony and Tughlaqabad. The total length of this section is about 4.2 km and this tender too will be opened on June 22. The Aerocity–Tughlaqabad corridor of Metro Phase IV is 23.6 km long with 15 stations. “Work is already in progress on the elevated section between Sangam Vihar and Saket G Block, comprising four elevated stations, which are Sangam Vihar, Khanpur, Ambedkar Nagar and Saket G Block,” the spokesperson said. “DMRC is currently engaged in carrying out construction on three priority corridors that have been approved as part of Phase IV, comprising 65.1 km with 46 stations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-on-underground-section-of-metros-silver-line-to-begin-soon/articleshow/82469843.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lending a hand to workers who ensure dignity to dead||NEW DELHI: Workers at several Delhi’s crematoria have been working day and night ever since the number of fatalities due to Covid-19 started surging in April. To assist crematorium workers reeling under lack of resources and essential equipment, a group of young professionals has decided to join hands to collect and personally hand over PPE kits, masks, gloves, sanitisers, etc to them. Jitender Singh Shunty of Bhagat Singh Seva Dal, which is conducting funerals at the Seemapuri cremation ground, said that they were facing a lot of problems for want of necessary materials and equipment. “There is a shortage of masks, sanitisers, PPE kits and body bags that we require to bring bodies from homes. We try to either procure these things on our own or we get help from NGOs and individuals,” he explained. Good Food Project was launched by a group of professionals and entrepreneurs a week ago to provide food to the poor and homeless who were hit hard by the current crisis. Now, the team has started a fundraiser to assist workers at the cremation grounds of Delhi with other Covid-essentials too. Shray Gupta, an entrepreneur and a member of the group, said, “We have around 100 people currently with many going to the ground and some others verifying information on the requirements. We were initially providing only food to people. We later realised that ambulance drivers and cremation workers were also struggling to deal with the crisis. So we decided to help them in every possible manner.” “We plan to provide them more PPE kits, disinfectant sprays, sanitisers, etc. We also distribute ORS solutions as the workers get dehydrated by the end of the day. Many of them complain that they do not get paid well and that they do not get the items/facilities required for their job,” said the group member. Gupta said that they were making a list of all the problems being faced by cremation workers. The group claims to be assisting 21 cremation grounds and graveyards currently and has reached out to around 600 people with the aid over the past one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lending-a-hand-to-workers-who-ensure-dignity-to-dead/articleshow/82469852.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Doctors Risk All To Keep Covid Fight Alive||Working under the toughest condition and fighting to save critical ICU patients, is the battle for ICU doctors and their colleagues, who takes many risks. Exposing themselves to heavy viral load in the wards, these Covid warriors have seen more deaths in one year than in their entire career in ICU wards, ever since the pandemic broke last year. Sharing their journey with Sribala Vadlapatla, three experienced intensivists said the choice for them is only one — saving a life at all costs. Dr Kiran Madala, associate professor, Nizamabad Government General Hospital My mother called me on Thursday informing about the death of my medicine co-student and friend, who was infected with Covid- 19. I felt disheartened by the news, because as ICU team members, we are better enabled to treat the patients than in the first wave. For most ICU doctors, the battle is tiresome as much as it is for patients. It is an emotional roller-coaster for us. But everything is not so grim, we saved a 38-old year patient in ICU in the first wave, getting all the steroids and he was in hospital for more than 20 days. Each patient either recovered or the ones who eventually died fought for 10 days. Their eyes haunt us. What we have noticed that the care and attention from families helps. We have observed that ICU patients who know that their families are by their side, recover quickly.” Dr Y Sridhar, critical care consultant, Apollo hospitals We might be working in ICU for a long time, it is becoming scary for us to tell families about the condition of patients when they are extremely critical and personally I hate to break the news. I still remember a recent experience where the man who was raising his child as a single parent died after getting infected. Now the child has no parents. At personal level I had to face the critical situation as one of my family member was infected twice but recovered well, The ICU doctors team and staff is not just about deaths, it’s about people getting their lives back. In a recent case, we saved a 35-year-old female patient after long battle where her lungs were severely damaged. He cautioned that patients who come up to ICU level are those who just deny that fact they can also get infected, and then they become critical. Dr Durga Padmaja, ICU in charge NIMS, professor and HoD (anaesthesia) Taking care of a Covid-19 patient at times is like walking in the dark and searching for light. This feeling is common for everyone working in ICU wards, right from residents to doctors to medical staff. Each patient has a life story and ICT teams don’t want that story to end abruptly. The agony of all families who lost their member is same but when I see the grief in the eyes of our own staff that lost their family members is depressing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doctors-risk-all-to-keep-covid-fight-alive/articleshow/82469859.cms||---

Ever since vaccinations opened for the 18+ category on May 1, she had been trying to register herself. It was the nearest option that she could find. “I kept trying to book a slot, and one day around 1.30 am, I found one spot at Ranila. I immediately booked it. The place was 100 km away. So, I had to travel 200km to get the jab and return,” said Sonam (35). Sonam and her husband Sunny Singhal drove to Ranila this Thursday. “I am relieved that I got at least one dose. Today (Friday), I heard about deaths in my family and friend circles. Some of those who passed away were young and otherwise healthy. It is very disturbing and makes you think that it can happen to you as well,” she said. Her slot was at 9am and they reached around 9.15 am. She said the vaccination centre was well-managed and not crowded. “There were 10 other people at the centre. Initially, I was apprehensive about the primary health centre. But it was a good experience since the place was clean, there were three nurses who were trained to administer the vaccine, and they had a vaccination room and an observation room. They had a separate room for women,” said Sonam. After the vaccination, they drove to Faridabad for her husband’s shot – Sunny had found a slot there – before returning home. She had mild fever on Friday. Like the couple, others too have been travelling long distances for their vaccine shots because of the limited number of vaccines in circulation and slots getting filled in the blink of an eyelid. Some have tweeted, saying they travelled to Delhi because no slots were available in Gurugram. Others said they had to go to centres in Faridabad and Nuh. Gurugram resident Sunil Amar said he will be going to Delhi on Saturday to get his second dose. He wanted to get the jab at a private facility but most centres did not have a slot or the vaccine he had taken, he said. For the second dose in the 45+ category, a fresh registration is not required. “I tried getting a slot in Gurugram for about 10 days but had no luck. I will be going to Malviya Nagar on Saturday. I got the first jab (Covishield) at Fortis Hospital, Gurugram. After that, I kept asking them about the second dose. I tried other private hospitals too but did not get a slot. I would have preferred to stay in Gurugram and get vaccinated, but now, I will be getting the shot at a government centre in Delhi,” Amar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-slots-near-home-100km-drive-for-vaccine/articleshow/82469862.cms||Vishakha Chaman

This comes after complaints of mismatch in rates for treating Covid patients came to the fore. Officials said that a committee of four doctors will be constituted to look into the grievances of the residents. They said that as the treatment line is more or less the same for Covid, hospitals found to be fleecing patients will be penalised or asked to correct the bill after being issued a warning. Sharing details, district magistrate Suhas LY said work is on to cover this front. “The rates have been fixed by the Central government for Covid-19 treatment. VK Paul Committee had fixed the charges for private hospitals. Following the recommendation of the committee, the state government had also fixed the charges and circulated guidelines to the managements of private hospitals. We will intensify the monitoring process and keep an eye on the bills being generated by private hospitals,” said Suhas. To handle the grievances and complaints coming in from Noida and Greater Noida, the administration and health department has launched a helpline. A WhatsApp number (9354357073) has been issued by the administation, and complainants can forward their details to this number, added officials. Aadhaar card of the patient, bills, prescription, clinical diagnosis, treatment chart and file of the patient will have to be submitted. After preliminary inquiry, the committee will decide whether the matter needs further probe and summon records from the hospital directly. “We have got complaints from eight residents over the past 48 hours about overcharging by private hospitals. The dossier has been forwarded to the administration for further action. We had asked the administration to standarise the rates of the private hospitals,” said Yogendra Sharma, chief of federation of residents’ welfare associations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/panel-to-look-at-complaints-of-private-hospitals-overcharging-penalise-them/articleshow/82469869.cms||Shalabh

Health minister Satyendar Jain has announced that the facility, which is about to be completed, will be used to set up a 500-bed Covid hospital. “Visited the under-construction Indira Gandhi Hospital, Dwarka. To augment medical resources, optimum utilisation of space is being done. A 500 oxygen-bedded centre will be set up here by next week,” Jain tweeted. The petition on change.org supported by residents welfare associations and citizen groups like Dwarka Forum and Seniors’ Hub Dwarka has received 7,277 signatures. “As for Dwarka is concerned, there is not a single government hospital that can accommodate the public except one under-construction 1,725-bed hospital in Sector 9. This hospital was promised to be made functional in 2020 but is not made so far... It will be of great help if you could plug the loophole,” the petition addressed to the LG and the CM states. Meanwhile, religious organisation Iskcon has helped set up a 200-bed Covid Care Centre along with a skill training company, Bada Business, in a Dwarka college. “Efforts are being made to expand it to 500 beds. The team is working to create ICU and ventilator facilities operational in the next few days,” a company official said. The facility has a dedicated team of 10 doctors and 18 nurses. “A Few medical facilitators are contributing resources to strengthen the initiative.” “Patients with oxygen levels up to 88 will be treated here. The team has tied up with Janakpuri Super Specialty Hospital to handle critical patients. To ensure safety of medical staff, a centralised monitoring system is being used for the patients,” Dr Vivek Bindra, CEO of the company, said. “We hope more corporates will come forward to support such initiatives. Iskcon is already engaged in delivering free and hygienic food to Covid patients,” said an Iskcon official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dwarka-may-get-govt-covid-hosp-by-next-week/articleshow/82469870.cms||---
---||India||SC to Centre: Ensure 700MT O2 for Delhi, or face coercive action||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asserted that the Centre has to ensure supply of 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi on a daily basis until further directions from the court, and made it clear it will not be shy of taking coercive action in case of non-compliance of its order. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said its order to allocate 700 MT oxygen was not for one day and supply of that level had to be maintained on a daily basis. "We want 700 MT to be supplied to Delhi on a daily basis. It is not that our order was for supply of 700 MT only for a day but it is for everyday," the bench said when the Delhi government's counsel, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, told the bench that Delhi received 537 MT oxygen till midnight and another 89 MT till 9am on Friday. Taking note of his submission, the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, "Please do not drive us to a situation when we have to take coercive action. We want 700 MT not only for a day but everyday. We mean business and you have to supply 700 MT." While staying contempt proceedings initiated by the Delhi High Court against the Centre and its senior bureaucrats over supply of medical oxygen to Delhi, the apex court on Wednesday directed the Centre to ensure supply of 700 MT of oxygen to the city. Agreeing with the Centre's submission that the issue required a pan-India approach and no state should be supplied oxygen from the share allocated to others, the bench had said, "However, the ground situation in Delhi, where people are running from hospital to hospital to find an oxygen bed, has to be addressed. And we have already passed an order asking the Centre to maintain supply of 700 MT of oxygen till May 10, when we will review the requirement after hearing all sides."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-to-centre-ensure-700mt-o2-for-delhi-or-face-coercive-action/articleshow/82469818.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Chennai||M K Stalin’s Day 1: Rs 4,000 dole, free ride for women, cheaper milk in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: DMK president M K Stalin, who was sworn in as chief minister of Tamil Nadu by governor Banwarilal Purohit on Friday, began his tenure by ordering Rs 4,000 Covid-19 relief to 2.07 crore families, slashing of Aavin milk price by Rs 3 per litre from May 16, and free bus ride for women passengers — all poll promises made by the DMK in the run-up to the assembly election. The relief amount, which entails an expenditure of Rs 4,153.39 crore to the exchequer, will be paid in two installments and the first tranche of Rs 2,000 will be issued to PDS rice card holders in May, a release said. All expenses for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals will be borne by the state under chief minister health insurance scheme, an order issued by the CM said, without going into the details of the scheme. All treatments, including Covid-19, are already covered under the state’s free health insurance scheme. An annual subsidy Rs 1,200 crore will be paid to state transport corporations to compensate for the revenue loss for allowing women across TN to travel without tickets in ordinary service (white board) town buses. The state transport corporations earn an annual revenue of Rs 3,000 crore. “As per Census 2011, women’s work participation rate stands at 31.8% in the state in comparison to men’s work participation rate of 59.3%. There is a need to improve the participation rate of women to ensure that they could extend contribution for economic growth,” another order said, explaining the rationale behind the decision. Keeping with his poll promise to redress public grievances in 100 days, Stalin ordered constitution of a department to implement “chief minister in your constituency” scheme. A senior IAS officer will head the department. Earlier, the chief minister was given a guard of honour at the Tamil Nadu secretariat. On his return from the Raj Bhavan, Stalin visited his mother Dayalu Ammal at Gopalapuram residence and Rajathi Ammal at Alwarpet residence. He also visited the memorials of former chief ministers C N Annadurai and M Karunanidhi and paid floral tributes to them. He later visited Periyar Thidal at Vepery and paid his respects at the memorial of social reformer Periyar E V Ramasamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalins-day-1-rs-4000-dole-free-ride-for-women-cheaper-milk/articleshow/82469872.cms||---

---||Noida||Police warn residents hit by Covid-19 of online fraudsters||Noida/Ghaziabad: In a desperate search for the Remdevisir injection for his ailing relative in Ghaziabad, Noida (extension) resident Raghu Singh recently put out an SOS message on social media. Raghu heaved a sigh of relief when someone reached out to him, promising to arrange the jab that is used to treat Covid patients. In advance, he transferred Rs 10,000 through a digital wallet but two vials of the drug never came. Last Saturday, Harshita Sambhu, a nurse at a private hospital, transferred Rs 6,000 as a token amount towards the delivery of an oxygen cylinder for a relative in Noida, but soon realised that she was duped. Harshita got the number of the fraudster, who identified himself as an oxygen cylinder agent, from social media. She lodged a complaint at the Expressway police station. Flooded with complaints of cases of fraud amid a surge in Covid patients in the district, the Noida police have warned residents against fraudsters offering help, including for a hospital bed and a life-saving drug or registration for Covid-19 vaccination. Cops say fraudsters are using details put out on social media by frantic relatives to dupe them in different ways. According to Noida police’s cyber cell officials, fraudsters are innovating ways to dupe distressed residents. They are gaining trust of their potential targets by floating websites and asking people to upload details, including Aadhaar number and email ID, for an oxygen cylinder or registration for vaccination. In some cases, fraudsters are contacting people and asking them to pay them a token amount as advance through a digital wallet and WhatsApp a doctor’s prescription and the patient’s Aadhaar card for a life-saving drug. Ankur Aggarwal, additional DCP (central Noida), who is also the head of the cyber cell, said that people should take numbers of hospitals from genuine websites. “Fraudsters are floating websites of medical facilities to dupe people. Don’t pay any advance to anyone. Also, never share any OTP with anyone.” Ghaziabad cops have also received similar complaints in the past 10 days. As many as 17 people in Ghaziabad, including some doctors, were recently duped of a total of Rs 11 lakh by a resident of Mumbai in the name of providing oxygen concentrators. Dr AK Chaudhary, who runs a clinic at Vijay Nagar, lodged a complaint in this regard. He told cops that the accused sent him a WhatsApp message about the availability of oxygen concentrators. Dr Chaudhary paid Rs 40,000 in advance to get two small units, but the same never arrived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/police-warn-residents-hit-by-covid-19-of-online-fraudsters/articleshow/82469902.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Gurgaon||Ex- Congress man sold oxygen cylinders in black market, held||Gurgaon: The crime branch of Faridabad police arrested a former Congress worker, who had earlier contested assembly election as an independent, for allegedly selling oxygen cylinders in black market on Friday. A police team seized around 50 oxygen cylinders from his home at Indra Complex in Faridabad. Bijender Mawi is president of Sarva Samaj Ekta Manch. He contested the assembly election in 2014 from Tigao constituency as an independent. Earlier, he was associated with Congress and had held the post of chairman of the sports cell of district Congress of Faridabad. Inspector Pradeep Mor, in-charge of the crime unit of sector 17 of Faridabad, said that they received information on oxygen cylinders being sold by the accused at an exorbitant rate. Acting on the tip-off, they raided the house of Mawi in Indra Complex and found 50 oxygen cylinders loaded in a mini truck. Of these, eight oxygen cylinders were filled, while 42 were empty. “He was selling these cylinders for a rate between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000 each,” said the officer. He had no permission to procure and sell oxygen cylinders. A case was registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal investigation) of IPC and section of Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940, Essential Commodities Act 1955 and Disaster Management Act 2005 in Faridabad. “We are trying to find out how he got these cylinders and who has bought oxygen cylinders from him till now,” Mor said. The initial investigation revealed that Mawi earlier used to supply oxygen cylinders to private companies. When the pandemic started, he started to supply oxygen cylinders to private hospitals. He used to fill the oxygen cylinders from different agencies in Faridabad and supply them to private hospitals. While supplying oxygen cylinders to private hospitals, he used to take out some oxygen from each cylinder and refill empty ones for selling to desperate buyers at exorbitant prices. “The investigation is under way,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ex-congress-man-sold-oxygen-cylinders-in-black-market-held/articleshow/82469908.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Time to augment quality of education through academic audit & assessment||Of all the factors upon which depends the success of the Indian desire to join the league of developed nations, the quality of higher education ranks at numero uno. Call to raise Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education also takes cognizance of unemployability as pointed out in several reports and by many policy makers of the country. The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) proposed the need to revamp education that would address both employment and employability. In view of the national goals of the country, NEP 2020 has formally brought in the role of academic audit. There is an increasing interest in providing accountability mechanism to help higher educational institutions (HEIs) to independently assess the quality of their academics, augment the teaching-learning process and promote GER. As a method, academic audit was first developed in the United Kingdom for the purpose of addressing the issues of quality enhancement of academics with the goal of identifying the gaps and bridging them for effective teaching and learning outcomes. This concept attains greater significance as NEP 2020 contemplated greater autonomy and performance-based system for HEIs in India. The rationale for conducting academic audit in HEIs lies in the comprehensive evaluation of academic systems, structure, and alignment of various components with goals for academic excellence that impacts the outcomes. It is, therefore, important to have a clear comprehension of assessment methods, tools, and techniques to develop its implementation mechanisms. Especially for colleges, NEP 2020 suggests a stage-wise mechanism to attain minimum benchmarks for accreditation to become autonomous colleges and be made free from the affiliation process. In light of this, implementation of academic audit has become inevitable. Academic audit fundamentally aims to assess attainment of goals set by the institution by emphasising not only on ‘What’ but equally on ‘How’. It incorporates evaluation of operations and measurement of indicators to prepare the institution for required changes. Academic audit appraises the quality of academics by a process of self-evaluation carried out by the institution. An external evaluator is also involved to ensure objectivity and precision. The process registers the entire range of academic work performed by the institution during a specified duration including in-class and off-class activity, mentoring activities, teaching-learning process, learning support system, learning outcomes, student satisfaction, research output and other such indicators. For objectivity of the findings, metrics are used to capture and communicate the effectiveness of teaching and learning. From the perspective of the implementing body, the academic audit of the HEI can provide many learning points, which can be strategically used to improve the quality of education. But its implementation throws up certain challenges as well. Many HEIs may initially be wary of academic audit, seeing it as an act of inspection rather than facilitation. Misconstruing the concept of handholding as an act of harassment is the biggest issue to be addressed by the conducting body. The remedy lies in communicating the conceptual contours leading to candid consultation. Sensitivity in conducting, appreciation of the premise of independent existence of the institution and the stage of its learning curve are other essentials of successful implementation of academic audit. Audit processes need to be objectively assessed and analysed, particularly the interaction between quality assurance practices and behaviours. This further underlines the importance of implementation of audit protocols. The measures encourage fairness by identifying gap between procedural and distributive justice in formation and implementation of policies. Further, it helps to determine best practice that can establish benchmark for other colleges. The audit follow-up activities should include consistent communication and concerted cooperation between the conducting and conducted HEIs in designing implementation plans for various quality enhancement initiatives. Further, challenges posed by Covid-19 make it imperative for colleges to leverage on digital technologies for teaching-learning. NEP 2020 also recommends initiatives to integrate education with on-line teaching, digital infrastructure and support facilities, along with capacity building for teachers for blended learning. To infuse these changes, HEIs need to value academic audit as a diagnostic tool for identifying the areas that altered and evolved to accomplish the goals of NEP 2020.  In view of the clear policy directive and the unequivocal conclusion of literature, academic audit may prove to be a potent tool to address the issue hence voluntary subjecting of all HEIs should be pondered over.

---||Goa||Goa: 15-day strict curfew in Goa from May 9, essentials to be available||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday announced a 15-day state-level curfew from Sunday to May 23. During these days, shops selling essential commodities will be open from 7am to 1pm (as against the earlier order of 7am to 7pm). Also, tourists and others wishing to visit Goa would have to produce a negative RT-PCR test report or vaccination certificate. “The state-level curfew shall be more strict than lockdown. On May 24, the government will decide whether to extend it or not,” Sawant said. He said the decision to impose strict curfew was taken considering the sentiments of all sections of society, the rise in Covid cases, and the increasing pressure on the medical fraternity. “I appeal to the people of the state to break the chain of Covid-19,” Sawant said. He asked people not to resort to panic-buying. “Essential shops, including those selling grocery items, will be allowed to open from 7am to 1pm,” he said. “Takeaway kitchens will be open from 7am to 7pm to supply food to needy people. There will be no restrictions on medical supplies,” Sawant said. The chief minister said the state would not issue permissions for weddings and other functions, and police would act against those loitering unnecessarily. “Over the past couple of days, it has come to my knowledge that even after the bride and groom were Covid-positive, they have gone ahead with their wedding, and those who attended turned Covid-positive. Considering this, we have decided not to issue permissions. People should cancel any functions that are scheduled from Saturday,” he said. The government’s move to mandate RT-PCR certificates for those visiting Goa comes a day after the high court directed the state to make Covid-negative certificate mandatory from Monday for all those entering Goa. The chief minister said the state government has started preparing for the third wave, and infrastructure would be created as per the guidelines of the Centre. “At least now, people should stay indoors,” he said. The chief minister said detailed orders about the curfew would be issued on Saturday at around 4pm. “Despite appealing to the people not to move out of their houses, they move out unnecessarily. On an average, hardly 25% of the people need to regularly move out of their house. There is no need for people who are 60 years and above to move out of the house. Educational institutes have been shut for those who are less than 24, and they can stay at home,” he said. Sawant said they have found that persons in those age groups are unnecessarily moving out of their houses. “Among those 45-60, only around 50% of them have to move out of the house for work,” he said. Referring to the death audit report, Sawant said over 96% of those who died of Covid hadn’t taken the first dose of the vaccine. “Most deaths are of those who died within 24 hours of hospitalisation, those brought dead, and those with complication,” he said, adding that doctors, nurses and healthcare employees won’t be stopped during the curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/15-day-strict-curfew-in-goa-from-may-9-essentials-to-be-available/articleshow/82469926.cms||---
---||Noida||Now, oxygen cylinders for patients in outer areas too||Noida: After Noida and Greater Noida, supply and refilling of oxygen for home isolation patients have also been streamlined for the outer parts of Gautam Budh Nagar. On Friday, the district administration directed the Nagar Palika of Dadri and the Nagar Panchayat of Jewar to arrange oxygen cylinders for residents. The residents will be provided with refilled cylinders in exchange for empty ones by the respective authority. In return for the refilled cylinder, people taking the life-saving gas will have to provide a copy of the Aadhaar card, prescription of the doctor, oxygen saturation level and Covid test reports. Charges for the oxygen cylinders have also been fixed. While small refilled cylinders will be provided at a price of Rs 200, the loaded jumbo oxygen cylinder will be available for Rs 500. A site will also be earmarked at five locations where empty cylinders can be dropped and refilled cylinders can be collected. For refilling oxygen cylinders, the development authorities in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway had earlier been asked to evolve a mechanism to provide refilled cylinders to serious patients in home isolation. These are in place already. Meanwhile, the administration announced on Friday that a new oxygen plant with a capacity of generating 8.5 tonne of Oxyegn has been set up at Noida Covid Hospital. The number of beds will also be increased to 400 from the existing 240 at the hospital in the next 48 hours, officials said. This was after private players came forward to help the administration during the ongoing Covid-19 battle. Besides, through CSR funds, corporates have agreed to provide more resources to the health department. IT giant HCL and Kent Ro Systems have started work on setting up oxygen plants at GB Nagar hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/now-oxygen-cylinders-for-patients-in-outer-areas-too/articleshow/82469933.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sitar exponent Prateek dies of Covid-19 within a week of father Debu’s demise||New Delhi: After announcing the death of his father, renowned sitar player Pandit Devabrata ‘Debu’ Chaudhuri, due to Covid-19 on his Facebook page last Saturday, 49-year-old Prateek Chaudhuri, also a famed sitar exponent, himself succumbed to the coronavirus on Thursday. The professor at Delhi University’s department of music and faculty sciences is survived by his wife and children, a son and daughter. He was from the Senia gharana of music. Both father and son had been undergoing treatment at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital. Last Saturday, the son had revealed on Facebook that his father, admitted to hospital with Covid and dementia complications, had been put on a ventilator around midnight of May 1, but had suffered a heart attack and couldn’t be resuscitated. The announcement of the son’s passing was posted on social media by music historian Pavan Jha. He wrote, “And the bad news is not stopping. Prateek Chaudhuri, promising talent and son of legendary Debu Chaudhuri, is no more. Was struggling hard in ICU. He was improving his health after being admitted to GTB with Debu ji and was to be discharged from the hospital on Monday when I last spoke to him. He was totally distressed and broken by the death of his father.” Deepti Bhalla, dean of the music department, said it was a personal loss for her. “I have known Panditji since I was five as my mother was his colleague. From knowing Prateek, we then became colleagues,” Bhalla told TOI. “He was an asset to the department. Apart from academics, he was also the torch bearer of culture. He always encouraged students to participate in programmes and performances because he was certain that academics and musical performances could go together.” Bhalla also disclosed that Prateek was working with her to set up a music studio in the department. It would have been ready by the end of this year. “The studio was initiated by his father 35-40 years ago. Prateek had almost ventured into setting it up but due to financial constraints, he could not go ahead with the project,” the dean said. “Around a couple of months ago, we finally got a confirmation from the university. Prateek was the propeller of the whole project, he was the one had received the numerous inputs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sitar-exponent-prateek-dies-of-covid-19-within-a-week-of-father-debus-demise/articleshow/82469947.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||Goa Medical College's Covid wards run out of space, patients now treated in corridors too||PANAJI: Even as the state government keeps adding beds and wards as fresh Covid-19 cases reach new highs everyday, Goa’s state medical infrastructure continues to struggle with the onslaught of the virus. Not only has Goa Medical College (GMC) run out of beds and trolleys, it has now run out of space in wards, forcing doctors to treat patients in corridors. Officials say that it takes at least four to eight hours for patient seeking hospitalisation to be admitted. Doctors, who are forced to rush through the mandatory triage process, now feel like they’re fighting a losing battle against the pandemic. Doctors and patients at GMC say that despite oxygen production being ramped up, the supply is just not enough. While chief minister Pramod Sawant insists that the oxygen supply is sufficient, nurses and patients said that the reliance on oxygen cylinders continues. “The infrastructure just cannot keep up with the fresh cases coming in,” said a frustrated GMC doctor. On Friday itself, 296 patients were hospitalised in the state. Photos shared by patients with TOI show women and men lying on stretchers, trolleys and wheelchairs outside wards and in corridors, hooked on to oxygen cylinders or IV lines attached to the central oxygen pipeline. Sources also said that with the extreme shortage of healthcare staff, some nurses have informally recruited volunteers and relatives to monitor or switch IV lines and oxygen supplies. “Wards are always full. There are patients in corridors, and we are constantly making more beds,” said another doctor who has been posted in one of the Covid wards. The GMC’s superspecialty block was commissioned on May 5, but the actual process of shifting patients is slow. The directorate of health services has deputed senior consultants to manage the new facility. The facility is equipped with an oxygen tank of 20,000 litres, and 150 oxygen beds have been allotted for Covid-19 patients. However, on a daily basis, close to 300 patients are hospitalized in the state, most of them at GMC and South Goa district hospital. “As of today, all hospitals whether they are government or private, have as much oxygen as they need, and oxygen dealers are ensuring that oxygen supplies reach every hospital as and when required,” said Sawant during his address to the state on Friday. Sawant said that the state disaster management team is monitoring the oxygen supply. He said that the 20,000-litre oxygen tank at GMC’s superspecialty block and the 6,000-litre oxygen tank at the South Goa district hospital were filled to capacity on Friday. “Many cylinders have run out again,” said a patient’s relative. “Nurses have connected a line to one cylinder to keep two patients alive outside ward 138. The nurses and doctors are tired and frustrated, and they just cannot keep up with the number of patients who are brought in every day.” Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that the BJP government should be held responsible for deaths due to oxygen shortage. “The death toll will further rise if the oxygen shortage continues. I urge the chief minister to take note and act. Where is the audit report ordered by the prime minister and the white paper on oxygen?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmcs-covid-wards-run-out-of-space-patients-now-treated-in-corridors-too/articleshow/82469954.cms||Newton Sequeira

Till date only people aged 45 and above have access to the government’s vaccination drive, with no preference for pharmacists and their employees who often come into direct contact with Covid patients.  “There are around 7,500 of us throughout the state and we are regularly exposed to the virus through patients and relatives. The pharmacy is the first place somebody sick visits and we should have been considered as frontline workers and given the vaccine along with healthcare workers,” a pharmacist told TOI. Another pharmacist said they are at the highest risk of exposure as they have been working continuously through the pandemic unlike other shops and establishments that are shut during lockdown and curfews.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pharmacists-want-frontline-worker-status/articleshow/82469959.cms||---

According to health officers, with an average of 2,754 daily, a total 16,522 people in 18-44 years age groups took the jabs till Friday evening. All the beneficiaries in this age group are being given India’s indigenously developed Covaxin. The people in this age group are being vaccinated at 10 centres: King George’s Medical University, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lokbandhu Hospital, Balrampur Hospital, Avantibai Hospital, Jhalkari Bai Hospital, BRD Hospital, SPM Civil Hospital and Rani Laxmi Bai Hospital. Those who want to get vaccinated have to book their slot through CoWIN portal. Officers admitted that the pace of vaccination is a bit slow due to limited vaccination centres for this age group as of now. As a result, people have to wait to get a slot. Immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said that 10 centres for vaccination have been made as per the direction of state government.

A professor at Sonipat’s Gateway Engineering College, the 35-year-old man has helped hospitals in three districts of Haryana make their oxygen plants functional as engineers were stranded in other states. “A shortage of oxygen was already killing people. When I came to know that the oxygen plant in the Sonipat hospital was non-functional as the company engineers were stranded in Maharashtra and Gujarat due to lockdown, I took up responsibility to start after permission from authorities,” said Gahlawat. It took him four days and nights to make the plant at Sonipat civil hospital functional. Now, it generates 200 LPM oxygen which can fill 40 to 45 jumbo size cylinders. “The oxygen plant material was available, but it was not installed. Since I am a programmer also, I coordinated with the designated company on the phone to set up a password and made the plant ready,” he added. He said by the time he readied the Sonipat plant, Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav invited him to replicate the same in their district hospital. “Till Wednesday, I have made an oxygen plant ready to use in Sonipat, Karnal and Ambala. The work at Panchkula and other places will be done in near future. Now, the company’s engineers have also started coming. My job is now to monitor the installation of plants,” he added. Gahlawat said he could not do much when he lost a close relative to the virus laster, so he wanted to do something now. Last year, Gahlawat worked at Sonipat civil hospital testing centre to facilitate the technology in dealing with the crisis. He adds he has been practising automation technology for 15-years. “I started working on automation in my second year of engineering from MDU in 2004. I did small courses and later developed skills in industrial training of my engineering course,” he added. He said he continued working on automation and has dedicated many of his machines to the ‘Make in India’ campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/professor-helps-make-3-oxygen-plants-in-haryana-functional-had-lost-kin-to-covid-last-year/articleshow/82469967.cms||Sat Singh

The initiative is supported by Khalsa Aid. Covid-positive residents who are not able to secure a hospital bed or get oxygen support can now drive in at the gurdwara’s makeshift camp and get oxygen support for up to three hours. The entry is from gate 4. But one has to book an appointment on 96547 14986. Patients have to carry their Aadhaar card. Ten beds have also been kept at the centre for those reaching there in an auto rickshaw. Since Thursday evening, 10 patients have availed the service, the gurdwara management said. The centre has oxygen concentrators and cylinders that are being filled with the support of the district administration. “So far, there is not much rush though more than 10 people have availed our oxygen sewa since Thursday. The district administration is helping us refill the cylinders and the Noida Authority is providing traffic management,” Surjeet Singh Bhasin, president of the gurdwara, told TOI. Indirapuram Gurudwara in neighbouring Ghaziabad, on April 22, started a similar initiative, and it has so far catered to over a thousand patients. The administration in Ghaziabad has allowed the gurudwara to procure oxygen from BHEL in Haridwar, from where they are ferrying 50 cylinders daily. At Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha, however, patients with blood oxygen level below 80 are being encouraged to get hospital support and not bank on the langar solely. “The service is for people who need interim help before proper medical support can be accessed,” Surjeet Singh said. “Patients are being asked to sign an undertaking so that the gurdwara does not have any responsibility for the medical condition of the patient. Patients with oxygen levels below 80 should consider proper medical support and not bank solely on the langar,” he added. The Gurdwara has also been running a langar service for Covid patients who can't cook for themselves. There are five langar kitchens running in Noida and Greater Noida — at the Sector 18 Gurudwara. Sector 37 Gurudwara, Noida Extension Gurudwara, Sector 50 Sangat Centre and Sector 121 Sangat Centre. Vegetarian meals are being sent to over 200 patients twice a day from these centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-free-meals-sector-18-gurdwara-starts-o2-langar-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82469993.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

This has triggered concerns from health experts, who urge hospital authorities to monitor them strictly.Many of the 700-odd patients in the hospital’s Covid-19 ward had a bystander sitting on the same bed, TOI found on Friday.Nurses in the ward said that the bystanders do not follow precautions including maintaining distance, wearing masks properly or even washing hands regularly. “We keep telling them to be careful and not to sit close to the patient, share water or food with them or mingle with other bystanders. But we are too short-staffed to be strict,” she said.“What is scarier is that it is not the same bystander who is with the patient throughout their stay. Several relatives turn up at different time to take care of the patient,” said Gladys, who was taking care of a Covid patient.“Some of them travel home via public transport. They also meet other relatives who brings fresh clothes and food,” said choreographer Footlose Edwin, whose relative is admitted in CMCH. Bystanders are required to administer medicines, feed patient and alert a doctor or nurse if oxygen saturation drops, said a doctor. “As we are short-staffed, this is a small way to reduce our burden,” he said.Agreed former deputy director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. “The district is at a stage beyond community spread or transmission. While bystanders are required to reduce health workers’ burden, they have to be regulated to a young healthy individual, preferably fully-vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19. They should not be allowed to step outside the ward. After the patient is discharged, they must also isolate for 14 days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bystanders-in-covid-ward-raise-concern/articleshow/82470006.cms||---

Veronica also sought the government to strictly implement a GO dated April 30, that asked all private hospitals to allocate 50% beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients.A division bench of justices M S Ramesh and B Pugalendhi observed that the grievance of the petitioner is that though the government has fixed treatment cost, it is not followed by the private hospitals. “This court appreciates the valuable services rendered by doctors, nurses, all health workers and all other frontline workers during this pandemic. At the same time, the receipt placed before this court shows that exorbitant charges have been collected by some hospitals even during this difficult time, which cannot be permitted. The hospitals are taking advantage of the situation,” observed the judges.The judges sought a response from the state to the following queries: Whether the maximum cost for Covid-19 treatment fixed by the government is displayed prominently in all hospitals so the public can see it, and the details of the authority to whom any complaint regarding exorbitant charges can be lodged.The judges asked what the penal provision or penalty contemplated for violation of the GO was and which authority was monitoring the implementation of the GOs. It also asked about the number of complaints received about exorbitant treatment costs and details of the action taken, if any.The court asked the state to inform it about the maintenance of a portal on bed availability in private hospitals along with their treatment charges. The judges sought details of Covid-19 patients who have benefited from the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme at private hospitals and whether government employees are entitled to take treatment for Covid-19 in such hospitals under the Tamil Nadu employees health insurance scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/how-are-you-monitoring-private-hosp-treatment-fee-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/82470008.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Coimbatore||CMCH all set to get 80 more oxygen-supported beds||Coimbatore: Four oxygen generators that can provide oxygen to 80 beds will soon be operational at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH).The generators, being set up in the hospital’s cosmetic surgery ward, are likely to be commissioned on Monday. Each generator will serve 20 beds and produce around 100 litres of oxygen per minute. CMCH now has 504 oxygen-supported beds and 213 ventilator beds.As many as 41 Rotary Clubs raised Rs 1 crore to install the four oxygen generators, which can serve 80 patients requiring oxygen. “All clubs are raising funds for the project. Corporates like Karur Vysya Bank and Aquasub Engineering also contributed large chunks from their corporate social responsibility fund,” said a club member.Oxygen generators use a technology called pressure swing absorption, which takes atmospheric air, separates nitrogen and other gases, concentrates oxygen, and supplies it to patients. It will require an equipment to be set up between every two beds. The equipment will receive oxygen from a centralized compressor.“We have machinery of varying capacity right from 20 beds to 100 beds costing from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 2.5 crore,” said Vivekanandan of Faraday Ozone, which is commissioning the generators. “Nine private hospitals in the city are in talks with us to set up the units,” he said.If more such generators are set up in the district, dependency on the one or two suppliers of medical oxygen will reduce and help decentralize oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-all-set-to-get-80-more-oxygen-supported-beds/articleshow/82470010.cms||---

SCAI’s member malls and shopping complexes boast a total of one lakh square feet of space and huge parking areas. The move, said the association in its letter to the central and state governments, will help health administrations accelerate vaccination. “Governments can utilise mall infrastructure to carry out an extensive pan-India vaccination drive to curb the spread of Covid-19. Malls are social infrastructure with ample safe and hygienic parking spaces, training rooms, etc, and can be utilized as vaccination camps,” the SCAI appeal said.  Meanwhile, NMMC has allowed Vashi-based Inorbit Mall and Seawoods’ Grand Central Mall to start drive-in centres in their parking bays for those aged above 45. These are aimed at helping the differently abled and senior citizens who have difficulty walking get their jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1650-malls-in-country-offer-premises-for-vax/articleshow/82464003.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||NGO launches 200-bed oxygen support camp for Covid patients||Gurgaon: An NGO that has been helping people in the city in need of medical oxygen get cylinders and also providing oxygen support to Covid patients with breathing distress has now opened a camp equipped with 200 beds to provide better care. The camp’s affairs are being managed by around 50 volunteers, several of whom work with IT companies and have taken a break to help diffuse the acute healthcare crisis the current wave of the pandemic has triggered. Called ‘Oxygen Centre’, the camp has been built on rented land off Golf Course Road Extension in Sector 62.  Admission to the camp is free and volunteers said 70 people had already used the facility by Friday evening, less than 24 hours after it was opened on Thursday night. The NGO — Hemkunt Foundation — said that the facility is not a parallel hospitalisation solution. Instead, the walk-in camp is meant to provide support to Covid patients who need medical oxygen urgently and give time to their family members to look for a hospital. While the facility has 200 beds, members of the NGO said it can provide support to 400 patients at a time. The capacity is handy because the city’s hospitals are swamped and getting admissions means a long wait that could run into several days. The camp also has a drive-through facility where people can park their vehicles and get immediate oxygen support. All they need to do is furnish a Covid report of the patient and get their oxygen saturation levels checked on the spot. “We have been noticing that people lose crucial time in search of oxygen cylinders and ICU beds,” founder and CEO of Hemkunt Foundation, Irinder Ahluwalia, told TOI. “During this period, the condition of the patient worsens. We wanted to plug this gap and save people from anxiety and emotional breakdown while they are searching for medical help for their loved ones. Many people don’t even need hospitalisation and recover with oxygen support. But arranging medical oxygen is not easy. Our idea is simple — to support Covid patients till the time they manage to get medical help.” As of now, the NGO is running the facility mainly on oxygen concentrators. It has tied up with various vendors in Gujarat and other states for oxygen cylinders. The camp also offers three meals a day to Covid patients. The NGO maintains that it doesn’t offer any other medical assistance like nursing, doctor consultations or ventilator support. “Besides offering oxygen support, we also provide food and coconut water to people who are exhausted with all the running around to get medical support for their loved ones. We also counsel patients with mild or moderate illness,” said Inderpreet Singh, an engineer with an MNC who is volunteering at the camp. The NGO claims several people have been offering donations to keep the initiative going. “Many people across the country and the international diaspora are ready to help. Several people who got support from us were able to save the lives of their loved ones. They express their gratitude in the form of donations,” Ahluwalia added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ngo-launches-200-bed-oxygen-support-camp-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82470016.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

He stated that during the lockdown last year, the homeless and abandoned mentally challenged people who were on the streets were taken care of by the Madurai district administration by providing them with food and shelter.Since the state government had imposed several lockdown restrictions, night curfew and complete lockdown on Sundays, several homeless and abandoned people were seen near the bus stands and railway stations in Madurai with hunger.

Families with Covid patients also complained that the online dashboard (https://beds.dgmhup-covid19.in/EN/covid19bedtrack) had bed availability status of 66 Covid hospitals out of 74 in the city till Friday night. Further, the dashboard is updated only twice daily – 8am and 4pm, which does not give the exact situation in the afternoon or night. Vinod Singh, a college teacher, needed an oxygen supported bed for his wife on Thursday night. He called up several hospitals based on the status provided on the dashboard, but was told that there was no vacancy. “Finally, a senior officer helped to get my wife admitted to a government facility,” he said. Long queues outside oxygen refill plants also continued since morning. “My entire day for the past one week goes into getting a refill,” said Awdhesh Prasad who had come to get oxygen for his ailing brother. Officers deputed to hospitals: The district administration on Friday divided 72 Covid hospitals into 24 sectors and deputed over 100 officers, including police officers, to ensure that no patient faces difficulty in admission.

---||Madurai||Oxygen crisis deepens in Madurai hospitals||MADURAI: Hospitals in Madurai are fast running out of oxygen even as the demand for the life-saving gas is going up every minute. Some hospitals say their regular suppliers are urging them to find alternative solutions as they would not be able to meet the demand. On Friday morning, a major hospital in the city ran out of oxygen as its storage unit did not have large capacity. Other major hospitals are admitting patients to oxygen beds only if they have enough oxygen storage for 48 hours. ``If the storage falls and would be available only for 24 hours, then the patients would have to be shifted to GRH,’’ a source said. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan said oxygen-supported beds are full in almost every hospital in Madurai and the only way a person can get a bed is after an occupant vacates it. Sources at a private hospital said about 20% of its oxygen-supported beds did not have oxygen though they were designed for it. ``These beds are now just ordinary beds, without oxygen,’’ he said. Benita, (name changed) daughter of a patient from Tuticorin, admitted to the ICU of a private hospital, said the hospital told them that they could not assure oxygen supply beyond Friday. ``We are just praying as we are not able to see my father,’’ she said. The capacity of oxygen storage tankers in Government Rajaji Hospital was 26KL of which 20 KL was being used on a daily basis. In the first wave, only people with 40% lung involvement were referred to the Thoppur infectious diseases hospital, where there are oxygenated beds, but now even more serious cases, of those with 70% lung involvement, are being referred there. This was a matter of grave concern, said Venkatesan. Authorities told him when he inspected the hospital on Friday that they needed a digital X-ray machine and generator. Venkatesan was also monitoring the supply of oxygen from Palakkad to Madurai, which was expected to arrive on Friday evening. This however, would have to be given to all the hospitals which were now overflowing with patients. Health department sources said the availability of beds as displayed in the chart given out by the department was varying by the minute in the new circumstances. As on May 6, the district had 1,150 oxygen-supported beds in government hospitals and 1,194 in private hospitals. Doctors at GRH said that almost all oxygen-supported beds were full. ``We are trying to juggle the patients, and will be able to manage as long as the storage unit holds good,’’ they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/o2-crisis-deepens-in-madurai-hosps/articleshow/82470051.cms||---

In future when the number goes up, the need will be more,” he said and reassured that arrangements will be made for the same. Kumar said that the district has a testing capacity of nearly 4,000 samples a day – 3,000 in the medical college hospital and 1,000 in private labs.Of the little more than 3,000 samples tested a day, the district has been recording nearly 700 fresh cases over the last few days. Jayant said that wearing masks properly, maintaining social distance and vaccination are the key to stop spread. “Many are wearing masks below the chin. It should cover the nose and mouth,” he added.Earlier, the monitoring officer chaired a review meeting along with district collector K Senthil Raj and other top officials and discussed the methods of contact tracing and testing and concerns over the high positivity rate in the district. Meanwhile, the collector conducted a training programme for officials from various departments to extend help to those under home quarantine.

As per the state government, the approval for BVLOS, in addition to VLOS, by the director general of civil aviation was critical to explore the feasibility of the intended last mile coverage. “This is because the medical centres at remote locations are typically far beyond the VLOS range of the vaccine and medical distribution hubs. The BVLOS clearance is a major step towards thoroughly testing these drones over long distances and thus gathering information on their reliability,” said a communique issued by the Telangana government. The `Medicine from the Sky’ project was launched in late 2019 in partnership with the World Economic Forum (WEF). The EoI, that was released during Wings 2020 to invite participants for this study, received 16 applications, of which seven were selected to undertake flights in Vikarabad district as part of this project. As per the state government, the drone operations are expected to commence in the fourth week of May or early June, subject to all clearances by MHA. The drone flights would be conducted for 24 days, where four batches of drones would perform sorties for six days each. The payload would consist of vaccine cold storage boxes equipped with temperature sensors and data loggers to record the performance. In each batch, the first two days would have VLOS flights, followed by BVLOS flights over different distances over the remaining days. Commenting on the development, Telangana IT & industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said, “The success of these trials would establish the use case and pave the way for adopting the drones at scale and leveraging them for the healthcare supply chain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-gets-dgca-nod-to-operate-vaccine-delivery-drones-farther/articleshow/82470056.cms||---

Madurai (162) and Tiruvarur (104) were the only districts with more than 100 vacant ICU beds whereas it was less than 100 in the 35 other districts. There were no ICU beds in Dharmapuri and Thiruvallur.Out of a total of 61,050 Covid beds earmarked in the state, more than 76% (46,770) were occupied including 25,168 oxygenated beds and 6,364 ICU beds. The breakup of the 61,050 beds shows that 30,050 are oxygenated, 23,494 non-oxygenated and 7,505 are ICU beds. Only 4,882 oxygenated (16%) and 1,142 ICU beds (15%) were vacant. Dharmapuri had only 22 beds vacant on Friday, all of them non-oxygenated. The number of available oxygenated beds was below 100 in 19 districts and less than 50 in 11 districts. Vacancy of ICU beds was 50 or lesser in 32 districts, 25 or lesser in 19 districts including Chennai (25) and less than 10 in nine districts.Meanwhile, there was a sizeable vacancy of beds in Covid Care Centres (CCC), as the number of centres and beds have risen with the soaring fresh cases. Of the 42,621 beds in CCCs only 18,577 were occupied. Health care professionals, district collectors and government-appointed monitoring officers expect a drastic rise in the number of oxygenated and ICU beds in the next few days. While efforts are on to resume production of oxygen from Sterlite by the middle of next week, hospitals are also in need of the required infrastructure to ramp up their oxygen capacities.Health secretary J Radhakrishnan had informed the high court on Thursday that occupancy rate of oxygen and ICU beds was 95%. While 12,915 beds were being provided with oxygen lines through the PWD, of which 3,752 have been put to use, 8,129 more beds were expected to be ready by Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-tiruvarur-only-dists-with-over-100-vacant-icu-beds/articleshow/82470059.cms||M K Ananth
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: ‘Pregnant women may have to wait for jab’||Lucknow: Pregnant women cannot take Covid-19 vaccination as of now, but lactating mothers can soon be included in the national immunisation programme, according to experts. Addressing a webinar titled ‘Vaccination for 18+ and post-vaccination prevention’, jointly organised by Lucknow University and UNICEF, member of the National Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Committee, Dr NK Arora said pregnant women would have to wait for the jab as research was still underway. “However, discussions are on to include lactating mothers in the national immunisation programme. A lactating mother can take the jab six weeks after the delivery,” he added. Replying to a query by a student, Shivangi Tiwari, on vaccination of heart patients, Dr Arora said the vaccine was safe for those who had undergone angioplasty or were on blood thinners, but if the person had undergone open-heart surgery, he or she should consult doctor before taking the jab. Dr Kanupriya Singhal warned Covid-19 home isolated patients against self-medication. “Take doctors’ advice before taking medicines and those living alone should not isolate themselves at home.” Emphasizing on the use of a triple-layer surgical mask by home isolation patients and their caregivers, she said: “If SPO2 levels drop below 94% or there is any other complication, patients should contact doctors immediately.” Dr Praful Bharadwaj said fully vaccinated people were less likely to fall critically ill. “However, people should take precautions against infection even after vaccination,” he added Health experts appealed to students to get a jab and share their photographs and videos on social media to motivate others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pregnant-women-may-have-to-wait-for-jab/articleshow/82470063.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: LGBTQ activist who made India his home dies of Covid-19||NEW DELHI: A fortuitous trip to Delhi in 2017 had led to 35-year-old LGBTQ activist James Williams finding his partner in the capital, and he eventually moved from the US to Delhi. On April 28, he breathed his last at a Noida hospital, succumbing to Covid-19. His partner, Ayush Thakur (25), whom Williams had met through a dating application, said while they could survive the first wave, the recent one hit them both. Williams had comorbidities, including high blood pressure, and his oxygen level was impacted. “We were moving around the city desperately to find oxygen. We eventually admitted him to a non-Covid hospital in Rohini and had to rely on finding oxygen cylinders every day,” said Thakur. Williams was later shifted to Noida, but his vitals continued to fluctuate. “We were told we needed Remdesivir, but by the time we could get it, he had passed away,” said Thakur, stating he could still recall the moment his partner’s skin started to turn blue due to lack of oxygen. “We were to get married in the US and had even asked a lawyer there to initiate the process. But before we could go to LA, the pandemic hit,” said Thakur. A Columbia University graduate, Williams had worked with writer Daphne Merkin for several years.  “He found extremely cheap tickets from LA to Delhi and that is how he came to India. He decided to come to India once again to meet me. By this point, I knew I had to make him meet my family and they were all supportive of our relationship,” said Thakur. In the capital, Williams began to approach producers and other influencers in popularising shows with same-sex couples. “He was inspired by the show Will and Grace and thought more shows needed to show same sex-couples. In Delhi, he started a non-profit fund and would provide free counselling to people from the LGBTQ community. He also wrote a play on the community, which ran for a month at a café in Chhatarpur,” said Thakur, stating when they met, Article 377 was yet to be decriminalised. “We celebrated it in 2018. He wanted to stay in India and make a bigger difference.” Shruti Kumar, an LA-based musician, who met Williams as freshmen in Columbia University, said through his writings and work, he had wanted to bring LGBTQ characters in the limelight in India.  “All of his friends here tried to motivate him while he battled Covid, but he could not come out. One of the last things he said to me was ‘I have incredible friends. I love you’,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/lgbtq-activist-who-made-india-his-home-dies/articleshow/82470070.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Goa||May’s 1st week saw more Covid deaths in Goa than March-September||PANAJI: The first week of May has seen more Covid-19 deaths in Goa than the entire month of April. In the deadliest week since the pandemic began, Goa reported 389 deaths, more than the state’s toll in the first seven months of the pandemic. The state is seeing an average of 56 deaths a day, but on May 5, that figure went up to 71. Goa’s positivity rate, too, is the highest in India, as it consistently remains over 50% — one in two persons tests positive. Apart from delays in test results being issues, other reasons for the high death toll include a less-than-ideal home isolation monitoring system, and late reporting of symptoms. Delayed test results, which sometimes take up to 10 days, inadvertently leads to patients infecting others. Doctors treating Covid-19 patients have stated that patients coming to hospital have severe pneumonia, and virtually all require oxygen support. “This was unlike the first wave, when we could maintain patients on room oxygen. This wave, the variant is very very infectious and it progresses to the lungs very quickly,” a doctor said. Another doctor attributed the deaths to people not being able to access and receive the right treatment, with serious patients unable to find oxygen beds in the government or private sector. “The government took it easy when things were worsening in other states,” the doctor said. “They continued to welcome tourists and hold elections, and didn’t upgrade the systems or train more doctors to handle Covid. The centralised oxygen system at GMC is ancient and should have been upgraded. It is too old and cannot cater to the oxygen requirements of those who require high flow oxygen.”  The complete collapse of healthcare infrastructure has also contributed to the high death numbers. Until May 1, the state administration refused to publicly acknowledge the shortage of oxygen and hospital beds. Only after doctors themselves, tired of the false statements, presented the true picture of the second wave did the administration grudgingly accept the shortcomings. “The oxygen supply in various Covid wards is not even close to sufficient. The central oxygen flow delivers very low flow oxygen at times, and that is inadequate to keep NIVs and ventilators working effectively. Also, the oxygen cylinders being used for patients get over in the middle of the night, and it takes at least 2-3 hours for replacement cylinders,” the Goa association of resident doctors wrote to the government. Doctors, besides blaming people for taking the pandemic lightly, have also blamed the health department for failing to monitor patients in home isolation and the administration for failing to delegate work when they couldn’t cope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mays-1st-wk-saw-more-covid-deaths-in-goa-than-mar-sep/articleshow/82470090.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Lucknow||Survivors triumph over coronavirus with grit & fighting spirit in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: At a time when the second wave of Covid-19 is causing devastation, every Covid survivor family in the city has an inspirational tale that keeps the human spirit alive. If a son’s desire to make his parents proud motivated him to fight, hold onto life, a son-daughter duo went all out to save the lives of their parents. When software developer Rishabh Ranjan Mishra (32), a resident of Shardanagar, had a sudden attack of breathlessness with blood oxygen level dropping to 88% in the morning of April 10, his parents contacted six hospitals, but none admitted him citing unavailability of beds. After trying desperately for the entire day, the family arranged a bed in a hospital in Gomtinagar at 10pm. The RT-PCR test found him Covid-19 positive and chest X-ray indicated that only 10% of his lungs were functioning due to Covid induced pneumonia, considered to be the advanced stage of the disease. “My parents were scared. My confidence also shook after seeing other patients in the ward gasping for breath, but the thought that I have to hold onto life and achieve my career goals and plans to make my parents proud, motivated me to fight,” said Rishabh, who recovered after spending 13 days in critical care. “All kinds of tests, drugs and therapies you go during treatment also bring fatigue, but pep talks by doctors and nurses kept my hopes alive,” he added. Anuj Srivastava and his sister Deepali were scared when the Covid-19 test reports of their parents, Sanjay and Savita, who were suffering from fever for the past few days, came positive on April 13. Suddenly, their blood oxygen level dipped to 70-80%. After running from pillar to post, the siblings managed to hospitalise their mother in a Gomtinagar hospital but could not find a vacant bed for their father. With no other option, they converted their father’s room into a mini ‘high dependency unit’ by installing oxygen support system. “The sugar level of my father, who is a diabetic, also shot up. It appeared then that we would lose him, but he kept fighting and after four days, we got a bed for him in a private hospital. However, before we could heave a sigh of relief, the news arrived that the oxygen supply in the two hospitals where my parents were admitted was exhausted. We somehow managed to get two oxygen cylinders and rushed them to the two hospitals on time to save their life. During their hospitalisation period, we daily shunted between home to the hospitals to provide food, medicines and other essentials to them,” said Anuj. “In between this struggle, Deepali too contracted infection but remained asymptomatic. She recovered in home isolation. My father got discharged from the hospital after eight days on April 21, but my mother had to spend 16 days in hospital as her recovery was slow. She returned home on April 29. During this period, we often felt helplessness but motivation from friends and doctors helped us survive the tough time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/survivors-triumph-over-coronavirus-with-grit-fighting-spirit/articleshow/82470099.cms||---

In addition to the villagers, around 150 tourists have also got themselves vaccinated at the PHC, medical officer at the Candolim PHC Dr Roshan Nazareth told TOI. “The people are cooperating and coming here without any worries because they know we’re taking all precautions and it’s safe here,” he said. While in the initial stages the vaccination was being done at the Candolim PHC, it has now been shifted to the Club-house at the Candolim football ground, where facilities have been provided by the Candolim panchayat, said the medical officer. “People are now seeing the deaths of those who have not been vaccinated, and want to get themselves vaccinated,” Dr Nazareth said. He said they also had one-day vaccination camps at Calangute and Saligao. “Around 500 people were vaccinated at each of the camps. We’re trying to have vaccination centres at these places soon, subject to availability of staff,” he said.  Dr Nazareth said the Candolim PHC has not faced any shortage of home isolation kits as of now. “There is not one person who has not received the home isolation kit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-10k-take-the-jab-at-candolim-health-centre/articleshow/82470117.cms||---

It’s the brainchild of joint commissioner of police, law and order, Piyush Mordia. He told TOI that the idea was floated to mitigate acute shortage of oxygen cylinders in the city. “The bank has been created at the JCP law and order office in Daliganj,” said Mordia. People can contact on 9454400154 for taking oxygen cylinder. The officer said that empty cylinders will be issued to the needy patients for a week after which they will have to be returned. “After issuance, one may get them refilled from the plants in Sarojininagar, Alambagh or Krishanagar,” he added. The aim is to make it convenient for the police personnel and public who have no other means to get oxygen support, said the officer. The oxygen cylinders will be made available on the basis of the requirement,doctor’s prescription and an Aadhaar card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-cops-start-o2-bank-for-needy-patients/articleshow/82470130.cms||---
---||Goa||Yet another record high as Goa sees 4,195 cases in one day||PANAJI: The Covid-19 pandemic continued to rip through Goa, chalking new records and claiming more victims on Friday. With 4,195 new cases detected, the state has breached the 30,000-mark for active cases, and also posted a record high in fresh cases for the third consecutive day. Friday also saw the state continue to lose more than 50 lives for the third consecutive day, with seven succumbing before they could be treated at the hospitals. Goa Medical College continued to report the highest number of deaths, with 32 people losing their lives. The victims included a 17 year old girl from Sindhudurg who died of sepsis and status epilepticus brought on by Covid-19. The girl was suffering from chronic kidney disease. The data also shows that 18 of the deceased did not have any co-morbid conditions. Seven of the patients died within 24 hours of admission. Over the past one month, Goa’s active caseload and positivity rate have shot up exponentially, even as the state government dragged its feet in adopting corrective measures to curb the spread of the virus. Exactly a month ago on April 7, the number of active cases in Goa stood at 2,857, while Goa’s positivity rate stood at 20%. Since then, the novel coronavirus has galloped across the length and breath of the state taking the total number of active cases to 31,716. While the recovery rate came down to 70.4%, the positivity rate climbed higher to 51.34%. Goa’s mortality rate also inched up to 1.4%. On the positive side, 2,175 patients recovered in the last 24 hours, including 194 patients who were hospitalized. Margao continues to have the highest number of Covid-19 cases, followed by Panaji and Porvorim. Although chief minister Pramod Sawant insisted that test results are released within 48 hours, several individuals have complained that their results have been delayed by five to seven days. “My room mate has all the symptoms of Covid — fatigue, cough and body pain,” said Shankar, a security guard. “He went for a test seven days earlier at the Casa do Povo hall at Taleigao, but his results have not yet come. If his case was critical, by now he would be dead. This is a hassle for me too, because I cannot live with him.” Of the 56 patients who lost their lives, 16 were reported at the South Goa district hospital, two at the north Goa district hospital, one at ESI and two at private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-another-record-high-as-goa-sees-4k-cases-in-one-day/articleshow/82470154.cms||---

"At least prima facie, we are satisfied that our orders made from time to time on the issue of installation of digital meters in taxis are not being complied with, for one reason or the other," the court observed. The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) had filed a contempt petition for the second time against government officials for not complying with the HC orders. “Before initiating further action in this contempt petition, we give the state government yet another opportunity to commence the process of installation of digital meters in taxis as early as possible and in any case within a period of 15 days from today” the court stated. Tha court stated that no one even bothered to seek any extension from it and added that despite issuance of this notification, no steps were taken for installation of digital meters in taxis. It observed that the notification on the fare rates was issued only on January 14, after a delay of almost one year. During the hearing of the case, advocate general of the state Devidas Pangam said that some difficulties have arisen on account of Covid-19 situation. He said that the contractor’s nodal officer, who was dealing with the state government has passed away and therefore, there is a delay. However, the division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and justice M S Jawalkar observed that this work of installing digital meters in taxis should have been completed long ago not only in terms of the directions, but also following the assurances given in the contempt proceedings. The implementation of our orders cannot be postponed or for that matter avoided based upon the reason stated, the court observed. Further, the advocate general said that the state government is keen to install digital meters in taxis and all efforts are being made. He stated that there was a proposal for installing such meters from May 1. The court has posted the matter for hearing on June 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-gives-govt-15-days-to-start-installing-digital-fare-meters/articleshow/82470179.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Rates for private ambulances fixed to check overcharging in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: While district magistrate Abhishek Prakash on Friday tightened the noose around private ambulance service providers charging more than the government-approved rates, officer in charge for Covid-19 Roshan Jacob ordered audit of five hospitals for reportedly using excessive oxygen on minimum admitted patients. Taking cognizance of media reports on high ambulance charges, the DM issued directives along with the rates fixed by the government for private ambulance services. DM said legal action would be taken against those overcharging patients. During an inspection, she found that the facilities were using more than 200 cylinders daily while the admission of Covid-19 patients was very low. She also found that hospitals were extracting oxygen cylinders from more than one supplier. She said legal action would be taken against the hospital authorities if they were found to be consuming excess oxygen. She stated a committee comprising of a doctor, drug inspector and an anesthetic was being formed which would allocate quota of oxygen to Covid hospitals based on the number of patients admitted and minimum requirement of oxygen. The committee will also ensure that seven plants in the city distribute or supply oxygen to hospitals areawise. During her inspection at Balrampur Covid-19 hospital, Jacob found that many patients were not able to breathe properly due to faulty oxygen pipeline. She directed officials to shift the patients to highflow oxygen wards till the fault was rectified. She directed the CMO to send a team to Balrampur hospital and verify as to where the 100 oxygen concentrators of 10 litres each were being used. Hospital director Santosh Kumar Pandey informed her that 50 concentrators were being used in lowflow ward and the remaining in those wards where oxygen pipeline was not available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rates-for-pvt-ambulances-fixed-to-check-overcharging/articleshow/82470183.cms||---

Currently, the 500-bed facility is taking admission through the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC). The hospital, which became functional on May 5, also recorded its first discharge on Friday when a Muslim woman walked out amid PPE wearing staff clapping for her resilience to beat the virus. “The Lucknow-based DRDO hospital discharged its first patient on Friday. It will soon start admitting whoever is coming to the hospital even directly,” DRDO director Narendra Kumar Arya told TOI. However, till late Friday night, no confirmation on direct admissions could be received from district administration, ICCC in charge or district Covid in charge. The hospital has 150 ICU/ventilator beds and 350 general oxygen supported beds. It has been established by DRDO and the medical operations are being carried out by the armed forces. As of now, admissions are being made through ICCC (0522-4523000).

We demanded lockdown but government is still not listening. Hope better sense will prevail soon,” Kamat said. He said that the “insensitive and irresponsible” BJP governments at the Centre and state were “now getting blows after blows from the high courts and Supreme Court completely exposing the harsh reality that the BJP governments did nothing to face the second wave of Covid.” “It is a welcome sign that the judiciary has taken serious cognisance of what is happening around and the courts are now giving directions to the governments to act swiftly to save precious lives,” he said. Pointing out that Gandhi has again written a letter to Modi “with various valuable suggestions and also raising concerns on the complete unpreparedness of the BJP governments in handling Covid even now,” Kamat said “if the government had paid attention to his alarm in February 2020, Covid situation would have been different today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/told-govt-long-ago-to-ask-for-negative-certificate-kamat/articleshow/82470189.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||As city races to add Covid beds, 600 critical patients on hospital wait list||Gurgaon: As many as 4,902 Covid patients have registered on the portal launched by the district administration to get hospital admission in the city. The administration has deployed a team of doctors to scrutinise the applications and reach out to applicants to determine the actual number of people requiring hospitalisation. Officials said so far, they have reached out to 3,671 people, of whom 600 are critical and require institutional care but have been put on the waiting list because the Covid wards of all hospitals are full. Officials said most of these patients had already started taking medication after tele-consultation with doctors and some of them were also assisted by doctors from the health department. A senior administration official said people on the waiting list will get a respite when more hospitals update their bed availability data on the portal. “Around 100 more hospitals will be added to the list on the portal and after that happens, the hospitals will have to update their daily bed status and oxygen requirement. Our audit team will go and see whether they are using oxygen in a fair manner and whether they are reporting their vacancy properly or not. If a hospital has 10 beds vacant for five hours and doesn’t report on the portal, it is unfair. This is the idea of this portal,” said the official. As of 8pm on Friday, 11 oxygen beds were available at Sheetla hospital, five at Civil Hospital, four at Artemis hospital, 17 at Signature hospital, 14 at SGT Medical College and Research Institute and two at Sunrise hospital. There were five ICU beds available at Signature Hospital. Deputy commissioner Dr Yash Garg said that temporary hospitals were being set up, which would enable more people to get hospital care within the next seven days. He said that around a 100-bed facility will be opened at Tau Devi Lal Stadium, which will be managed by Medanta, while another 100 beds were being prepared at a facility in Sector 27 by Hero Motocorp. He said that the IAF too was setting up a 150-bed facility. For families of patients who need immediate care, the last few weeks have been a nightmare. Anita Sharma, a resident of Sector 4, said that all members of the household have tested positive for Covid-19. “We feel helpless. I lost my grandfather three weeks ago. No hospital bed was available. My father-in-law is admitted at a small private hospital. We are providing the oxygen. We tried multiple hospitals with ICU beds but nothing was available. Meanwhile, the hospital that has admitted him has given us no assurance on oxygen support. So, we are managing on our own.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/as-city-races-to-add-covid-beds-600-critical-patients-on-hospital-wait-list/articleshow/82470227.cms||Vishakha Chaman

Farmers said they would violate the lockdown on Saturday as planned. This is the first time that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has used harsh words for farmers, who he had been sympathising with so far. “We are committed to violating lockdown guidelines on Saturday, come what may, and even call upon shopkeepers to accompany us in the protest and open their shops. We are ready to face any eventuality, ready to face lathi blows or even go to jails if the government deals with our protest in such a way but we will surely go ahead with the protest,” BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) vice-president Manjit Singh Dhaner said they have planned ahead. “We do not fear such diktats and will go ahead to defy the lockdown tomorrow. We have planned for it and even held meetings with traders. If the government wants to deal strictly, let it do that and test our commitment,” said Dhaner. Taking a tough stand on the issue for the first time in seven months, when the farmers’ protest started, Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday said that the Kisan Morcha could not dictate terms to the state government and warned of strict prosecution in case of violation of any restrictions. He also said that if any shops were opened in violation of restrictions, owners would be prosecuted. Various sections of society denounced the decision of farmer groups to defy lockdown at a time when the entire nation, especially Punjab is facing a major spike in Covid cases and fatalities. But no unanimity in SKM meeting Consensus could not be achieved on defying lockdown in Punjab and Haryana in the meeting of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha at Singhu border on Friday. Though farm groups from Punjab had put the point in the meeting, unanimity could not be reached, inside sources said. Two days ago, farm organisations of Punjab had decided to openly defy lockdown in the state and also to take shopkeepers along In view of the Covid situation, a convention proposed for May 10, to be attended by academics and intellectuals, was also postponed. Farm leader Rakesh Tikait’s group decided to take on the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, especially after its dismal performance in panchayat polls. It was stated that details would be worked out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-defy-lockdown-orders-in-punjab-farm-groups/articleshow/82470269.cms||Neel Kamal

The policy would offer incentives to encourage more investors in the sector. Speaking at a virtual session on government schemes for boosting MSMEs, organized by the Uttar Pradesh Chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Singh also invited suggestions from the association which would help in bringing out a robust policy. Singh also spoke about the need to have a robust medical and healthcare infrastructure in the state for any unforeseen contingencies or challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic. Asking the industry for some “out of the box” suggestions on how this could be done at the earliest, the minister said that the pandemic has disrupted business activities and the momentum would have to be revived by the collective efforts of the government and the industry. “The government is looking for out-of-box ideas to finance the health sector, like utilizing a portion of undisbursed money, which is already financed by the World Bank, in improving the health care sector to cater the current need. The government is already in discussions with the Asian Development Bank for financing private investment in the health sector,” he said. The minister also spoke about the need to have more medical institutions in the state and also more doctors to run these institutions. Sanjay Agarwal, President, PHDCCI, said that the resurgence of the pandemic has had a multi sector impact, especially hurting MSMEs. “This has not only impacted supply but also demand. MSMEs contribute to about 35% of the GDP but face a greater danger of closing down due to the pandemic. Around 90% MSMEs are overwhelmed due to confined work developments and required greater assistance from the government to survive this period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-framing-o2-policy-seeks-more-investors-min/articleshow/82470295.cms||---

Plants with the capacity of producing 500 litres per minute (LPM) will be set up in hospitals at Agra, Sant Kabir Nagar, Kasganj, Kaushambi, Banda, Auraiya, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Hardoi, Baghpat, Hapur, Varanasi and other districts. Similarly, the 1,000 LPM capacity plants will be established in hospitals of Azamgarh, Bareilly, Basti, Sultanpur, Lalitpur, Sitapur, Ghaziabad, Moradabad, Aligarh, Prayagraj and Pratapgarh among others. Abdul Basit, regional officer, NHAI, Lucknow, on Friday told TOI that civil and electrical works of these 25 plants will be done on war-footing and completed in seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nhai-to-complete-civil-work-of-27-o2-plants-in-seven-days/articleshow/82470303.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Citizens bridge gap between those in need of oximeters and donors||PANAJI: Citizens in the state are running from one pharmacy to another to buy oximeters. With these devices, used to measure oxygen saturation level, in short supply, good Samaritans have stepped forward to bridge the gap and have volunteered to collect used oximeters from recovered patients and provide them to those in home-isolation. Students of Don Bosco College have created a document on Google Forms using which those owning oximeters can submit their details and offer their devices. Based on this inventory, the students will collect the oximeters and then deliver them to those in need. “There is a shortage of oximeters to such an extent that home isolation kits are being distributed without them. We are willing to personally deliver these to home isolated patients and to hospitals if required,” one of the students involved in the initiative, computer engineering student Shivam Naik said. Similarly, another group of youngsters have also created a Google Forms document appealing to people to revert with these devices so that they could donate them to those in need. Gabriella Periera, whose family owns a chain of supercenters in the state, took to social media to appeal to recovered patients and their families to drop off their oximeters at any of her outlets. “I had two oximeters at home and so assumed that there would be many like me who would have them but no longer require them. If people are happy to buy and donate, we would be extremely grateful, but if people do have extras at home, we would urge them to give them up so that we can donate them to PHCs, doctors and needy patients,” she said. Rotary Clubs across the state have also put their hands together to use their manpower to collect and distribute used oximeters. “There is a dire need of oximeters and we will give them to IMA doctors and simultaneously procure new ones so that we can provide them to people. Once they are done using the devices, they can return them to us, so that we can then pass them on to the next patient in need,” a Vasco club member Salil Kosambe said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-bridge-gap-between-those-in-need-of-oximeters-and-donors/articleshow/82470307.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP MLA Dal Bahadur Kori dies of Covid, CM Yogi Adityanath expresses grief||LUCKNOW: The deadly second wave of coronavirus pandemic on Friday claimed the life of BJP MLA from Rae Bareli’s Salon (reserved) seat, Dal Bahadur Kori (65), making him the fourth BJP lawmaker to have fallen victim to the virus within a fortnight. Earlier, BJP’s Auraiyya MLA Ramesh Chandra Diwakar, Lucknow (west) MLA Suresh Srivastava and MLA from Nawabganj in Bareilly Kesar Singh had succumbed to coronavirus infection. Later, Diwakar’s father died of heart attack while Srivastava’s wife also passed away due to Covid, barely 48 hours after her husband’s death. In the first coronavirus wave last year, the BJP government had lost two of its ministers – Chetan Chauhan and Kamal Rani Varun. CM Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh expressed grief over the death of Kori, who was admitted to a private hospital in Lucknow 15 days ago. He breathed his last after his condition deteriorated earlier this morning. Kori, who was associated with the Ram temple movement, saw many ups and downs during 30 years of his political career. He contested UP assembly elections for the first time in 1991 but lost to Congress’s Shiv Balak Pasi by a margin of 10,500 votes. In 1996 assembly polls, he defeated Pasi by around 5,000 votes and went on to become a minister in the Rajnath Singh government. Kori received a setback in 2002 elections when he lost Salon to Samajwadi Party’s Asha Kishor. In fact, he finished a distant third garnering only 18.5% votes. A jolted Kori left the BJP and joined BSP, but that hardly made any difference as he again lost Salon to Congress’s Shiv Balak Pasi in 2007 assembly elections, despite the strong wave in favour of BSP president Mayawati, who stormed to power in UP with absolute majority for the first time. Kori stood third garnering 21% votes. Kori returned to saffron fold and contested from Salon in 2012 assembly elections, only to be defeated for the fourth time (11% votes). Riding on a strong Narendra Modi wave, Kori finally won the seat in 2017 state elections bagging nearly 42% votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-mla-dal-bahadur-dies-of-covid-cm-expresses-grief/articleshow/82470308.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Lucknow||Covid-19 queries flood Ramzan helplines in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: What if one develops fever during roza (fasting)? How can one compensate the loss of roza due to Covid-19 management? Can zakat (donation) be given to provide food and medicines to a Covid-19 patient in the neighbourhood? Is it haram (prohibited) to take vaccine during roza? These are some of the queries that are flooding Shia and Sunni helplines in the city as coronavirus pandemic weighs heavy on the minds of rozedars during the holy month of Ramzan. On an average, 30-40% of the queries on helplines are related to Covid-19. “The world is passing through an unprecedented crisis and uncertainty is affecting everyone. The sentiment is bound to reflect on the thought process of rozedars as well. We try to clear their doubts in the light of the Quran and Hadis,” said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali of the Islamic Centre of India. Maulana Saif Abbas, whose team runs a helpline for Shias, said: “People have stress and doubts on how to follow the rules and regulations for Ramzan during the pandemic. Our helpline tries to simplify things for believers. About 25-30% queries are related to pandemic alone.” Clerics said most of the people ask if a person with co-morbid conditions can observe fast or not. Many Muslim doctors, nurses and health staff on Covid duty also took help in choosing between the call of duty in these extraordinary times and call of religious duty. “The answer is simple. If a doctor advises a person not to keep a fast, the religion exempts him/her. They can compensate by making donations, especially by giving food to the needy,” said Maulana Saif. Maulana Khalid Rasheed said besides attending to questions, the helpline served as a platform to create awareness on pandemic. “In the process of clearing the doubts, the helpline staff also informed people about the precautions one needs to take to keep trouble away,” he said. He said many callers were also counselled to help them overcome the guilt of not being able to observe fast. “Many people were advised by their doctors not to observe fast because they had post-Covid symptoms or belonged to high-risk category. Such people felt guilty and looked for ways to compensate,” the cleric said. The helpline staff said many callers asked about the use of alcohol-based sanitizer. “We told them that it was a misconception. Even mosques are cleaned with liquid sanitizer,” said Maulana Rasheed Farangi Mahali. Many persons asked if taking steam during roza would break the fast. Experts replied that steam inhalation would break the fast. If steam is mandatory and life-saving in view of the physician, then one should not observe fast, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-19-queries-flood-ramzan-helplines/articleshow/82470317.cms||Shailvee Sharda

According to the official data, as many as 372 deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours. With this, the total lives lost to the pandemic reached 14,873. Data showed that Kanpur recorded a maximum of 31 deaths followed by 30 casualties in Hapur. In Lucknow, death of 25 persons was reported. But the pattern of death in remote districts is steadily going up. While Ghazipur saw 18 deaths, 16 patients died in Hardoi and 15 lives were lost in Gorakhpur. Officials urged people not to take the pandemic situation lightly and follow all relevant precautions to keep trouble away. The bulletin also indicated that despite decline in case positivity rate, Lucknow (1,982) remained the top contributor of new cases followed by Meerut (1,817), Gautam Budh Nagar (1,288) and Saharanpur (1,122). Meanwhile, the government is pushing Covid-19 vaccination in a big way especially among the 18 plus persons.

---||Lucknow||Running for glory: Army veteran qualifies for Boston Marathon||LUCKNOW: After Covid-19 pandemic dashed his dreams of running the prestigious Boston Marathon last year, 60-year-old army veteran, Col (retd) Bajrang B Singh, has again qualified for the 125th Boston Marathon scheduled on October 11 this year. Last year’s marathon was deferred and converted into a virtual experience due to the pandemic in which Singh finished first among Indian participants. Despite the reduced number entries, Singh made the cut this time and will travel to Boston in October to realise his dreams on the American turf. “I am delighted to receive a confirmation of acceptance from the Boston Athletic Association. Even with high cut off, I am proud to have qualified for the iconic marathon. I hope the pandemic doesn’t play spoilsport this time,” Singh told TOI. In the virtual experience, Singh ran the marathon in Lucknow and finished in 3 hours, 38 minutes and three seconds — his best so far. This year, the organisers of Boston Marathon have decided to shift the qualifying period backwards by one year and accept previous races to decide the selection. “This means that athletes who have participated in races between September 2018 and September 2020 and have achieved the qualifying standard of the BAA have been selected. Unlike previous year when qualifiers who were 1 minute and 39 seconds faster than the qualifying time were accepted, it has gone up to 7 minutes and 47 seconds this time,” Singh said. “Due to stringent rules, many qualifiers across the world have been rejected. My best in formal race in a marathon is 3 hours, 40minutes and 32 seconds in Hyderabad,” Singh said. He will be accompanied by his wife, Asha Singh, who is also an athlete and has sacrificed Chicago Marathon event slated for October 10 to be with her husband. In view of the pandemic, Singh has limited his practice to the boundaries of his house. “It has been extremely difficult and unsafe to have proper practice amid coronavirus spread. I am trying to maintain my base fitness. The real training will begin after there is some respite from pandemic,” Singh said. An ex-serviceman, Singh discovered his passion for running after retirement. He took part in his first race (10-km run) in 2016 in Pune, when he was 56. “What started as a small step ended up becoming a long journey,” recalls Singh. He later ran his first full marathon in Goa, followed by a half-marathon in Pune. Four years later, he has 70 competitive races with 30 half-marathons (21.1 km), 15 full marathons (42.2 km) under his belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/running-for-glory-army-veteran-qualifies-for-boston-marathon/articleshow/82470329.cms||Isha Jain
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Patients dying due to oxygen shortage’, writes BJP MLA to Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: BJP MLA from Mohammadi constituency in Kheri, Lokendra Pratap Singh, on Friday claimed that several Covid patients in his district have died because of the lack of oxygen in the past few days. In a letter sent to CM Yogi Adityanath, the MLA claimed that the CHCs and PHCs in his constituency are facing oxygen shortage which has further aggravated the crisis. In the letter – which went viral on social media – Singh said that the demand for 10 oxygen concentrators in every assembly constituency also remained unfulfilled. He said though the state government has stepped up efforts to tackle the pandemic, they are going in vain in the wake of shortage of oxygen supply. The BJP lawmaker said that his district is reeling under severe onslaught of pandemic and he has been rendered as a mute spectator. “We are not able to save anyone. Be it political leaders, government employees, lawyers, journalist or teachers,” he said in the letter. Recently, BJP MPs, Kaushal Kishore (Mohanlalganj) and Rajendra Agarwal (Meerut), had also expressed their anguish over the state government failure to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen and Remdesivir to the Covid patients in their constituencies. Earlier, UP minister Brijesh Pathak had also said that the health officials never picked up phones and that there were neither beds at the hospitals nor ambulances to carry the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patients-dying-due-to-oxygen-shortage-bjp-mla-writes-to-yogi/articleshow/82470336.cms||---
---||Goa||Stay Home Goa||GOA: The first week of May has seen more Goans die of Covid-19 than in the first seven months of the pandemic. That Goa is facing an unprecedented public health crisis is now beyond doubt, aided and abetted by a dithering government that let things get out of hand. For weeks, this newspaper has been demanding the government strictly enforce its rules and take responsibility for the lives of the people. Unfortunately, for reasons best known to it, it refused to acknowledge the ferocity of the pandemic. Since then, the virus has decimated the state and its healthcare infrastructure. Goa’s positivity rate remains over 50%, making the state perhaps the most affected area in the world. The daily scenes of death at hospital wards have left even doctors facing mental trauma. While there was no shortage of misplaced overconfidence from the government, there seems to be a shortage of everything else—oxygen, home isolation kits, pulse oximeters, and most importantly, strategy. In short, if you need medical attention right now, you may not get it. In the absence of a capable government, it’s now every person for themselves. To slightly misquote the CM, ‘bhonvpachi garaz na’ (there’s no need to roam). It’s imperative to stay home at all costs, and venture outside only if unavoidable. Goa has among the highest proportion of senior citizens in the country, and this category remains the most vulnerable to the virus. The government must now focus on vaccination and do everything in its power to get vaccines into arms. It can perhaps take a leaf out of Mumbai's book, and start drive-through vaccination points. There is a fear of getting infected by the virus at vaccination centres. To combat this, the government could also use large open spaces, such as the Campal grounds, for vaccination. Door-to-door administration of the jab is also something it could take up with the Centre, citing Goa’s special case. The next few weeks look bleak, and citizens cannot and must not accept 50-60 deaths a day as a “new normal”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stay-home-goa/articleshow/82470339.cms||---

It may not be sharp or smooth… it can be intermittent having smaller highs and lows which usually remain below the pinnacle.” Read AlsoUP registers record rise of 372 Covid-19 deaths, adds 28,076 casesUttar Pradesh on Friday saw a record single-day jump of 372 Covid-19 deaths and 28,076 fresh cases, even as a senior health ministry official said the second wave of coronavirus seemed to have crossed its peak in the state.In terms of Covid-19, data analysts and statistical modelling specialists over the world use new cases and active cases as a tool to determine the peak of a pandemic. A decline on these two counts is seen as an indicator that the peak has passed and, according to officials, the data suggests so. The maximum number of daily cases in UP (38,055) were reported on April 24 and has been declining since then. Likewise, the highest number of active cases in the state (3,10,783) was recorded on April 30 after which it has been showing a downward trend. The case positivity rate, or the number of people testing positive among those tested, is also a crucial indicator to show that the peak has passed. Read AlsoUP: Covid-19 victim's son alleges hospital staff demanding bribe for handing over bodyThe son of an 80-year-old woman alleged on Sunday that the staff of a government hospital here was not handing over her body and demanding Rs 8,000 for it.Acknowledging the trend, secretary to CM Yogi Adityanath, Alok Kumar-III, who is monitoring the growth pattern of the pandemic, said: “State’s CPR has come down by almost five percentage points over the past one and a half weeks which is a good sign.” According to officials, data from the state health department proves the point. UP’s CPR has gone down from 24.1% during April 21-27 to 18.8% between April 28 and May 4. CPR of private labs may also be used to gauge the trend. A pilot assessment in Lucknow indicated that CPR in private labs has gone down from about 76% in mid-April to 38% now.

TheCase positivity in districts like Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi and Prayagraj, where Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc, has also come down. “The peak may have come down only because of an all-out attack on the virus. The strategy includes aggressive testing, restrictions, mass sensitisation and cleanliness. Individual contribution to control the virus through adherence of Covid-19 prevention protocol remains the key to save people from suffering. Therefore, no one should drop the guard,” said Dr PK Gupta of the UP chapter of Indian Medical Association.

The government also cautioned hospitals against projecting an artificial shortage of oxygen. A government spokesperson said: “Efforts are being made to create an artificial scarcity of beds and oxygen by various private hospitals in different districts. It has also been reported that some private hospitals are charging more than the fees fixed by the government. These types of activities are criminal and strict action has been taken against a few.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NIA collects FIR, info on 7kg uranium seizure case||Mumbai: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday collected the FIR and other information on the seizure of 7.1 kg natural uranium from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS). The ATS on Wednesday arrested two men, including a Mankhurd scrap dealer, for illegally possessing and trying to sell the radioactive uranium worth Rs 21.3 crore. “We have given them (NIA) the FIR copy and relevant information about the case,” confirmed a senior state ATS officer. The two accused, Thane resident Jigar Pandya (27) and scrap dealer Abu Tahir Choudhary (31), were booked under sections of the Atomic Energy Act 1962. This is a scheduled offence under the NIA Act, and hence they were produced before an NIA court which remanded them in police custody till May 12. It is, however, still not clear whether the NIA will initiate its own probe too. In February, the ATS received a tipoff that Pandya was trying to sell pieces of a uranium substance. The ATS sent a dummy customer who bought some for over Rs 1 lakh and then sent it to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay for analysis. During questioning, Pandya said he got the uranium from Choudhary. On Wednesday, the BARC report confirmed it was uranium and the duo was arrested. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-collects-fir-info-on-7kg-uranium-seizure-case/articleshow/82470622.cms||---

The facility will start from May 10 and this can be availed through the Covid helpline 1950. The district administration has partnered with a social organisation named Swasti, to prevent panic among patients. Under this initiative, psychologists and trained counsellors will be counselling patients so that they do not panic and maintain their mental well-being which would help them in their recovery. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, “At present, many types of rumours are being circulated on various social media platforms about Covid infection, due to which it is natural for a person to develop a state of fear and panic. It is very important for the patient to have correct information about treatment as the health of the patient can be adversely affected due to anxiety. Keeping all these aspects in mind, we have started this initiative and have jointly created a team of mental health experts with the NGO.” “Anyone who is under home isolation can avail this facility through the Covid helpline and it will be free of cost. Our team will record all their details, then information will be shared with psychologists and trained counsellors who will call the people and help them by clearing their doubt about Covid-related issues or any other stress, anxiety, sadness, sleep disorder etc. that they are dealing with,” said the senior official of the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/patients-at-home-to-get-free-counselling/articleshow/82470738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Man fakes appointment as Ratnagiri collector, held||Mumbai: A week ago, it was brought to the notice of Ratnagiri collector Laxminarayan Mishra that a letter appointing 35-year-old Arjun Sankapal as his replacement had gone viral. The brief order on the letterhead of the state government’s general administration department was in the usual format and signed by the deputy secretary (GAD). Everything seemed in order, except that Mishra had not heard anything about a transfer. He decided to take a closer look. The letter was found to be fake and he knocked on the doors of the police superintendent. An offence was registered against the Kolhapur-based Sankapal, who was arrested and later released on bail. Officials are aghast at the audacity of Sankapal, who eyed a collector’s post based on a fake order. An inquiry revealed that Sankapal had been living a lie for a long time. The arts graduate had attempted the civil services examination five years ago. He did not succeed, but he told his family he had passed and would soon take over as a district collector. A huge procession was taken out in his Karvir village in Kolhapur district to celebrate the achievement. After that he left Kolhapur district and would occasionally visit his village in swanky cars. He misled villagers, saying he had been appointed collector but never gave the name of the district. From the days when he was preparing for his UPSC examination, Sankapal used to teach IAS and IPS aspirants. Subsequently, he got married to a student, whose father was a retired police officer, said a senior official. When his in-laws buttonholed him on his posting, he created four fake orders with the help of a friend in Kolhapur and pacified them. The fake order for his appointment as Ratnagiri collector was made on the basis of past orders issued by the GAD. “He just inserted his own name in the appointment order signed by the deputy secretary,” the official said. The forgery was good enough for many in the Konkan region to believe Mishra had been transferred and Sankapal appointed in his place. Mishra, himself, finally burst Sankapal’s balloon. Mishra refused to comment on the episode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-man-fakes-appointment-as-ratnagiri-collector-held/articleshow/82470747.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Realty firm, founder booked for ‘cheating’ former CEO||Gurgaon: A real estate firm, which launched Trump Towers in Gurgaon and Kolkata, and its founder-director have been booked for allegedly duping its former CEO of Rs 7.5 crore, on the orders of a city court. The firm’s management is accused of inducing IIM-Calcutta alumnus Manish Jaiswal to join them by promising buyback of equity partnership at the time of his exit, which was never fulfilled. Manish joined Tribeca in June 2015 as a full-time partner to help set up the firm’s real estate business. In his complaint, he alleged that Kalpesh Mehta, the firm’s founder, promised him equity of up to 5% with a buyback assurance. Over the next four years, Tribeca’s real estate arm launched Trump Towers Gurgaon and Trump Towers Kolkata, both of which raked in more than Rs 1,200 crore of sales. “For creating stellar results, I was also promoted to CEO’s position by Kalpesh with some more promises,” he said. In July 2019, Manish resigned from the company and requested for the buyback of his equity shares.  “The value of my equity stake at the time was more than Rs 30 crore based on market estimates. Even though I agreed to a much lower amount of Rs 7.5 crore in November 2019, Mehta never gave me any money even after following up for months. I was left with no option but to approach the Gurgaon court,” he said. Based on the court’s order, an FIR was lodged on April 25 at Sector 53 police station against Tribeca and Kalpesh under sections 403, 406, 420, 467 and 471 of the IPC.  Tribeca challenged the order of the Gurgaon court in the Punjab and Haryana high court but the plea was dismissed on May 3. In its statement, Tribeca said Manish is a disgruntled ex-employee, who was caught performing serious illegal activities against the firm. “This current complaint by Manish is nothing but a facade to defend his previous illegal acts. The claims made in the complaint are false and preposterous. We are not aware of any company in the world that gives assurance of equity buybacks to employees. We certainly did not give any such assurances...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/realty-firm-founder-booked-for-cheating-former-ceo/articleshow/82470789.cms||---
---||India||At 4,187, India records its highest 1-day Covid deaths||India’s Covid-19 wave crossed another grim milestone with the country reporting more than 4,000 deaths from the virus in a single day, even as daily cases stayed over 4 lakh for the third day running. India reported 4,187 fatalities on Friday, only the third country after the US and Brazil to report more than 4,000 deaths in a day. As per worldometers.info, the highest single-day toll in any country is 4,490 deaths reported in the US on January 12. With 4,01,522 fresh cases reported on Friday, as per TOI’s Covid database, India has recorded more cases in 82 days of the second Covid wave than in over a year prior to that. Since February 14, the country has documented 1,09,68,039 cases of the coronavirus as opposed to 1,09,16,481 cases recorded from January 30 last year till February 14 this year. Although no single day can be pinned down as the start of the second wave in the country, February 14 is the date since when the seven-day rolling average of daily cases in India has risen uninterruptedly. In other words, India’s Covid caseload has doubled in 82 days — a very rapid surge considering the number that has doubled is 1.1 crore. Assuming that the first wave in the country really began from April 1 last year, the second wave has already seen four times higher daily case counts than the first. There have been more than 82,000 recorded Covid deaths in the country since February 14, more than half of all earlier fatalities. India has recorded a total of 2,38,197 Covid-related deaths so far. On Friday, at least five states reported their highest daily death toll from the pandemic. These included Karnataka, which saw a big surge in deaths with 592 people succumbing to the virus. Other states where the highest daily tolls were recorded were Uttar Pradesh (372 deaths), Tamil Nadu (197), Rajasthan (164) and Himachal Pradesh (56). Maharashtra continued to report the highest number of fatalities at 898. Other states where the toll continued to be high were Delhi (341), Chhattisgarh (208), Punjab (165), Haryana (162), Uttarakhand (137), Jharkhand (136) and Bengal (112), among others. The total death toll crossed the 10,000 mark in Punjab and Chhattisgarh on Friday. In all, the Covid toll has topped 10,000 in eight states. Punjab has the highest case fatality rate in the country CFR at 2.4%.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP ‘smells a scam’, seeks inquiry into MLA hostel||Mumbai: The Rs 900 crore redevelopment of MLA hostel Manora at Nariman Point has unleashed a war of words between the BJP and the Congress.  BJP MLA Atul Bhatkalkar has demanded an inquiry into the rise in construction cost by 66% from Rs 600 crore to Rs 900 crore in two years. “When the Fadnavis government awarded the contract to the National Building Construction Corporation, the cost was estimated at Rs 600 crore. It is alleged that the Rs 300 crore rise is for the final finish to the buildings. It smells of a scam,” said Bhatkalkar. He criticised the Congress-NCP who have been critical of PM Narendra Modi’s Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project and demanded scrapping of the project. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, on the other hand, said the project was approved by Fadnavis when the buildings could have easily been just repaired. The delay in reconstruction has already cost the government more than Rs 700 crore. Every month, every MLA is paid around Rs 1 lakh for alternate accommodation which amounts to Rs 3.5 crore per month and has added up to Rs 150 crore. Besides, the delay caused by NBCC has resulted in a loss of Rs 550 crore, said Sawant. In contrast, Sawant said the PM is already using a plush residence, and accommodation is available for MPs where the Central Vista project has been undertaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-smells-a-scam-seeks-inquiry-into-mla-hostel/articleshow/82470810.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: First dose on pause, walk in to get 2nd shot at govt centres from today||HYDERABAD: Facing a shortage of vaccines, the Telangana government on Friday said it will administer only the second dose for the time being on a walk-in basis at government centres. Addressing a media conference, the director of public health, Dr Srinivasa Rao, said from May 8-12, the second dose for people aged 45 and above will be administered and to make things easy, those who queue up at the centre will only have to show their first dose certificate at the vaccination centre. “Till the end of this month 19. 92 lakh people needs to be given their scheduled second dose, and by May 15, about 4. 9 lakh doses need to be administered, whereas the state has only 3.74 lakh doses,” said Dr Rao. “Since vaccine shortage is everywhere in the country, vaccinating people for a second dose will be the utmost priority. We have requested the Centre that we need about 2 lakh doses daily,” he added. Out of 19.92 lakh doses, the second dose of Covaxin constitutes 3.35 lakh doses, while 16. 61 lakh doses are of Covishield. In the next few days, the state is expecting 3.5 lakh doses. “We are getting a lot of requests from the people for a second dose, and the CoWin portal does not have a facility for registering for the second dose separately, and we brought this issue to the notice of the Union government, and they have agreed to this but said it would take time,” Rao said. If needed, the government is ready to buy vaccine from the companies at a cost of Rs 2,400 crore, but everything depends on the production of the vaccine, he said. Rao also urged people to wear two masks when in crowded areas. “While there is no steep rise in numbers, the situation will be like this for another three to four weeks. Until then, please don’t go out unless it is essential,” Srinivas Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-dose-on-pause-walk-in-to-get-2nd-shot-at-govt-centres-from-today/articleshow/82470820.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana extends night curfew, more curbs||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Friday extended the night curfew in the state by another seven days to 5 am on May 15. The fresh orders, issued by chief secretary Somesh Kumar, also imposed more restrictions on movement of people to check the spread of Covid-19. This is the third extension of the curfew which was imposed initially on April 20. The Telangana high court had recently asked the state government to explore stronger measures like extending hours of night curfew or a weekend lockdown to flatten the curve of the virus spread. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has, however, made it clear that the government is not in favour of a full lockdown, stating that the number of fresh cases being reported daily has started to plateau. Though there was no change in the curfew timings in the latest order - in force from 9 pm to 5 am - the state government has further restricted the attendance during marriages and funerals. The chief secretary issued separate order making it mandatory for marriages to not have more than 100 guests. The order also says that the gathering at weddings would have to ensure that protocols like social distancing and wearing masks are followed. Funerals and ceremonies for last rites will be limited to 20 people. All other gatherings like social, political, entertainment, academic, religious and cultural events continue to be prohibited. This means that it is unlikely that the annual congregational Eid-ul-Fitr prayers,likely to be celebrated on May 14, would be allowed in idgahs. All offices, firms, shops, restaurants and others would close down by 8 pm during curfew nights. Diagnostic labs, pharmacies and those dealing with supply of essential services continue to be exempted from the restrictions. Public transport, including autos and taxis would be allowed to ply within the stipulated time for transportation of the categories of persons like patients and pregnant women during night curfew. The chief secretary directed all collectors, police commissioners and superintendents of police to strictly implement the night curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-extends-night-curfew-more-curbs/articleshow/82470866.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Hyderabad||False reports on N440K trigger travel curbs on Telangana & Andhra Pradesh people||HYDERABAD: A false alarm comparing the infectivity of novel coronavirus mutant N440K with that of the double mutant of Maharashtra B.1.617 and the UK variant B.1.1.7 has created a scare in several parts of the country forcing the governments of Odisha and Delhi to impose travel restrictions, including quarantine, for travellers from both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to those places. Live updates: Coronavirus in India It all began with a group of scientists, including from the city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), publishing a preprint in online scientific portal ‘BioRxiv’ that N440K (also known as B.1.36) was 10 times more infectious than its parent lineage A2a. The research was based on laboratory results. But, the reports wrongly compared N440K with B.1.617 and B.1.1.7 leading to the scare. While B.1.1.7 has already been declared as a variant of concern (VoC), Public Health England on Friday put the sub-lineage of B.1.617 (B.1.617.2) under the VoC category. Coronavirus: Complete coverageAccording to CCMB scientists, N440K, which was widely prevalent in parts of the country, including AP and Telangana, in the first wave and later has gradually diminished giving way to the double mutant, makes up for 50-60 per cent of cases reported during April 2021. The UK variant is also present in Telugu states. At its peak, N440K caused 35-40 per cent of the positive cases in Andhra Pradesh. But, now its share is between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. Read AlsoAll we should know about the South Indian N440K COVID-19 variantAccording to the CCMB (Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology), N440K also referred to as the Andhra Pradesh variant as it was first discovered in Kurnool district, is at least 15 times more infectious than the earlier virus.Reports also wrongly called N440K as an ‘Andhra variant’ though it did not evolve in AP. The only Andhra ‘connection’ was that researchers from Kurnool Medical College were part of the team that sequenced the genome of N440K. Reports also described the variant as ‘Visakhapatnam strain’ though it was not specific to any city or state. CCMB former director Rakesh Kumar Mishra said N440K is diminishing but other variants, particularly B.1.617, are taking over its space. Read AlsoHyderabad: Mutant N440K 10 times more infectious than parent strainEven as scientists are busy decoding the potential threat of the double mutant (B.1.617), a team of researchers from Hyderabad and Ghaziabad has found that the mutant N440K of the novel coronavirus is 10 to 1,000 times more infectious than certain strains now in circulation. This mutant appears toResearcher Vishal Sah, who was part of the study of N440K and its comparison with its parent lineage, said they did not mention that N440K was more dangerous than the UK strain or the double mutant. “A few days ago, we published a preprint from our lab that N440K variant has more infectious fitness than its parent lineage A2a (also known as D614G mutant or B.1.1.8) and an unrelated A3i variant (also known as B.6). We have also suggested that based on the sequence information on GISAID till April 24, 2021, the proportion of N440K variants are increasing, clustering in some regions more than the others,” Sah said, adding that the study did not say N440K was the deadliest. KS Jawahar Reddy, chairman, AP State Covid Command Control Centre, said that B.1.617 was present in AP and Telangana. “B.1.617 is spreading quickly in India. The variant was detected in samples collected from Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Delhi, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, AP and Telangana. According to the World Health Organisation, this Indian strain has been detected in at least 17 countries, including the UK, the US and Singapore,” Jawahar Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/false-reports-on-n440k-trigger-travel-curbs-on-t-ap-people/articleshow/82470900.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Most Googled in Telangana & Andhra Pradesh: Remdesivir vial||HYDERABAD: What’s in Remdesivir? Well, it’s the most ‘searched’ word in Google Search in the last one week amplifying the desperation of people facing shortage of Remdesivir injections to tackle Covid-19 cases. Telangana stood third followed by its neighbour Andhra Pradesh in Google Search trends for Remdesivir. Karnataka and Delhi topped the search charts. Not just Remdesivir, people’s anguish for oxygen was very much felt as oxygen also became the most searched term on Google in the past seven days. Delhi stood on top followed by Haryana, Uttarakhand, Goa and Karnataka. AP was in seventh position for oxygen search. Among the cities for most searches for Remdesivir came from Vijayapura, Bidar, Hassan, Kalaburagi and Bengaluru in Karnataka, followed by Khammam, Warangal, Karimnagar in Telangana; Guntur, Vijayawada, Ongole and Vizianagaram in AP. Experts said this only indicates severe shortage of Remdesivir injections coupled with the worsening Covid-19 situation in these states. Search for Remdesivir in the country started rising significantly from April 3 and touched a peak on April 18 and began a downward trend since then. When the search period of 90 days for Remdesivir is considered, Maharashtra and Gujarat were on top followed by Delhi and Chhattisgarh. Telangana stood in 12th and AP 16th among the sub-regions from where the searches came. Among the cities for 90 days, most searches for Remdesivir came from Nashik, Thane, Nagpur, Navi Mumbai and Pimpri-Chinchwad in Maharashtra, followed by Vadodara in Gujarat and Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. Data security researcher Srinivas Kodali told TOI, “If the terms ‘Remdesivir’ and ‘oxygen’ are increasingly searched on Google, it means that people are unable to access this injection and oxygen. Governments are telling that they are available. In that case, people do not know where to get them. Ideally, hospitals are supplied with medicines and oxygen. Then, why would individuals search for them. This means hospitals are facing shortage and are asking the patients to get them.” He added: “It also signifies that in some places spread of Covid-19 is significant and at the same time, there is a shortage of medicines and oxygen. The government is in a denial mode while search trends indicate people are desperate.” Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat warned online fraudsters indulging in sale of Remdesivir. “Do not believe in online ads for Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections. It is a fraud. These people will say that they will supply them at your doorstep,” he said. Among the cities for oxygen search in the past seven days, Nacholi, Gurgaon and Faridabad in Haryana; Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi came out on top. For the search term oxygen on Google in the past 90 days, Delhi topped the charts followed by Union territories of Daman Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli. Telangana was in 14th position. Delhi topped the search list for hospital beds in the last seven days followed by Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Haryana and West Bengal. Among the cities, a majority of the searches came from Haryana, UP and Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-googled-in-t-ap-remdesivir-vial/articleshow/82470977.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kolkata||Vaccine pricing ‘arbitrary’, Bengal moves Supreme Court seeking uniformity||KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Friday moved the Supreme Court challenging the differential vaccine prices as “arbitrary and discriminatory”, and seeking the court’s direction to the Centre to cap vaccine prices at a uniform fixed rate. The state has also urged the court to direct the Centre to factor in the state’s interest while diverting any liquid medical oxygen (LMO) outside the state, in view of an expected spike in requirements. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, raising her concerns about oxygen availability. She informed him that the oxygen requirement in Bengal had gone up to 470MT per day in the last 24 hours, because of the rising caseload, and this was expected to increase to 550MT per day in the next seven-eight days. The apex court plea, filed by state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, states that the “basis for arriving at the figures of Rs 400 (now Rs 300) and Rs 600, for Covishield and Covaxin, respectively, is completely opaque and in fact higher than the cost per dose for Covid-19 vaccines across the world”. “The Covid-19 vaccination policy must be underpinned by the principle that we are as strong as our weakest link,” the petition argues. “A single person deprived of vaccination would be to the collective detriment of a large section of society.” Stating that the right to health was a fundamental right, the government claimed that it was both the “legal and moral responsibility” of the Centre “to reimburse” the state “for the costs incurred by it towards vaccinating its residents”, and the Centre should intervene by capping the price of vaccines at an “affordable and uniform” rate. The petition argues that the Centre’s vaccine policy has compelled states to buy vaccines from the open market, “where higher prices are fixed by the two vaccine manufacturers. Therefore, the cost of vaccinating the 18 to 45 demographic shall either be borne by the individual states, or the individual citizen seeking vaccination from a private hospital.” The chief minister, in her letter addressed to the PM, questioned the logic of the Centre allocating 308MT oxygen per day to Bengal, despite the state’s requirements set to increase to 550MT. “I would request you to kindly have the allocation of medical oxygen reviewed and issue instructions for an immediate allocation of at least 550MT per day, preferably out of the total produced medical oxygen [560MT] in West Bengal. It will help us in making necessary logistics arrangements and to ensure smooth supply of medical oxygen to all health facilities of Bengal,” the CM wrote. She reminded the PM that allocation of anything less than the requested amount would not help, and would likely cause loss of life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-pricing-arbitrary-bengal-moves-sc-seeking-uniformity/articleshow/82471046.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Post-poll violence in Bengal: 5-judge Calcutta high court bench seeks government report||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Friday formed a five-judge bench to hear a PIL on post-poll violence in Bengal and asked the state government to file a report “specifying the areas where violence has taken place and steps taken to prevent or control it”. The HC wanted to know “the latest status of law-and-order situation in the state” when it would hear the matter again next Monday. One of the two PILs also brought up the issue of fake images being posted on social media to foment communal riots.  Petitioner Anindya Sundar Das’s advocate, Uday Shankar Chatterjee, argued post-poll violence was not new to Bengal but this time there was an attempt to instigate communal riots, which needed to be stopped immediately. The court felt there was a need to “constitute a larger bench... considering that life and liberty of people in Bengal” were at stake. The five-member bench comprises acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar. State advocate-general Kishore Dutta opposed the petition, saying that a new government had taken charge barely two days ago and had already taken several steps to stem the violence. Dutta then sought an adjournment to file an affidavit by the state home secretary. State additional solicitor-general YJ Dastoor, who represented the Centre, too, opposed the petition, claiming it was not maintainable. He also disputed the allegations of instigation of communal riots. The state government has blamed ill-considered transfers of senior police officers and their replacement by “incompetent officers” by the Election Commission for the situation in Bengal. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the next of kin of the 16 people who died over the last few days. The development in court coincided with the visit of a four-member union home ministry team to Bengal “to assess the ground situation” following the announcement of poll results on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/5-judge-hc-bench-seeks-govt-report-on-violence/articleshow/82471119.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||CID makes 1st arrests for fake news; FIR against Kangana||Kolkata: Cops have made the first arrests for the fake posts on violence in Bengal that have flooded social media since the announcement of the assembly poll results on May 2. The arrests by the CID’s cyber cell happened on Friday, a day after an FIR was registered against actor Kangana Ranaut at Ultadanga police station for her hate comments on social media, including one alleging “Hindu genocide” in the state. Kolkata Police’s cyber cell had earlier lodged two complaints against her but none of them was converted into an FIR, officials said. Twitter permanently suspended Ranaut’s account earlier this week. City police cyber cell officials registered a separate case — its third since the poll results — against the fake news on the state BJP’s social media pages that initially tried to pass off Delhi-based journalist Abhro Banerjee as a Sitalkuchi “martyr”. The post — and Banerjee’s social media response that he was “(still) alive... and hale and hearty” — went viral, prompting the BJP to clarify several hours later that his image was “erroneously included” in a video. City cops on Friday said the case “did not appear to be so simple”. Akash Mandal was allegedly uploading fake videos on social media and Arghya Sarkar, also in his 20s, was an information technology student, officials said. “We lodged two separate FIRs on Monday for intentional insult, breach of peace, public mischief and criminal conspiracy. We contacted Facebook and Twitter and nabbed the accused with their help. We have sought similar help in several other cases,” Mukherjee said. “Initial investigations indicate Mandal was using a fake profile to post fake posts on Facebook. We want to know whether he was operating alone or was part of a group,” an investigator said. The city police also sent legal notices to six social media users to record their statements on specific allegations against them for spreading fake news. Officials did not divulge the identity of those summoned or their political affiliations. KP and CID continued to flag fake posts all through Friday, an exercise that they began on Monday. Among the flagged videos and posts were old images of violence from protests in Bangladesh, Odisha’s Bhadrak and Bengal’s Raniganj. “A few genuine suicides are also being passed off as murders,” read another alert by East Burdwan police. Citizens could report fake news to cops by Twitter or email or phone, KP joint commissioner of police (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said. The CID has also launched a special helpline number (033-24506124) to report fake news.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cid-makes-1st-arrests-for-fake-news-fir-against-kangana/articleshow/82471216.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||No ex-post facto CRZ nod for projects till next hearing in Mumbai: HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday in an interim order restrained, till the next date, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate from granting any permissions to projects under its February 19, 2021 administrative circular which permits ex-post facto approval of projects that have not obtained a statutory CRZ clearance. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni passed the interim order in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by an environmental non-governmental organization (NGO), Vanashakti. The PIL, through advocate Zaman Ali, challenged the constitutional validity of the state’s circular as it empowered coastal authorities to regularize all kinds of Coastal Zone Regulation violations on a day-to-day basis, making it easier for environmental violators to evade substantive law. The HC fixed the PIL for final hearing on June 30. Senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond, with Akash Rebello, had at the earlier hearing on April 29 argued that the CRZ regulations of 2011, meant to ensure balanced development while protecting the environment, have sought to be amended by an “executive fiat”. Such circular or office memorandum would “dilute the rigours of the statutory mandate in the Environment Protection Act as well as other law.” Considering the importance of the issue raised, the HC had sought the presence of additional solicitor general Anil Singh—the highest law officer representing the Centre in HC—to appear on May 6. At the hearing on Friday, Singh said no permissions were granted so far by the MoEF. The HC also stated that if any permission has been granted or any application received for any such CRZ regularisation by alleged violator since 19.02.2021 till date, then such persons and industries will be informed of the pending PIL and such permissions or applications will be subjected to its outcome. The court observed, prima facie, that the administrative circular appears to have incorrectly relied on the Supreme Court judgment in Alembic Pharmaceuticals where the SC had held that revocation of environmental clearance by the National Green Tribunal was not warranted, on principles of proportionality. The SC had noted, however, that “penalties must be imposed for the disobedience with a binding legal regime.” The PIL said the CRZ notification of 2011 does not provide for any ex-post fact (after the fact) and the office memorandum or circular was issued by MoEFCC “without following any procedure under the EP Act.” It added that such clearance is alien to the environmental law jurisprudence since prior to a CRZ nod, there has to be careful application of mind based on a study into likely consequences of any proposed development on the environment. A CRZ nod is necessary to determine the type of industry that can be safely set up in a coastal area or an ecologically sensitive area covered by the CRZ notification. And permitting a clearance later would “bypass this most crucial stage and condone the operation of industrial activity without grant of CRZ clearance” , the PIL said. The HC order says, “In our prima facie view, contents of the office memorandum under challenge have the efect of diluting the rigours of the provisions of the Environment Act and other related enactments. We also fnd that the said OM refers to the decision of the Supreme Court dated April 1, 2020 (Alembic Pharmaceutical Limited Vs. Rohit Prajapati)...Quite unusuall , the Government despite being bound by the ratio decidendi of such decision, has elected to follow the directions contained in the said decision which were issued under Article 142 of the Constitution.” The SC had observed that “ex-post facto environmental clearance (EC) was in derogation of the fundamental principles of environmental jurisprudence and is an anathema to the EIA notification."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-ex-post-facto-crz-nod-for-projects-till-next-hearing-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/82471236.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||‘Centre’s hatred for Maharashtra evident from its aid distribution’||Mumbai: Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Friday alleged that the NDA government’s hatred towards Maharashtra is evident from the way the state is being discriminated against over distribution of foreign relief received by the Centre to fight the pandemic. “There is blatant injustice towards Maharashtra in distribution of foreign aid and the BJP, particularly leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, owe an explaination to the people of Maharashtra. Being a former CM of the state himself, we were expecting Fadnavis to use his clout, but he is indulging in petty politics,” said Sawant. Sawant alleged that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has excluded Maharashtra from the list of states where it plans to distribute aid from 40 countries. “Initially, the NDA government sat on the relief material for a long time, and when they did start distribution, priority was given to BJP-ruled UP, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana,” he said. Congress condemned the NDA government for its indifferent attitude towards Maharashtra. “We have information that 25 aircraft have arrived in India from different countries. Many people of Indian origin too have contributed towards relief fund, but no help has come for Maharashtra. Since Maharashtra is governed by non-BJP parties, NDA government is indulging in such unfair activities,” alleged Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centres-hatred-for-maharashtra-evident-from-its-aid-distribution/articleshow/82471322.cms||---

---||Business||Not just vaccine, India seeks patent waiver for Covid meds too||NEW DELHI: South Africa, India and other developing countries are expected to demand TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) waiver for Covid-19 drugs and medical tools in addition to vaccines. With US Trade Representative Katharine Tai indicating American support only for talks on patent flexibility for vaccines at the WTO, the scope of the proposed waiver could turn out to be the next sticking point. In October, India and South Africa had submitted a joint proposal, which had just outlined the broad areas of TRIPS waiver. The revised draft will provide the scope, in terms of coverage as well as the duration, which could be longer than originally expected. "Intellectual property is not the only barrier but definitely a significant barrier that can impact production of medical tools.... The scope (of the waiver) should cover health products and technology, including diagnostics, therapeutics, medical products and personal equipment," South Africa's ambassador to WTO Xolelwa Mlumbi-Peter said at an online panel discussion. Several patented medicines, which have been repurposed, are being commonly prescribed to tackle severe infection. The group of 60-odd developing countries is also insisting that negotiations for a deal should start in a few weeks so that it can be finalized at the earliest. "We have suggested that the TRIPS Council should meet in the second half of May itself, instead of waiting until next month," said an officer. Experts too have said that time is of essence as a delay in supplying vaccines will adversely impact a larger population. Earlier this week, India's ambassador to WTO Brajendra Navnit had suggested to the multilateral body that TRIPS waiver could be part of the deliverables ahead of the ministerial meeting in late November. The proponents have argued that the current vaccine production capacity of 3.5 billion doses a year is inadequate when the requirement is around 14 billion. Given the idle capacity, production can be ramped up from the current level to nearly a billion doses a month. India has suggested that a global vaccination drive is needed to tackle Covid-19, just like the initiatives to deal with smallpox, measles and more recently polio. Nearly 1.5 billion vaccine doses may be needed to be produced every month. “In the first quarter we can expect the idle capacity to be used and over the next two-three quarters brownfield investment will flow,” said an official. Countering the impact on pharma companies, which claim to have invested heavily in developing the vaccines, government sources said that the impact on pharma companies will be far lower than the loss in lives and lower economic activity due to the pandemic.

---||Mumbai||CBDT: Can pay Rs 2 lakh in cash for Covid care||MUMBAI: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has recognised the issues faced by individuals who were unable to pay Covid-related hospital bills exceeding Rs 2 lakh in cash, owing to income-tax regulations that prohibited hospitals and nursing homes from accepting such large cash payments. The stringent provisions have been relaxed up to May 31. Families of patients who are not net savvy were hard hit as they could not pay the bills via net-banking facilities. Hospitals typically do not accept cheques and there are limits on debit and credit cards. The CBDT notification covers hospitals, dispensaries, nursing homes, Covid care centres or similar other medical facilities. Cash payments for Covid treatment exceeding Rs 2 lakh, can be received by these medical facilities during the period April 1 up to May end, on obtaining the PAN or Aadhaar of the patient and the payer. The relationship between the two has also to be noted by the recipient medical facility. The provisions of section 269ST of the I-T Act, they prohibit receipt of an amount of Rs 2 lakh and above in cash, in aggregate from a person in a day; or in a single transaction; or in respect of transactions relating to one-event or occasion from a person, have been relaxed. As of now, it is unclear whether the relaxation period will be extended beyond May end.

---||Mumbai||32 lakh have left state since April 1, govt says it’s normal||Mumbai: At least 32 lakh people have left Maharashtra since April 1, said Mahendra Kalyankar, commissioner, labour, and director, industrial safety and health. Of them, 11 lakh have gone to UP and 4.5 lakh to Bihar. He argued that several factors, including continuing work in manufacturing and construction, meant most had left as a matter of course as it is summer—time for harvest as well as the marriage season. Despite the surge in Covid cases, there has been no panic flight from Mumbai and Maharashtra this time, he said. Of the 38,000 factories registered with the directorate, over 60% are working with 50% workers, said Kalyankar. At construction sites across MMR, nearly 75% workers are on site, said Credai-MCHI president Deepak Goradia. “These are figures shared with us by the railways. The availability of a definite mode of transport, the insistence on a confirmed travel ticket, and the fact that manufacturing and construction sites are operating has meant that those who left had gone in the normal course since it is summer vacation, time for crops to be harvested and the marriage season,” said Kalyankar. Avinash Dhakne, state transport commissioner, said initially people left by the busload without adhering to the 50% occupancy norm, but now there are hardly any buses crossing the borders. “The insistence on RT-PCR tests to enter a state has discouraged a lot of people from leaving and this time there is no panic,” he said. Credai-MCHI president Goradia added: “Around 25% workers did leave, some initially and some after receiving salaries, but raw material is available and work is on, unlike last year when work had been stopped.” According to Central Railway officials, nearly 16 lakh people have left from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune and Solapur and the majority was headed to UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. Western Railway officials said around 14 lakh people left between April 1 and May 5. Akhilesh Rao, a resident of Ambujwadi, Malwani, in Malad (West), which is a large cluster of daily wage-earners hailing from UP, Bihar and Bengal, said the majority has not returned home. “Many went back during the first lockdown and stayed home for 4-5 months. They have returned to earn, have no savings now. The last time, many hitched a free ride back home. This time that has not been possible and there is no money back home,” he said. But the fresh lockdown is piling on the misery. “Autorickshaws have no passengers. Masons are not able to find work. For the poor it is difficult to survive,” Rao said. Goradia agreed that workers stayed on to earn and send money home. “Currently we are able to pay the contractors who pay the labourers, but there’s no sales happening and if the lockdown prolongs, it will be difficult to sustain the expenditure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/32-lakh-have-left-state-since-april-1-govt-says-its-normal/articleshow/82471768.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Protocol violators should own up to their lapses: HC||Mumbai: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court said on Friday that it was “quite shameful” that some people in Marathwada and north Maharashtra were blaming the administration after being infected with Covid-19 when they had failed to follow protocols themselves. While taking up a criminal suo motu public interest litigation, the HC was critical of people who slip their masks down to their chins, and directed the administration, including the police, to strictly enforce Covid-19 restrictions and penalise people found without masks in public, irrespective of their social status. “It is quite shameful that we are unable to discipline ourselves and we find it easy to blame the administration for being infected with coronavirus due to our own acts. It is not as if citizens owe no duty towards themselves or their families,” said a bench of Justices RV Ghuge and BU Debadwar. On being shown media reports of birthday celebrations amid the lockdown, it said, “We are surprised that people’s representatives, who are expected to lead from the front and should aspire to become ideal leaders and role models, are taking pride in celebrating bhoomipujan and their birthdays publicly by violating Covid-19 restrictions.” The HC also directed the administration to increase rapid antigen tests at primary healthcare centres and rural hospitals to ensure that residents of remote villages can get access to life-saving treatment on time. It said at present, such people have to wait two days to get back their RT-PCR test results, a delay that could prove fatal for some. The HC also upheld the Aurangabad city police’s May 16 order making helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders. The next hearing is on May 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/protocol-violators-should-own-up-to-their-lapses-hc/articleshow/82471793.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Non-tech savvy citizens hit hardest in bid to book slots||Mumbai: The first day of BMC’s no walk-in rule had a chaotic start at most vaccination centres. Many citizens unaware of such a direction came without appointment. As the crowd swelled and refused to leave without the shot, some centres relaxed the ‘no walk-in’ rule for a few hours. Booking a vaccine appointment on CoWin is now a game of fastest finger first. For the past few days, with limited slots up for grabs, vaccine seekers are spending hours on the website or mobile app to secure a confirmation in the few seconds they remain available. When slots open, applicants have usually less than a minute to select the vax centre, time or type a security code. “Most days end in disappointment in the race against more tech-savvy citizens,” said Somnath Shetty, a Thane resident who managed to book slots at KEM for himself and his mother on Friday. While BMC announces availability on Twitter, other MMR districts upload data on stocks through the day. Both the 18-44 group and s those above 45 now mandatorily need an appointment, thus intensifying the virtual rush. To boot, many are now criss-crossing districts to land a slot. In Mumbai, those lining up with appointments include Thane or Navi Mumbai residents. On Friday, 41,107 took the vaccine in Mumbai of which an estimated 50% made online bookings, said an official. Bhuleshwar resident Rajesh Rathod said he spent half of Friday refreshing the Aarogya Setu app and the Co-Win page. “I hit a jackpot though, I got an appointment in 20 minutes,” he said, standing in the queue at Parel’s KEM Hospital. Another successful vaccine seeker, a 22-year-old, who managed an appointment for his 82-year-old grandfather’s second dose, said three of his friends “launched an attack” on CoWin from three devices. “We got it for the BKC vaccination centre after multiple attempts,” said the Bandra resident. He said he his friends in Delhi stayed up the night to see if appointments would be easier to get around 3-4am. On Friday, a security code was added to the steps on CoWin, apparently to stop bots from booking the appointments. A sure hack, he said, was to try searching for centres using districts rather than pin codes. Another revelation for authorities was that vaccine seekers were crisscrossing between districts to get the shots. As slots opened in Mumbai, many from the neighbouring areas such as Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira Road grabbed the slots. Rajkumari Gupta, a resident of Ghodbunder Road, said five of her previous appointments at nearby centres had got cancelled due to vaccine shortage. So, when she got the sixth confirmed appointment at a Parel centre, she just booked a cab and got there. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said several instances of residents from outside Mumbai booking slots in city hospitals have come to their notice. “We are hoping that the 200-odd centres starting in the community from next week will solve this problem. Because of this, many Mumbaikars are forced to travel outside the city to get doses,” he said. BMC has also decided to open appointment slots at a fixed hour so that people don’t have to keep scrolling all day. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said vaccination centres have an idea about their leftover doses by 7.30pm. “We will now open slots uniformly, say around 8pm. We are working on that,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-tech-savvy-citizens-hit-hardest-in-bid-to-book-slots/articleshow/82471849.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||India||Bengal: HC sets up 5-judge bench to hear PIL on post-poll violence||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Friday formed a five-judge bench to hear a PIL on post-poll violence in Bengal and asked the state government to file a report "specifying the areas where violence has taken place and steps taken to prevent or control it." The HC wanted to know "the latest status of law-and-order situation in the state" when it would hear the matter again next Monday. One of the two PILs also brought up the issue of fake images being posted on social media to foment communal riots. Petitioner Anindya Sundar Das's advocate, Uday Shankar Chatterjee, argued post-poll violence was not new to Bengal but this time there was an attempt to instigate communal riots. The court felt there was a need to "constitute a larger bench... considering that life and liberty of people in Bengal" were at stake. The five-member bench comprises acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar. State advocate-general Kishore Dutta opposed the petition, saying that a new government had taken charge barely two days ago and had already taken several steps to stem the violence. Dutta then sought an adjournment to file an affidavit by the state home secretary. State additional solicitor-general Y J Dastoor, who represented the Centre, too, opposed the petition, claiming it was not maintainable. He also disputed the allegations of instigation of communal riots. The state government has blamed ill-considered transfers of senior police officers and their replacement with "incompetent officers" by the Election Commission for the situation. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the next of kin of the 16 people who died in the last few days. The development in court coincided with the visit of a four-member Union home ministry team to Bengal "to assess the ground situation" following the announcement of poll results on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-hc-sets-up-5-judge-bench-to-hear-pil-on-post-poll-violence/articleshow/82472043.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Business||Indians can enter US with ‘recovery from Covid’ proof, apart from negative RT-PCR report||NEW DELHI: Visitors eligible to go the US from India can now show a documentation of recovery from Covid-19, apart from the negative RT-PCR test report to enter the country. From May 4, US had restricted travel from India and currently allows its citizens and permanent residents with a few other exceptions. The US embassy in India website says: “Anyone travelling to the US (two years and older) must take a Covid-19 test no more than three days before travel and show a negative result to the airline before boarding the flight, or be prepared to show documentation of recovery from Covid-19 (proof of a recent positive viral test and a letter from a healthcare provider or a public health official stating clearance for travel).” The move comes at a time when reduced eligibility to go to US from India means that mainly its own citizens and permanent residents, and a few other exempt categories of travellers, can go there from India. More information on testing requirement is available on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. “United and Air India continue to operate numerous direct flights weekly from India to the United States. Additional flight options remain available on Air France, Lufthansa, and Qatar Airways via transfers in Paris, Frankfurt, and Doha. US citizens who wish to depart India are encouraged to book tickets through the airlines,” the website says. US has a level 4 travel advisory for India which means "do not go there." Level 4 is the highest advisory level due to greater likelihood of life-threatening risks. “New cases and deaths from COVID-19 have risen sharply throughout India to record levels. COVID-19 testing infrastructure is reportedly constrained in many locations. Hospitals are reporting shortages of supplies, oxygen, and beds for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related patients. US citizens are reporting being denied admittance to hospitals in some cities due to a lack of space. Some states have enacted curfews and other restrictions that limit movement and the operation of non-essential businesses,” the website adds.

She also ridiculed BJP for obsequiously and prematurely lauding the PM for vanquishing Covid. In another letter to the PM, Rahul Gandhi said “hubris” on his (Modi) part had “placed India in a highly dangerous position” and made another national lockdown “inevitable”. Sonia demanded that the PM call an all-party meeting on Covid. The Congress chief demanded that parliamentary standing committees be convened to "ensure collective action and accountability". Addressing the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting, Sonia said, "The Modi government has failed the people of our country... Tackling this crisis requires able, calm and visionary leadership. The nation is sinking under the weight of the Modi government's indifference and incompetence... It is utterly shocking to see the Modi government abdicate its moral obligation and its sworn duty towards the people." The strong words, with Congress members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha listening in, were in line with Congress's recent offensive against the government in which leaders from Sonia to Rahul Gandhi to former PM Manmohan Singh have blamed Modi's lack of attentiveness and planning, and triumphalism for the virus gone wild. Sonia said BJP government's empowered groups and national taskforce had warned of a second wave of the pandemic while the parliamentary standing committee on health had raised alarm over the lack of preparedness. "But the PM arrogantly boasted that he had defeated the pandemic and his party obediently felicitated him for his so-called success," she lamented. In his letter to Modi, Rahul said "uncontrollable spread of the virus" would be devastating not just for India but the entire world and urged the government to use "genome sequencing" to track the virus, assess efficacy of vaccines against mutations and to "keep the rest of the world informed". Senior Congressmen Mallikarjun Kharge and Abhishek Singhvi were wary of Rahul's reference of "national lockdown" and plumped for local and regional lockdowns. Rahul wrote that India's size and genetic diversity made it a fertile ground for virus mutation and that mutant strains were "only the beginning, I fear". Sonia told MPs that the government did not beef up health infrastructure during the last one year, while allocating crores for non-essential projects (an apparent reference to the Central Vista).

Though the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) authorities have asked vegetable vendors to provide door-to-door services to avoid the rush, the markets were still crowded on Thursday. Malti Patil (62), a roadside vegetable seller in the Laxmipuri market, said, “The administration has asked us to sell vegetables on carts, providing door-to-door service but elderly people like me will not be able to roam around selling vegetables. Due to strict restrictions, we are already in trouble so if I do not sell, then what about my bread and butter? Anil Jadhav, a city resident, said, “The district administration has created chaos by calling for lockdown and later janata curfew. People are still unaware about what is operational and what is not so it is better come to the market and buy the grocery instead of waiting for the vegetable vendors to come in our areas”. The KMC administration sealed eight shops on Thursday. Pandit Powar, the head of KMC’s anti-encroachment drive, said, “Vegetable markets in the city were kept completely closed but at a few places, vegetable sellers adamantly sat on the roadside selling vegetables. Tomorrow the action will be more severe on such vegetable sellers. Eight shops, which do not sell essentials, were seen operating behind the closed shutters.” In Sangli, people have followed the lockdown norms after the emotional appeal from their guardian minister Jayant Patil. . Considering the increase in Covid cases and deaths, there is no other option apart from the imposition of lockdown While in Satara, FIR was registered against 15 people for violating strict lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-unimpressive-response-to-janata-curfew/articleshow/82438294.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Jitender Sagar has been appointed in his place. BSP fought in 39 wards out of the 56 in the district but won only five seats. Bijnor was once considered a BSP stronghold from where Mayawati made her political debut in 1989 and became an MP. The party had won all the assembly segments from Bijnor in 2007. But over time, its position weakened and in 2017, it lost all the assembly seats in the district. Now, with assembly polls due early next year, the BSP’s efforts to make a comeback in the political arena has been hit by intra-party feud. So fierce has been the competition within the party that several BSP workers fought for a single seat in the polls, marring all prospects of winning. According to poll results, SP-backed nominees emerged victorious in 20 of the 56 wards with BJP securing eight seats, BSP five, RLD four and BKU leaders winning two seats. The rest were won by Independents. Soon after poll results, local leaders sent their reports to Mayawati, who replaced district president Rajendra Singh with Jitendra Sagar. Now, the focus is on who will bag the district panchayat chairman’s post. The 56 elected ward members will vote for the chairman. It is a numbers game with all parties eying Independents’ support to win the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bsps-bijnor-prez-removed-after-poor-show-intra-party-feud-in-polls/articleshow/82440893.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||India||SC turns down Centre's plea to stay Karnataka HC order on oxygen supply||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to interfere with the Karnataka high court order directing the Centre to allocate 1,200 MT of medical oxygen to the state, saying it was a reasoned order and turned down the Centre's plea to stay it. At the outset, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said they had read the order of the HC and did not find any fault in it. The bench said it was a "judicious and calibrated exercise of power" by the HC and no interference was required. The bench also cited the projections by the BJP government in Karnataka about the quantum of oxygen needed by the state to stand by the HC. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta , however, contended that the Centre is ready to sit with the state government to sort out the issue but the high court should not have passed the order. He told the bench that the entire system put in place to handle the pandemic would collapse if all high courts started passing direction for supply of oxygen to their states. He insisted that there was a need to have a pan-India vision and courts should resist from taking a state-centric approach. "We are not averse to reasonable demands of the states. We have limited quantity of oxygen and we have to cater to the needs of all states. The Centre and states can sit together and decide on allocation of oxygen," Mehta said. 'It is imperative that the limited resources available be put to its most judicious use, keeping in mind the overall situation in the country. Thereby, passing directions in the nature and manner the HC has done, would ultimately lead to mismanagement of resources and create a further chaotic environment in an already overburdened system," the Centre said. The apex court, however, was not convinced with the submission and said the HC had passed a reasoned order giving justification for supply of 1,200 MT oxygen as the state government itself had sought 1,162 MT. "The HC has furnished adequate reasons for issuing a calibrated ad-interim direction. The direction of the HC is evidently an ad-interim direction, subject to such calibration as would be necessitated after the state of Karnataka and the Union government have mutually attempted to resolve the issue. The order of the HC does not preclude a mutual resolution by the two governments, since the proceedings are still pending," the bench said. "The HC order is based on the need to maintain at least a minimum requirement as projected by the state government until a decision on the representation is taken. Hence, without enquiring into the wider issues sought to be raised at this stage (and keeping them open) there is no reason to entertain the petition," it said. The court also noted that allocation for Karnataka stood at 802 MTs prior to April 30 and has been increased to 856 MT from May 1 and 965 MT from May 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-turns-down-centres-plea-to-stay-karnataka-hc-order-on-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82473235.cms||---
---||Patna||Covid cases to start plateauing in Bihar in a fortnight: Experts||PATNA: Active Covid cases in the state may start plateauing within a fortnight if the lockdown is enforced rigidly and people are forced to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, experts said. Delay in imposing complete lockdown in the state and people’s Covid-inappropriate behaviour have worsened the situation and led to a phenomenal surge in the number of cases. However, experts said the current wave would attain its peak within 10 to 15 days and then show a declining trend. AIIMS-Patna Covid incharge Dr Sanjeev Kumar said seeing the current surge in Covid cases, it is really very difficult to predict as to when the infection would start plateauing. “Everything depends on how effectively the lockdown is enforced and the people’s movement is checked to break the chain of infections. Medical experts and scientists had earlier predicted that the peak would be reached by May 5, but that did not happen. It may take another fortnight when the cases start plateauing and showing a downward trend,” Dr Kumar added. He said different states have attained peaks at different times depending on the strictness of the administration and people’s Covid-appropriate behaviour. “If the lockdown is lifted from the state soon, the Covid infections would start multiplying again,” he added. Epidemiologist Dr Arun Shah of Muzaffarpur said even as it is premature to predict the exact time of the peak of the second wave, it may show some declining trend in a fortnight if all the Covid protocols are followed by the people. “Had the lockdown been imposed a fortnight back, the number of infections would have minimised by now. The second wave had started in March itself, but neither the government nor the public took it seriously. The virus has now penetrated so deep at different levels that the authorities are finding difficulties in breaking the chain,” Dr Shah added. Former state president of Indian Medical Association and former superintendent of PMCH, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, however, said Covid cases would reach its peak in a week and then start declining. “By the time the infection subsides completely, more than 50% of the state’s population would have been infected. The current lockdown, if enforced rigorously, will help break the chain and minimize the number of infections,” he added. Dr Prasad said vaccination drive should be launched on a war footing both in urban as well as rural areas as the virus has reached even in remote areas with the unrestricted movement of Covid-infected people from one place to another. Patna University’s professor of biotechnology Dr Birendra Prasad said Covid cases would start declining in Bihar within 10 days. “The normal behaviour of the virus manifests that it does not reside in a human body for more than 10 days and if necessary precautions are taken by the infected people, the virus would die out automatically after 10 days,” he added. Prasad cautioned that a third wave of Covid infections would also hit sooner or later, but it would not affect the people so dangerously as most people would get themselves vaccinated by then. Senior physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said Covid cases would start showing a declining trend in two weeks, but the lockdown would have to be enforced more vigorously. “The infections caused by the dual mutants of the virus in the second wave are more dangerous than those of the first wave. Hence, it would require more precautions to be followed by the people in containing the infections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-cases-to-start-plateauing-in-state-in-a-fortnight-experts/articleshow/82438990.cms||B K Mishra

The SC's intervention on the nettlesome issue provides a huge relief to the Modi government since the polarising demand, with strong proponents and detractors, would be difficult for a political party to ward off. It could also give state governments a handy reason to plead inability to cater to fresh qouta demands. The SC's intervention during the implementation of the Mandal Commission laid the foundation for the 50% ceiling. While the halfway quota cap was designed as a balance between affirmative action and general merit, there has been a pushback against it from OBC politicians because the backward communities believe that the slice of cake they have got is too small. That quota should be "in proportion to population" has been the argument proffered. In contrast, ruling parties have been wary of political consequences of deciding either way and have chosen to strike a balance. The Modi regime brought in the controversial 10% quota for upper castes (EWS) to neutralise the anger among the forward communities over its 2018 move to undo the court-mandated dilution of SC/ST atrocities Act. The SC is still to hear and decide on the constitutionality of the quota on economic criteria that is EWS reservation. What made the fresh push against 50% ceiling extra sensitive was the support it enjoyed from across the states as it pertained to new quotas being instituted to accommodate demands from influential social groups - like Marathas in Maharashtra, Gurjars in Rajasthan and Jats in Haryana. The ruling may have opened a can of worms by taking away from the states their powers to identify the OBCs for local quotas. The roots of this ruling lie in the 102nd Constitutional amendment, which the Centre brought in 2018 to grant constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes. The bill, flagship agenda of PM Modi, was stuck in Parliament for a long time because the opposition warned that its wording and provisions would make the NCBC the ultimate arbiter in identifying OBCs for state lists and take away the powers of states. Even the bill vetted by the parliamentary committee headed by BJP's Bhupendra Yadav encountered same objections in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The NCBC, a body nominated by the ruling party at the Centre, would thus have unprecedented powers to decide which caste can be in a state's OBC list - a big change from the existing regime when its mandate was limited to the Central list. Whether the BJP government will appeal against this part of the SC ruling or will move to amend the 102nd Constitutional Amendment is being keenly watched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-ruling-may-ease-pressure-on-govt-from-quota-seekers/articleshow/82473243.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

---||Kochi||Lockdown in Kerala from today, police to act tough on violators||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Around 25,000 police personnel will be deployed on roads from Saturday morning to impose the nine day lockdown in the state. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters that police have prepared a detailed action plan for strict implementation of restrictions announced in view of the worsening Covid-19 situation. He said it would take at least a week more to see a reduction in the number of cases even if the lockdown is strictly enforced. Warning against spreading of fake news regarding lockdown and Covid-19, he said the police hi-tech cell and Cyberdome had been asked to look into such matters and take action. There is no need for a police pass for inter-district travel like last year's lockdown and a pass format being circulated on social media is an old one, Vijayan said. However, inter-district travel should be minimised, and such travel can be undertaken in unavoidable circumstances by producing a self-certified affidavit, he said. People can go out for unavoidable reasons with a self-certified affidavit but there will be serious action if such travel is found unnecessary. The chief minister said vehicle workshops can function during the weekend while banks, insurance and other financial services will be allowed on alternate days -- Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Way-side eateries should not be operated while officials of banks or financial institutions should not visit houses for recovering instalments during this period. Vijayan said police would publish the dos and don'ts during lockdown on their social media accounts. Highway police and fire and rescue service have prepared a joint plan for transport of life-saving drugs, for which IG (south zone) Harshitha Attalluri will be the nodal officer. The government has, meanwhile, come up with some more clarifications on exemptions given during the lockdown. It has included transport, women and child development, dairy development and NORKA department employees among the exempted categories. Restaurants will be allowed to function from 7am to 7.30pm for home delivery or parcel services. People queue up outside a grocery shop in Kochi without maintaining social distancing. On Friday, many shops were crowded as people rushed to stock up essentials before the lockdown despite the government's assurance that there won't be any shortage The movement of bystanders to and from hospitals, advocates and clients to courts if a physical sitting has been notified and units involved in packing of essential food, medical items and items of export have also been exempted. Police face a major challenge in enforcing the lockdown this time as the government has — taking a cue from last year’s national lockdown — given more exemptions so as to ensure that the economic activities are not affected. It will be tough for police to ensure that those venturing out of houses during the lockdown are doing so for genuine reasons. A section of police officers said the rider of ‘minimum possible staff’ with which many departments had been allowed to function could lead to arguments on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lockdown-in-kerala-from-today-police-to-act-tough-on-violators/articleshow/82473293.cms||---

Justice N Nagaresh declined a stay after additional advocate general Ranjith Thampan argued that the government considered the rates in other states and the cost of conducting the test while refixing it to Rs 500. The government had filed a statement to the court pointing out that the total cost for conducting an RT-PCR test had come down to Rs 275-350 since March this year from Rs 1,700-2,000 last year. A PCR kit, which cost Rs 1,064-1,288 last year, is available at Rs 40-90 since December last year, data presented in the statement showed. While only imported kits were available in February last year and the supply chain was disrupted due to lockdowns, and the rates came down as more manufacturers started making these kits and the ICMR approved them, the court was informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rt-pcr-rate-kerala-high-court-declines-to-stay-state-government-order/articleshow/82473316.cms||---

On behalf of the central government, the assistant solicitor general told the court that vaccines are being released to states incrementally following an all-India policy to ensure fair distribution. The court said in an interim order: “We have no quarrel with the proposition now placed before us by the learned Assistant Solicitor General, but we think that Government of India should respond at the earliest as to when there would be a meaningful solution to the scarcity of doses of vaccines, which is now being faced.” The court will hear the case again on May 20th.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-high-court-asks-centre-for-meaningful-solution-to-vaccine-scarcity/articleshow/82473323.cms||---

Public Health England said: "Following a rise in cases in the UK and evidence of community transmission, PHE has reclassified B.1.617.2 - classified as a VUI on April 28 - as a VOC. This is based on evidence which suggests this variant, first detected in India, is at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7 (the UK variant)." Cases of the B.1.617.2 variant increased to 520 from 202 over the last week, PHE said, mainly in London and the northwest town of Bolton, with almost half the cases related to contact with a traveler. Health teams and NHS Test and Trace are now focused on limiting onward spread. Enhanced contact tracing and enhanced community and surge testing are in place in affected areas as well as increased community engagement. It was on April 15 that the so-called "Indian variant" of Covid-19 (B.1.617) was first discovered in the UK and designated a VUI by PHE. This variant includes a number of mutations, including E484Q, L452R, and P681R. E484Q and L452R - found together for the first time in India - are together known to be more infectious, more transmissible, and to evade antibodies. On April 29 two additional variants, also first detected in India and sharing the same parent lineage as B.1.617, were discovered and designated variants under investigation. These were branded as B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3. It is B.1.617.2 that is of real concern to the UK. Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at PHE, said: "We are monitoring all of these variants extremely closely and have taken the decision to classify this as a variant of concern because the indications are that this B.1.617.2 is a more transmissible variant." B.1.617 and B.1.617.3 remain variants under investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-labels-more-transmissible-indian-strain-variant-of-concern/articleshow/82473300.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Oxygen will be supplied to all hospitals, both government and private, through the state government. For the purpose, a designated authority has been appointed — Dr Dileep Kumar, general manager, Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd — who will communicate with the manufacturers, distributors and cylinder filling centres. “Other than the designated authority, no one shall communicate to the oxygen manufacturers/distributors/ cylinder filling centres,” as per an order issued by health secretary Dr Rajan Khobragade. The oxygen requirement of private hospitals shall be ensured through their contracted agencies by the designated authority and whenever there is shortage or inability of providing oxygen by the contracted agencies, the required oxygen quantity shall be worked out and given to the private hospital. “In very urgent cases, the designated authority shall assess whether the patient shifting is a more feasible and logical option based on the scenario at that point of time vis-avis supply chain management of oxygen,” the order added. “We don’t want a situation where our oxygen capacities are not full and we face sudden shortage. This arrangement is good only if the government is able to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to the private hospitals too,” said Dr Jayakrishnan A V, chairman, IMA’s committee for vaccination promotion and coordination. For oxygen, hospitals have to request the designated authority through the e-jagratha portal. They also may inform any issue related to oxygen to district war rooms and once validated, oxygen will be supplied to the hospitals. Private hospitals will continue to pay for the oxygen purchased. “ We are with the government in its decision to take over the control of complete oxygen supply in the state to ensure that there is no abuse and allegations of oxygen deficiency,” said Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter) president Dr M I Sahadulla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/oxygen-supply-kerala-government-takes-over-control/articleshow/82473335.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Erode||The numbers don’t add up, Tamil Nadu could lose out for under-reporting its active Covid-19 cases||CHENNAI: Active Covid cases (people undergoing treatment) are being grossly under reported in the state, jeopardising its share of oxygen and drugs such as antiviral Remdesivir or immunosuppressant tocilizumab. The Centre makes the allocation based on the number of active cases. In the past one week (between April 30 and May 6), the state added 1.49 lakh fresh Covid cases. After 1,041 deaths, there should have been at least 1.48 lakh people under treatment on Thursday, but the state reported 1.31 lakh cases. Epidemiologists say the under reporting could be much more considering that several people (some estimates put the number at 20,000) infected before April 30 would still be under treatment. On Friday, when the state added 26,465 new cases, the active case number was revised to1.35 lakh. Most allotments – drugs, medical equipment, testing kits or vaccines — made by the Centre are based on demand and the number of people on the active registry. “There is no doubt that the Centre has miscalculated oxygen allocation to the state. But TN’s statistics could be adding to this misery,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandaswamy. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh was allotted 500 tonnes of oxygen a day for the1.8 lakh active cases and Telangana got 360 tonnes for 73,000 active cases. “We should account for people in hospitals, home isolation and those on transit in ambulances. The simplest way to do this is to ensure they don’t get out of the registry for at least two weeks after testing,” Kolandaswamy said. Officials in the public health department said one of the main reasons for the mismatch is early discharge from hospitals. “Many hospitals now discharge patients on the second or third day if they don’t require oxygen or have any other complaints that require intense monitoring. Though many of these patients are sent for home isolation, their names inadvertently get added to the discharged list,” an official said. Between April 30 and May 6, Chennai reported 42,727 cases. After accounting for 319 deaths, the city should have had at least 42,000 active cases. But the city reported just 33,316. Director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said the state protocol permits discharge of patients ten days after symptoms. “Many people go for testing only on the third or fourth day of symptoms and by the time results arrive many of them are healthy. So, they may get discharged fast too,” he said. Infectious diseases experts say at a time when there is increasing concern over reinfection and relapse of Covid-19, early discharges from the registry can be dangerous. “All international organisations such as WHO and CDC recommend at least 14 days isolation. There are scientific reasons for this,” said infectious disease expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan. “These people can still transmit the virus and infect others. More than that, evidence shows that severe disease occurs in the second week. In that period, morbidity and mortality is high. Besides artificially pushing up recovery, it will increase deaths,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/the-numbers-dont-add-up-tamil-nadu-could-lose-out-for-under-reporting-its-active-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82474395.cms||Pushpa Narayan

After accounting for 319 deaths, the city should have had at least 42,000 active cases. But the city reported just 33,316. Director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said the state protocol permits discharge of patients ten days after symptoms. “Many people go for testing only on the third or fourth day of symptoms and by the time results arrive many of them are healthy. So, they may get discharged fast too,” he said. Infectious diseases experts say at a time when there is increasing concern over reinfection and relapse of Covid-19, early discharges from the registry can be dangerous. “All international organisations such as WHO and CDC recommend at least 14 days isolation. There are scientific reasons for this,” said infectious disease expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan. “These people can still transmit the virus and infect others. More than that, evidence shows that severe disease occurs in the second week. In that period, morbidity and mortality is high. Besides artificially pushing up recovery, it will increase deaths,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/the-numbers-dont-add-up-tamil-nadu-could-lose-out-for-under-reporting-its-active-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82474401.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Chennai||The numbers don’t add up, Tamil Nadu could lose out for under-reporting its active Covid-19 cases||CHENNAI: Active Covid cases (people undergoing treatment) are being grossly under reported in the state, jeopardising its share of oxygen and drugs such as antiviral Remdesivir or immunosuppressant tocilizumab. The Centre makes the allocation based on the number of active cases. In the past one week (between April 30 and May 6), the state added 1.49 lakh fresh Covid cases. After 1,041 deaths, there should have been at least 1.48 lakh people under treatment on Thursday, but the state reported 1.31 lakh cases. Epidemiologists say the under reporting could be much more considering that several people (some estimates put the number at 20,000) infected before April 30 would still be under treatment. On Friday, when the state added 26,465 new cases, the active case number was revised to1.35 lakh. Most allotments – drugs, medical equipment, testing kits or vaccines — made by the Centre are based on demand and the number of people on the active registry. “There is no doubt that the Centre has miscalculated oxygen allocation to the state. But TN’s statistics could be adding to this misery,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandaswamy. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh was allotted 500 tonnes of oxygen a day for the1.8 lakh active cases and Telangana got 360 tonnes for 73,000 active cases. “We should account for people in hospitals, home isolation and those on transit in ambulances. The simplest way to do this is to ensure they don’t get out of the registry for at least two weeks after testing,” Kolandaswamy said. Officials in the public health department said one of the main reasons for the mismatch is early discharge from hospitals. “Many hospitals now discharge patients on the second or third day if they don’t require oxygen or have any other complaints that require intense monitoring. Though many of these patients are sent for home isolation, their names inadvertently get added to the discharged list,” an official said. Between April 30 and May 6, Chennai reported 42,727 cases.

---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Reorient oxygen supply for timely arrival in Punjab, Haryana, Centre told||CHANDIGARH: Considering the “critical” situation in Punjab, Haryana and the UT of Chandigarh on account of insufficient supply of oxygen, the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the central government to consider reorientation of the supply of oxygen from various plants in such a manner that the allocated quantity reaches the region on time. The high court made it clear that the reorientation is needed because there is an oxygen deficit in the region and filled containers of oxygen cannot be lifted by air and transported only by rail or road transport from remote areas, which would consume precious time needed to save Covid-19 patients. “It appears that all three states, at this stage, are not seeking enhancement in the quantity of oxygen allotted to them but are aggrieved by delay in supply thereof. As a result of late delivery, the allocated quantity of oxygen is not able to reach the states well in time. We, thus, feel it necessary to direct the Government of India to consider reorientation of the supply of oxygen from various plants in such a manner that the allocated quantity reaches the respective states before the already allotted quota is exhausted to avoid loss of life,” ordered the high court. Representing the Union government, Satya Pal Jain, additional solicitor general of India, however, assured the court that the matter would be considered immediately and appropriate steps would be taken. A division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh of the high court has passed these orders after hearing the contentions raised by the amicus curiae and both the states of Punjab and Haryana and Chandigarh. When the matter came up for hearing on Friday, senior advocate Rupinder Khosla, who has been assisting the court as amicus curiae, pointed out that there was a severe shortfall in the supply of oxygen to all three states within the jurisdiction of this high court. “The allocated quantity is either not being supplied or has been allotted from very distant places such as Rourkela and Jamnagar, the timeline for which is not conducive. By the time the arrangements are made, the states are virtually left starving for oxygen, resulting in many deaths,” Khosla told the bench. Punjab advocate general (AG) Atul Nanda submitted that the state requires 300 MT oxygen, whereas the Centre has allocated 227 MT oxygen, which too is not reaching the state. A sufficient number of containers have not been allotted to transport the same, Nanda added. The Haryana AG also pointed out the insufficient number of containers needed to transport oxygen. Baldev Raj Mahajan, the Haryana AG, also informed the HC that his state is facing an extreme shortage of oxygen despite the fact that it has a plant located at Panipat, which is manufacturing 260 MT. “Instead of allowing the state of Haryana to get the supply from the plant at Panipat for the facility of transport as well as timely replenishment, it has been allocated far off places like Rourkela and Jamnagar. The resultant delay has led to several deaths in Haryana as well,” Mahajan told the bench. Pankaj Jain, senior standing counsel for Chandigarh, said even the UT is now facing difficulty in procuring the required quantity of oxygen. On a query from the bench, the Centre’s counsel Satya Pal Jain submitted that the allocation of oxygen is being done equitably to all the states in the country. No discrimination is being done and nobody has been given, out of turn, favoured status. According to him, certain difficulties are being faced in view of the fact that certain states do not have oxygen plants. They have also to be supplied oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-19-reorient-oxygen-supply-for-timely-arrival-in-punjab-haryana-centre-told/articleshow/82473367.cms||Ajay Sura

According to Nanda, the entire vaccination has to be made available by the Centre for the age group of 45 and above. The requisite quantity has not been supplied so far, he said and claimed that there is a shortfall of 32 lakh doses. In total, 2.64 crore doses are required in Punjab for the age group of 18 to 45 years. Nanda also added that the state has been given liberty to secure the same from two suppliers, Serum Institute, Pune, and Bharat Biotech, on a payment basis. This demand has also not been met despite orders after following due procedure, the AG said. The Punjab government also asserted that the state is still waiting for 600 doses of Tocilizumab, a life-saving drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/we-are-short-of-vaccine-punjab-to-high-court/articleshow/82473383.cms||---

But soon he started experiencing pain and swelling on the face. A quick CT scan confirmed the doctor's fears - he had contracted mucormycosis, a potentially fatal fungal infection. He recently underwent a surgery at Global Hospital in Parel, where doctors had to remove his upper jaw to arrest the spread of the fungus to the brain. Triggered by coronavirus, mucormycosis, which has a mortality rate of over 50% and can lead to blindness, is sweeping through parts of the state. City hospitals that are treating dozens of such cases from northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha said its spread is assuming epidemic proportions, so much so that regions have started facing a shortage of anti-fungal medicines. Global Hospital, which has started a dedicated clinic for mucormycosis after witnessing a surge in cases during the first wave, has 18 patients admitted at present.

"Cases of mucormycosis have exploded in the state, and the government needs to urgently intervene. Medical centres across Maharashtra, particularly, Vidarbha, must be seeing a 100%-200% rise in cases," he said. At the Global centre, six patients have lost their entire upper jaw, while one has lost an eyeball due to the infection.

Dr Hetal Marfatia, head of ENT, said almost all patients are from far-off districts and have come at an advanced stage. The infection typically starts growing from the nose, upper jaw and travels to the brain. "Once it reaches the brain, it's almost a death sentence," she said, adding that from treating a handful cases annually, the hospital is now seeing three-four referrals daily.

The bigger challenge now is treatment, since anti-fungal medicines are not just in short supply but also very expensive. In pre-Covid times, the 'black fungus' mucormycosis used to be rare and seen mainly in immunocompromised people.

From a peak 717 on April 29, the corporations oversaw 506 such cremations this Thursday. Civic officials say they are still on high alert and the daily pyre capacity for cremations reserved for Covid victims is kept at 1,184. An official says the likelihood of bodies of Covid patients dying in homes being cremated under “normal category” may be a factor behind this decline. Another official says with the city’s critical healthcare infra overwhelmed, many families are taking serious patients to other states. Covid-protocol funerals are carried out according to strict directions—comprising a series of precautions meant to minimise the risk of infection spreading—issued by the Union heath ministry. A public health official says even bodies of patients suspected to have died of Covid are laid to rest following these rules. Interestingly, a civic official says the daily Covid-protocol funeral count over the last two weeks has been 200-300 above the number of official deaths cited in the health ministry bulletin. ‘Clear system needed for home deaths’The funeral reports from the three municipal corporations show that the number of such Covid funerals crossed the 700-mark for the first time on April 28, peaked the next day at 717 before starting to decline. Reports state the number of such funerals was 697 on May 1, the next day, came down below the 600 mark on May 3 when 594 funerals took place. “The current count stands around 500 bodies a day and the last time Delhi registered less than 500 Covid funerals was on April 22 when 483 such funerals took place,” official stated. “When there are no tests happening on time and hospitals are full, how will some families get the bodies documented for Covid from hospitals? Many are choosing to cremate them under normal category as soon as possible,” one of the officials says. Earlier, North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash highlighted how the number of ‘normal cremations’ had significantly gone up. “Even Covid patients are being cremated under normal category. A clear system for home deaths needs to be developed and it will reduce the chances of spreading infection at funeral facilities. This is also dangerous for staff working at the sites,” he had said last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-700-to-500-a-day-steady-drop-in-delhi-covid-funerals-in-past-week/articleshow/82473396.cms||Paras Singh

Deeply appreciate the initial gesture of goodwill with complimentary LMO supplies particularly from UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain & Saudi Arabia,” Pradhan tweeted. The national oil companies of these countries are among countries aiding India by supplying oxygen, cryogenic tankers and other medical equipment. “This is reflective of the close friendship and warmth of leaders of the middle east countries towards Hon’ble PM @narendramodi ji,” he said. In a series of tweets, Pradhan said India’s ambassadors in these countries are now working on securing regular commercial supplies of oxygen, while IndianOil and GAIL will provide the logistics. “My deep appreciation to HRH Abdulaziz, HE Dr Sultan Jaber, HE Sherida al-Kaabi for their extended support & special gesture of solidarity with India through the offer of ISO Containers for the next 6 months. Assurance of steady commercial supply of LMO to India is also welcomed,” Pradhan tweeted.

---||Business||Finance ministry report sees muted hit to economy from 2nd Covid wave||New Delhi: The second wave of Covid has posed a downside risk to economic activity in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, but there are reasons to expect a muted economic impact as compared to the first wave, a finance ministry report said on Friday. "Learning to 'operate with Covid-19', as borne by international experience, provides a silver lining of economic resilience amidst the second wave," according to the ministry's monthly economic report. It said that growing infections and consequent restrictions, though local/ regional in nature, have imparted a downside risk to economic activity. The impact of restrictions is evident in a decline in the Google mobility indicator to -37% in April 2021 from around -22% in the preceding month. The Oxford Stringency Index in India has surged to around 71 in April 2021 from 59 in the preceding month, though it is still below 100 seen in April 2020 and average of 85 in Q1FY2020-21, it said. The sharp surge in cases and deaths and the lockdowns in several states have hurt economic activity. The services sector, particularly hotels and restaurants, have borne the brunt of the curbs. Most experts now agree that there is likely to be an impact on the country's growth prospects and the economic recovery that was under way. "Agriculture continues to be the silver lining with record foodgrain production estimated in the ensuing crop year on the back of predicted normal monsoons," the report said. The first wave and strict lockdown had hurt the economy severely, leading to a recession with two successive quarters of contraction last year. Since the opening up of economic activity, there has been a sharp recovery and most agencies had estimated the economy to grow in the 10%-12% range and emerge as the fastest growing economy in the world. However, the second wave, which has heaped misery in recent weeks, has prompted several agencies to shave off their growth estimates marginally. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) still maintains that the dent to aggregate demand is expected to be moderate in comparison to a year ago. In a separate report, the SBI said they are now "little apprehensive" of double-digit growth in FY22. "Given the rise in cases and restriction in every state, real GDP growth of 10.4% looks a bit ambitious. Regarding the question if the pent-up demand would support economic activity once the restrictions are removed, we believe recovery will depend on the psyche of people to come out and this will not happen till the larger population is vaccinated," Soumya Kanti Ghosh, SBI group's chief economic adviser, said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finance-ministry-report-sees-muted-hit-to-eco-from-2nd-covid-wave/articleshow/82473483.cms||---

The London lawsuit centres on the 2017 sale of Tata's specialty steel business to Liberty House Group for 100 million pounds ($139 million). Liberty told the Indian firm's UK arm that it had run into difficulties as early as May 2020 when demand for steel was hit due to the pandemic, lawyers for Tata said in documents filed at the UK high court. Gupta's business has been searching for funding after the collapse of Greensill Capital, its biggest lender. It looked to have secured a lifeline for his ailing steel business when terms were agreed on a 200-million-pound loan from White Oak Global Advisors on Thursday. By March 2021, Liberty was still struggling with late payments and wrote that it was "going through a crisis arising out of the insolvency of its principal lender, Greensill Capital", Tata's lawyers said in the filings. Tata is also seeking a further payment of 10 million pounds from Liberty if it wasn't paid by May 1. It's not clear whether these amounts have been paid yet. The suit was filed less than a month after Credit Suisse Group - through Citibank - filed a winding-up application against another of Gupta's businesses, Liberty Commodities. Tata declined to comment beyond confirming that it had issued proceedings against the firms. The Gupta-led GFG Alliance declined to comment too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-sue-gupta-for-late-payment-in-139mn-deal/articleshow/82473511.cms||---

The new high in the second wave is more than thrice the maximum number of the fatalities, 179, reported on September 18, 2020 during the first wave. Bengaluru — epicentre of the second wave in Karnataka — accounted for 346 deaths, the highest ever state capital has seen so far. After Bengaluru, the highest number of deaths were reported from Ballari at 24, Mysuru 22, Hassan 20, Kalaburagi 19, Tumakuru 15 and Shivamogga 14. Friday’s fatalities included 158 Covid patients who died in April. Bengaluru reported 21,367 cases — or 43% — of the state’s new infections, followed by Tumakuru 3,040, Hassan 2,422, Mysuru 2,246, Kalaburagi 1,722, Ballari 1,284 and Mandya 1,110. The Covid fatality rate in Karnataka touched 1.2% on Friday. In all, Karnataka has reported17,804 Covid fatalities till May 7. The surge in deaths was expected given that Bengaluru is seeing a sharp rise in infections post mid-April and experts involved in the state’s Covid management have said viral replication occurs between the fifth day after the symptoms show and the ninth day when the disease worsens. Youngest victim 2 months oldDeaths are more likely during the second or third week. As per the bulletin, 55 patients died at home and11were brought dead to hospitals. The youngest victim was a two-month-old boy from Mysore who died on May 5 a day after he was admitted. Having conducted nearly 1.6 lakh Covid tests, the daily positivity rate stood at 30.6 % in Karnataka. As per the bulletin, there are 5.3 lakh active Covid patients in the state. “This is an expected surge. With the imposition of statewide total lockdown and movement restrictions, the transmission is likely to be controlled in the next 14 days,” said a technical advisory committee member, stressing the need to prevent unnecessary movement of public. Following the suggestion from the Covid technical advisory committee, the state health commissioner on May 6 issued a circular stating that persons suffering from Covid symptoms, who gave their swab samples for testing, can start treatment without waiting for test reports. Private labs and hospitals are directed to give prescription through their doctors to take Ivermectin 12mg (morning on empty stomach) along with vitamin and zinc supplements for three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-records-346-covid-19-deaths-in-24-hours-highest-ever-in-a-day/articleshow/82473545.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the 14-day lockdown will start at 6am on May 10 and end at 6am on May 24. The main differences in the new lockdown guidelines, when compared to existing rules, are that private vehicles will not be allowed to move freely and all intra-state travels between districts, cities and villages will be barred, except for medical and other emergency services. “Since the 14-day partial lockdown imposed by the state from April 27 failed to yield the desired result in containing the spread of the virus, we are forced to enforce stringent restrictions. Nobody will be allowed to come out on the streets after 10am. We’ll initiate stringent action on those who violate lockdown measures,” said Yediyurappa, after meeting cabinet colleagues, officials and health experts. Some experts are not happy with the decision to allow people movement to buy groceries, vegetables and other essentials. “When Karnataka imposed a 14-day lockdown from April 27, it allowed people to move freely between 6am and 10am to buy essentials. Many people misused this and started moving around freely, leading to crowds on the streets. The government could have avoided or limited this relaxation and imposed a strict lockdown now,’’ they said. Weddings and funerals allowed with conditionsYediyurappa defended the decision: “How can we expect people to live without their daily groceries? Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar said there won’t be crowds since they have banned people from using private vehicles to purchase groceries and especially to get parcels from hotels and liquor shops.” A member of the state’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee said: “The government should allow people to buy groceries for the next 15 days over this weekend and impose a complete lockdown till May 24. This is important especially when people are dying on the streets.’’ Offices of central and state governments and their autonomous and subordinate offices and public corporations will remain closed, barring offices of health and civic bodies. Any person visiting the state from any other state will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours. Permission will be given to organise weddings with the condition that more than 50 people will not be allowed to participate. Funerals and cremations are allowed with five people. All shops, commercial establishments, malls, cinema halls, swimming pools, gyms, hospitality services, private offices, industries, except those with in-situ staff, will remain shut.

---||Hubballi||Karnataka's 14-day lockdown: What's allowed and what's not from May 10||BENGALURU: Faced with the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths in Karnataka, the state government on Friday decided to impose a strict statewide lockdown from May 10 to May 24. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the 14-day lockdown will start at 6am on May 10 and end at 6am on May 24. The main differences in the new lockdown guidelines, when compared to existing rules, are that private vehicles will not be allowed to move freely and all intra-state travels between districts, cities and villages will be barred, except for medical and other emergency services. “Since the 14-day partial lockdown imposed by the state from April 27 failed to yield the desired result in containing the spread of the virus, we are forced to enforce stringent restrictions. Nobody will be allowed to come out on the streets after 10am. We’ll initiate stringent action on those who violate lockdown measures,” said Yediyurappa, after meeting cabinet colleagues, officials and health experts. Some experts are not happy with the decision to allow people movement to buy groceries, vegetables and other essentials. “When Karnataka imposed a 14-day lockdown from April 27, it allowed people to move freely between 6am and 10am to buy essentials. Many people misused this and started moving around freely, leading to crowds on the streets. The government could have avoided or limited this relaxation and imposed a strict lockdown now,’’ they said. Weddings and funerals allowed with conditionsYediyurappa defended the decision: “How can we expect people to live without their daily groceries? Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar said there won’t be crowds since they have banned people from using private vehicles to purchase groceries and especially to get parcels from hotels and liquor shops.” A member of the state’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee said: “The government should allow people to buy groceries for the next 15 days over this weekend and impose a complete lockdown till May 24. This is important especially when people are dying on the streets.’’ Offices of central and state governments and their autonomous and subordinate offices and public corporations will remain closed, barring offices of health and civic bodies. Any person visiting the state from any other state will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours. Permission will be given to organise weddings with the condition that more than 50 people will not be allowed to participate. Funerals and cremations are allowed with five people. All shops, commercial establishments, malls, cinema halls, swimming pools, gyms, hospitality services, private offices, industries, except those with in-situ staff, will remain shut. Milk parlours and pushcarts selling vegetables are allowed to operate from 6am to 10am and cabs and autos are allowed to drop and pick up passengers from the airport and railway stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/partial-curfew-fails-karnataka-imposes-strict-14-day-lockdown-from-may-10/articleshow/82477708.cms||Anil Gejji

A two-day meeting of the political affairs committee will be held on May 18 and 19 to finalize the revamp in the party. Earlier, at the meeting most leaders took the same stand and accepted responsibility for the defeat of the party. However, a few leaders criticized Mullappally Ramachandran, Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy for the poll debacle. In his opening remarks, Ramachandran alleged that he is being cornered for the poll debacle while defeat in elections is a collective responsibility. He alleged that there is an attempt to oust him unceremoniously. However, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, who spoke soon afterwards, made it clear that everyone has equal responsibility and hence there is no point in targeting a single leader for the poll debacle. Meanwhile, former chief minister Oommen Chandy said he is the first person responsible for the defeat as he was the chairman of the election committee. Both Chennithala and Chandy said they are ready to accept the decisions taken by AICC in the coming days. Soon, all senior leaders like K Sudhakaran, K Muraleedharan and VD Satheesan opined that there was no point in singling out leaders for the defeat. We all have a collective responsibility for this defeat and hence a thorough introspection is required. Not just cosmetic changes but a massive revamp right from the bottom level to the KPCC is required, they said in unison. There was a collective opinion that all jumbo district congress committees and even the KPCC should be dismantled and a new effective committee should come in its place. The meeting also decided to collect reports from mandalam, booth, block and district-level committees on what went wrong and where. KPCC general secretaries and party MPs, who were given charge of each constituency and district, will be meeting all candidates individually to collect their feedback.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/massive-revamp-on-the-cards-for-congress-in-kerala/articleshow/82473576.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Big demand to make Suvarna Soudha a Covid care centre||BELAGAVI: As Covid cases in Belagavi district are on the rise, the demand to convert the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha (SVS) into a Covid Care Centre has been steadily growing. Khanapur MLA Anjali Nimbalkar has written to chief minister BS Yediyurappa that the Rs 300 crore capacious building could help overcome the shortage of beds. Last year too, there were demands that this be made a CCC but nothing came of it. Netizens on several Facebook pages dedicated to Belagavi are creating memes with posting photos of SVS and slamming the state government for not utilising it during this medical emergency. Ever since the SVS was opened in 2012, there have been calls from administrators and people that it should be used better. Apart from an assembly session once a year, it really does not serve the purpose for which it was intended. The government did not hold any assembly session in 2020 and has not shifted offices from the state secretariat as assured. Prakash Wali, a resident of the city, said the district has started to report nearly 1,000 cases every day. “We’re hearing of a shortage of beds and oxygen. It’s high time the state converts the SVS, which is lying unused, into a Covid Care Centre. The government can also set up oxygenated beds to reduce dependency on private hospitals.” Another resident told TOI that the state could easily put up 1,000 beds in this large space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-big-demand-to-make-suvarna-soudha-a-covid-care-centre/articleshow/82473583.cms||---
---||Kochi||Private hospitals in Kerala demand 30-50% more than Karunya rates||KOCHI: Private hospitals have informed the state government that they should be allowed to charge 30-50 % more than the existing Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhati (KASP) rates for Covid treatment. However, negotiations are on and the government is yet to agree to it. “For poor walk-in patients admitted in the general ward, we are willing to reduce the rates. However, we should be allowed to charge 30 to 50% more than KASP rates from patients who prefer a private room and can afford treatment,” said Farhan Yasin, vice-president, Association of Healthcare Providers India (AHPI), Kerala chapter. The daily KASP rates for Covid treatment: General ward, Rs 2,300, High Dependency Unit, Rs 3,300, ICU without ventilator, Rs 6,500 and ICU with ventilator, Rs 11,500. They have fixed the PPE cost of Rs 1,000/unit, with a maximum claim limit of Rs 1 lakh/case. These charges will apply to patients referred by the government to the hospital under 25% reservation and the enhanced rates will be applicable for the rest 25% of patients who come directly to the hospital, said sources. During negotiations, the government informed private hospitals that they have benchmarked KASP rates for Covid treatment and how much is the enhanced rate that they want to charge. Initially, private hospitals asked for a 100-130% increase in rates, which was turned down. On Friday, they submitted the revised rates. The meeting headed by Health Secretary Dr Rajan Khobragade was called after the Kerala high court while considering a petition seeking uniform Covid treatment rates in private hospitals asked the state government to regulate it. The stakeholders – corporate hospitals, small and medium hospitals and private medical colleges – discussed two issues namely getting empanelled under KASP and rates for Covid treatment. “Negotiations are going on with the government and we will definitely reach a consensus as everybody is working together to ensure that no Covid patient is denied treatment in the state,” said AHPI president Dr M I Sahadulla. Further, HC deprecated the practice of some hospitals charging its patients for two or three PPE kits per day and Rs 40,000 for oxygen and asked those to be regulated as well. The HC also asked the government to consider regulating consumables sold outside. The court will hear the case on Monday. Private hospitals said that high-end medicines for Covid treatment should be excluded from KASP rates. “Facilities in no two private hospitals are the same but then the situation warrants that we work together to sail through this crisis,” said Kerala Private Hospital Association (KPHA) secretary Dr Benevan Joseph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/private-hospitals-in-kerala-demand-30-50-more-than-karunya-rates/articleshow/82473592.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Karnataka government provides kits for home isolation in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The government has embarked on an ambitious mission of providing medical kits for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms in home isolation. Officials, on Friday, said the scheme has already been launched in select areas of Bengaluru and will soon be expanded to cover the entire state. A cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan recently recommended providing free kits to Covid-19 patients recovering at home, considering the lack of hospital beds in the wake of rising cases. The prime objective is to treat as many patients as possible without having to admit them in hospitals. Experts and doctors had called for health authorities to monitor people in home isolation more closely, saying constant checks are needed to save lives. A top virologist based in Bengaluru had pointed out that more people who are initially asymptomatic are dying, as reported by TOI on Friday. Symptoms suddenly accelerate in these cases and people very often seek treatment late. However, the scheme to provide kits is a tad ambitious since it will require huge funding. As on Friday, Bengaluru Urban alone had more than 3.4 lakh active cases, 92% of whom are said to be in home isolation. However, chief secretary P Ravi Kumar said resources will not be an issue as the scheme has been given top priority.  Funds have already been diverted from other departments to manage the pandemic and this money will be utilised for the purpose, he said. But he could not say precisely how much has been earmarked for the purpose. “Orders have already been placed for materials required to make up home isolations kits and the scheme will be made effective across the state as soon as materials arrive,” said Kumar. Deputy chief minister Narayan, who had launched the scheme on a pilot basis in Malleswaram, his constituency, said a home isolation kit would mainly contain basic Covid-19 medicines along with a handbook on advice for patients.  The government is trying to include an oximeter and thermometer, Narayan added. “The government has been distributing medicines to patients in home isolation even last year. The new feature we are thinking of adding is regular blood tests. This is seen as important in order to ensure effective monitoring of their health condition,” Narayan said The blood test and haemogram will be done in primary health centres or fever clinics once in three days till the patient tests negative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-govt-provides-kits-for-home-isolation-in-bengaluru/articleshow/82473595.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Tigress found dead in Balaghat irrigation canal||BHOPAL: A sub-adult tigress was found under mysterious circumstances in Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh. All its body organs were intact and poaching attempt has been ruled out by the officials. Some however suspect it as a case of electrocution or poisoning on grounds that it had bleeding from mouth. Autopsy has been scheduled for Saturday. Carcass of tigress was seen floating in Rajiv Gandhi irrigation canal near Waraseoni thehsil’s Khadagpur village (Ansira gram panchayat) which is roughly 20 kms away from the Maharashtra border, officials informed. They believe this tigress must have dispersed from Maharashtra’s Bhandara district. Villagers informed that flow of the canal was high on Wednesday, and therefore it would have floated from somewhere else. Tigress must have died on Thursday. WWF-India had been working on multiplying the tiger population in Balaghat for long- they call it a tiger recovery site or TX2 site. Target was to double up the number of tiger population in this region by 2020 Unfortunately, the spot where this tigress was found and the stretch up to Sonewani forest area is all agricultural land. It was spotted by a passerby around 11 am and we came to know about it after two hours,” said an officer. Dog squads were sent to the area for search, but no clues were found, he said. Its stripes could not be matched with any of the big cats in the data base available with Pench and Kanha tiger reserves, sources said. Pictures have been shared with Maharashtra and WII-Dehradun for further verification. Environmentalist Ajay Dubey said, “Instead of taking care of the wildlife, forest department has shut down its offices in the name of Covid-19. Mismanagement is leading to continuous death of tigers. If this goes on, we won’t be a tiger state soon,” Dubey says. WWF-India had been working on multiplying the tiger population in Balaghat for long- they call it a tiger recovery site or TX2 site. Target was to double up the number of tiger population in this region by 2020. Nothing much happened, say sources. Balaghat tiger recovery site is situated in the biodiverse Maikal hills, comprising 963 km2 of forests. It is strategically located in the corridor regions connecting several source population sites, including Kanha and Pench Tiger Reserves in Madhya Pradesh with protected areas of low tiger densities such as Achanakmar Tiger Reserve in Chhattisgarh and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, says a report titled “The Balaghat Tx2 Recovery Site: Status of Tigers and Conservation Assessment (2014-2017)”.

Most alarming part is that Madhya Pradesh is worst among these 15 when it comes to tests per million. State has, however, increased the number of tests recently after the cases began to surge. On an average around 60,000 tests are being done every day in the state, but when it comes to overall testing, only around 1 lakh out of every 10 lakh population has been tested, which is worst among the states that have reported more than 5 lakh cases so far. Even states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Odisha, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh have fared well when it comes to conducting tests than Madhya Pradesh. When it comes to overall cumulative positivity rate, i.e. number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested since the beginning of Covid-19 in the state, MP has 7th worst positivity rate among the top 15 states, which have reported maximum cases. Sources said, less number of testing has persistent in the state since the beginning of the pandemic. Now around 60,000 tests are being done every day, but it had decreased to around 20000-25000 tests in March itself, said sources. Early identification of a positive patient and subsequent isolation is one of the key factors to contain the spread of the virus; it is need of the day that tests are further increased and not reduced even after the cases decrease, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-fares-worst-in-tests-per-million-among-states-with-5-lakh-positive-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82473628.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Jaipur||21 deaths in 21 days in Rajasthan village||JAIPUR: Kheerva village in Laxmangarh tehsil of Rajasthan’s Sikar has witnessed 21 deaths in as many days. But just four of these deaths recorded during April 16 to May 5 have officially been attributed to Covid-19. Taking note of this “unusually high” figure in a village of 3,500 residents, state health officials rushed to Kheerva on Friday. They took random samples to ascertain the possibility of a community spread of the virus. A villager who died in Surat was buried in Kheerva on April 16 without following Covid-19 guidelines. Villagers claim misinformation drive, say not all died of CovidThe body was not only taken out of the plastic bag, but was also touched by several men who thronged the burial. Village sarpanch Hakim Ali said, “Sometimes we don’t record a single death in a year, while the average is around five to six. This is too high.” PCC president and education minister Govind Singh Dotasra, who is the local MLA, posted about the burial on social media on Thursday and linked the series of deaths in the village to the violation of protocol by the villagers during the burial of the Covidpositive victim. The local administration has not confirmed that the man was infected by the virus. Villagers have alleged that misinformation was being spread that all deaths occurred due to Covid. Dotasra has deleted his post which invited the ire of locals accusing him of making false claims. The minister clarified to TOI on Friday that the post was deleted after the local administration brought to his notice that the body was not of a Covid victim. “Still, the team of doctors was sent to find out the reason behind the unusual number of deaths in the village. A total of 157 RT-PCR samples were collected to determine the scale of infection in the village,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/21-deaths-in-21-days-in-rajasthan-village/articleshow/82473606.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Pets & cattle starve when owners test Covid positive||KOCHI: With Covid infection spreading its wings to every nook and corner, pet animals and cattle in homestead farms are left to be starved for many days when family members are either shifted to hospitals or first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) after they tested positive or placed under quarantine in the state. Neighbours and relatives refuse to feed the animals as they are scared to enter the compound misconstruing that they will contract the infection from the animals. In a recent incident, a dog was left to starve for five days after an elderly man in the family died of Covid at Kolenchery and his wife and daughter were shifted to a treatment facility after they tested positive. As no one came forward to feed the dog, the son of the deceased in Ireland sought the help of a local animal rescue team. “When I went there, the dog was lying in the cage due to lack of food in the house, situated behind an old munsiff court building. There were also fowls in the house. No one was forthcoming to feed the dog and fowls for five days. I have been feeding them for the past three to four days thereafter. I also got a call from another family this morning (Friday) to rescue cattle. I got another call on Thursday to feed fowls and ducks in a house where all family members have been shifted to a facility after getting tested positive for Covid. Sadly, even neighbours are not ready to come to the gate of the house to place food for the needy,” says Suresh, an animal rescuer in Kolenchery. Animal rights activists across the state are getting calls from people informing about the pathetic situation of animals when the family members turn Covid positive. Anjali Anand, coordinator of Animal Rescue Rehabilitation and Overall Wellness (ARROW), remembers how a neighbour told one of her volunteers to let the dog die of starvation. “All members in a family at Thengana in Kottayam were admitted to a hospital after they tested positive for Covid. We came to know that a dog in their house was starving for food for four days. Our volunteer travelled around 30km to reach the house and gave food to the animal. Later, our volunteer approached a neighbour asking whether it would be convenient to give food to the dog if he gives them dry food for animals. To the shock of everybody, the neighbour replied that we should let the dog die of starvation. In another house, family members were in home care after getting infected with Covid. A dog was there and was recuperating after a surgery. Despite the request of family members to get medicine and treatment for the dog, neighbours refused to take the animal to the hospital. Later, we shifted the dog to the hospital and returned it,” said Anand. Animal husbandry director K M Dileep said the issue has not came to his notice. Directive will be issued to make arrangements at local level to ensure that animals are fed when family members have to be shifted to Covid facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-pets-cattle-starve-when-owners-test-covid-positive/articleshow/82473665.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Karnataka: MP and district ministers squabble over oxygen supply||MYSURU: With pressure on hospitals mounting with the rise in cases and medical resources such as beds and oxygen scarce, elected representatives are increasingly engaging in petty turf wars, putting people’s lives at risk. On Friday, Pratap Simha, Mysuru MP, stopped just short of accusing district ministers of Chamarajanagar and Mandya of indulging in goondaism after KC Narayanagowda, Mandya district minister, travelled to Mysuru with police in tow to get oxygen cylinders for his district on Wednesday. His Chamarajanagar counterpart S Suresh Kumar had also visited suppliers in Mysuru on Thursday. The squabble — between functionaries of the same ruling party — comes in the wave of the deaths of 23 patients at Chamarajanagar Covid hospital after oxygen supply was exhausted and fresh stock from Mysuru was delayed. “There is a trend of oppression which is affecting Covid management in Mysuru,” Simha said. “Officials in Mysuru are being threatened and ordered to fall in line. We need to take care of patients housed in our Covid facilities. But when ministers come and take away supplies, it is not good. They should control themselves, otherwise, I will have to intervene.” He asked both ministers to get the state government to increase their quota of oxygen. “Mysuru needs nearly 40 kilo litres (KL) of oxygen every day, but we are getting only 24KL,” the BJP MP said. Over the past few days Mysuru has been reporting more than 2500 fresh cases a day. He said cases could spiral to 10,000 a day by May end. He said the Mysuru district administration will install CCTV cameras at all eight medical oxygen suppliers’ plants to monitor movement of cylinders. ‘Outsiders’ barredMeanwhile, in Shivamogga, senior BJP minister KS Eshwarappa had told authorities at McGann Hospital, the designated Covid facility, to display ‘no beds’ boards to deter patients from neighbouring districts seeking treatment in Shivamogga. He said after authorities put up the boards, “the number of outsiders decreased” at the hospital. “Patients from neighbouring districts should not come to Shivamogga,” Eshwarappa said. “They have facilities in their respective districts. Our oxygen beds and ventilators are created as per our requirement. We are not able to meet demand for beds from people in Shivamogga itself under the current situation.” Amid the crisis, Bhadravati VISL’s oxygen plant began operations on Thursday, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-mp-and-district-ministers-squabble-over-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82473661.cms||HM Aravind

The day of prayer was observed after Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) wrote to various diocesan bishops to pray for those affected by the pandemic on the day. “The day was spent in prayers and fasting by priests and nuns at wherever they are stationed. Parishioners were also asked to pray and fast at their own home in the backdrop of the pandemic. Cardinal George Alencherry observed the day in prayers at Mount St Thomas,” said Fr Abraham Kavilpurayidathil, PRO of the Syro Malabar Church. It was on April 22, CBCI president Cardinal Oswald Gracias wrote to heads of various dioceses urging them to observe the day. “After taking counsel with Cardinal Alencherry, Cardinal Cleemis and CCBI president Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao, I thought that we should unitedly turn to God in this time of distress. Hence, I am inviting all our Churches to observe May 7 as day of prayer and fasting for relief from the Covid-19 pandemic,” Cardinal Gracias had written. Church sources said that Pope Francis has written to Cardinal Gracias on Thursday conveying the Pope’s solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people. “At this time when so many in India are suffering as a result of the present health emergency, I am writing to convey my heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people, together with the assurance of my prayers that God will grant healing and consolation to everyone affected by the grave pandemic. My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,” the Pope had written.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/churches-observe-day-of-prayer-fasting-in-kerala/articleshow/82473681.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Covid-19 in MP: Lack of info leaves travellers in a fix about carrying RTPCR reports||BHOPAL: Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic surfaced the biggest challenge has been for the travellers to know whether they need to carry RTPCR reports with them or not. Such is the situation that almost every traveller has to run from pillar to post to know about carrying the RTPCR report with them. Travellers said that there is no specific information provided to them about it. “I was supposed to travel by road last month from Allahabad to Madhya Pradesh. Such was the absence of the information that at the end I had to cancel the trip. I called up everyone, but I was forced to cancel the travelling,” said Vivek Sinha, a private firm employee. Same has been the problem for train passengers. “I had read several times that travellers need to carry RTPCR negative reports while travelling to Delhi. However, there was no one to ask me when I got down at New Delhi railway station. I was a little scared also as god knows what would happen if police ask me for the report,” said Virendra Ahuja, a private firm employee based in Bhopal. Even the air travellers have been facing the same problem. “I do not know what kind of approach is this as few states are demanding the RTPCR report while others not. Besides, even they are asking if there should be a platform to check whether such reports should be carried or not,” said Akash Maharishi, a resident of Bhopal. In the absence of the information, several travellers left in confusion even till the last minute of their journey. “I was to travel by air in an emergency. I did not know the protocol of carrying the report. I had read somewhere that authorities demand last 72 hours report. I had given RTPCR test but the agency was asking me to wait for two days to receive the report. Now, in this situation what to do,” said Vineet Patil, a resident of Bhopal. Even the officials were not able to provide the exact information about the travellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-19-in-mp-lack-of-info-leaves-travellers-in-a-fix-about-carrying-rtpcr-reports/articleshow/82473679.cms||---

These officials would visit areas where guest workers reside and communicate with them in their language. “The labourers would be given awareness about the situation. The directives of the government would be explained to them and measures would be taken to avoid any kind of anxiety or stress among them. Awareness would be given about the possibility of fake new and misinformation which are likely to be spread among them as well,” said Karthick. Meanwhile, police have closed the district borders with barricades from Friday midnight as the statewide lockdown comes into place. Police said that goods vehicles laden with essential commodities will be allowed inter-district travel. Everyone else will have to produce relevant documents like ID cards to prove their purpose of travel. Karthick said that vehicles of those who fail to produce relevant documents would be confiscated and individuals found violating the lockdown without a justifiable reason would face stringent action. Rural police said in a statement that more police personnel have been deployed for the enforcement of restrictions in connection with the lockdown. Police pickets have been set up at important points. Rural police have also deployed special teams to monitor fake news and miscreants who indulge in scaremongering. Rural SP on Friday held online meetings with traders about the measures to be undertaken in connection with the lockdown. SP has assured the public the full support of police. Rural police on Friday registered 325 cases for violation of Covid protocol and arrested 102 people. As many as 309 vehicles were seized. Nine persons were booked for quarantine violations. Action was initiated against 3,015 for not wearing masks and 2,934 for not maintaining social distancing, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-34-liaison-officers-to-ensure-welfare-of-guest-workers/articleshow/82473691.cms||---

Now, non-Bengaluru Urban districts have overtaken the state capital and their share touched 52% of fresh infections on May 6. Their share further increased to 56% on Friday. There is a surge in 10 districts of the state, apart from Bengaluru, in a clear sign that the virus is spreading to other districts. “Ten districts, including Tumakuru, Kalaburagi and Mysuru, are showing a huge surge and they don’t have the required infrastructure to handle the cases,” members of the state’s technical advisory committee (TAC) said. The inter-district movement during Ugadi and village festivals is a major source of the virus spread, say TAC members. “With fruits and flowers, virus was also transported by people to their relatives’ places. Though there were no curbs on inter-city travel, caution should have been exercised by the citizens,” a member said. According to TAC chairperson Dr MK Sudarshan, people moving out of Bengaluru to other districts have led to a surge in districts like Hassan, Belagavi and Mysuru. District-wise advisory teams needed: DocGradual surge has begun in all other districts. As there were no restrictions on intrastate movement following Janata curfew, many have moved out of Bengaluru and from other districts. Any travel leads to spreading of infection. No part of the country is free from infection. Surge in other districts is caused partly by local spread of infection and partly by migration from the epicentre,” said Dr Sudarshan. ‘Working with acute stress’The Chamarajanagar incident where 24 Covid patients died due to shortage of oxygen has become a nightmare for all district health officers. “We are working with acute stress. There is a shortage of Remdesivir, oxygen, testing kits, beds and human resources. With our MP’s intervention, we got Remdesivir recently. A team of doctors is facing sleepless nights as there are multiple deaths occurring every day. Lack of a liquid oxygen tank in the district hospital is still an issue,” said a health official from a north Karnataka district. The rise in Covid cases in north Karnataka is contributed largely by those who came from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The surge in southern Karnataka started as clusters initially from those who had returned from Kerala, a TAC member said. According to Dr Sudarshan, there is a need to form districtwise technical advisory committees to guide deputy commissioners in Covid management. Each team must have five members and include clinical and public-health experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/52-of-fresh-covid-cases-from-non-bengaluru-districts/articleshow/82473693.cms||Sunitha Rao R

In a phone conversation, Modi and his counterpart Scott Morrison agreed on the need to tame the pandemic worldwide by ensuring vaccine availability. "Modi conveyed his appreciation for the prompt and generous support extended by the government and people of Australia for India's fight against the second wave of Covid-19," said the government in a statement. The two leaders took note of the progress made in the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership since the virtual summit held on June 4, 2020 and discussed ways to further strengthen cooperation and foster people-to-people ties, it said. They also discussed regional issues and reiterated the importance of working together for a rules-based international order and a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-seeks-oz-support-on-trips/articleshow/82473703.cms||---

For this, all Janakeeya Hotels run by Kudumbashree will be ensuring food for the needy. In those places where there are no such hotels, local bodies have been directed to begin community kitchens, he added. Local bodies and the police will ensure that food packets are distributed at homes for the needy. Hotels in the state can function during lockdown but no dine-in will be allowed. But, parcels can be provided. The kit of essential commodities will be distributed this month also through ration shops from next week. Such kits will also be provided to guest workers. The chief minister said it is not possible to provide vaccines for all persons aged between 18 and 45 years. Hence it has been decided to give priority for those people who are living with comorbidities in this age-group. Though we have demanded one crore vaccines from the manufacturers, we have not received a favourable response. They have promised only a limited stock initially, he added. Already a surge plan has been readied by the health department to meet any eventuality. At present, we have a ventilator facility of 2293 which was initially 995. The number of ICU beds have increased to 2,857 from 1,800. Steps have been taken to ensure oxygen stock, he added. At present, Kerala has 6,008 oxygen cylinders and 21,888 B-type cylinders.

The meeting that will be conducted online will discuss the roles and responsibilities of local bodies in containing the spread. There was criticism that most of the local bodies were unable to rise to the occasion during the second wave as the elected representatives were newcomers who were unclear of their duties during the pandemic. In the last couple of weeks, the local self-government department has been initiating several proactive steps by involving local bodies in Covid-19 control and management.

A delegation of BBMP medical health officers met chief health officer B Vijayendra on Friday in this regard. A BBMP source said Vijayendra asked the officials to submit a memorandum which he will take up with chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. A Amruth Raj, president of BBMP officers’ and employees’ association, said health officers are harassed every day. “We want the BBMP chief commissioner to solve the issue or we will quit,” he added. New protocol on beds may ease misuseThe government said it is planning a new protocol for bed management that may minimise political interference apart from making the system foolproof against malpractices such as the bed-blocking scam. “As many officials have aired grievances about political interference, the protocol is being designed to address such issues as well,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. A senior official said BJP MLA Satish Reddy had demanded that 90% of hospital beds in Bommanahalli zone be reserved in his name so that he could help his constituents seeking hospital admission. A team of his representatives sitting in the war room had allegedly taken control of bed allotment till a senior officer took objection and sent them out last week. While this led to an unsavory public spat between his supporters and the war room officials, zonal minister S Suresh Kumar and revenue minister R Ashoka had to intervene to bring the situation under control. Reddy denied any irregularity. “It is my duty to help people of my constituency. There was an instance where 17 bodies waited for hours for cremation; no official was forthcoming with help. Patients were denied beds. As a representative of the people, I sought beds for the needy,” he said. With many such instances being reported, the government decided to implement the new protocol as suggested by a three-member committee of officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/netas-issue-threats-we-cant-work-bengaluru-health-workers/articleshow/82473731.cms||B V Shivashankar

Communist parties of China and Cuba and Left parties from Germany and Sri Lanka wished them on the occasion. The latest among the lot is Germany. “Leaders of Die Linke, which is a major left party in Germany, sent a greeting. They also asked us to inform them if they could do something for us in containing Covid as well. We have already received greetings from communist parties in China and Cuba. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, a communist party in Sri Lanka, also extended its solidarity,” said CPM politburo member MA Baby. The leaders of Die Linke, said in the message that the long-lasting efforts by the LDF government to strengthen the health system during the time of the pandemic is one of the major factors that led to the major victory. “Two terms in a row for a Left government in Kerala is the result of the successful Left strategies during the previous term. The way of having a broad participation of citizens goes along with good and stable solutions, especially in times of crises. The long-lasting way to improve and strengthen the health system was of course a great success during this pandemic,” stated the message sent by Wulf Gallert, member of party executive board, Die Linke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consecutive-poll-win-wishes-pour-in-from-abroad/articleshow/82473803.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

I am only acting as a corrective force. BJP won’t run away because of the setback it received in the elections. We would continue to work as a corrective force in the democratic discourse. BJP would study the reasons for the erosion of votes in certain constituencies. There is no basis for vote trading charges. If votes are lost because of trade, Pinarayi Vijayan, who is also the politburo member of his party, should clarify whether CPM had sold off all its votes,” he said. Muraleedharan said BJP’s performance in Kazhakkoottam and Nemom, where its candidates finished second, were promising. He also alleged the involvement of jihadi elements in LDF’s election victory. He said BJP and CPM share a common reaction on West Bengal. “It’s total lawlessness there,” he said. Muraleedharan said he has brought to the notice of the concerned central minister about Kerala chief minister’s request for allocation of more medical oxygen. “Imported oxygen is being distributed in accordance with the needs of states. There will be more interventions on this front in the coming days. Dispatch of oxygen to different states is being carried out using all available facilities, including oxygen trains. No state needs to be worried over its availability. They only need to ensure the availability of enough tankers for the movement of the consignments within the states,” he said. According to the Union minister, Kerala government could so far set up only two of the four oxygen plants sanctioned by the Centre and expressed worry over the same. He asked why the state government was not taking steps to regulate the Covid treatment charges in private hospitals. “The state health minister claimed last July that the rates were regulated. The astronomical charges demanded by private hospitals for Covid treatment is scary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nothing-personal-against-pinarayi-says-union-minister-muraleedharan/articleshow/82473860.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Nothing personal against Pinarayi, says Union minister Muraleedharan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union minister V Muraleedharan said on Friday that his criticisms against Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan should not be interpreted as a personal attack on Vijayan. “I am not making any personal attack on him. I am only acting as a corrective force. BJP won’t run away because of the setback it received in the elections. We would continue to work as a corrective force in the democratic discourse. BJP would study the reasons for the erosion of votes in certain constituencies. There is no basis for vote trading charges. If votes are lost because of trade, Pinarayi Vijayan, who is also the politburo member of his party, should clarify whether CPM had sold off all its votes,” he said. Muraleedharan said BJP’s performance in Kazhakkoottam and Nemom, where its candidates finished second, were promising. He also alleged the involvement of jihadi elements in LDF’s election victory. He said BJP and CPM share a common reaction on West Bengal. “It’s total lawlessness there,” he said. Muraleedharan said he has brought to the notice of the concerned central minister about Kerala chief minister’s request for allocation of more medical oxygen. “Imported oxygen is being distributed in accordance with the needs of states. There will be more interventions on this front in the coming days. Dispatch of oxygen to different states is being carried out using all available facilities, including oxygen trains. No state needs to be worried over its availability. They only need to ensure the availability of enough tankers for the movement of the consignments within the states,” he said. According to the Union minister, Kerala government could so far set up only two of the four oxygen plants sanctioned by the Centre and expressed worry over the same. He asked why the state government was not taking steps to regulate the Covid treatment charges in private hospitals. “The state health minister claimed last July that the rates were regulated. The astronomical charges demanded by private hospitals for Covid treatment is scary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nothing-personal-against-pinarayi-says-union-minister-muraleedharan/articleshow/82473861.cms||---
