Everyone is now thinking of ways to boost one's immunity and kadha has been the answer to many family problems.  Sarina Dcosta from Majorda says, “It was only recently that I have been drinking kadha. After my husband was tested positive, I was informed by the doctors to consume it every day. I asked a few friends for the recipe and immediately started making it. I add a little jaggery to make it sweet.”  Jeanne Ribeiro, dietitian, QUA Nutrition, says, “Adding immunity building foods which contain Vitamin C such as amla, lime, oranges and guavas is a must. Spices such as ginger, garlic, turmeric, black pepper, cumin, fennel seeds, you can make all this into an immunity boosting tea or a kadha.”  I have old parents at home and I think that its better to be safe than sorry. We used to have bitter medicines and tonics only if we fell sick. But now I make it a point to drink kadha. We are gradually reducing our tea intake and trying to drink kadha instead. The ingredients are easily available in almost every household,” says Monica Dias, from Panaji||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kadha-is-now-every-familys-favourite-drink/articleshow/82841211.cms||---

The urgent SOS, among other things, is to seek "salary support for airport employees to avoid any possible loss of employment due to sustained low level of operations for such a long period." The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) earlier this week sent an 11-point communication to Union aviation ministry amid the Covid catastrophe in India that has dealt a body blow to aviation as both international and domestic air travel have crashed. "Struggling to sustain operations, concerned for a much deeper financial impact this year. It has now come to the brink, to ensure sustenance of safe and secure airport operations and are in dire need of cash support to survive," it says. APAO represents PPP airports at Mumbai and upcoming Navi Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru (part of Adani Group); Delhi, Hyderabad and upcoming in Goa (GMR Group); Bengaluru and Kochi. Indian airlines are also in dire straits and had a meeting with aviation ministry on Thursday to seek elusive support. The APAO representation to the government speaks of suffering "catastrophically in terms of traffic, revenues and cash balance for the entire last year. The recent surge of cases has again raised serious concerns for the future." Due to the vaccination fiasco in India, it says, "going by the current pace it will take much longer to vaccinate a sizeable Indian population" required for safe travel to resume. Citing impact of the second wave, it says Delhi airport had recovered to nearly 1.1 lakh daily domestic passengers (about 60% of pre-covid level) in February before slipping to 20-25,000 by mid-May. Mumbai airport had recovered to 60,000 daily domestic passengers by mid-February, before crashing to 12-15,000 by-May 2021. Other airports have also seen their traffic fall off the cliff. The 11-point relief sought is for things like "extending GST input tax credit; reduction in GST rate from 18% on output services to 12%; disbursement of overdues from Air India; salary support for airport employees; special line of credit or working capital loan on an unsecured basis at subsidised rate with a moratorium of at least 2 years. The credit amount should cover the cash flow gap for a period of at least 24 months or till business comes back to normalcy." It has also requested a "moratorium on debt servicing obligations and extending suspension of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code till March 31, 2022." Rating agency ICRA earlier this year estimated India’s airport sector would post a combined net loss of Rs 5,400 crore and cash loss of Rs 3,500 crore during FY 21. Based on revival in air travel being witnessed till mid-March, ICRA had estimated the sector’s operating income to rise 73% to Rs 14,500 crore and net profit to Rs 190 crore in FY 22. But now the Covid tsunami has erased all gains of past few months. "All airports are struggling. Business is down to 10%. One or two of these 10 PPP airports are finding it hard to pay staff. Both aero and non-aero revenues have crashed," say senior PPP airport officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ppp-airport-operators-seek-cash-support-from-government-to-pay-staff-and-sustain-operations/articleshow/82841442.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Principal of GMCH Dr Shashi Sudan Sharma has confirmed the fatality due to mucormycosis and said the man suffered from a high degree of diabetes of 900-level and was immunocompromised. “The patient had tested negative of Covid-19 before he was admitted to the hospital for fungal infection,” Dr Sudan said, adding that it was an avoidable complication that could be restricted by strictly monitoring the blood sugar levels of Covid-19 patients, who have been put on steroids. “His condition patient was critical when admitted into GMCH. We have so far detected this single case only. So, people are advised not to panic,” she said. Earlier head of ophthalmology department at Government Medical College (GMC) Jammu, Dr Satish Gupta had said, “We have not witnessed any case of black fungus infection in the recent months.” He had advised the susceptible population to keep diabetes under check and warned all against unsupervised use of steroids. Dr Gupta said that black fungus usually targeted Covid-recovered persons with uncontrolled diabetes or those who have administered prolonged or unsupervised dosage of steroids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-and-kashmir-reports-first-death-due-to-black-fungus/articleshow/82841531.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The explosion occurred at a rally organized by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Nazaryati (JUI-N) in Chaman’s Murghi Bazaar, Balochistan government spokesman Liaquat Shahwani said. The rally was taken out to express solidarity with the people of Palestine, which over the last 11 days has been involved in a tense confrontation with Israel that has led to the death of over 240 people, and threatened to destabilise the volatile Middle East. Shahwani strongly condemned the attack, saying terrorists wanted to destroy Balochistan’s peace. “The enemies of solidarity with the oppressed Palestinians are on the side of Israeli aggression,” he added. According to police, the explosive material was packed into a motorbike parked near the vehicle of a religious leader who was participating in the rally. “It was an improvised explosive device which went off as participants began to disperse,” said Tariq Mengal, a senior local administration official. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. On Friday after mid-day prayers, thousands of people rallied across Pakistan in support of Palestinians, hours after a ceasefire was announced between Israel and Hamas. The incident comes a month after a suicide bombing at a luxury hotel in Quetta, killing at least five people and wounding 12 others. A Chinese ambassador was at the hotel when the bomb exploded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/at-least-7-killed-in-blast-at-pro-palestine-rally-in-pakistan/articleshow/82841610.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The number of cases has nearly tripled, with an additional 2,111 cases in the past week compared to a total of 1,313 the week before. “Cases are still predominantly affecting the North West of England — particularly Bolton — and London, but we are seeing clusters of cases across the country. There is evidence that B.1617.2 is growing rapidly and may be more transmissible than B. 1.1.7 (the ‘Kent variant’) that is currently dominant in the UK,” the Public Health England (PHE) said. “There is currently no evidence to suggest the vaccines will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness and hospitalisation from B.1617.2. It is highly likely that the vaccines offer significant protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death, which is why it’s vital to get both vaccine doses as soon as you are offered to them,” it added. Surge testing, including door-to-door testing and mobile testing units, enhanced contact tracing, and self-isolation support, and enhanced vaccine rollout are being deployed in affected areas with second doses for priority groups being brought forward. Wastewater monitoring has been increased in affected areas too to help identify early warning signals of where the variant may be present. A spokesperson for PHE told TOI, “We are confident B.1617.2. is at least as transmissible as the Kent variant but we have not got enough evidence to make any further judgment.” A paper to Sage by Jupiter, a consortium of modelling groups, on Friday, said, “Although Bolton was initially dominated by cases in the Asian population, there is now a heterogeneous mix of cases, suggesting community spread. We have three areas that we think are principally community transmission of B.1.617.2 — the North West cluster around Bolton, Sefton and Liverpool and around Bedford. Modelling suggests new variants with increased transmissibility are capable of generating a wave of infections bigger than previous waves. It is possible the outbreak in India is partly the result of higher transmission of B.1.617.2.” The PHE has also this week classified a new variant with “an unusual mutation profile” a variant under investigation. There are 49 cases of the strain named VUI-21MAY-01 in the UK and the country it was first detected in is yet to be confirmed. It is mainly concentrated in Yorkshire and the Humber. There is currently no evidence it can evade the vaccine or causes more serious disease, PHE said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/indian-variant-cases-triple-in-one-week-in-uk/articleshow/82841649.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Some TOI editions had reported that Patra’s post, as also one by author Shefali Vaidya, had been flagged by Twitter. This marks another instance of the Modi government asking social media companies to remove content that is seemingly critical of its handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Last month, Twitter and other players such as Facebook, YouTube, Google and WhatsApp were also asked to take down some content that the government said contained "fake or misleading information" meant to create panic. There have been other instances, such as those related to the farmer protests, where the social media outfit was asked to remove certain tweets. On Friday, the IT ministry’s latest rebuttal came hours after Twitter’s action which had followed a complaint made by Congress that had raised objections to the tweets and retweets by the BJP functionaries regarding the alleged "toolkit". As a political slugfest began, the ministry shot back with its objection, alleging that Twitter’s action "appears prejudged, prejudiced and a deliberate attempt to colour the investigation by local law enforcement agency". The notice said that the company’s action "dilutes the credibility of Twitter as a neutral and unbiased platform facilitating exchange of views by the users". Asking the social media giant to remove the "manipulated media" tag immediately, the ministry said Twitter "cannot pass its judgment" when the matter is under investigation. "Such content moderation by Twitter puts a question mark on its status as an ‘intermediary’," the ministry told the company, this being the second time in recent months when the two (government and Twitter) are in a major face-off, although there have other issues too regarding the company’s content-moderation policy. Twitter did not respond to questions around the government’s latest charge against the company. However, Ian Plunkett, the global director for the company’s public policy communications, told TOI, "We can confirm this tweet has been labelled in line with our global synthetic and manipulated policy. We've nothing further to share." The IT ministry said that the latest "toolkit" — allegedly created by Congress according to tweets by BJP functionaries — had been made to "undermine, derail and demean" the efforts the government has been making towards corona relief. "While the local law enforcement agency is undertaking the investigation to determine the veracity of the ‘tookit’, Twitter has unilaterally drawn a conclusion in this matter and arbitrarily tagged it as ‘manipulated media’… such unilateral action is an effort to influence the fair investigation process and a clear overreach, which is totally unwarranted," the ministry said. Patra’s tweet, posted on May 18, included the screenshot of a word document, which contained instructions to amplify BJP’s alleged apathy towards corona relief efforts.

A bench of Justices L N Rao and S R Bhat upheld the validity of the November 15, 2019 notification issued by the Centre fastening liability of bad debts on corporate guarantors for loans obtained by their companies, which later failed to pay up and went into resolution proceedings under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code. The apex court ruling will help banks go after those who have offered guarantees to recover dues in case the resolution amount is short of the claims filed by them in the National Company Law Tribunal. The ruling will disappoint high-profile petitioners such as Sanjay Singhal and Aarti Singhal of Bhushan Power and Steel, Reliance group’s Anil Ambani, Punj Lloyd’s Atul Punj, infrastructure firm IVRCL’s E Sudhir Reddy and Sabbineni Surendra, the promoter of Hyderabad-based Coastal Projects, who had challenged the validity of the central notification. They had argued that once a resolution plan for the distressed company is approved by NCLT, the personal guarantors stood absolved of their liability. Companies promoted by them have been part of the insolvency drive initiated by lenders due to a massive pile-up of bad debt. Over the years, many companies have repeatedly defaulted in loan repayment and got banks to restructure the debt, often citing systemic issues. But as part of the clean-up initiated five years ago, the IBC was enacted and banks were told to go after those who were not paying their dues The State Bank of India, through advocate Sanjay Kapur, had informed the court that the bank or a consortium led by SBI had initiated proceedings against Singhals (Rs 12,276 crore), Punj (Rs 3,400 crore), Surendra (Rs 2,130 crore), Ambani (Rs 1,900 crore) and Reddy (Rs 1,250 crore). He had informed the SC that cumulatively, SBI had invoked personal guarantees of corporate guarantors in 16 cases for recovery of nearly Rs 20,000 crore. The court said NCLT will be able to consider the whole picture, as it were, about the nature of the assets available, either during the corporate debtor’s insolvency process, or even later. "This would facilitate the CoC in framing realistic plans, keeping in mind the prospect of realising some part of the creditors’ dues from personal guarantors," it said. Writing the 82-page judgment, Justice Bhat said, "Approval of a resolution plan does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of a corporate debtor) of her or his liabilities under the contract of guarantee. As held by this court, the release or discharge of a principal borrower from the debt owed by it to its creditor, by an involuntary process, i.e. by operation of law, or due to liquidation or insolvency proceeding, does not absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises out of an independent contract." The bench said, "Approval of a resolution plan relating to a corporate debtor does not operate so as to discharge the liabilities of personal guarantors (to corporate debtors)... It is, therefore, clear that the sanction of a resolution plan and finality imparted to it by Section 31 does not per se operate as a discharge of the guarantor’s liability. As to the nature and extent of the liability, much would depend on the terms of the guarantee itself. However, this court has indicated, time and again, that an involuntary act of the principal debtor leading to loss of security, would not absolve a guarantor of its liability." The petitioners had furnished personal guarantees to banks and financial institutions which led to release of advances to various companies which they (the petitioners) were associated with as directors, promoters or in some instances, as chairman or managing directors. In many cases, the personal guarantees furnished by the writ petitioners were invoked, and proceedings are pending against companies which they are or were associated with, and the advances for which they furnished bank guarantees. In several cases, recovery proceedings and later insolvency proceedings were initiated. The insolvency proceedings are at different stages and the resolution plans are at the stage of finalisation. In a few cases, the resolution plans have not yet been approved by the adjudicating authority and in some cases, approvals granted are subject to challenge before the appellate tribunal. The SC said the resolution proceedings and the committee of creditors under the IBC would now look into the assets of personal guarantors while formulating a resolution plan. "The rationale for allowing directors to participate in meetings of the CoC is that the directors’ liability as personal guarantors persists against the creditors and an approved resolution plan can only lead to a revision of amount or exposure for the entire amount," it said. Rejecting the plea of petitioners that the November 2019 notification was illegal, arbitrary and against personal liberty, the bench said, "Parliamentary intent was to treat personal guarantors differently from other categories of individuals. The intimate connection between such individuals and corporate entities to whom they stood guarantee, as well as the possibility of two separate processes being carried on in different forums, with its attendant uncertain outcomes, led to carving out personal guarantors as a separate species of individuals, for whom the adjudicating authority was common with the corporate debtor to whom they had stood guarantee." Explaining the ruling, the bench said, "Thus if A, an individual, is the subject of a resolution process before the DRT and he has furnished a personal guarantee for a debt owed by a company B, in the event a resolution process is initiated against B in an NCLT, the provision results in transferring the proceedings going on against A in the DRT to NCLT."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/guarantors-for-loans-liable-under-ibc-proceedings-sc/articleshow/82843512.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Goa government will appeal the verdict. Additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi pronounced the verdict on Friday after thrice deferring the judgment date in a case in which the Goa police had filed an FIR suo motu. Tejpal’s lawyer, Rajiv Gomes, died of Covid last week. Minutes after the judgment, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said the government would appeal in the high court. “The verdict is an injustice towards the victim, and this injustice will not be tolerated. We will challenge the verdict in the high court as soon as possible,” he said. “We will not let somebody go scot-free like this. I have personally gone through the evidence collected in the case and, looking at it, he cannot be acquitted. It is very sad and we will not tolerate such injustice against women,” Sawant said. Tejpal said the past few years had been a long nightmare for his family and that he was relieved that it was over. “It is with profound respect that I thank this court for its rigorous, impartial and fair trial, and for its thorough examination of the CCTV footage and other empirical material on record,” he said. “In November 2013, I was falsely accused of sexual assault, and today the trial court of the additional sessions judge, Goa, has acquitted me. In an awfully vitiated age where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth. I am grateful to have received justice, because justice is not always a given thing in this country,” he said. When asked if the state government had “fixed him” in the case, Tejpal said, “We will speak to the press, but give us some time. It was very tough for all of us.” Tejpal had been charged under IPC Sections 354 (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over woman committing rape of such woman) and 376(2)(k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman). Special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora said the verdict was a setback to the state. The case pertains to 2013, when on November 7 and 8 Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event in Goa. On November 22, Goa police lodged a suo motu FIR against him. He turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013 and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on May 19, 2014 to attend the cremation of his mother and he has been out of prison since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/7-years-on-court-acquits-tarun-tejpal-of-rape-charge/articleshow/82843681.cms||Murari Shetye

The move is expected to benefit about 1.5 crore workers. The hike, effective retrospectively from April 1, 2021, will range from Rs 105 per day to Rs 210 per day, depending on a worker’s occupation and geographical location, and will also have a resultant impact on minimum wages for workers. The VDA is similar to the dearness allowance for government employees. The government’s revised wages notification will be applicable to establishments such as the railway administration, mines, oil fields, major ports or all corporations established by the Central government. Contractual & casual workers also entitled to hike in VDAThe hike will also be applicable equally to all contractual and casual workers. The cumulative hike is expected to be in the range of Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 per month. While unskilled mine workers will draw Rs 431 per day, those working underground will be eligible to receive VDA at the rate of Rs 539 per day. In contrast, highly skilled mine workers working on ground will now draw Rs 752 a day and highly skilled mine workers working underground will be eligible to get Rs 840 per day as VDA. Revision of VDA has also been done for agriculture workers across skill categories, building and construction workers. ‘Sweeping and cleaning’ workers, ‘watch and ward’ workers and workers working for loading and unloading works are also eligible for the pay revisions. A statement from the labour ministry said it has notified and revised the rate of VDA with effect from April 1, 2021. Union labour and employment minister Santosh Gangwar said the hike in VDA will support these workers particularly in the backdrop of the economic pressures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The VDA, the government added, was revised on the basis of average Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW), and the ministry took the average CPI-IW for the months of July to December 2020 to revise the VDA. The enforcement of the Minimum Wages Act in the central sphere, the government said, is ensured through the offices of the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central).

---||Business||Bonanza from RBI to reduce government's fiscal pressure||NEW DELHI: At the Reserve Bank of India’s board meeting on Friday, some of the board members suggested that the central bank could consider transferring a larger surplus to the Centre, a suggestion that is usually lapped up by the government. Surprisingly, economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth, the newly appointed government nominee on the RBI board, expressed his satisfaction with the Rs 99,122 crore that the central bank proposed to transfer in line with the formula provided by an expert committee headed by former governor Bimal Jalan. After all, the central bank’s transfer itself is a bonanza for the Centre that had budgeted for Rs 53,511 crore dividend and surplus from public sector banks and financial institutions as well as RBI. The surplus transfer is more than twice the expected Rs 45,000 crore for the current fiscal year. By all accounts, it will provide a much-needed cushion for the Centre, which is expected to face a shortfall in tax collections during the full financial year, given that a bulk of the first quarter, if not the entire three months, is going to see below normal economic activity. During the current financial year, the government has budgeted for a near 17% rise in gross tax collections. On the other side, expenditure may turn out to be higher than budgeted, given that the Centre is more than willing to push spending and may have to allocate more funds in the coming months to combat Covid-19. Besides, the fate of the government’s privatisation drive is also unclear amid a raging pandemic. The extra funds could also be deployed by the Centre to provide support to the vulnerable segments. Given the bank results so far, the finance ministry is expected to ensure that the comfort in the dividend account in the financial sector only goes up. Already, SBI has announced a 40% dividend and the improved showing across the public sector is going to push them to increase their payout. “We think today’s dividend announcement will relieve some of the fiscal pressure on the government, providing it with more room to spend in the current fiscal year. This could be particularly helpful in alleviating the impact of the second Covid-19 wave,” Barclays economists Rahul Bajoria and Shreya Sodhani said in a note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bonanza-from-rbi-to-reduce-governments-fiscal-pressure/articleshow/82844493.cms||Sidhartha

His passing is an irreparable loss for the nation. A home-grown environmentalist who steered a spontaneous ‘Chipko Movement’ of the 1970s into a strong people’s movement and saved the forests of the great Himalayas and the forest-based livelihoods of its indigenous communities was a living image of unfettered dedication. When I met him for the first time at the Gandhi Peace Foundation in Delhi in 1975, it was an awe-inspiring moment. I was a student and greatly moved by his thoughts and ideals. “Harmony with nature is the only way of life,” he believed and instilled in many young minds an environmental consciousness at a time when the world was blinded by a mad race of unprincipled development. A true satyagrahi and an avid Gandhian, he was born on January 9, 1927 at village Maroda near Tehri, Uttarakhand. With his wife Vimla Behen he dedicated his life to the cause of society and environment. Since his early days as an activist, he believed in the power of women. He believed that women and nature are intrinsically connected and demonstrated that they can lead change. He pioneered many social movements with women crusaders, most noteworthy were the movement against alcoholism and the anti-Tehri dam movement to save Himalayas and Ganga. I distinctly remember the 10 days Bahuguna ji spent at the Tarun Bharat Sangh Ashram. He walked with us for hours to see the water and environmental conservation work in villages at Bheekampura in Alwar district of Rajasthan. Witnessing the conservation of Sariska forests, he was determined to replicate the model in the Himalayas. “The mighty Himalayas and the Ganga river are eternal symbols of sacredness and their natural and pure existence is integral to the development of the nation,” he truly believed. He motivated me to take up the cause of the Himalayas and Ganga. We spent hours discussing environmental, societal and cultural issues. With passion and vigour, we embarked on a journey with 120 volunteers from Galtaji, Jaipur, to the birthplace of Ganga at Gangotri to spread environmental consciousness and mobilise youth in the cause of environment. Since then, I have worked closely with Bahugunaji in struggles against deforestation, pollution and encroachment in the Himalayas and along Himalayan rivers. During the anti-Tehri dam struggles, I had the privilege to follow his lead, to see his passion and dedication towards environment closely and to witness his remarkable persona that inspired hundreds and commanded action. March 28, 2021, will be etched in my memory as the day I met Sunderlal Bahuguna for the last time. At age 94, a lot had changed in his physical appearance. However, his passion and pride in his work and love for environment was as strong as when I met him for the first time. While talking about forests, he excitedly broke into a folk song about trees.

UGC’s draft on ‘Blended Mode of Teaching and Learning’, which has been put in public domain for suggestions from various stakeholders till June 6, envisages a scenario where students can pick teachers and timings; frame their own courses; design degrees; and study through any mode with learning and examinations literally on demand. The concept note has been prepared in accordance with the new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP-2020) which gives acceptability to many modes of learning, including face-to-face, online learning and distance or virtual mode. “The UGC had decided that HEIs should be allowed to teach up to 40% of each course through online mode and the remaining 60% can be taught in offline mode. Exams for teaching under both modes can be conducted online,” said UGC Secretary Rajnish Jain. The draft said, “The advantages of blended learning for students include increased learning skills, greater access to information, improved satisfaction and learning outcomes, and opportunities both to learn with others and to teach others.” “Blended learning is not a mere mix of online and face-to-face mode, but it refers to a well-planned combination of meaningful activities in both the modes. The blend demands consideration of several factors, mainly focussing on learning outcomes and the learner-centred instructional environment,” said the draft prepared by an expert panel. Defining the role of teachers in blended learning, the draft said, “blended learning shifts the teacher’s role from knowledge provider to coach and mentor. This shift does not mean that teachers play a passive or less important role in students’ education. Quite the contrary—with blended learning, teachers can have an even more profound influence and effect on students’ learning.” “Traditionally, classroom instruction has largely been teacher-directed, top-down, and one-size-fits-all, with a bit of differentiation thrown in, but with blended learning, it now becomes more student-driven, bottom-up, and customized, with differentiation as a main feature,” it added. The expert panel has noted that in order to implement blended learning as a new mode of teaching-learning in higher education and hence the area of assessment and evaluation needs to be explored again in the light of blended learning mode. The proposal suggests Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) in universities and colleges. Summative evaluation strategies including open book examination, group examinations even for conventional theory papers, spoken examinations, on demand examinations have been recommended besides formative evaluation strategies like ePortfolio, creative products, classroom/online quizzes. The UGC panel has also pointed out that availability of infrastructure is fundamental to teaching and learning. “It must be ensured that required infrastructure for online systems such as accessibility of internet, bandwidth, hardware, space and other related resources be made easily available for the smooth execution of blended teaching-learning process. The financial aid required to develop the infrastructure and resources must also be taken care of,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/blended-learning-ugc-panel-suggests-up-to-40-teaching-via-online-mode/articleshow/82846304.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

The Navy is looking for 15 barge staffers still missing and has also initiated an underwater search to locate the wrecks of P305 and a tug, Varaprada, whose 11 members also remain untraced. Six Navy warships have, since Monday, rescued 186 personnel of the total 261 who were on board P-305 when it sank, and two personnel from the tug Varaprada. Bodies brought on shore have been sent to JJ Hospital to complete formalities before they are handed over to families. Navy’s chief PRO, Commander Mehul Karnik, said 60 bodies of “Brave Nature Victims” had been recovered while search for the remaining 15 continued. “Search and rescue operation continues for the remaining crew.” Three construction barges of Afcons, working on an ONGC project in the western offshore fields in the Arabian sea and one floater drilling rig of ONGC were severely impacted by Monday’s cyclone. All the anchors of P-305 gave way, and when it drifted, it hit an unmanned ONGC platform and eventually capsized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/barge-toll-hits-60-as-11-more-bodies-found-search-on-for-15-men/articleshow/82846884.cms||V Narayan
---||India||Mamata Banerjee likely to contest bypoll from her old constituency||KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to contest an assembly byelection from her home turf, Bhowanipore, after sitting MLA and state agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay quit as MLA on Friday, vacating the seat. Banerjee, a two-time winner from this assembly segment (she had won this seat in 2011 and 2016), had fought the 2021 polls from Nandigram but lost narrowly to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari. Weeks after Adhikari quit Trinamool and joined the BJP, she had announced her decision to fight from Nandigram, referring to Bhowanipore as her “boro bon (elder sister)” and calling Nandigram her “mejo bon (middle sister)”. Banerjee has to get herself elected in six months because, according to Article 164 of the Constitution, a minister who cannot be elected as MLA in six months of being made a minister ceases to one. Chattopadhyay defeated BJP’s Rudranil Ghosh in Bhowanipore by 29,000 votes. He quit exactly 10 days after he took the oath as a cabinet minister on May 11. “I, and many of my colleagues, felt that Mamata Banerjee should continue as CM. In that case, she has to get elected within six months,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-banerjee-likely-to-contest-bypoll-from-her-old-constituency/articleshow/82847211.cms||Debashis Konar

State government had already floated its own portal CGTEEKA for registering 18-44-year-old for vaccination through which vaccination certificates are being issued instead of CoWin, a portal launched by the Centre for vaccination. 1 Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo said, “I don’t think there should be any issue on that. When Government of India was providing the money and vaccine they had the Prime Minister’s photograph. If the state government is doing something, then we will use the chief minister’s photograph instead. When the Centre has left it on the states to bear the financial burden and the state governments are procuring their own vaccines, why should they not issue their own vaccination certificates? Why should the vaccination certificates carry the photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?” Opposing the Congress government’s approach of using picture of chief minister Baghel over Prime Minster Modi’s picture, Chhattisgarh ‘s BJP leader of opposition Dharamlal Kaushik said, “It is a standard practice of Chhattisgarh government to take undue credit over Centre’s schemes. Though it is Centre’s decision that states must procure vaccine, but when the vaccination drive for 18 plus age group is Centre’s decision, then states should consider to use Prime Minister’s picture.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/chhattisgarh-replaces-pm-modi-picture-in-vaccine-certificates-with-cms/articleshow/82847504.cms||Cherrupreet Kaur

Ghadge wants to intervene to oppose all of Singh’s pleas as he said they are “misconceived” and are “also likely to cause a serious miscarriage of justice”. Ghadge, through his advocate Vipin Nair, said he wants to place “crucial facts” on record, “which would persuade” the SC to dismiss Singh’s petition.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh spends Rs 2,246 crore so far on Covid relief||VISAKHAPATNAM: As per the budgetary proposals for this fiscal tabled in the legislative assembly on Thursday, Andhra Pradesh has so far spent about Rs 2,246 crore on multiple interventions for prevention, mitigation and management of the Covid-19 pandemic. This expenditure was incurred on establishment of laboratories, testing, procurement of medicines, PPEs, ventilators, oxygen supply, vaccines, etc. The values of the drugs and other medical consumables alone stood at about Rs 1,200 crore. As of April, more than one lakh patients had availed free treatment under the Aarogyasri scheme, which cost the state exchequer around Rs 310 crore. Andhra Pradesh is the first state to include Covid-19 treatment in the list of illnesses covered under its healthcare scheme. The state government has recently allocated Rs 309 crore to set up pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants in 49 hospitals and to procure 50 cryogenic tankers for oxygen transportation/storage. According to state health officials, Andhra Pradesh has come a long way in terms of Covid-19 containment and management since it detected the first lab confirmed case in March last year. Several cross-disciplinary committees have been constituted in the last year to draft action plans for Covid-19 treatment protocols, tracing and testing mechanism, hospital management, discharge plans, procurement of medical consumables, vaccine administration, oxygen supply, etc. Starting with zero testing facilities in February, the state government ramped up its health infrastructure and has established 135 Covid-19 testing laboratories as of date, including private ones. The first lab was established only on March 7. Until then, the state had to send the Covid-19 samples to other states. The state has taken advantage of its village/ward volunteer system for community surveillance to identify vulnerable groups and foreign returnees in the first wave, before it launched state-wide fever surveys a few days ago in the second wave. Nearly 95,000 suspected Covid-19 cases were detected during in the first round of the fever survey concluded two days ago. Andhra Pradesh has lined up more than 640 hospitals in the second wave, against the 260 hospitals that served Covid-19 patients during the first wave. After recruiting 17,300 doctors and other supporting staff during the first wave for Covid-19 management, the state has so far hired about 18,000 medical personnel during the ongoing second wave. The state has recently floated a global tender for procuring Covid-19 vaccines from foreign players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/640-hospitals-lined-up-18k-medical-personnel-hired-during-second-wave/articleshow/82841633.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The bank also reported its highest ever full-year net profit of Rs 20,410 crore, which is 40% over the previous year. The bank has proposed a dividend of Rs 4 per share, which works out into a payout of Rs 3,569 crore. The government, which has a 57.6% stake in the bank, will receive over half of the sum. Following the results, shares of the bank ended 4.3% higher at Rs 401 by close of Friday’s trade on the BSE. The bank ended the fiscal year with deposits of Rs 36.8 lakh crore — a 13.5% increase over Rs 32.4 lakh crore as of March 2020. Advances during the same period rose 5% to Rs 24.5 lakh crore from Rs 23.3 lakh crore earlier. The net profit also got a boost with a 17% drop in provisions for bad loans, which dipped to Rs 9,914 crore during the quarter from Rs 11,894 crore in the previous year. Announcing the results, the bank’s chairman Dinesh Khara said, “We hope to grow by 10% this year if, hopefully, the second wave of Covid is behind us.” He said that the bank has contained its slippages at Rs 28,564 crore (1.18%) as compared to Rs 49,647 crore (2.16%) in the corresponding period of previous year. The slippage in the retail portfolio at Rs 3,287 crore (0.4%) is even lower, alleviating fears that the Covid pandemic had increased defaults last year. Khara said that the second wave of the pandemic was different from the first one and it was difficult to predict customer behaviour. “It is a very fragile situation and too early to predict,” said Khara. He, however, added that the bank does not see any pressure on asset quality and collections continued to be high at 96%. SBI’s gross non-performing assets stood at 4.98% at the end of the quarter, down from 5.44% in the preceding quarter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-q4-profit-up-80-sees-record-rs-20k-cr-full-year-net/articleshow/82841635.cms||---

Stating that a section of people are abusing Twitter and the social media platform too was allowing its space to be abused by such anti-social elements, Khaja Aijazuddin, an advocate from Hyderabad, filed the petition urging the court to direct the Centre to get the matter probed by either the CBI or the NIA. A vacation bench of SC may soon take up the matter for hearing. Describing the posts as ‘inflammatory’ aimed at creating hatred against Muslims, the petitioner said that this was done with an intent to attribute the emergence and spread of coronavirus to Muslims. He urged the apex court to direct the Union ministry of electronics and information technology to frame guidelines as envisaged under the provisions of IT Act, 2000, pertaining to hate messages against any religious community, including Islamophobic posts. Aggrieved by the inflammatory trending on Twitter under the name and styled ‘Islamic coronavirusjihad’, #Nizamuddinidiots, #Coronajihad, #TabIighijamat, #TablighiJamatVirus and, in many ways, attaching religion to the pandemic, Khaja Aijazuddin had filed a petition in the Supreme Court in April 2020 and the apex court had directed the petitioner to first approach the Telangana high court. The HC recently closed the petition upon being informed that the offending messages had been deleted by Twitter. The court, however, left it open to the petitioner to approach the apex court if he wants to seek larger reliefs that run beyond the scope of the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lawyer-files-slp-in-sc-over-islamophobic-posts/articleshow/82842894.cms||---

It is expected that there will be a 30% drop in productivity in the sector. According to IT companies associations, employees are now facing stress and psychological problems due to deaths in their families. The IT sector in the state had registered around Rs Rs 1,600–1,800 crore business in the 2020-21 fiscal even though the first wave had hit the sector. Most of the employees of the around 200 IT companies in the state have been working from home since last March. “Majority of employees of the IT sector are still working from home. They worked extra hours and productivity was not hampered because there were not too many deaths last year. But this year, every employee has either witnessed one or two positive cases in his family, relatives or friends and also deaths, which has shattered their confidence,” O Naresh Kumar, CEO of Symbiosis Technologies, said. According to IT sector sources, the first wave had hit the sector by 15% but this time around it is likely to be more than 30%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/second-wave-to-reduce-it-productivity-by-30/articleshow/82841740.cms||Siva G
---||Chandigarh||PAU’s ‘ludo’ for paddy, cotton growers||Ludhiana: The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, has developed a ‘ludo’ game for direct seeded rice (DSR) technology for sowing paddy and acquiring higher yield from cotton cultivation. PAU director of extension education Jaskarn Singh Mahal said the varsity scientists were making all-out efforts to update the knowledge of the farmers. “Ludo, which comprises snakes and ladders, is a unique concept in relation to agricultural practices,” he said, adding that it includes PAU’s recommendations regarding DSR technology. Mahal advised that if DSR technology was practiced on medium to heavy textured soils in the first fortnight of June by adopting short duration varieties, using 8-10kg seed per acre and giving first irrigation after 21 days of sowing, then the technology would yield better results and farmers will be on the winning side in the game. “If farmers adopt the technology on light textured soils (sandy and loamy sand), use long duration varieties and more seed, and apply spray on dry fields to manage weeds, then they will be penalised. If the members of the family play ‘ludo’, it will lead to curiosity, for which there is a booklet also,” he said. PAU additional director of communication T S Riar, while presenting the first set of the ‘ludo’ game to Mahal, said it would motivate youngsters, children to practice farming as per the varsity recommendations. He said, “This will also contribute in conserving natural resources and protecting the environment.‘Ludo’ has been developed by Anil Sharma, assistant director of the communication centre and his team. It can be purchased from different parts of Punjab. The second ‘ludo’ provides information on dos and don’ts to be followed for successful cultivation of cotton.” Sharma said, “In layman’s language, it is an effort to educate farmers about ‘tar wattar’ DSR technology.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paus-ludo-for-paddy-cotton-growers/articleshow/82842902.cms||---

Officer on special duty in health department, Kumar Ravi, said as this injection was very effective against the black fungus, the state government has sought it from the government of India. He said, 5,000 vials were needed urgently. Meanwhile, the number of mucormycosis patients reaching the Patna hospitals has risen to 101. Three such patients have lost their lives. Director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) Dr P K Singh said the total number of admitted patients at the hospital has increased to 45. He said the Ambisome injection provided by the state government was being used under the mainline of treatment. AIIMS nodal officer Dr Sanjeev Kumar said while three people were discharged, two died of this deadly fungal infection. “It is remarkable that while the majority of the serious Covid patients came from urban areas like Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya, those reaching the OPD or being referred from other hospitals with black fungus symptoms hailed from sub-urban and rural areas,” said Sanjeev. Another important hospital, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), had recorded 39 cases of mucormycosis by Friday evening. Its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said, “While 28 patients were Covid negative with fungal infection, 10 had both Covid and mucormycosis. One suspected case was admitted on Friday.” Dr Mandal said timely availability of the liposomal Amphotericin B injection (Ambisome) from the health department would be of great help as this injection is very effective in treatment of the black fungus. Depending upon the severity of the infection, varying doses of the injection are being given to patients, he said. There were 11 black fungus patients at Paras HMRI Hospital. One of them was discharged after medication. No casualty due to the fungal infection has been reported at this hospital. However, of the seven patients of mucormycosis admitted at Ruban Hospital, one has died, hospital’s managing director Dr Satyajeet Singh said. Though the number was low, the hospital has earmarked separate beds for black fungus cases. “There is every possibility of rise in number of mucormycosis patients from far off places of the state as many had been on prolonged use of steroids and oxygen in unhygienic condition,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/black-fungus-bihar-seeks-50k-ambisome-vials-from-centre/articleshow/82842402.cms||VK Tripathi

The counter-affidavit was submitted by its dean Soumya Chakraborty. The high court was informed that auxiliary nurse and midwives (ANMs) and general nursing and midwives (GNMs) provided by the state government were also not capable of handling Covid-19 cases and don’t have the knowledge and skill of administering medicines and fluids. The court has been also informed that the ESIC is in urgent need of paramedics and ward boys and that even the security staff provided by the state refuse to go to the Covid care ward. The high court was appraised that there is 500-bed strength at ESIC, including or ICU facilities, and of them, 226 beds are commissioned for Covid care. Of these 226, 50 beds are being managed by ESIC, 76 by Army Medical Corps (AMC) and 100 by the state government, which are isolation beds. The court was also made aware that PPE kits sent by the government were incomplete and ESIC is in dire need of one basic life support, one advance life support ambulance and one mortuary van. In the affidavit, it was urged that ESIC needs equipment for setting up an RT-CPR testing lab, a CT-scan machine and an oxygen generation plant of 2000 litres per minute for which numerous letters have been written to the government. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a batch of three PILs on the grim pandemic situation during which all these issues were brought to light via the ESIC’s counter affidavit. The high court bench then directed the liaison officer of the state government for ESIC to file a reply on the matter. Meanwhile, the court was also apprised of the situation via the affidavit that there is no support for dead body management from the state government at the hospital and that there is an urgent need for sanitization staff, sweepers and body wrappers. The dean has also apprised in the affidavit that there is a need for an anaesthesiologist, ICU experts and lab technicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/esic-to-patna-hc-covid-support-staff-provided-by-govt-untrained/articleshow/82842354.cms||Debashish Karmakar

They have threatened to go on strike from May 24 if their demands are not fulfilled. These doctors under the banner of Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of AIIMS-Patna wrote to the hospital director on Friday, urging him to allow them to undergo eight-day quarantine after eight days of Covid duty. They have also demanded 20 beds in the hospital, including at least two in the ICU, to be reserved for them and their family members. “We have been putting up our heart and soul relentlessly and working tirelessly from past one year risking our lives. Despite repeated reminders to the authorities concerned to approve eight-day quarantine for us, nothing has been done yet,” the letter read. AIIMS-Patna RDA president Dr Vinay Kumar said they have been raising these demands for nearly a month, but to no avail. On the other hand, interns at IGIMS have demanded that health insurance and Covid allowance should be given to them. Several interns also sat on a dharna in support of their demands. “Apart from basic stipend, we should be given Covid allowance,” Dr Navneet told medispersons. However, later in the evening, he sent a written statement to the press stating there was no strike at IGIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-patna-doctors-threaten-to-go-on-strike/articleshow/82841206.cms||Sheezan Nezami

They said ‘We are part of the solution’, the theme set by the United Nations (UN) for this year’s International Day for Biological Diversity to be observed on Saturday, is most relevant for overcoming the prevailing crisis. “The highest number of living species has become extinct in the last 100 years in the name of development. The damage done by humans to biodiversity hits back with severe crisis, like the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, 70% of the infectious diseases in the recent decades have been zoonotic diseases, in which the virus is transmitted from animals to human being. This shows that there has been too much intervention in the wildlife by human beings,” principal secretary (environment, forest and climate change) Dipak Kumar Singh said. The UN has also stated that biodiversity loss could expand zoonoses – diseases transmitted from animals to humans. “If biodiversity is kept intact, it offers excellent tools to fight against pandemics,” it said. Environmentalist and chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board Ashok Ghosh also attributed the causes behind frequent infectious disease like Covid-19, anthrax, bird flu, Ebola and H1N1 to disruption of biodiversity. “Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus has shown bat origin of the deadly virus and similar viral diseases having animal origin have affected humans in the past and their frequency is only increasing. This happened as people interfered more with wildlife as human population grew and tampered with their natural habitat,” he said. Padma Shri recipient environmentalist and vice-chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, R K Sinha told TOI biological diversity is life-support system of all species and it its getting severely affected by the ‘greed’ of human beings for being at the top of food chain. Sinha said change in the education system can be one of the methods for finding solution for conservation of biodiversity. On its part, the state government has launched a campaign to encourage installation of oxygen-giving indoor plants. Department of environment, forest and climate change has launched the campaign, #NatureCuresYou, to encourage people keep at home plants of medicinal values.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/loss-of-biological-diversity-led-to-rise-in-infectious-diseases/articleshow/82839079.cms||Piyush Tripathi

From information on setting up portals for online admissions to asking universities about implementing uniform union election guidelines, the VCs will have to update the government on several such decisions which have been taken earlier. Among the details sought are holding of online classes and dates for publishing results. “We will submit the dates on which examinations were held, the format and the time for publishing results. But we will also have to inform the higher education department about the upcoming semester examination and tentative dates for the results,” said a VC. Sources indicated the government is worried about possible delay in examinations and inability to conduct laboratory classes for the final semester students. “A number of universities report vacancies, even in sought-after courses. The government wants to know the demand of each department and understand if the seats have been rationalized,” a source said. The implementation of a uniform statute for all universities, the issue of fee reduction and exemptions for students during the pandemic and the status of guest and contractual teachers were also discussed at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bratya-discusses-admissions-tests-results-with-vcs/articleshow/82841400.cms||Somdatta Basu

The Institute has tied up with Kolkata Municipal Corporation and acquired enough Covishield doses to cover a lot of hawkers and drivers who walk in for the first jab. The drive started on Monday and over 200 people have already received the first dose. Autos equipped with loudspeakers are asking hawkers and drivers to walk in with documents, like Aadhaar card, voter ID card or PAN card. In case of drivers, their commercial licences are mandatory. “We got in touch with Karaya police station for a list of local hawkers so we could reach out to them individually,” said Amiruddin Bobby, a former mayor-in-council member, who is part of the Islamia Hospital administration. “We have enough doses and are not limiting numbers. We will see how many come in over the next 10 days and then take a call,” he said. “I heard the announcement and walked in,” said taxi driver Tarak Giri. Hawker Gautam Das said, “We hope to get the second dose just as easily. We have been promised that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drivers-hawkers-walk-into-islamia-for-jab/articleshow/82841336.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The counter-affidavit was submitted by its dean Soumya Chakraborty. The high court was informed that auxiliary nurse and midwives (ANMs) and general nursing and midwives (GNMs) provided by the state government were also not capable of handling Covid-19 cases and don’t have the knowledge and skill of administering medicines and fluids. The court has been also informed that the ESIC is in urgent need of paramedics and ward boys and that even the security staff provided by the state refuse to go to the Covid care ward. The high court was appraised that there is 500-bed strength at ESIC, including or ICU facilities, and of them, 226 beds are commissioned for Covid care. Of these 226, 50 beds are being managed by ESIC, 76 by Army Medical Corps (AMC) and 100 by the state government, which are isolation beds. The court was also made aware that PPE kits sent by the government were incomplete and ESIC is in dire need of one basic life support, one advance life support ambulance and one mortuary van. In the affidavit, it was urged that ESIC needs equipment for setting up an RT-CPR testing lab, a CT-scan machine and an oxygen generation plant of 2000 litres per minute for which numerous letters have been written to the government. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a batch of three PILs on the grim pandemic situation during which all these issues were brought to light via the ESIC’s counter affidavit. The high court bench then directed the liaison officer of the state government for ESIC to file a reply on the matter. Meanwhile, the court was also apprised of the situation via the affidavit that there is no support for dead body management from the state government at the hospital and that there is an urgent need for sanitization staff, sweepers and body wrappers. The dean has also apprised in the affidavit that there is a need for an anaesthesiologist, ICU experts and lab technicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/esic-to-patna-hc-covid-support-staff-provided-by-govt-untrained/articleshow/82842353.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Patna||‘Covid is airborne, follow protocols to keep it at bay’||PATNA: Justifying the new advisory issued by the Centre in the light of the finding that aerosols from Covid-infected people can travel up to a distance of 10 metres, experts have stressed the need for wearing of masks, social distancing, sanitisation and ventilation in order to win the fight against the pandemic. Aerosol (short form of aero-solution) can travel to a much greater distance as compared to droplets because of its lighter weight and infect a person at greater distances. But, if the place is well ventilated and people are well covered with masks, there is little chance of getting infected with the virus, the experts said. Joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) Dr A K Ashu said as the virus is floating in the air (as aerosol), it can easily be inhaled by any person if he or she is roaming without wearing a good quality protective mask. “The new mutant of the virus is so notorious and deceptive that one does not know when it would enter the human body and weaken the immune system,” he said. Dr Ashu added aerosols containing viruses can lead to community spread of the disease if the people do not adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People should avoid closed and congested places and must not venture out of their houses without any urgent work. Special care of children should be taken by the guardians who have not been vaccinated so far,” he said. Patna University (PU) zoology department’s head Arbind Kumar, who has worked for 10 years on epidemiology at the cell and molecular biology lab at AIIMS-New Delhi, said he had already been advocating for increasing the distance of two metres prescribed for social distancing in view of the fact that the virus is airborne. Appreciating the revised guidelines, he said now people must wear double masks and sanitise their hands regularly to protect themselves from the virus. He said people living in multi-storey apartments should also stay vigilant against the invasion of viruses through the aerosol. “If any person living in an apartment is infected with Covid-19, all other persons living in flats located in the same vertical row as that of the infected person are susceptible to infection as the virus enters through the gas emanating from sewage pipes. Hence, all the rooms of the flat must be kept well ventilated all the time and air-conditioners should be used only casually,” Kumar added. PU biotechnology teacher Birendra Prasad said aerosols travel faster than the droplets and infect the people with greater speed. He pointed out that aerosols become loaded with innumerable viruses in high concentration zones like hospitals or other health centres and testing labs. “People must take extra precautions while passing through health centres as the air of their surroundings is invariably loaded with the virus, increasing the chances of getting infected many times. Wearing double-layer masks and washing hands with soap at regular intervals are the only effective tools in the fight against the pandemic,” Prasad added. Immediate past president of IMA, Bihar, Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, said people must be encouraged to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly if the rate of transmission is to be halted. “Stopping the transmission of the virus from one person to another will decrease the infection rate of the disease to a level where it can eventually die. This can be achieved only with the support and cooperation of individuals, communities, local bodies and authorities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-is-airborne-follow-protocols-to-keep-it-at-bay/articleshow/82839118.cms||B K Mishra
---||Business||Sebi doubles AIF, VCFs’ overseas investment cap||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Friday allowed alternative investment funds (AIFs) and venture capital funds (VCFs) to collectively infuse up to $1.5 billion in overseas markets, up from $750 million. The decision was taken in consultation with the RBI, a circular from the markets regulator said. Under Sebi rules, AIFs and VCFs need to mandatorily disclose the utilisation of overseas investment limits within five working days of such usage on the market regulator’s intermediary portal. Also, if an AIF or a VCF do not utilise its overseas limit within six months since Sebi’s approval, that should be reported within two working days after expiry of the validity period. In the backdrop of a sharp rise in investments by AIFs outside of India, the Indian Venture Capital Association (IVCA) wrote to Sebi to enhance the limit of $750 million, which was last hiked in 2018. The assets managed by AIFs in India recorded a CAGR of nearly 500% from December 2012 to December 2020, with the cumulative size at Rs 4.4 lakh crore by end-2020. “In a highly globalised world, asset diversification in terms of geographies adds a significant alpha to a fund manager’s performance. In view of this, Sebi allows Indian AIFs to invest up to 25% of their investable corpus overseas,” Siddarth Pai, co-chair of Regulatory Affairs Committee, IVCA, said. According to Sahil Shah of J Sagar Associates, a leading corporate legal advisory firm, this enhanced limit “is a positive move in these uncertain times which will open newer windows of opportunities for various VCFs / AIFs in India for them to invest outside India and also allow the Indian investors to be a part of the global growth trajectory”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-doubles-aif-vcfs-overseas-investment-cap/articleshow/82841445.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Man hacks son, daughter to death in sleep, surrenders||PATNA: A 30-year-old man hacked his minor son and daughter to death in their sleep at Kanhaipur village under the Mokama police station area in rural Patna on Friday. The accused Kamaldev Prasad, a daily wager, walked into Mokama police station and surrendered soon after hacking his children Ankit Kumar (6) and Alisha (3) with an axe. Prasad committed the ghastly act a day after his wife Veena Devi lodged an FIR against him for domestic violence and dowry. Police said the man suspected that his wife was having illicit relationships with several men and had attacked her on May 16, but she managed to escape to her parental home in Jamui, leaving her children behind. Mokama police station SHO Raj Nandan said Prasad came to the police station on a bicycle around 5 am and surrendered. “He directly approached the officer on duty informing that he had come to surrender. The officer asked him about the case thinking he was evading arrest. It was then that Prasad said he had killed his two children whose bodies were inside his residence,” the SHO said. Nandan said a police team reached Prasad’s home, which was locked. The accused, who was taken to the spot, then took out the key and handed it over. “The bodies of Ankit and Alisha were found lying side by side in a pool of blood on the bed in which they were sleeping. Their throats were cut deep using a sharp-edged weapon. It was recovered later on Prasad’s confession,” he said. The SHO said Prasad told the police that he was sleeping with his children by his side but woke up suddenly around 2 am and hacked them to death. He alleged that his wife Veena was having illegal relationships and had taught her kids not to address him as their father. “I didn’t have any reputation left in the village after all this. Thus, I finally killed them both,” Nandan said, quoting Prasad’s confession. He added that probably the accused suspected that the children were not his. Nandan said after killing both his kids, Prasad locked his home and left. “Incidentally, he was stopped by a patrolling party on the highway around 4 am but he avoided suspicion. Prasad had said in a calm voice that he was a daily wager and was returning home after getting stuck in rain,” Nandan said. The SHO said Veena reached Mokama with her family members and lodged an FIR against Prasad for killing their children. “She told the police that Prasad started suspecting her three years ago after which he frequently thrashed her. However, she never reported the matter to the police to save her marital life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-hacks-son-daughter-to-death-in-sleep-surrenders/articleshow/82839942.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar's makhana, mango and litchi out of country's export list||BHAGALPUR: The Bihar Agricultural University (BAU) has expressed disappointment over non-inclusion of makhana, mango and litchi as the agriculture commodities of Bihar in the recently-approved Agriculture Export Policy (AEP) of the country. “Active participation of state governments is the key in the implementation of AEP. The recently-approved policy has disregarded the claims of the state’s major horticultural products,” said a BAU scientist. BAU vice-chancellor Dr Ravindra Kumar Sohane said the farming community and horticulturists of the region have written to the state government and drawn its attention towards the glaring omission of makhana, mango and litchi from AEP. “The government of India has approved AEP with an objective to promote export in order to increase the income of farmers as part of PM Narendra Modi’s vision to double the income of farmers by the end of 2022. Twenty-nine clusters covering 11 states for 12 Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)-scheduled products have been notified for export promotion in the recently-approved AEP. However, it is really disappointing that the AEP has not included any of the farm product from Bihar,” Sohane added. He said apart from makhana, mango and litchi, some other agricultural commodities of Bihar have vast export potential. “The state government should take up the matter with the Union ministry of commerce and industries,” he added. “Of total production at country level, nearly 90% of makhana is produced and cultivated by the farmers in Purnia, Katihar, Kishanganj, Araria, Saharsa, Supaul, Madhubani and Sitamarhi districts in Bihar with an approximate yield of 24,000 tonnes,” said Dr Anil Kumar, principal investigator of Makhana Research Project. More than 1,250 metric tonnes (MT) of mango, including unique variety of Jardalu in Bhagalpur region, and 70% of the total yields of 6,00,000MT litchis in the country are from Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and other districts in Bihar, said BAU scientists in reference to a data. APEDA under the Union ministry of commerce and industries is the nodal agency for export promotion in the country. “The farm products’ clusters of other states which have been included in the AEP are banana, pomegranate, mango, grapes, rose onion, onion, potato, isabgol, okra, green chilly, dairy and poultry products, including egg. However, no product from Bihar has been included in the AEP,” said Alok Agarwal, president of the Eastern Bihar Industries Association (EBIA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/concern-as-states-makhana-mango-and-litchi-out-of-countrys-export-list/articleshow/82839751.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Business||Bankruptcy will not void personal guarantees: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Banks can look forward to improved recovery prospects from promoters of defaulting companies who have provided personal guarantees for corporate loans. The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the government notification of November 2019, which allowed banks to enforce the personal guarantee of the promoter if lenders are not able to fully recover their dues after the insolvency resolution process. Among the defaulting corporate houses that are referred for insolvency proceedings, there are a host of promoters ranging from Sanjay Singhal of Bhushan Power & Steel to Anil Ambani, Venugopal Dhoot, Atul Punj and the Ruias of Essar, who have provided a personal guarantee to their loans. For these promoters. who have already lost control over their companies due to the initiation of corporate insolvency resolution, the notification was the last thing they expected. This prompted several of them — including Singhal, Ambani and Punj — to challenge the legality of the circular. But like most issues related to the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the Supreme Court held that even this notification was legally valid. “What it does is that it allows the creditors to recover based on these guarantees in case the corporate insolvency process does not generate enough funds to cover the claims filed by them,” explained an officer at the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India. So, if a lender has a claim of, say, Rs 100 crore, and can recover only Rs 70 crore through the insolvency process, they can initiate action either in the National Company Law Tribunal, if the case is still going on, or move the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover the rest by invoking the personal guarantees of the promoter. “This judgment will pave the way for banks to initiate proceedings against the corporate debtor and personal guarantors of corporate debtors under IBC and to recover the amount from personal guarantees despite the debt of the corporate debtor being resolved in accordance with resolution plans. Thus, even if the loan to the corporate debtor is restructured or settled or written off, the liability against the personal guarantor will continue,” said L Viswanathan, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. While SBI told the Supreme Court that it had invoked guarantees in 16 cases to recover close to Rs 20,000 crore, the bank’s chairman Dinesh Khara was guarded in his response, saying the lender would examine the nuances of the order before taking a course of action. “This will help settle the jurisprudence finally on simultaneous initiation and proceeding with insolvency resolution process against principal borrower and guarantors or co-guarantors/co-obligors as well,” said Misha, partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas. While guarantees were doled out with ease earlier, the decision of lenders to invoke Vijay Mallya’s to recover dues from Kingfisher Airlines along with the new bankruptcy law had forced companies to be selective. “Today, companies are often reluctant to give even sponsor undertaking although we are seeking corporate guarantees because it shows the entity’s commitment,” said a banker, adding that often lenders dilute the condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bankruptcy-will-not-void-personal-guarantees-sc/articleshow/82841798.cms||---

Panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary said 3 crore masks have already been distributed among people and 45,000 villages are being sanitised in the state. He said the panchayati raj bodies and field officials of the panchayati raj department have launched a four-pronged campaign to contain the spread of the pandemic. “The district and sub-divisional hospitals as well as the block-level primary health centres (PHCs) have been strengthened by the zila parishads and panchayat samitis,” Chaudhary told this newspaper. “It was anticipated that the pandemic, in its second wave, might hit the villages. Accordingly, we alerted the district and block-level panchayati raj officials on time and continued issuing directives and guidelines to them periodically,” Chaudhary said. The Centre has provided Rs 741 crore for the same on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, he said, adding the funds are being utilised to purchase masks from the Jeevika didis and support other necessary steps. District and sub-divisional hospitals as well as the PHCs are also being strengthened with the same fund. “These hospitals are being provided additional beds, oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators,” Chaudhary said, adding the target is to provide masks to 14 crore people. He said the ward management committees in every panchayat have been asked to identify the outsiders who reach any village as well as persons showing Covid symptoms so that their testing could be done. While the elderly people, pregnant women, children and those with serious ailments are being given extra attention, the panchayat secretaries have been asked to ensure sanitisation of religious places, community buildings, panchayat sarkar bhavans, village haats and bazaars and all other public places. “Block-level panchayati raj officers have been asked to submit daily reports to the district panchayati raj officers, who, in turn, will send detailed integrated reports to the state headquarters,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/min-panchayati-raj-institutions-activated-to-curb-covid-spread/articleshow/82839045.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Business||RBI pays Rs 99k cr dividend to govt for just 9 months||TNN Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved a Rs 99,122-crore dividend payout to the government for an accounting period of nine months ended March 31, 2021 (July 2020-March 2021). The amount is more than 73% higher than the entire previous year’s Rs 57,128-crore dividend, despite the period being only nine months due to a change in accounting year to April-March. This is also the highest dividend after the Rs 1.23 lakh crore paid out for FY19 (along with a separate Rs 52,637-crore surplus reserve transferred to the government in that fiscal). The dividend is also higher than what the government had expected for FY21in its Budget, which was announced in February this year. The central government had pencilled in Rs 53,510 crore as dividend from the RBI and other public sector banks for FY21 as against a dividend income of Rs 61,826 crore in FY20. The windfall will help the government with the revenue shortfall arising out of lower tax collections due to the lockdown induced by the resurgence of the pandemic in April-May 2021. The RBI said that its central board approved the payout in its 589th meeting held on Friday through videoconference. It added that the dividend was paid out after ensuring that its contingency risk buffers were at 5.5% of its balance sheet. “The higher transfer is clearly due to two factors: Higher interest income on holding of securities due to various OMOs (holding of government bills increased by Rs 3 lakh crore approximately) as well as sharp increase in forex reserves of around $95 billion (about Rs 6.5 lakh crore), which would have earned 2-2.25% interest. This would have also absorbed the cost of reverse repo operations, which were high at above Rs 4 lakh crore through the year,” said CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis. Unlike commercial banks, the RBI generates a higher surplus during adverse financial conditions as it has to repeatedly intervene in the money and foreign exchange market. For instance, when the RBI intervenes to defend the rupee, it makes huge profits as it sells at a premium the dollars that it purchased earlier. Similarly, in the money market, the RBI generates a surplus by lending to banks under term repos. The flip side of a higher dividend payout by the RBI is that it leads to creation of money and could limit the headroom for the central bank to infuse further liquidity should inflation rise in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-pays-rs-99k-cr-dividend-to-govt-for-just-9-months/articleshow/82841943.cms||---

The process of enlistment of names has started in Maniktala market, Posta and several community markets in south Kolkata. Many market committees have even offered to provide space on their premises and bear a part of the cost if their workforce is inoculated. “Maniktala in the north and some markets in the south have received a communication from the government asking for an estimate of people engaged there for vaccination. This will not only help those who get vaccinated but also those who come in contact with them daily. We will request the government to scale up this drive and finish inoculation in other markets too,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, general secretary of Federation of Traders’, West Bengal. “In a meeting with the chief minister on May 10, we offered to provide our own space and even bear a portion of the cost if our traders, employees and labourers were vaccinated. We have drawn up a list,” said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of the traders’ association in Posta. “We want everybody to be vaccinated so that we can start our business at the earliest,” said Ashutosh Singh, president of the traders’ association in Bagree Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/markets-draw-up-lists-of-traders-labourers-for-vax/articleshow/82841273.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Except for antifungal drugs, the demand for Remedesivir and other essential Covid drugs has dropped significantly compared to April. “We have surplus Remedesivir, but meeting demand for black fungus drugs is still a challenge,” said Biswajeet Dasgupta, Patna circle head of Food & Drug Controller Authority (FDCA). He added, “Any shortage happens due to unexpected demands. Earlier with Remedesivir, we did not know the exact quantity of drugs which was required. Patients can get Amphotericin-B injection used for treatment of black fungus only through sending a mail request to the state drug controller via the hospital’s mail ID.” Rajesh Arya, secretary, Chemist and Druggist Association, Patna region, said, “We will soon receive the consignment of the DRDO-developed anti-Covid drug ‘2-DC’. The shortage is only for drugs of specific manufacturers, while state-sponsored generic medicines and alternatives from other companies are available. All requests of Remdesivir and antifungal drugs have so far been met successfully.” Vinit Mishra, a third-year student of College of Commerce, who is active in resourcing Covid essentials for common people, said, “We haven’t received any request of Remedesivir in the past 18 days.” “Footfall of customers has dropped. Hoever, vitamins and zinc of popular manufacturers are still in short supply,” said Yashwant Singh, a medicine store owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/medicine-supply-improves-as-covid-cases-decline-in-bihar/articleshow/82842471.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Sugar mills asked to clear dues of farmers by June 15||PATNA: The sugar mills on Friday were asked to make full payment to sugarcane growers by June 15, even as they had cleared 86% of the dues of farmers till May 15, according to an order issued at the review meeting held in the sugarcane industry department. At yet another review meeting, the cooperative department maintained that wheat procurement has been going on along expected lines, as procurement made was much more than last season. As to the sugar mills, they were also asked to take loans from the banks to clear the dues of the farmers. The sugar mills said that percentage dues of Bihar cane farmers with various mills in the state was less than that in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (UP). While the review was made through virtual medium, the participants included cane industry minister Pramod Kumar, department’s principal secretary N Vijayalaxmi, joint cane commissioner Jay Prakash Narayan Singh, other officials and representatives of the sugar mills. The representatives maintained that sugar was available in the godown of the mills, but due to the limit imposed by the Centre on allotment of sugar for sale, it was being difficult to clear the dues of the farmers. Vijayalaxmi said that the Centre has already been asked to increase the allotment of sugar for sale so that the dues of the cane growers could be cleared. In the meantime, banks could be approached for loans. The decision was also taken to increase the area under cane production in the state by also including the new farmers. Wheat Procurement: The quantity of wheat procured by the government during this year's season has been 1.19 lakh metric tonne (MT) from 22,797 farmers, so far. The cooperative department said that procurement is being made through PACS and Vyapar Mandals, and the quantity of wheat purchased from the farmers till now has been much more than the previous season around the same time. This year, wheat will be procured till June 15. Wheat will also be procured from willing farmers whose list has been prepared by Kisan Salahkars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sugar-mills-asked-to-clear-dues-of-farmers-by-june-15/articleshow/82839929.cms||Abhay Singh

Infrastructure like additional number of beds, oxygen cylinders, concentrators, pipeline and other healthcare facilities have to be upgraded in the district, sub-division and block-level hospitals. Deputy development commissioner (DDC) Suman Kumar said, “Civil surgeon (CS) Kamal Kishore Rai has submitted a requisition for oxygen cylinders.

The DM has also asked the CS to get requisition from all the primary health centres (PHCs) separately, while the DDC has been directed to constitute a committee for purchase of healthcare materials for the hospitals. District board chairperson Karuna Kumari said, “Around Rs 2.91 crore have been made available under 15th finance commission. Apart from providing oxygen cylinders, additional number of beds and other healthcare infrastructure in the hospitals, there is also a plan for purchasing fogging machines.” Meanwhile, ANMMCH is also gearing up for the third wave of Covid.

Each of these 19 facilities has 2,500 under trial prisoners (UTPs) and convicts and they include sub-district and open jails, prisoner’s ward and a borstal school.  The Byculla jail for women in Mumbai, Pune’s open jail at Yerawada, JJ Hospital’s prisoner’s ward, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg jails are among these smaller facilities and do face overcrowding issues. Additional director general (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI, “We undertook an elaborate exercise of conducting over 75,000 Covid tests on inmates and jail staffers at all our 60 jails in December last year and January this year. Those testing positive were isolated from others in special wards, hospitals, temporary jails and Covid care centres and were provided with best possible treatment. A large number of inmates later started testing negative even though there was a surge in the number of positive cases elsewhere outside the jails. The exercise to subject inmates and jail staffers to RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen tests continues till date.” Ramanand said compared to bigger jails, the smaller jails are less crowded and better managed and none of the inmates have fallen ill or shown symptoms of the Covid-19. “We have taken series of measures to decongest state jails as per the Supreme Court appointed high power committee guidelines to release inmates on interim bail and convicts on emergency parole in 2020-21. We have vaccinated inmates and jail staff on a large scale. All government guidelines to contain the spread of virus have been implemented in letter and spirit.” The number of positive cases had started increasing since January this year. A planned strategy and series of measures taken helped in making smaller jails become Covid free while 41 other jails, including nine central, districts and sub-jails have reported decline in the number of Covid cases, he said. “We had initially started an exercise of recalling inmates released on bail and parole like other states. We later took a call not to recall them unless the notification issued by the state government under the Epidemics and Diseases Act authorising their release on bail and parole is not withdrawn,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/19-state-jails-have-kept-covid-away-in-second-wave-so-far/articleshow/82841059.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said they were in talks with various cvompanies. He said the companies would be given incentives to set up generation plants in the remote areas. The state has committed itself to increasing the oxygen production to 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) a day from the existing 1,250 MT per day.Last month, with the state recording the more than half the daily cases in India, the government had decided to divert all industrial oxygen for medical use. Pune had grappled with a severe shortage of oxygen in April as consumption in the district had reached 383 metric tonnes as against its full daily production capacity of 350 tonnes.

---||Chandigarh||‘Defend Behbal Kalan case strongly in HC’||Jalandhar: Behbal Kalan police firing victim Krishan Bhagwan Singh’s son Sukhraj Singh has said that Punjab government should now strongly defend the investigation in the case in the Punjab and Haryana high court where a petition challenging it is pending. The government should take care that it does not fall like Kotkapura firing case, he added. Sukhraj also alleged the special investigation team, including ex-IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, was responsible for letting off seven police officials in Behbal Kalan case and only three police officials were charged. “No lapses should be left in its legal defence when challans have been presented. Now, evidence should start in the trial court in Behbal Kalan firing case,” he said at a press conference here on Friday. The state government should also challenge the HC decision scrapping the Kotkapura firing case investigation, in the Supreme Court, he added. He alleged former DGP Sumedh Saini got relief in the Kotkapura firing case as legal department of the state government did not contest his petition strongly. Two FIRs – 129 and 130 of 2015 — registered in Behbal Kalan case reflected presence of 11 police officials there but only three were charged and one was made approver while rest seven were let off, Sukhraj claimed, adding, “I ask the government that on what basis these seven police officials were let off and who had asked for it”. “Entire SIT was responsible for letting them off,” he said. When asked if he also meant then IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, to whom the Behbal Kalan case was also later entrusted, he replied in affirmative saying, “all including Kunwar Vijay Partap are responsible for letting them off”. Responding to another question, he said the former IG should have presented the 10th challan also in the case as he had claimed that nine challans had already been presented and next was ready. “New SIT has been formed in Kotkapura case. They should use statements of the witnesses already recorded by the earlier SITs. They should use the same statements to save time so that justice can be delivered without any delay,” he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/defend-behbal-kalan-case-strongly-in-hc/articleshow/82842972.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze's colleague Riyazuddin Kazi now fired from police||MUMBAI: Invoking special powers, the city police commissioner on Friday dismissed assistant police inspector (API) Riyazuddin Kazi, who was arrested along with his colleague Sachin Waze in the alleged planting of gelatine sticks in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house this February and the subsequent murder of the vehicle owner, Mansukh Hiran. After Waze, Kazi is the second officer arrested by NIA to be dismissed from service by Hemant Nagrale. Sources said inspector Sunil Mane, also arrested in the case, is next in line. Kazi was dismissed under article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution, wherein the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by that authority in writing, it is not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry. Kazi, who was working under Waze, aided and abetted the murder of Hiran and helped Waze in destruction of evidence, said NIA. It was Kazi who went to Hiran’s automobile shop in Thane and later Waze’s housing society and forcibly took away the relevant footage that showed that another vehicle used in the crime was parked there. Kazi also assisted Waze in creating an alibi that he was on duty on March 4, raiding bars in south Mumbai when he was in Thane. Waze had even left his mobile phone at his office in the police headquarters as part of the plan. It was at Kazi’s instance that the NIA had seized the number plate, laptop and other electronic gadgets dumped in Mithi by Waze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-colleague-kazi-now-fired-from-police/articleshow/82844449.cms||Ahmed Ali

There is also a specific remark in the government notification that "all important policy matters" shall be the exclusive domain of the chief minister unlike 2016, showing more concentration of powers with him this time. The previous practice was to refer only those files requisitioned by the chief minister or mandated by the rules of business to him. This would mean that he will practically have control over every file in the government. The chief minister has now taken over minority welfare, pollution control, coastal shipping and inland navigation and Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation. A comparison of departments administered directly by CM Pinarayi Vijayan during his first (2016) and second tenures shows more concentration of power by the chief minister- both in terms of business and the number of portfolios. The number of departments has increased from 24 in 2016 to 28 in 2021, with a specific remark that ‘all important policy matters’ shall be the exclusive domain of the chief minister. This entry was absent in the allocation in 2016. The specific entry in the notification issued by the government on May 20 mandates that all ministers will have to refer files of policy importance to the CM for his decision rather than the cabinet taking a collective call. The previous practice was to refer only the files requisitioned by CM or those mandated by the rules of business to be circulated to the CM. The rules of business (framed under Article 166 (3) of the Constitution based on which the government machinery functions) contain a list of businesses requiring approval of the chief minister, governor and also that of the council of ministers. As per the rules, there is a distinct list of 26 items that has to be shown to the chief minister, before any orders are issued. The entry 26 in the list says that ‘any other case or class of cases that the chief minister specially wants to be submitted to him’, will also be routed to him, which would mean that he has practically control over every file in the government. Having 28 items of business to be disposed of on a daily basis, along with decisions on all policy matters, the file work of the chief minister’s office is expected to increase substantially. Also, the notification allocating business in the central government has a reserve clause requiring all important policy matters in the departments to be put before the Prime Minister. However, the PM’s portfolios otherwise are confined to atomic energy, space departments, and departments of personnel and training, calling for a much smaller daily paperwork. Despite the induction of energetic young ministers, the trend in allocations points towards a much stronger CMO. The cabinet is perceived to be the highest decision-making body, which is supposed to take all policy decisions. According to Article 164 (2) of the Constitution, the council of ministers shall be collectively responsible before the legislative assembly. Responding to the takeover of minority welfare portfolio, CM said that he did so on the basis of a general decision. Dismissing statements that IUML opposed the move, he said that IUML doesn’t decide portfolio allocations and it is evident that the Muslim community trusts the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cms-powers-expand-as-ldf-govt-2-0-assumes-office/articleshow/82841158.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||City of angels: Woman turns app cab into ambulance for Covid patients||KOLKATA: App-cab driver Shampa Nandy has converted her car into a cab-ambulance to ferry Covid patients from home to hospital and back despite initial opposition from a section of her family. However, they are all very proud of her courage and resolve. Shampa is now a familiar face at hospitals across the city. Be it the sweltering summer heat or when it pours during Monsoon, Shampa is on duty from 10 am to midnight. In the past several months, she has ferried counltess patients to different hospitals. Or transported those who have recovered to their homes. “On hearing stories about ambulances extorting money from the hapless families of Covid patients, I decided to help them by ferrying patients in my cab. I joined Kolkata Ola, Uber, App-Cab Operators’ and Drivers’ Union which offers similar services. My male colleagues offered support when they learnt that I will ferry Covid patients,” said 36-year-old Shampa, who lives in Bijoygarh. Initially, she did not have PPE kits. “I used to get very scared as I slept with my 13-year-old daughter. We don’t have separate rooms. But now I have a set of PPE kits. I know, if you don’t lower your guards, you are unlikely to be afflicted by the disease. I find Covid patients mortally scared. I chat with them as I drive, tell them how many patients I have brought back home. Those who could not return are negligible in number,” said Nandy. Nandy learnt driving only in 2019 and got her cab dueing the pandemic last year. “My sister Rakhi Basu Roy is a pillar of strength in my life. She insisted that I stand on my own feet, to rear my daughter on my own. On her insistence, I booked the car. But its delivery was inordinately delayed. I got the cab last June,” said Shampa, who has been separated from her husband, but stays with her mother-in-law. But when she decided to ferry Covid patients, the opposition came from her sister and mother-in-law. “I understood their concern for me . But I was resolute to do it. As I kept ferrying patients with complete health safety measures, now they feel proud of me. I also feel life is worth living,” said Shampa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-of-angels-woman-turns-app-cab-into-ambulance-for-cov-patients/articleshow/82841155.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Although the data collection of patients suffering from black fungus is still on, the NMC health officials said as many as 127 patients in the city are suffering from this disease in one-and-a-half month. In other parts of Nashik district, 53 patients suffering from mucormycosis have been reported, while three have succumbed to the disease. The NMC health officials said all the patients in the city were on steroids while they were undergoing treatment for Covid and most of them had a history of diabetes. When contacted, Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC, said the city has reported 127 patients suffering from mucormycosis during the last one-and-a-half month. But most of the patients are from other districts, who had come to Nashik for treatment of mucormycosis “We are collecting the data about the mucormycosis patients in the city from the private hospitals, after which, we will know more details,” he said. Hemant Sonanis, the president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nashik, said earlier two to four patients suffering from mucormycosis underwent treatment in a span of six months in the city. But the scenario has changed in the past few days as two to four patients with mucormycosis are undergoing treatment daily in the city. “Specialists in the city are aggressively treating mucormycosis patients. But the major problem we are facing is a severe shortage of amphotericin B injections, a key drug required to treat mucormycosis,” said Sonanis. “The district administration has received some stock, but it is inadequate. Moreover, the priorities are given to government hospitals. Hence, we want the government to provide an adequate supply of ‘amphotericin B’ for private hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mucormycosis-127-cases-7-deaths-in-nashik-city/articleshow/82836747.cms||Tushar Pawar

An NMC official said the civic body has asked for details in order to analyse the reasons behind the deaths that are on the higher side in these hospitals. According to sources, around 7% of the total admission at these hospitals succumbed to Covid infection during the last couple of months. When contacted, NCM medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje admitted that the nine private Covid hospitals in the city have registered higher death rates. “We want to find out the reasons behind the deaths. This will help us in taking preventive measures in future to reduce the number of people dying from this infection,” he said. “We have already sent letters to these hospitals, asking them to provide the details at the earliest,” he added.Nagargoje, however, avoided commenting on how many Covid deaths took place in these nine private hospitals during the second wave. IMA Nashik president Hemant Sonanis said doctors can’t be blamed for deaths as they have been working overtime to save the lives of Covid patients.  468 new cases in city Meanwhile, Nashik city on Friday registered 468 new cases of Covid-19 — lowest in the past two-and-a-half months.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Party nominees to be ministers’ private secys||T’puram: Immersed in a system clean up mode, CPM has given strict instructions to its ministers to be more vigilant while inducting persons into their personal staff. As part of this, the party secretariat is learnt to have decided that all private secretaries, who lead the personal staff of ministers, would be direct nominees of the party. Leaders claim the move is to pre-empt the possibilities of personal staff putting the government and party in trouble in important issues. Just like last time, CPM fixed the number of personal staff for each minister at 25, though rules allow ministers to keep 30 members. CPM had insisted the same during the first LDF government, but it later gave exemptions to certain ministers who insisted on drafting up to 27 members as personal staff. The party would also insist that the maximum age of government officials, being inducted as personal staff, should be 51 years so that their retirement age would sync with their tenure as personal staff. Minimum qualification for private secretary was tentatively fixed as degree during the first LDF government, but exemptions were given to deserving candidates. However, many in the personal staff of ministers used to grumble over the quota fixed for personal staff. According to them, ministers, who handle important and heavy portfolios, need a bigger team. "Take for instance the case of Mohammed Riyas. He is in charge of PWD and tourism. He may find it difficult to run the show with lesser personal staff whereas someone who is vested with less important portfolios might be able to manage with lesser personal staff," said a former personal staff of a minister in the first LDF government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/party-nominees-to-be-ministers-private-secys/articleshow/82841237.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Panel to probe overcharging charge against pvt hospital||Panchkula: Haryana health and home minister Anil Vij has ordered the setting up of a committee of three senior-level officers to re-examine the allegations of overcharging against Paras Hospital here and submit a report within a week. The committee comprises Dr Shaleen, director general, medical education; Dr V K Bansal additional director general, health services; and a senior grade officer of the state finance department. Paras hospital spokesperson Yashwant said, “We are not aware of any such orders. We can only comment once the orders are served on us.” A few days ago, Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta had given a written complaint to Vij, saying the hospital was accused of charging more from three Covid patients. Gupta said he would write to the state government to order an audit of bills of private hospitals, issued to Covid patients. Gupta said, “During the earlier investigations, the hospital bill was found to be three times high and after audit, the bill of Rs 7.5 lakh was reduced to Rs 2.9 lakh. So, we demanded a high-level probe into the overcharging.” A committee constituted at the district level in its report had mentioned some irregularities, recommended issuing a warning and seeking an explanation on the alleged inflated bills. The six-member committee had inspected three bills issued by the hospital. In the case of patient Jog Dhian, the committee found he was admitted on May 2 and till May 13, his family was issued a provisional bill of Rs 7,59,831. Of this amount, Rs 2.95 lakh was shown as advance. When the committee contacted the patient’s brother Sanjiv Kumar, he said Dhian was on a ventilator and alleged the hospital had not been providing adequate treatment. The committee found that a large number of tests had been conducted on the patient for which charges were depicted in the bill. “But on the same day, the patient was issued a final bill of Rs 2.91 lakh proving the overcharging by the hospital,” said Gupta. The committee concluded the patient was excessively charged Rs 7.60 lakh but during the cross-verification, they reduced the bill by Rs 4.69 lakh to Rs 2.90 lakh. The rates per day are Rs 8,000 for isolation bed, Rs 13,000 for ICU without ventilator care and Rs 15,000 for ICU with ventilator care for hospitals not NABH-accredited. For the NABH-accredited hospitals, the rates per day are Rs 10,000 for isolation bed, Rs 15,000 for ICU without ventilator care and Rs18,000 for ICU with ventilator care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panel-to-probe-overcharging-charge-against-pvt-hospital/articleshow/82832264.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Varanasi||In Kashi address, PM Narendra Modi chokes up during homage to Covid victims||VARANASI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that bringing treatment to the doorsteps of patients will reduce the burden on the health system and provided a new mantra in Covid-19 management — ‘Jahan bimar, wahin upchaar’ (treatment where the patient is). “Bringing treatment to the patients’ doorstep will reduce the burden on the health system, which is already under great pressure, as we have to fight on many fronts. With our common efforts, we have handled the pandemic to a great extent, but still we have to fight a long battle, focussing on rural areas of Varanasi and surrounding regions of Purvanchal (east UP),” Modi said while interacting with doctors, paramedical staff and other frontline health workers of his parliamentary constituency through video conferencing on Friday. The PM, who became emotional while paying condolences to those who lost their lives during the pandemic, said, “Covid-19 has snatched many of our loved ones from us. I pay my respect to the people who died of Covid-19 and express my condolences to their bereaved families.” While lauding the efforts of Uttar Pradeh’s Yogi government in tackling the pandemic effectively as well as beginning preparations for the anticipated third wave of the pandemic, Modi also appreciated the initiative of the Varanasi administration in creating micro-containment zones and ensuring home delivery of medicines. The PM commended the work done by doctors, nurses, technicians, ward boys, ambulance drivers and other frontline health workers of Kashi and the alacrity with which the number of oxygen and ICU beds were increased in a short time. The Pandit Rajan Mishra Covid Hospital was also activated by DRDO at a short notice, he added. Expressing happiness over the functioning of the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) in Varanasi, the PM said, “Varanasi’s example inspires the world. Initiatives like creation of micro containment zones and home delivery of medicines yielded positive results. Bringing doctors, labs and e-marketing companies together to provide a tele-medicine facility named ‘Kashi Kavach’ was also a very innovative initiative.” The PM also warned against complacency and urged the frontline warriors to take maximum advantage of the potential and experience of ASHA and ANM sisters in the ongoing war against Covid in villages. Terming the vaccine as a ‘safety armour’ against Covid-19, the PM said, “Vaccination has provided protection to our frontline workers during the second wave, who could serve the people. In the coming days, we will be extending vaccine protection to everyone. I urge everyone to get vaccinated when their turn comes.” Emphasising maximum vaccination, the PM also warned against wastage of vaccines. Modi hailed the efforts of Yogi government in fighting the pandemic and cited the success in controlling encephalitis cases in children in the Purvanchal region due to active efforts of the UP government. “I urge the officials and doctors to work with the same sensitivity and vigilance.” He cautioned against the new challenge posed by mucormycosis or ‘black fungus’ disease in the battle against the corona pandemic. “It is important to pay attention to the precautions and arrangements required to deal with it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/treatment-at-doorsteps-of-patients-willreduce-burden-on-health-system-modi/articleshow/82841775.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Talking to reporters here on Friday, Pt Mishra said, “The district administration had referred the matter of death of my daughter Sangita Mishra to a three-member committee of senior doctors on May 2 to investigate the matter and give a report at the earliest. However, no investigation report has been finalised so far. I haven’t slept for 20 nights while waiting for the report to know what had happened to Sangita in the hospital.” Pt Mishra, who was one of proposers of Modi when he had contested Lok Sabha election from Varanasi in 2014, said, “I had ensured Sangita’s admission to a private hospital following intervention of district magistrate and depositing Rs 1.50 lakh on April 25. On April 26 my wife died and we could not visit the hospital. On April 29 night, we were informed that Sangita had died.” On May 3, Pt Mishra’s other daughter Dr Aarti Mishra reached the hospital and alleged that the owner and staff of the private hospital’s Covid facility in Maidagin area had murdered Sangeeta. She sought CCTV footage of Sangita’s admission period. Taking note of her allegation, inspector Kotwali Brijesh Singh reached the hospital and informed reporters that after taking her complaint, police had started investigating the matter and action would be initiated after the investigation is complete. On Friday, Dr Aarti claimed that she possessed CCTV footage of the day when her sister was admitted to the ICU of the hospital in which she was visible on her bed. However, the hospital owner and staff are claiming that CCTV footage was not available with them due to technical snag in the CCTV network of the hospital. Dr Aarti has levelled many serious allegations on the hospital mentioning that a day after claiming that Sangita had become 95% cured they informed her family that she died of heart attack. But when the body was handed over to her family, blood was noticed in Sangita’s nose and mouth. Later, the hospital asked them to pay Rs 4 lakhs claiming that injections of Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000 were administered to Sangita. However, the hospital has not provided prescription, diagnostic reports or related documents so that we could know what ailment Sangita was having and the course of treatment and also the medicines given to her, she alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/noted-vocalist-to-meet-pm-cm-as-daughters-death-probe-is-delayed/articleshow/82841824.cms||---

On Friday, one litre of petrol was being sold at Rs 100.14 while premium petrol was priced Rs 103.26 per litre. The cost of diesel also crossed the Rs 90-mark and was being sold at Rs 90.68 per litre. Gajkumar Mangave, president of Kolhapur District Petrol Diesel Dealers Association, said, “Increase in price of crude oil in the international market due to the war-like condition between Israel and Palestine along with lifting of Covid restrictions leading to rise in demand for fuel. Also, with states planning to lift lockdown, there is a possibility that fuel prices are likely to go up.” He added, “Both state government and central governments should come together and reduce the tax amount, offering some relief to the people who are already reeling under financial crisis due to the pandemic. If fuel is brought under GST then it can definitely reduce the price and an uniform rate will be charged for petrol across the nation. I have been in this business for 40 years and never imagined that petrol rates will reach the Rs 100-mark.” Snehal More, a health worker, said, “It’s an open invitation for inflation. With rise in petrol and diesel prices, the rates of other products are also going to go up. With prices of every thing going up managing the monthly budget has become difficult.” Citizens, who used to travel to Karnataka earlier to fill their tanks due to lower rates, are unable to travel due to Covid restrictions that has left them fuming. Sadanand Patil, a resident of Kagal taluka, said, “Petrol price in Karnataka is Rs 96.67 and here it is 100.14 rupees. Karnataka border is just five kilometre from Kagal so we used to travel there to fill up our tanks. But now even that is not possible because of Covid-related restrictions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-kolhapur-dist/articleshow/83041717.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||Actors use shoot break to serve people||Kolkata: Television actor Dibyojyoti Dutta of ‘Desher Mati’ fame has been using his break from shooting, which has been stalled during the enhanced restrictions, to serve the people. The 21-year-old has been visiting a canteen in Jadavpur every day and helping the caterers packs meals for 125 needy people. Armed with a pass from Kolkata Police, Dutta, along with two friends, has been distributing the free meals to the families and he has also travelled to districts to distribute ration and sanitary napkins among those in distress. Dutta is among the many stars who have doing their bit for society. Dutta, who has earned the moniker of ‘Boy of Bengal’ after his popularity in serials like ‘Joyee’ and ‘Chuni Panna’, had initially mooted this idea of pulling their personal resources with friends Subhadeep Kajli and Sabyasachi Bhattacharjee. “They agreed and the work began. Earlier, I could join my friends only on weekends,” he said. Now that shooting has been on hold, he has been packing, distributing packets and even reaching ration to homes. “If I can take care of my safety, why should I stay at home? I always have my mask and gloves on,” he said. Some of his fraternity members, including Leena Gangopadhyay, Ananya Das, Debanjana Mookerjee and Pradyut Dey, have been supporting him. Shruti, his co-star in ‘Desher Mati’, is herself a Covid survivor. “She sent across a lot of medicines,” he added. Sudipta Chakraborty donated blood on WednesdayActress Sudipta Chakraborty donated blood on Wednesday. She had been “scared” of blood donation but took an “impulsive decision” when she learnt about the scarcity. “I heard the situation would worsen once the 18+ vaccination starts as people can’t donate blood within 14 days of getting jabbed. I felt an adrenaline rush, connected with an organization and enrolled my name as a donor. On Wednesday, I went to a hospital and donated blood. Though I am averse to sharing such photos, I was told doing so would inspire others,” she said.. The West Bengal Motion Picture Artists’ Forum is set to open a 25-bed facility for free treatment to residents of Wards 89 and 93, members of the forum, technicians and their families on Saturday. Named ‘Soumitra’, after the late Soumitra Chatterjee, the facility has been opened at a badminton training centre. Actor Shantilal Mukherjee, joint secretary of the forum, said, “Doctors will examine patients to see if they need hospitalization or can be treated at the facility. The ground floor of a house that’s located bang opposite this facility will house the front office. Members of the forum and the club will be physically present there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/actors-use-shoot-break-to-serve-people/articleshow/82841318.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Dada said on April 5, the HC had ordered the preliminary enquiry only in a complaint filed by advocate Jaishri Patil. The state has sought quashing of two paragraphs in the FIR and to stop a “roving” probe into the state’s administration by seeking to investigate API Sachin Waze’s reinstatement last year and Deshmukh’s alleged “exercise of undue influence” over police transfers and postings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cbi-probe-into-deshmukh-fir-may-demoralise-cops-says-maharashtra-state/articleshow/82844516.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kodakara heist amount was Rs 3.5cr, not Rs 25L||Thrissur: The “complainants” in the sensational highway heist case, recently taken place at Kodakara, have finally conceded that the looted amount was about Rs 3.5 crore and not Rs 25 lakh, as was mentioned in their original complaint. Thrissur range DIG A Akbar, who is heading the special investigating team, said the police have already recovered nearly Rs 1 crore of the looted money. The looting incident had taken place on April 3, and the money was being transported in a car allegedly for the election work of a national political party. The goons who executed the action had followed the car in two other vehicles, and intercepted it by creating an artificial accident, near Kodakara. Thrissur rural SP G Poonguzhali, who was investigating the case, had said earlier that Dharmarajan, who had allegedly sent the money in the car, had told the police that he was an RSS activist. Dharmarajan had also told the police earlier that the money was handed over to him by Sunil Naik, who is the former state treasurer of the Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the BJP. Even though Dharmarajan and Sanal had earlier told the police that only Rs 25 lakh was lost in the incident, they have now conceded that the amount was about Rs 3.5 crore. They are also now arguing that they had not mentioned the original amount earlier fearing that they would not be able to divulge the source of that fund, the DIG said. Police have reportedly received some hints that the money has come from outside the state and on the identity of the source of funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kodakara-heist-amount-was-rs-3-5cr-not-rs-25l/articleshow/82841431.cms||T Ramavarman

At 113mm, this is the highest ever rain recorded in Mukteshwar since 1916 in the month of May. Earlier, the maximum rainfall in the month was recorded on May 10, 1916 when the hill station received 71.4mm rain, little over half of what was received on Thursday. The hills of Uttarakhand, including Mukteshwar and Nainital, saw incessant rainfall on Thursday due to the combined impact of western disturbance and Cyclone Tauktae. “A record 113mm rainfall occurred in Mukteshwar during 24-hours ending on Thursday. The rainfall has broken the earlier record of 1916 when 71.4mm rainfall fell in the month of May in 24-hours,” said Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at regional meteorological centre. According to the met centre, Uttarakhand received 80.7mm rainfall in span of just 48-hours against the normal of 5.1 mm rainfall. For the week ending on May 19, Nainital received 46.9mm rainfall, 205% more than what is normally expected. For the same time period, Dehradun recorded 21.5mm rainfall, 81% more than normal, Pauri Garhwal received 14.4mm, 112% more than normal.

On Friday, 555 fatalities were reported as part of the daily report, and 708 deaths were added to the cumulative tally. Of the total, 3,082 deaths were reported in the daily bulletin, while the remaining 2,050 were over a week old and were added to the cumulative toll as part of a reconciliation process. Maharashtra had reported a total of 81,486 deaths on May 16 which rose to 86,618 on May 21. At a meeting of the state task force on Covid-19 mortality held on Friday, members discussed how deaths in the second wave followed a different pattern as compared to the first wave. “Many patients came late to hospital and died within 24 hours of admissions and the number of deaths among youngsters has been higher,” said former KEM hospital dean Dr Avinash Supe, who is a member. “We are still awaiting mortality figures from districts for a complete analysis, but we found four risk factors for mortality in the second wave -- diabetes, male gender, high dose of steroids and poor oxygen hygiene (not using distilled water in oxygen concentrators),” said Supe. On Friday, 29,644 new Covid cases were reported from 2.8 lakh tests conducted across the state in the last 24 hours. The positivity rate is on a steady decline, it dropped to 10.2% on Friday. The daily caseload and toll in Mumbai were 1,415 and 54 deaths, respectively. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force, said the situation in Mumbai is improving every day. “However, till we reach a daily caseload of below 500, we need to remain vigilant and mask up,” he said. In the state, smaller districts like Satara, Solapur, Beed, Buldhana,Osmanabad were adding as many cases as Mumbai. Pune district added 2,291 cases, the highest in the state.

---||Kolkata||Chemists flooded with home test kit queries in Bengal||KOLKATA: People are looking forward to the introduction of Covid-19 self-testing kits, particularly at a time, when labs are handing out long waiting periods to suspected Covid patients for RT-PCR results. With doctors advising people to act quickly and begin consulting a physician at the earliest, many view the self-test as a reliable option to either confirm or dismiss doubts .  “Once I lay hands on the kit and learn how to use it, I will do the test once a week for the family,” said executive Jogen Mukherjee, a resident of Sarat Bose Road. With a demonstration video circulating on social media, many are looking forward to trying it. But the enthusiasm is not shared by owners of pharmacy chains and chemists. Rejendra Khandelwal, owner of pharmacy chain Dhanwantary, doubts how proficient the average man will be in using the kit to derive proper results. “Unlike a pregnancy kit or a sugar test kit, this will check a virus, which cannot be seen. Collecting a swab sample from the nostrils is not easy. Retailing it is fine but I think it will be more of a fad,” he said. Gautam Jatia, CEO of Frank Ross chain, said when the kits arrived, they would be available at all the stores. “It looks like a handy thing. Let’s see how the acceptance is,” he said. Modern Medicine Distribution (MMD), which runs wholesale and retail business in Behala, was flooded with calls from retailers over the kit’s date of availability. “Ever since the news was flashed about ICMR’s approval for the kit, there have been a lot of queries. But no company or major stockist could give us a definite answer,” said Samir Jana of MMD. “We are checking with the MyLab Discovery Solutions in Pune their status of mass-scale production,” said a health department official. Self-test kits can be a game-changer in Covid-19 management in Bengal. Those can cut queues in labs, reduce costs, and give quick results (15 minutes), leading to prompt treatment and isolation, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chemists-flooded-with-home-test-kit-queries/articleshow/82841423.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Kolkata air turns better amid restrictions||KOLKATA: Within five days of stringent restrictions being imposed on May 16, the air quality in the city has improved remarkably as non-essential industrial activities and movement of the majority of vehicles have been suspended. Health experts said improved air quality would help in faster recovery from Covid as most symptomatic patients ended up with lung infection. Though Bengal had been under complete lockdown in May 2020, the restrictions this month led to more number of “good” days than lasy. “It is partly because of the higher rate of infection and greater awareness that have made restrictions successful. Intermittent rains and norwesters are also reasons,” said a West Bengal Pollution Control Board scientist. On May 4, the state started imposing restrictions, which led to a certain degree of emission reduction. But from May 16, a marked improvement in the ambient air was clear, said environment activist Somendra Mohan Ghosh.  Ballygunge already showed 11 good air days (AQI: 1-50) in 21 days, compared to 10 out of 31 days last year. On the B T Road Campus of Rabindra Bharati University, which recorded poor and severe days in winter, showed 11 satisfactory air days (AQI: 51-100), while May last year had only four such days. “The improvement of air quality has beneficial effect on patients with chronic respiratory related ailments, like COPD, asthma, ischaemic heart disease. Visits to OPDs and clinics have decreased out of virus fear. But we checked out individually and found out that most of them are doing better even in these grim hours,” said Subir Ghosh, a respiratory medicine expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-air-turns-better-amid-restrictions/articleshow/82841459.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Ramesh, Chandy oppose party rejig||Thiruvananthapuram: Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy, who aren’t ready to accept a generational change in the party, have opposed the move to appoint new faces at the helm of party affairs. They want old warhorses to continue so that they will have an iron grip over the party. Chandy opposed the move to appoint V D Satheesan as the new opposition leader and joined hands with Chennithala to replace Mullappally Ramachandran with his trusted lieutenant KC Joseph as the KPCC president. Chandy told AICC leaders to let Chennithala continue as the opposition leader. He made it clear that he won’t support Satheesan’s candidature. Both group leaders have put the high command under tremendous pressure with this move. However, this has given rise to severe resentment in the party as more leaders have started coming out in the open against them. “Group leaders aren’t ready to correct their mistakes. If there is no revamp in the party, then Chandy would be the last chief minister of the party,” said senior leader Rajmohan Unnithan, reacting to the situation the party is facing now. Young leaders —including MLAs, MPs and a bunch of senior leaders— demanded a massive revamp in the party and this was communicated to AICC observers who came here to meet them. They had proposed the name of Satheesan as the new opposition leader. Unnithan said that the party badly needed a new leadership to instil confidence among the people. If the party isn’t ready to learn from its mistakes, then we will have to pay a huge price. The groups in the party are destroying it, he said. Senior leader K Muraleedharan also demanded a total restructuring in the party and stressed on the need for a new leadership to rejuvenate the party at the grassroots level. “If we are not ready to rectify mistakes now, more setbacks are in store for the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ramesh-chandy-oppose-party-rejig/articleshow/82841470.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM seeks cyclone aid from Del; where’s PM, asks Sena||CM Uddhav Thackeray, on a day-long tour of the cyclone-hit Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts on Friday, demanded central assistance citing the severity of devastation. He did not immediately announce any state relief and said compensation will be given after review of the loss assessment report. His demand for central aid was amplified by Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna, which questioned the step-motherly treatment to Maharashtra highlighting that the PM visited only Gujarat and announced Rs 1,000-crore assistance, and sought Rs 2,000 crore. Pointing out that Mumbai contributes Rs 2.5 lakh crore revenue to the Centre, the daily said: “Keeping this in mind, we can hope that ‘Dillishwar’ (ruling party at Centre) will provide at least Rs 2,000 crore relief to the cyclone-affected people in Konkan.” Speaking in Pune, deputy CM Ajit Pawar too said PM Modi should have visited Maharashtra and the other affected states, besides Gujarat, and announced assistance for them all, not just Gujarat. “The meeting was scheduled, but it was cancelled last minute,’’ he said. After surveying Wayari village in Malvan and Nivati village in Sindhudurg and speaking to cyclone-affected persons, Thackeray said climate change is leading to repeated instances of cyclones in the Konkan and an assistance roadmap is being made. “Central assistance will be sought for permanent infrastructure along the coast to lessen cyclone damages. Underground cabling is required to avoid power outages and shelter homes have to be constructed to house evacuated people during cyclones,” he said. Last year, Cyclone Nisarga had slammed into the Maharashtra coast and caused extensive damage. Responding to a query on BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis claiming the CM was making political comments on the tour, Thackeray said. “I am not the leader of opposition. I am not frustrated.” Later, in a dig at the PM, he added: “I am touring on ground and not surveying from air.” The Saamna also tore into Fadnavis, saying: “Fadnavis should also forcefully demand aid from the Centre keeping aside political differences as he is a leader of Maharashtra.”  Referring to the unfolding tragedy of scores of lives lost as a barge sank off the Mumbai coast, it said: “Even after the tragic incident, the PM visited only Gujarat with an aerial survey and left, which is painful.” After assessing the damage, Thackeray said: “Compensation based on loss assessment report will be announced.” He asked officials to expedite the ‘panchanama’ of the damages and submit a report ensuring not one affected person is left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-seeks-cyclone-aid-from-del-wheres-pm-asks-sena/articleshow/82844661.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Nagpur||High soyabean seed cost follows last year’s low crop||Nagpur: Relieved from increased fertilizer prices after government hiked subsidy a day ago, farmers in Vidarbha are now dogged by higher soyabean seed prices. Soyabean is the second major crop of the region after cotton, but cultivators have only reaped poor returns in it over the years. Last year was rather ironical for the growers. The soyabean yield dipped to less than half as some farmers also reported to have reaped nothing. Soyabean was sold at Rs3,500 to Rs4,500 a quintal on an average. As against this, traders who bought it from farmers are now selling it at a record high of Rs7,500 a quintal to solvent extraction firms where soyabean is used as a raw material. This has prompted farmers to increase the area under soyabean for the coming kharif season. The rates of seeds have nearly doubled this year. A 30kg packet of soyabean seeds that was sold for Rs2,200 is now available at Rs3,000 to Rs3,500. In some of the brands, it has gone up to Rs4,000 too, said sources. Farmers say despite the high prices, seeds are not available in a number of pockets. Sharad Chandak, seed trader in Nagpur and president of Nagpur Agro Dealers Association, said a 30kg bag of soyabean seeds that was available for Rs2,200 now costs Rs3,300-Rs3,500. One acre needs one bag. There are farmers who take as much as 25 bags too. The rates have gone up because of shortage due to the demand and poor crop last year. Production of seeds was hit due to unseasonal rains damaging the crop. Vallabh Deshmukh, director of Mahabeej — a state government undertaking producing seeds — said the corporation had decided not to change the rates. It has maintained last year’s price of around Rs2,200 for a 30kg bag. “However, a number of private companies have increased the rates to at least Rs3,300 bag. Some brands are selling for Rs4,000 a bag,” claimed Deshmukh. Even as the prices of seeds have gone up, farmers who provide the basic stock to seed companies did not get any enhanced rate, he added. “There should be a law on controlling the seed prices and also providing fair remuneration to farmers who supply the stock,” said Deshmukh. There may be a shortage due to last year’s low output, but it is also hyped, he said. Farmers in Yavatmal contacted by TOI said seeds are not easily available. Mahabeej’s seeds are cheap, but the supply is rather low, said traders. IFFCO cuts rates, others to follow Companies have rolled back fertilizer rates after government hiked the subsidy. IFFCO has already issued revised rates and the rest are expected to come up with new prices by Monday. DAP that had gone up to Rs1,900 a bag is now back to Rs1,200, said Sharad Chandak from Nagpur Agro Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-soyabean-seed-cost-follows-last-years-low-crop/articleshow/82841433.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: FDA crippled in midst of pandemic as hundreds of key posts lie vacant||Mumbai: At a time when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to play a crucial role in helping control the pandemic, it is crippled as a majority of its key posts have been lying vacant for a prolonged period. Barring one, all posts of joint commissioners are unfilled. Out of a total of 1,361 sanctioned posts, 585 are vacant. FDA officials said they have not been able to monitor the availability of emergency Covid-19 drugs as well as oxygen. When contacted, medical education secretary Saurabh Vijay told TOI: “We are in the process of filling up the vacancies. We will complete the exercise soon.” FDA commissioner Parimal Singh did not respond to a text from TOI on the vacant key posts. Senior FDA officials admitted work was hampered to a great extent due to the acute staff shortage. “Our performance has been adversely affected as there is no one to take note of the state of affairs in the FDA. Justice Bakhtawar Lentin had recommended key reforms in the FDA, but it appears that they have been given a go-by. Now suddenly, following the pandemic, we have realised the FDA exists,’’ said a senior FDA official. In the wake of deaths of more than a dozen citizens back in 1986 following administration of contaminated glycerol, the state had set up the Lentin Commission to probe reasons behind it. The panel had made several recommendations, which are yet to be implemented in letter and spirit, said officials. Veteran bureaucrat Mahesh Zagade, who was the FDA commissioner from 2011 to 2015, said the body has been completely ignored due to lack of seriousness at the government level. “In my opinion, the FDA has collapsed. As a result, we have not been able to rein in illegal and unauthorised hoarders and the black market of crucial medicines required for treating Covid-19. Law enforcement agencies are seizing such drugs but the presence of the FDA is not felt across the state. As an FDA commissioner, I had recommended appointment of 900 drug inspectors. It appears that the proposal is gathering dust,” Zagade said. Official FDA records show seven out of the eight posts of joint commissioners are lying vacant, including for food and law. Two posts of assistant directors, 35 of assistant commissioners (drug), 39 of assistant commissioners (food), 111 of drug inspectors, 138 of food safety officers, 29 of senior scientific officers and one of chief administrative officer are vacant too. “Even the newly appointed minister did not take a review of the manpower requirement of the FDA. As a result, it’s a critical situation,’’ said an official. One said Maharashtra has 80,000 medical stores while the number of medical products has crossed 40,000. The existing inspectors can inspect less than 20,000 of the 80,000 in a year. FDA laboratories can test less than 7,000 products per year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fda-crippled-in-midst-of-pandemic-as-hundreds-of-key-posts-lie-vacant/articleshow/82843325.cms||---

The portfolio was with KT Jaleel during the last LDF government. In a video message released by the KCBC on Friday, Fr Jacob Palackappilly, deputy secretary general of KCBC, welcomed the move while congratulating the new government. “The chief minister himself handling the department of minority welfare was a subject which has been in discussion in the public sphere for a while now.

IUML slams move IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty said in Kozhikode that Vijayan’s decision amounted to insulting a community and not taking it into confidence. “It is an insult to the community. The decision came amid news reports that it was not proper if some communities are allowed to handle the department and that is now getting endorsed.

---||Nashik||‘Harsher’ curbs to be relaxed from Sunday||Nashik: Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Friday said only ‘harsher’ restrictions imposed by the district administration would be eased from Sunday but the state curbs to break the chain will remain across the district.“Covid cases are on the decline in Nashik, which is a good sign. Hence, some harsher restrictions will go. However, the state government’s restrictions under the ‘break the chain’ plan will be in place. People taking advantage of the situation and flouting rules will be prosecuted,” he warned during an online review meeting. The review meeting was attended by district collector Suraj Mandhare, Nashik civic chief Kailas Jadhav, city police commissioner Deepak Pandey and Zilla Parishad CEO Leena Bansod. The administration had imposed a ban on the functioning of the agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) at its central office, though scattered business was allowed. At the same time, industries were also closed down while essential services were allowed. “The APMCs and industries can function provided they follow the rules. This is being done so that farmers do not suffer. The violation of Covid protocol will lead to the closure of establishments. The industries have to give an undertaking on taking responsibility of workers and their families,” said Bhujbal. Grocery shops were closed, though delivery of goods was allowed. These restrictions will be lifted and shops will remain open during the specified hours, that is 7am to 11 am, as decided by the state government, said the district collector. Mandhare pointed out that a detailed order about the restrictions from Sunday would be issued on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/harsher-curbs-to-be-relaxed-from-sunday/articleshow/82837254.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The incident took place at Koyikkathara on Thursday. The members shouted slogans against Nair while burning his effigy. According to them, the protest was against Nair who took a political stand while at the helm of an organization representing a community. They also said that the protest is not against the Nair community but against the NSS chief. Meanwhile, the office-bearers of the Chettikulangara Erezha South NSS karayogam distanced themselves from the incident.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Parsis object to cremating Covid dead||AHMEDABAD: Aggrieved by the cremation of dead bodies of Covid-19 patients belonging to the Parsi community, its religious group from Surat has approached the Gujarat high court asserting that this practice is against Parsis’ faith. The petition has sought directions to the authorities to permit the Parsi community to perform the last rites according to Zoroastrian religious traditions. The petitioner, Surat Parsi Panchayat Board, submitted that the community follows a 3,000-year-old tradition for the disposal of dead bodies. The bodies are left at Dokhma, the Tower of Silence, to be eaten by vultures and left in the sun to be decomposed. The board complained that the authorities in Surat do not allow Parsis to follow the religious traditions for the last rites of Covid patients and force them to cremate. There were 29 such deaths in Surat. The body said that in the name of Covid protocols, the denial of permission to follow this essential religious practice is a violation of constitutional provisions — Articles 14, 19, 21, 25, 26, and 29. Justice Nirzar Desai on Friday issued a notice to the Centre, the state government, and Surat authorities over the Parsi board’s plea that cremation or burial of bodies constitutes a sin for the community. The court has sought a reply from the authorities by May 27, said senior counsel Asim Pandya who appeared for the petitioner. The plea said that the Parsi community considers fire an agent of purity and would not cremate the dead. The plea said that burying the bodies would also be considered a sin. The board has submitted that the central government’s Guidelines for Dead Body Management issuedin March 2020 donotprohibit the disposal of a body by placing it on the Tower of Silence. It was submitted that the Centre’s guidelines recognize only two modes of dead body disposal, cremation and burial. But there is no mention of the method followed by the Parsi community, which is Dokhmenashini, an integral part of the Zoroastrian religious practice. The Dokhmas are at secluded placesand are accessibletoonly nasheshalars, who handle the dead bodies and place them either in the well or on the tower. It was also argued that the ICMR has clarified that coronavirus cannot be spread through dead bodies. The petition mentioned that burial is anyway not possible for the Parsi community because the authorities have not allocated any burial ground to it. Moreover, Muslims and Christians do not allow their burial grounds to be used forpeople of other religions. The plea cited the case of a Parsi man who allegedly forged a high court order saying that Parsis are allowed to dispose of dead bodies of Covid patients according to their customs. The plea said this only shows the mentaltrauma that the community is going through because theauthorities force them to follow a practice not permitted in their religion. Besides, the plea has sought a declaration that the Centre’s guidelines do not prohibit the Parsis from following their customs. Theplea says if theguidelinesare interpreted against the interests of the Parsis, the guidelines should be quashed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parsis-object-to-cremating-covid-dead/articleshow/82841582.cms||---

The state accounts for about 85% of the groundnut oil exported from the country. According to the latest data available with Indian Oilseeds and Produce Exports Promotion Council (IOPEPC), India exported groundnut oil to the tune of 2.13 lakh tonnes during April 2020 to February 21 as against 35,629 tonnes during the same period in fiscal 2020. High demand from China on account of damage to its domestic crop due to flooding mainly resulted into higher exports of groundnut oil from India, said oil millers in the state. “Our groundnut oil export is estimated to touch 2.25 lakh tonnes in 2020-21 following a high demand from China,” said Kishor Viradia, president, Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA). Agreed Samir Shah, former president, SOMA, who stated that the demand from China surged as the groundnut production in the neighbouring country was down as its crop was hit due to flooding lastyear. Meanwhile, groundnut crop within Gujarat was also damaged due to excessive rains. This coupled with the strong demand from China pushed up the groundnut oil prices in local markets. The average wholesale prices of groundnut oil are hovering around 2,600t o Rs 2,700 per 15kg tin, which were at Rs 2,200-2,300 per 15kg tin last year,” added Viradia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/groundnut-oil-exports-pegged-at-2-25l-tonnes/articleshow/82841536.cms||---

Oral hygiene of the patients has to be ensured by raising awareness among them when they are being treated,” Thorat said. The STF has also asked the hospitals to ensure they use distilled water for humidifiers used in providing oxygen to the patients. The other factors stressed are judicious uses of steroids, antifungals and antibiotics to ensure chances of development of the black fungus are further avoided. The advise has been sent to the hospitals and at the same time a discharge note has also been prepared for patients that advises them about their behaviour and measures they need to take during post-covid period — including oral hygiene, use of clean masks and visiting ENT specialists at regular interval. The doctors treating Covid patients, however, have said that most hospitals followed the ICMR guidelines about the use of the steroids considering their adverse effects as well. “The doctors are following all cleanliness measures. They are also using medicines judiciously,” Dr Raj Nagarkar, who has been treating Covid patients, said.He added aggressive use of antifungals and antibiotics in very rare case cannot be ruled out, but at the same time it is necessary to save the patient first due to which calculated risk has to be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/use-steroids-judiciously-dist-administration-tells-hospitals/articleshow/82837287.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The PM was to tour cyclone-hit Maharashtra along with Gujarat, but the Met department said it was not advisable to fly over coastal Maharashtra. So he went to Gujarat, said state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. “The PM has announced Rs 2 lakh as compensation to the families of those who died on account of the cyclone and Rs 50,000 to the injured. The PM has promised that all the states and Union territories will be paid compensation as soon as the Centre receives their reports,” he added. Reacting to Uddhav Thackeray’s dig at Modi’s aerial survey, Patil said the CM who never steps out has finally set foot on the ground. “He does not have to tell others that he did not go by air but travelled on land. One should not forget that the late PM Indira Gandhi would tour affected areas by air,”he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-foul-weather-nixed-pms-maharashtra-tour-rs-1000cr-for-all-affected-areas/articleshow/82844758.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Tarun Tejpal acquitted in alleged rape case, state to move HC||PANAJI: A local court on Friday acquitted Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal of allegedly raping a woman in a starred hotel in 2013, bringing the curtains down on a seven and a half-year trial that saw numerous twists and turns. Additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi pronounced the verdict on Friday, after thrice deferring the date for judgment, in the case originally filed as a suo motu by Goa police. Minutes after the judgment, chief minister Pramod Sawant said the government would appeal the verdict in the high court. “The verdict has been an injustice towards the victim, and this injustice would not be tolerated. We will challenge the verdict in the high court as soon as possible,” he said. “We will not let somebody go scot-free like this. I have personally gone through the evidence collected in the case, and looking at the evidence, he cannot be acquitted. It is very sad, and we will not tolerate such injustice against women,” Sawant said. Tejpal said the past few years were a long nightmare for his family, and that he is relieved that it’s finally over. “It is with profound respect that I thank this court for its rigorous, impartial and fair trial, and for its thorough examination of the CCTV footage and other empirical material on record,” he said. “In November 2013, I was falsely accused of sexual assault, and today, the trial court of the additional sessions judge, Goa, has acquitted me. In an awfully vitiated age where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth. I am grateful to have received justice, because justice is not always a given thing in this country,” he said. When asked if the state government had “fixed him” in the case, Tejpal said, “We will speak to the press, but give us some time. It was very tough for all of us”. Tejpal was charged under Sections 354 (assaulting or using criminal force on a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (outraging modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrong confinement), 376 (rape), 376(2) (f) (person in position of trust or authority over woman, committing rape of such woman) and 376(2)(k) (rape of a woman by a person being in position of control or dominance over the woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Meanwhile, special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora said it is a setback for the state. The case pertains to 2013, when, on November 7 and 8, Tejpal allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at an event in Goa. On November 22, Goa police lodged a suo motu FIR against him. He turned up in Goa on November 28, 2013 and was arrested on November 30 after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on May 19, 2014, to attend the cremation of his mother, and since then, has been out of jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpal-acquitted-in-alleged-rape-case-state-to-move-hc/articleshow/82843305.cms||Murari Shetye

GHAA has requested to end the summer vacation two weeks earlier. The fourweek vacation is to end on June 10. In a representation made on Thursday, the association said that from April 7, the HC has been taking up only ‘urgent matters’ due to surge in Covid-19 cases and limited number of benches were available till summer vacation. “The good news is that spread of Covid-19 has subsided recently and due to this, the government of Gujarat is expected to lift substantial restrictions placed in April -2021 to arrest spread of the Covid -19,” the letter reads. The association further said that due to suspension of regular court functioning, hundreds and thousands of important and urgent matters are held up. Litigants and advocates are keen to proceed with those matters as early as possible. GHAA also said that the HC had last year suspended the summer vacation to recoup loss of working hours in April 2020. “It is expected that reducing summer vacation and resuming court working on full strength will alleviate miseries of litigants who are otherwise suffering from miseries of pandemic on one way or other and also pain and suffering of members of GHAA who are unable to exercise their fundamental right to profession fully,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lawyers-urge-hc-to-end-summer-vacation-early/articleshow/82841632.cms||---

Arjun, 38, the only son of Thankappan and Chandrika of Munappy House, was working with a certification agency associated with ONGC. While Thankappan, 71, is suffering from cancer, Chandrika too has some health issues. Arjun’s wife Aarathi is employed with RPF in Kolkata, and they have no children. Arjun had contracted Covid-19 infection when he visited Wadakkanchery last December. He went back after he tested negative and completed the quarantine period, said his neighbour Sasikumar. Sumesh, who had been working as an engineer in a Mumbai-based company for the last six years, had been onboard the barge P305 which sank off Mumbai High during cyclone Tauktae. Sumesh, son of Velleri Sudhakaran and Devayani, had last visited his house in Wayanad six months ago. He had told the family that he would come on leave by May end. He got married to Dhrishya two years ago. Though the family had got information that Sumesh was in the ill-fated barge on Thursday morning, they were pinning hopes that he could be rescued. The family and relatives heard the news of his demise following the identification of the body. Meanwhile, the body of Jomish Joseph, 35, hailing from Eachome in Wayanad and who was identified on Thursday, was brought home on Friday. The funeral was held at the Christuraja church at Eachome at 4pm on Friday. Meanwhile, Karuvassery native Athul, 27, who survived the barge mishap, arrived at his house near Kakkodi in Kozhikode on Friday. Athul was on the barge ‘Gal Consturctor’ which was caught in the cyclone. “The anchors of the barge broke off and it went adrift and water began seeping into the vessel. Luckily we were rescued by the Indian Navy,” said Athul, who was safety officer on the barge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/barge-mishap-bodies-of-2-more-keralites-identified/articleshow/82841637.cms||---

On Friday, 367 cases out of the 841 cases in the district were from areas outside the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) limits. Against this, on Thursday, 437 out of 862 cases were reported from areas outside VMC limits. On Wednesday the numbers stood at 445 out of 871. Officials said that the numbers had been going down in general across the state including central Gujarat. They added that this is also reflected in the hospitalization numbers. Sources added that the number of cases in rural parts of Vadodara and neighbouring districts was being closely monitored as hospitalization of cases from these areas was often delayed. The delayed presentation of cases made many patients serious and they needed ICU beds or ventilators. This had led to a shortage of such beds in the city, particularly in private hospitals that have limited such facilities. Most serious patients from nine districts surrounding Vadodara including bordering districts are brought to the city. It also caters to patients from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/proportion-of-cases-from-rural-areas-dips/articleshow/82837336.cms||---

For the pandemic to end, the weekly growth rate has to reach 0 and experts say it could take years. However, the rate is 0.2% in Mumbai now, down from 2.03% between April 1 and 7. In the week ending May 18, the state’s average growth rate was 0.7%, with Ratnagiri district topping the charts with a weekly growth rate of 2.2% (see box). Maharashtra cases will continue to remain high due to the wide disparity between the growth rates across districts. “Cities are reporting a clear decline in cases, but smaller districts and rural areas are showing a surge,” said a state official. According to data compiled by the health department, Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur have all reported a weekly case growth rate that is lower than the state’s average. Active cases as on Friday in some of these cities have dropped below the peak reported in the first wave. State officials attributed it to the strict implementation of the lockdown measures. “Many smaller districts that did not implement the lockdown strictly are now seeing a rise. Some districts have now imposed a stricter lockdown that the state,” said one official. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said the chart underlines districts that need focused attention to control the spread of the infection. “It means that the second wave will take longer to decline in the state,” said a doctor with a BMC hospital. The second wave began in Vidharba in the last week of February and hit the peak in early to mid-April. “The Covid-19 pattern in our country follows a 100-day cycle. We have seen cases declining and this is likely to be the situation for the next two months and the next peak, if at all, could come in August or September,” said a doctor. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said growth rate and R naught value, a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is, are low as the number of cases are dropping. Gomare said as per the Centre’s guidelines, districts with a positivity rate of less than 10% and a bed occupancy rate of less than 600 could be termed as ‘out of concern’ areas. “Mumbai is right now in the ‘out of concern’ zone,” she said. On Friday, Ratnagiri district, which has reported the highest growth rate, had 7,492 active cases, nearly twice its highest active cases in the first wave. “Even though the weekly growth rate is high, there is a dip in active cases. We are working at increasing our testing which has dipped due to the cyclone early this week,” said an official from the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-case-growth-rate-falls-below-1-in-21-districts-city-in-out-of-concern-zone/articleshow/82843330.cms||---

They had held a meeting with the tribals in the village previous evening regarding tendu leave collection and earnings from it. This stretch had been known as ‘safe zone’ for Maoists. Around a month ago, commandos had failed to zero in on the same group near Korkuti village, around a few kilometres from Paidi.Sources said the commandos had started their operation on Thursday night but circled the Maoist camp on the hillock in teams during predawn. One AK 47, five SLR, three .303 rifles, one carbine, pistols and several other materials including their literature were seized from the place.DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil said following an input from police’s human intelligence network regarding presence of Maoists, commandos were dispatched in smaller teams from Gadchiroli and Aheri headquarters. “The first bullets were fired from the Maoists camp after which commandos decided to retaliate,” he said adding there were no injuries among the commandos. The DIG said they outsmarted the Maoists by plugging the exit points.Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil, who was in the district on Friday, extolled the efforts of the commandos. District guardian minister Eknath Shinde too appreciated the team work done by the Gadchiroli police under DIG Patil, SP Ankit Goyal and Addl SP (Operations) Manish Kalwaniya. Addl DG (Operations) Sanjay Saxena too reached Gadchiroli from Mumbai.This is the second biggest success for Gadchiroli police against the Maoists after the Kasnasoor encounter in 2018 when 34 cadres were killed. On May 21 in 2009, the Maoists had gunned down 16 police personnel, including almost half a dozen women constables, in a brutal attack at Hatti Gota in Dhanora tehsil in north Gadchiroli.In the latest action on Friday, the C-60 commandos managed to wipe out a sizeable chunk of the Kasansoor Dalam which worked as crucial link between the north and south Gadchiroli division of the Maoists.The Maoist camp lost their senior leader and divisional committee member (DVCM) Satish Mohanda of the Maoists’ Company number four formation. Deputy commander of the Kasnasoor dalam, Rupesh Gawade, too was killed. It is learnt, a few Maoists managed to sneak out after suffering bullet injuries, but one of the village militia members, Kishor Holi, was killed.Senior Maoist leader of the north Gadchiroli and action team expert Mahesh Gota’s wife, Sunita Naitam, too was among the ones who were killed in the action. Police said four members of Company four were eliminated in the encounter. “The company formations protect the dalams but in this case their military men were less in number. We will eliminate rest of the dalams soon if they do not surrender,” said DIG Patil.This is the second jolt to the Maoists this year. In March, Gadchiroli police had gunned down five members of the Khobramendha dalam, which weakened the Maoists base in north Gadchiroli.MAOISTS KILLED IN PAST ENCOUNTERSJanuary, 2013 | Six, GovindgaonJuly, 2013 | Six, MendhariFebruary, 2014 | Seven, BethkatiDecember, 2017 | Seven, KalledApril, 2018 | 34, Boria-Kasnasoor April, 2018 | Six, Nainer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/13-maoists-gunned-down-in-predawn-action-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/82843309.cms||---

The district has an estimated 300 patients affected by the disease.“We received 60 vials on Wednesday and 140 vials on Thursday of amphotericin-B emulsion injections that were given to the relatives of the patients who had come to civil hospital. Now, there is no stock available either at government facilities or with private pharmacies,” said Dr CS Thorat, district civil surgeon. “These are special drugs and each patient requires anywhere between 4 to 15 vials a day. In case of severe conditions the demand can go up to 100 per day,” Uday Jadhav, one of the patients suffering from the disease, said. As the relatives of such patients throng the hospital in large numbers to get the drug, it gets difficult to manage such huge rush. The hospital staff alleged that some of them quarrel on Thursday and a police case was registered with Sarkarwada police station. The ENT surgeon in civil hospital, Dr Sanjay Gangurde, who has been given the charge of distribution of the injections registered the complaint. “We were distributing the injections when two people created ruckus at the hospital. Attempts to pacify them failed and hence I along with my team walked off from the spot,” Dr Gangurde said. The complaint has been registered under section of The Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010. The civil surgeon has now directed the hospitals treating the patients to register their demand through online process so that the stock could be disbursed directly to the hospital on payment of the sum into the government account. “Since the numbers of injections were very less, we gave the same on first come first serve basis. However, we have now decided to take the demand online, verify the same and issue the stock directly to the hospitals,” Dr Thorat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/stock-of-black-fungus-drug-lasted-few-minutes/articleshow/82837370.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rain washes away bridge built 3 months ago||DEHRADUN: A suspension bridge built on the Dhauliganga by the Public Works Department (PWD) to restore connectivity after the February 7 Chamoli flash floods was washed away on Thursday night following heavy rainfall in the upstream areas of the district. The 30-meter-long suspension-log bridge was built over three-months ago to restore connectivity between Bhangyul village and Tapovan. Nand Kishore Joshi, the district disaster management officer, said, “The abutment structure on one side of the bridge was damaged by the heavy flow of the water in the river. The work to repair the bridge will commence soon.” Chamoli received 30mm rainfall on Thursday resulting in rise in the water levels of the Rishiganga and the Dhauliganga rivers. However, the water level receded and is now flowing at normal level, according to the District Emergency Operation Centre (DEOC). As reported by TOI earlier, heavy to very heavy rainfall wreaked havoc in isolated places of Uttarakhand with five persons losing their lives in rain-related incidents on Thursday. Three family members were killed in Chakrata after a temporary shelter fell on them following heavy rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rains-wash-away-suspension-bridge-built-on-dhauliganga-after-chamoli-flash-floods/articleshow/82839629.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Dehradun||Veteran environmentalist & ‘Chipko’ pioneer Sunderlal Bahuguna dies of Covid-19||Dehradun: Sunderlal Bahuguna, 94, one of India’s best known environmentalists and pioneer of the ground-breaking ‘Chipko movement’ that started in the Uttarakhand hills and became a hallmark of green activism, died battling Covid-19 at AIIMS Rishikesh on Friday. Bahuguna was admitted in the hospital on May 8 and was being treated for Covid-related complications. “He breathed his last at 12:05 in the noon on Friday,” said Harish Thapliyal, Public Relations Officer of AIIMS-R. The veteran environmentalist was cremated on the banks of Ganga at Purnand Ghat in Rishikesh following Covid protocols and given a guard of honour by police. In attendance were his wife Vimla, family members, assembly speaker Premchand Aggarwal, environmentalist Anil Joshi and others. “He spent his life living for the Ganga and the Himalayas. I am thankful that he was cremated on the banks of Ganga and had a peaceful demise,” Rajeev Nayan Bahuguna , his eldest son, told TOI. Bahuguna---who was born in 1927--- became synonymous with the Chipko movement, initiated in the 1970s by village women in the Garhwal hills who embraced trees in forests to prevent them from being cut. The environmentalist gave impetus to the movement and through his efforts, the initiative gained world-wide recognition. He is also credited with creating the movement’s slogan "Ecology is permanent economy." In 1981, his name was proposed for the Padma Shri award which he refused to protest against the rampant felling of trees in the Himalayas. He was later awarded India’s second-highest civilian honour Padma Vibhushan in 2009. Bahuguna led a 5,000-km-long yatra through the Himalayas — from Kashmir to Kohima in early 1980s, which led to a meeting with then-PM Indira Gandhi. During the yatra, he chronicled the pace of deforestation brought on by developmental projects and submitted his reports to the United Nations. Following his efforts, the government imposed a ban on the cutting of green trees in sensitive zones. A staunch Gandhian who had participated in the freedom struggle and had also agitated for Dalit rights, he used the Mahatma’s tools like satyagraha and hunger strikes to protest for numerous other green causes, the most prominent of which was the agitation against the construction of the Tehri dam in Uttarakhand which led to several villages being submerged. His own village, Maroda was submerged as part of the project and he was also jailed for his anti-dam protests in 1995. He remained a life-long opposer of big hydropower projects. In an interview with TOI in 2018, he had said, “Dams are never a solution for the water crisis. They are paving the way for more calamities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/veteran-environmentalist-chipko-pioneer-sunderlal-bahuguna-dies-of-covid-19/articleshow/82839678.cms||---
---||Noida||Gzb starts drive-in vax session, 50 get jabs on Day 1||Ghaziabad: The first drive-through vaccination session was held at World Square Mall in Mohan Nagar on Friday, when 50 people aged over 45 were administered Covishield. Officials said more than 150 people had gathered at the mall, many of them for their second dose. But most had to return without getting the jab as they had not completed the mandatory gap of 84 days between two doses of Covishield.“My relatives in Noida got themselves inoculated at a drive-through vaccination session a few days ago. I was waiting for a similar camp in Ghaziabad. On Friday, I took the shot without any fuss whatsoever,” said Lalit Singh, one of the 50 recipients.“I was a bit apprehensive about getting myself vaccinated at any government facility since I didn’t want to expose myself to the infection. At World Square Mall, it took me less than 10 minutes,” he added.Like the drive-through vaccine sites in Noida, here too many recipients came on two-wheelers. Vasundhara resident Ashwani Singh, who had also gone to the Mohan Nagar mall, had to return without getting the shot because he had not covered the 84-day gap period. “I took my first dose a month ago and reached World Square Mall for the second dose on Friday. I was told that I needed to wait for 84 days for the second shot. There is a lot of ambiguity regarding the second dose. There should be clarity around it,” he added.With the government revising the guidelines every now and then, many recipients are confused when they would qualify for the second dose.Rajeev Gupta, president of World Square Mall, said, “We vaccinated 50 people on Friday while about 35 to 40 had to be turned away because they had not completed the 84-day gap between doses. The numbers were low today because of the weather. Also, many people were not aware of the drive. We hope the numbers will pick up from Saturday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gzb-starts-drive-in-vax-session-50-get-jabs-on-day-1/articleshow/82844713.cms||Abhijay Jha

TOI on Friday had reported that there was a strong demand from BJP, its ministers and legislators to extend the restrictions. The issue was discussed at the cabinet meeting, wherein it was unanimously decided to extend the curfew period. There has been a decline in Covid cases after imposition of the state-level curfew.  It was imposed on May 9 and will be in force till morning hours of May 24. During the period, shops selling essential commodities were allowed to remain open from 7am to 1pm while takeaway kitchens from 7am to 7pm. Social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural functions, marriages and other congregations, except for events with the permission of the government, were restricted. Cremation rites with 20 people or less were permitted. Shops selling groceries, eatables, animal fodder, public distribution system, standalone liquor shops (for take away only) were also allowed to remain open from 7 am to 1 pm.  Earlier, only shops selling essential commodities were allowed to operate from 7am to 7pm.  The curfew orders were issued as Covid-19 cases were rising in Goa besides other parts of the country. In a meeting with the chief minister on Thursday, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade urged him to continue with the statewide curfew for a few more days. “We have asked Sawant to extend the curfew. It is up to him to decide how many days he would like to extend it,” Tanavade had told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curfew-extended-till-may-31-restrictions-to-continue-cm/articleshow/82843307.cms||---

Officials said 2DG was likely to be available in medicine shops by mid-June. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Ghaziabad has also cautioned private hospitals against prescribing the medicine until it is released in the market.It was on May 18, a day after the release of the medicine’s first batch by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, that the Ghaziabad hospital asked relatives of 10-12 patients to procure the drug from CMO’s office. TOI saw at least one such letter issued by the hospital. A doctor with the facility said much like the protocol for remdesivir or tocilizumab, patient parties were required to visit the CMO office and take approval.The IMA warned against such a practice. “Hospitals should not mislead people. If something happens to the patient, his or her relatives will blame the hospital. The association will issue an advisory to hospitals on Saturday, asking them to refrain from prescribing the medicine until it is available in the market or with government authorities. Doctors should also not discuss this medicine with attendants,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, the IMA president.A senior health official said all applications by the hospital had been forwarded to Delhi.In Noida, several hospitals have written to Dr Reddy’s, the company marketing 2DG, asking for the drug. No hospital has prescribed it yet. Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, Greater Noida, said they were trying to get the drug directly from the company or suppliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2dg-not-yet-in-markets-but-gzb-hospital-prescribes-it/articleshow/82844742.cms||Snehil Sinha

Agarwal has also forwarded to them the request letter of the DSP’s brother, Hardeep Singh, and his medical reports. The DSP, who is posted at Ludhiana Central Jail, is battling for life as Covid-19 has affected his lungs. As the doctors have prescribed lung transplant, which will cost Rs 70 lakh to Rs 80 lakh, his family is seeking help for his treatment. ADGP (prison) PK Sinha said, “We have received the letter from Ludhiana CP and are already working on it. We are exploring the ways and the means to get things done and afterwards the government will be approached for funds. We will do our best to save the life of DSP Harjinder.” Earlier, there were plans to shift him to PGI in Chandigarh. However, now, the officials are examining his reports. The officials are checking the process of shifting the cop to a suitable hospital and of transplant. According to senior officials, this is the first case of lung transplant of a cop that has reached them. On April 6, Harjinder was confirmed to have contracted the virus and was admitted to the Covid ward of SPS Hospital till April 21. Thereafter, he was shifted to a non-Covid ward. Though he defeated the virus, it badly affected his lungs. On April 28, reports confirmed his lungs were damaged. The doctors again tested him after medication on May 10, but there was no improvement. Thereafter, Harjinder’s cousin Hardeep Singh approached Agarwal to seek help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/senior-cops-examine-case-of-ailing-dsp-harjinder/articleshow/82839744.cms||Payal Dhawan

A detailed report will be submitted to the Union government, he said. Sawant said that he regretted that the people had to go without power for almost three days and that they had to even face water problems due to this. “After preliminary assessment it is learnt that electricity and agriculture sector have suffered the most losses. The electricity department has pegged preliminary losses at nearly Rs 22 crore, but we will know the actual figure when we prepare the final report on Saturday for submission to the Centre,” he said. “We have prepared a letter to send to the National Disaster Management Authority for compensation,” Sawant said. The chief minister said that agricultural activities had been severely affected due to the cyclonic winds and heavy rainfall. “Agriculture department has arrived at a figure of Rs 30 crore for the losses,” he said. Sawant said that the fisheries sector has also suffered major losses. “Fishing canoes, boats, nets and other equipment have been damaged. Additionally, the fisherman could not venture into the sea for the last 4-5 days,” he said. The other losses include damage to schools belonging to the education department and to private and forest department properties and agricultural crops. Besides, Sawant said that nearly 500 houses have been damaged, of which some need major repairs. “Several roads and other structures have been damaged,” he said. Bardez in North Goa and Mormugao in South Goa have been majorly affected due to the cyclone. The chief minister thanked the people of the state, panchayat members, councillors and others who helped in clearing the blocks created by the cyclone. “We have to equip the disaster management cell properly by purchasing new equipment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-146-cr-loss-due-to-tauktae-says-cm/articleshow/82843315.cms||---
---||Dehradun||From politicians to environmentalists to hill villagers, tributes pour in for Bahuguna||Dehradun/Nainital: People from all walks of life — from political leaders to hill villagers, environmentalists as well as those who admired his work — paid tributes to Sunderlal Bahuguna on his passing, hailing him as symbol of green activism who inspired a generation of young activists to preserve and protect the environment and fragile Himalayan ecology. Tweeting about Bahuguna’s death, PM Narendra Modi termed it as a ‘monumental loss for the nation’. “He manifested our centuries-old ethos of living in harmony with nature. His simplicity and spirit of compassion will never be forgotten,” the PM said. Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat described it as “a big loss not just for Uttarakhand and India but for the entire world.” Villagers of Raini village in Chamoli which was the cradle of the Chipko movement, also expressed dismay at his passing. Baba Devi, 76, who participated in the movement along with several other village women, told TOI that Bahuguna’s lessons of environment conservation “are spread across the area and will continue to live on amidst the people here.” Anil Joshi, founder of Doon-based HESCO, said that he had lost a father-figure. “Besides being someone who was passionate about the environment, he was also extremely patriotic. I remember that he used to get ready early on occasions like August 15 and January 26 as these national festivals were real festivals for him and he identified deeply with them.” Ravi Copra, Doon-based environmentalist remembered Bahuguna as a great communicator. “He was listened to by the highest of the land and by the people across the seven seas. His efforts made Chipko a worldwide symbol of environmental conservation. His going away will be a setback to all those people in India who are struggling to save the environment at a time when the government has thrown all the environmental regulations and cautions to the wind,” Chopra said. Reminiscing about his association with Bahuguna, Shekhar Pathak, historian and founder of People’s Association for Himalayan Area Research (PAHAR), said he first met the veteran environmentalist at the age of 23 in early 1970s in Almora and the meeting proved to be a turning point in his life. “Had I not met him, I would have simply taken up a job somewhere and not get involved in environmental activism. He taught us to look at the Himalayas as a single entity and work towards conserving it.” Chandi Prasad Bhatt, another pioneer of Chipko Movement and a close associate of Bahuguna, said, “Not just his environmental conservation, even his work with Dalits and women’s rights was monumental. It was due to his efforts in Tehri’s villages that Dalits of the area gained entry into temples.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/from-politicians-to-environmentalists-to-hill-villagers-tributes-pour-in-for-bahuguna/articleshow/82839748.cms||---

After paying a visit to her family at Keerithode on Friday, Muraleedharan said that the visit was as per the special direction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “If the chief minister was busy so far, he can still visit the family and announce a compensation. There are no proper job opportunities in the state and that is the main reason our people have to go abroad for a job. The Union government will provide help for Soumya’s child Adone’s education,” he said. The minister also expressed condolences to the family on behalf of the Prime Minister . Soumya’s husband Santhosh said, “The minister told us that his visit was on the special direction from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was to visit us but cancelled it due to the pandemic. The minister also said that the Centre would contact the Israel government through the embassy to complete all the paper works at the earliest.” “No state representative visited us during the funeral. We thought that they would visit us after the funeral. But no one came. We don’t know why the state government is avoiding us,” said Santhosh. Soumya, a native of Keerithode in Idukki, was killed in a rocket attack at Ashkelon on May 11 while she was on a video call with her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/union-min-visits-soumyas-house/articleshow/82841700.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The chief minister said the whole state and government shared the grief over her death and it would be wrong to paint it otherwise. He said some BJP leaders were trying to create a false impression that only they shared the grief over her death. “These are campaigns by those who have nothing else to say. Our state as a whole shared the grief of that family. Now, BJP leaders try to create an impression that only they shared sympathies,” he said Union minister V Muraleedharan who visited the family of Soumya at Keerithode in Idukki on Friday had accused the state government for being non-sympathetic towards the family and demanded the government to give financial assistance to the family. Muraleedharan who said he visited the family on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was unfortunate that none of the state government representatives visited Soumya’s house, even as the Israeli president spoke to the family members over phone and the Israel consul general visited her house. However, Vijayan said the apprehension against Israel was widespread in the state as well as across the country. Even the BJP government that took a pro-Israel approach was not able to rule out the cause of Palestine, he said. “Have they (BJP government) been able to support Israel in full scale (in the Israel-Palestine issue)? It’s better such a sub-standard approach is not followed on issues like this,” Vijayan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-denies-bjp-charge-of-snub-to-soumyas-kin/articleshow/82841744.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||CET for Std XI admissions not for all? State mulls option||Nagpur: Even as the state education department firms up plans to conduct a common entrance test (CET) for Std XI admissions, sources said officials may go back to the drawing board once again. A highly placed source in the education department said they are mulling the option of holding CET only for those colleges where demand exceeds seat availability. “If we look at the entire state, then there are hardly 40 or 50 Std XI institutes where students struggle to get admissions. So, we are discussing whether there really is need to conduct CET for every institute or we can make it optional for certain institutes. We are discussing it within the department and will take a decision soon,” the official said. Earlier this month, the state education department had conducted an online survey to guage opinion regarding conduct of CET. Maharashtra State Council fo Educational Research & Training (MSCERT), which conducted the survey and analyzed the responses, found that majority of the respondents were in favour of a CET. The survey was open to students, parents and academics. While the CET’s decision is still pending, majority of the decision makers in the education department are pushing for it. In the midst of this, the issue regarding need for a statewide CET came to fore. Another education official, who is not part of the decision-making team, said CET does not make sense. “Over a lakh of seats remain vacant in Maharashtra because of oversupply. The entire purpose of CET is to select the best candidates when demand exceeds supply. But here in Nagpur alone, we see 18,000 seats on an average going vacant ever year. Conducing CET for IITs makes sense because only 13,000-odd seats are available for lakhs of applicants. When everyone in Maharashtra is guaranteed admission, then why conduct CET?” the official said. But, state education officials do have some valid reasons to think of a CET. An education department employee said, “SSC exams have been cancelled this year so there will be variations in internal marks to be given. To make sure that Std XI admissions are done fairly, CET seems a logical choice.” So far, no policy for SSC’s internal evaluation has been decided yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cet-for-std-xi-admissions-not-for-all-state-mulls-option/articleshow/82843322.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The sequnce of tragic events began around 2am on Monday when due to heavy winds, two of the 8 anchorage steel cables broke. A police source said that despite repeated warnings about the cyclone, Ballav did not take action in time. Ballav and others have been booked under sections 34, 304(2) and 338 of IPC. These attract up to 10 years in jail. Meanwhile, Navy warships on Friday recovered bodies of 11 more men, taking the total number of casualties to 60. Indian Navy warships on Friday recovered bodies of 11 more personnel of barge Papaa (P-305) that sank 70 km off Mumbai coast after cyclone Tauktae stormed past the western coast, taking the total number of crew casualties to 60. The Navy is looking for 15 barge staffers still missing and has also initiated an underwater search by its survey ships to locate the wrecks of P305 and a tug, Varaprada, whose 11 members also remain untraced. Six Navy warships have, since Monday, rescued 186 personnel of the total 261 who were on board P-305 when it sank, and two personnel from the tug Varaprada. Bodies brought on shore have been sent to JJ Hospital to complete formalities before they are handed over to families. Chief PRO of the Indian Navy, Commander Mehul Karnik, said a total of 60 bodies of “Brave Nature Victims” had been recovered while the search for the remaining 15 continued. “The search team has safely rescued 188 survivors (including 2 of tug Varaprada) to date. SAR (search and rescue) operation continues for the remaining crew.” The underwater search for the vessel wrecks by survey ships would be carried out using specialized teams and equipment, he said. Karnik said Karwar had more survey ships, so some would be sent out from there. Three construction barges of M/s Afcons, working on an ONGC project in the western offshore fields in the Arabian sea and one floater drilling rig of ONGC were severely impacted by Monday’s cyclone. All the anchors of P-305 gave way, and when it drifted, it hit an unmanned ONGC platform, resulting in water ingress, and eventually capsized at around 5 pm. More than 30 vessels from the Navy, Coast Guard, ONGC and Afcons and 15 helicopters of ONGC, Navy and Coast Guard have been deployed for the search and rescue operations. Indian Coast Guard commandant R K Singh said six Coast Guard ships would continue the search. The fisheries department, fisheries association and the coastal police of Maharashtra and Daman Diu have also been alerted and requested to keep a lookout along the beaches and shallow waters for survivors/bodies. Family members of those still missing have started reaching JJ Hospital to check bodies for identification, but they alleged that they were being made to run from pillar to post to get details and that no one from the employer’s side had come forward to help. P-305 was owned by Durst Enterprises Limited and chartered by Afcons for an ONGC contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-more-bodies-recovered-toll-in-barge-mishap-now-60/articleshow/82844899.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Noble Hospital on Friday started the vaccination drive for 18-44 age group and has planned more sessions on Saturday.Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, told TOI, “We were trying to open slots for 18-44 age group earlier on Friday, but could not do so. By Friday evening, however, we were able to upload sessions for this age group and vaccinated about 100 adults. We uploaded a session of 400 slots for Saturday for 18-44 age group , which was booked within a few minutes. If we vaccinate the 400 early on Saturday, we may open another session for this age group for Saturday afternoon. All jabs in this age group will be based on Co-Win appointments.”Inoculations also began at the Jehangir hospital on Friday for the 45+ age group. The hospital authorities said they received the biggest lot of Covishield among private hospitals in the city so far at 50,000 doses. “We are waiting to start the drive for 18-44 age group as this population is mobile and productive. The need of the hour is to vaccinate this section, as soon as it is permitted as per the guidelines,” Vinod Sawnatwadkar, CEO, Jehangir Hospital, said. Sources from Ruby Hall Clinic said vaccination for 18+ had not started yet for want of permission.However, district authorities clarified that private hospitals need not wait for any specific permission from the authorities. “The Centre has already given permission for starting vaccination for 18-44 age group, so private hospitals who have bought vaccine from manufacturers can start creating sessions for this age group on Co-Win and inoculate them on the basis of pre-booked appointments,” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI.Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, which would start inoculations from Monday or Tuesday, has set aside maximum doses, almost 1,200 doses per day, for 18-44 group and 800-1,000 for 45+ group, the authorities here said. “We are still awaiting for 36,000 Covishield doses. As the number of those needing jabs above 45 years of age goes on decreasing in due time, we will increase the jab numbers for 18+ age,” Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/major-push-eyed-for-18-44-age-group-as-pvt-hospitals-start-paid-inoculation/articleshow/82841822.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Red tape ties up medicines, free run for black fungus||AHMEDABAD: Anxiety kept Sandip Mehta hooked to the phone through Friday on the Civil Hospital campus. “My 68-year-old mother is admitted with a severe infection of mucormycosis. Her palate has been destroyed,” said a distraught Mehta, a Bhavnagar resident. “She has started losing her vision and the fungus is now spreading to her head.” Mehta went on to say: “Doctors have warned us that if the infection reaches her brain, death is inevitable.” Mehta said his mother has received only two injections over past10 days as there is a severe scarcity of drugs. “Doctors say more critical patients are being catered to first. She will get injections when her turn comes,” Mehta said. “We are exploring every resource possible. The authorities claim no injections are available. Should I let my mother die for want of medicines?” The abject despair is shared by 1,000-odd patients of the lethal fungal infection, mucormycosis, in Gujarat who await the Amphotericin B injections. The injections offer the only shot at survival. Principal health secretary Jayanti Ravi said that the government has given the available stock of injections to nodal centres. “We are receiving less stock from the Centre compared to the demand,” Ravi said. The state government, however, failed to deliver drugs on Day-1 itself of the state-managed injection distribution drive for mucormycosis treatment. In Ahmedabad, not a single injection was dispensed to private hospitals from LG Hospital (for city areas) or Sola Civil Hospital (for district areas) on Thursday, authorities confirmed to TOI. The state government had told the Gujarat high court on Monday that it had procured most of the injections from the market. It also submitted that “it had placed an order for 1,14,430 vials of Amphotericin B injections and it has got sufficient stock as of now”. The court had expressed its reservations and had told the government to create a mechanism for the distribution of injections. “How will hospitals deal with it since you have procured everything? How should they treat their patients?” the court had questioned. On Thursday, Gujarat had declared mucormycosis an epidemic but it is yet to declare the official figure of patients and the death toll. Government officials offer mere ‘estimates’ even as conservative figures peg the number of active patients at about 1,000 and the cumulative mortality at 225-250. The sheer lack of planning in managing the crisis was apparent from the fact that an AMC health officer was forced to send a worry-laden email to the government on Friday. The officer said the 1,200 injections provided to the civic authority were not enough even for the patients at AMC-run hospitals, let alone private hospitals. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, the president of Ahmedabad Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the acute shortage of medicines for mucormycosis will result in private hospitals turning away patients. “We are doing our best to manage the medicines, and we welcome the government’s move to centralize the supply,” Dr Gadhvi said. “But when we cannot assure the patients of injections the next day, how can we admit them?” “Injections were not available at any of the centres designated by the government,” said Sushil Ratvani, whose father battled Covid and is now critical with MM at a private hospital.

We cannot afford to be complacent this time around,” he said. With the positivity rate declining a bit in the state, he said that the government should not let its guard down and continue to ramp up infrastructure as there is a threat of the potential third wave which may even overlap the second wave. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India and Indian Medical Association, Pune, said that ahead of the third wave there is a need to ensure proper planning to handle subsequent waves and for this there is a need for local authorities to collaborate better with the hospitals ‘We need to focus mainly on two aspects -- empower small and medium-sized hospitals with regular and rational supply of essential medicines, oxygen as they are solely dependent on supply from the government,” he said. He further added that the local authorities should start or promote private partners to develop at least 4-5 permanent and dedicated Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/keep-health-infra-ready-till-december-salunkhe/articleshow/82841890.cms||Nisha Nambiar

At present, the delivery is allowed till 12 noon. In another major change in the current lockdown restrictions, deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma has extended the operational timings of non-essential shops, private offices and other establishments by one hour — now they will be able to operate from 5am till 1pm — as against the earlier closing time of 12 noon. Although traders are happy about new development, some are still adamant that shops should be allowed to open till 5pm.DC Sharma said, “The ongoing curfew in Ludhiana will remain in place till May 31, but from Monday (May 24) some minor changes will come into effect. All the shops, private offices and establishments can remain open from 5am till 1pm, Monday to Friday. Similarly, fast food outlets, dhabas, bakeries, sweets shops can offer take away services till 1pm. Home delivery of food is allowed till 8pm, but delivery staff need to have curfew pass. Besides this e-commerce companies, courier companies and postal department will be allowed to deliver till 8pm with curfew passes. Everyone is requested to stick to the timings decided by us and we will take strict action against violators.”Welcoming the decision, Mayank Chabra, owner of restaurant located in Sarabha Nagar, said, “We are thankful to DC Ludhiana for accepting our demand and saving the restaurants and food outlets from closing down permanently. Earlier, we were suffering huge losses, as 90% of our sales is only after 6pm. Though dine in still not being allowed which, but we are okay with permission for home deliveries till 8pm, as at least we will be able to make some sales and manage to pay expenses like salaries of staff and electricity bills.”According to Rakesh Sharma, general manager of a hotel, “We had shut down the entire operations of our restaurant, as we were getting no orders at all. But now with home deliveries allowed till 8pm, we will start our operations from Monday, as there is certainly scope for getting orders in the evening.”Meanwhile, state general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal Sunil Mehra said, “Shopkeepers and traders are suffering badly due to current operational timings and extending the operations of shops just by one hour is not going to help anyone. Nothing is going to help until the shops are allowed to open at least till 5pm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/food-outlets-can-deliver-till-8pm-non-essential-shops-offices-get-1-hour-extension/articleshow/82839922.cms||Mohit Behl

Speaking to the media after the weekly Covid meeting in Pune, the deputy CM said there were over 300 cases of mucormycosis in Pune district alone and over 1,000 in the state. “There is a need of six injections daily for these patients. So, nearly 1,800 injections are required daily for Pune district itself,” Pawar said. As per our talks with injection manufacturers, they have been directed to provide the doses to the Centre, which will then allocate them to states, just like it was done with remdesivir shots. “This (allocation) should be done soon,” he said. Pawar said the state government has already brought the mucormycosis treatment under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. On the impending threat of the third wave, he said while Pune district’s positivity rate had dropped and its recovery rate was on the rise, the increase in the spread in the rural areas was of concern.“While we are ready to handle the third wave by ramping up necessary infrastructure, including beds, oxygen and medicines, we need to have focus on the rural areas,” he said, adding that the availability of remdesivir injections had been streamlined in the state. With continuing shortage of vaccines in the state, he said the state was currently using vaccines meant for the 18-44 age group for the 45-plus category. Pawar said the state was leading in the country in vaccination, with Pune district achieving the highest per day vaccinations in the state. “We have the capacity, but the vaccine shortage is an hindrance. The state as well as the municipal corporations of Mumbai and Pune have floated global tenders for the vaccines,” he said, adding that the state was in talks with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech to ramp up their production.He said the vaccines from Russia were at Hyderabad cargo and expected to be allocated to the states soon. The deputy CM also called for auditing of bills to prevent overcharging. Besides, the implementation of the fire audit committee recommendations was also sought by Pawar at the meeting.‘Still time to re-assess restrictions’Deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said no decision had been taken about easing the prevailing restrictions in Pune district. “There are 10 more days to re-assess the overall lockdown situation. As of now, Pune will continue to follow the same restrictions till the next review,” he said, adding that the decision would be taken depending on the Covid caseload then.Paediatric units in every taluka Deputy CM Ajit Pawar on Friday said separate paediatric units should be readied ahead of the likely third wave in every taluka. “Dedicated paediatric centres should be readied,” Pawar said, adding that dedicated centres should be readied both in the city as well as rural parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-asks-centre-to-allot-injections-for-treating-black-fungus-at-the-earliest/articleshow/82841967.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Black fungus: More to it than just steroids||New Delhi: Is the use of steroids the primary reason for the upsurge in black fungus infection? While the primary cause of mucormycosis is overuse of steroids, doctors said other factors are also responsible for the spike. Senior doctors argue that steroids have been used to treat several diseases, but never in recent years has such an exponential increase in mucormycosis been seen. Dr Uma Kumar, head of rheumatology at AIIMS, reasoned, “We have used steroids for weeks, months and in some cases, years, but in my career, I hadn’t seen such a rise in black fungus cases. There has to be other factors involved, and they should be investigated.” She added that sanitation and healthcare associated with fungal infections were also concerns. Immunosuppressants, transplants, diseases like leukaemia, AIDS, kidney and liver conditions and malnourishment predispose an individual to mucormycosis, noted Dr Anoop Mishra, chairman, Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol. “Also, if a hospital or home is contaminated with moulds on walls or the ventilation system or medical supplies are not well sterilised, black fungus infection can occur,” he said. “Mould grows on stale bread, vegetables and fruits.” Doctors also stated that the purity of oxygen did not have a role in triggering mucormycosis. Dr Vidit Tripathi, senior ENT consultant at Fortis Hospital, said, “It is an opportunistic infection in any medical condition causing reduced immunity, such as cancer, chronic kidney disease or AIDS. Long standing hypoxia caused by Covid and increased ferritin (blood protein) level in blood as observed in some Covid patients are also factors. The purity of oxygen or humidifier isn’t significant.” However, Dr Sandeep Garg, pulmonologist at Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, felt that besides the use of industrial oxygen, even the improper use of medical oxygen was a danger. “Medical oxygen requires humidification before administration to patients. The gas, therefore, has to pass through a container filled with sterile water. The water itself must be sterilised and changed frequently as per protocol. If the water is not sterile, it is potentially a source of black fungus infection,” said Garg. While emphatic that steroids weren’t the only factor, Dr Ameet Kishore, senior ENT consultant, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, conceded that high doses of steroids over a prolonged period caused a sugar spike that could result in black fungus infection. “Indiscriminate and unmonitored use of steroids can cause a steep spike in sugar levels. If this goes unchecked, it leaves the individual susceptible to mucormycosis,” said Kishore. “Steroid medication should, therefore, be done under the supervision of a healthcare expert.” In addition to doses and duration of steroid administration, diabetes as a comorbidity was a big factor, pointed out Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Institute of Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare. “Steroid cause sugar levels to jump. Another trigger is ferritin, which is usually high in Covid patients and the mucor fungus feeds on iron produced in the body because of this protein,” explained Budhiraja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/black-fungus-more-to-it-than-just-steroids/articleshow/82841936.cms||---

On Friday, the city reported 803 cases. This figure had last been below 1,000 (956 cases) on April 8. The number of new cases in the city crossed 1,000 on April 9 (1,296 cases) and had doubled in the next four days. New cases grew by 36% and 26% (from previous days) on April 9 and 12, respectively. A senior AMC official said the increase at the time was considerable, as it took just 14 days to cross 5,000-case mark from 1,296 on April 9. Once the peak of 5,790 was touched on April 25, it took 26 days for the number to go below 1,000. Officials said AMC’s aggressive testing policy and surveillance through the 104 helpline and ‘Dhanvantri raths’ helped the city bring down cases in less than a month. However, as markets are being partially opened now, there are fears that the city may again see cases increase. Officials said that there was a 25.6% drop in fresh cases on Friday compared to Thursday, going to 804 from 1,078. Officials said the city had a high of 450 micro-containment areas, while there are just 23 now. For the past week, there have been no new micro-containment areas notified in the city. “That there have been no new additions of micro-containment areas shows that cases coming from the city are not concentrated from one society or block but are scattered as a result there aren’t any areas which need to be micro-contained. If there were three or more cases on one floor of an apartment building, the floor was micro contained. If there were more than eight cases in an apartment block, the entire block was micro-contained,” said a senior health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-cases-in-city-fall-below-1k-after-42-days/articleshow/82841931.cms||---

Thus, half the capacity is vacant. Thus, two wards have been closed temporarily. Likewise, with burden on the 1200-bed easing, the attempt is to close Manjushree Mill Compound hospital with 850-bed capacity in the near future,” said a senior official. “The staff and doctors will be utilized for both non-Covid duties and new challenges like mucormycosis.” Barely two weeks ago, the MediCity campus had bed occupancy of more than 90%. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the number of ventilator occupancy has also gone down in the past few days. “But we have our guards up – we are keeping a close watch on daily cases, and if need be, the facilities can be expanded,” he said. Among private hospitals, the similar trend is being observed. According to Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), the bed occupancy was 90% two weeks ago on May 7, which has come down to 40% on May 21. “The biggest fall is in isolation- and oxygen-bed occupancy,” said an AHNA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drop-in-cases-two-wards-vacant-at-civil/articleshow/82841986.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘Relief for loss of life due to man-animal conflict will be increased to Rs10L’||Forest minister K Ramachandran is now busy inspecting Covid care centres and instructing officials. Deputed for Covid management in Coimbatore district, he, however, has drawn several plans for his ministry. In an interview with Shantha Thiagarajan, the minister, representing Coonoor assembly constituency, talks about streamlining the forest department and removal of encroachment of forest land. Excerpts:Q: As a forest minister what would be your priority in the sector?First, I have to regulate the system within the forest department. It has been a mess for the past 10 years. Then, as per the instruction of the CM, we will go for a sapling plantation drive across the state to make green cover denser. Q: Encroachment of forest land is rampant, especially in the Gudalur division of Nilgiris and Megamalai in Theni district. What are your plans to protect them?A report will be prepared on small-time encroachers. With the support of district administrators, the issue will be sorted out, after obtaining opinions from legal experts. A resurvey of forest land across the state will be conducted soon to consolidate the boundaries. All major encroachments in Gudalur and Megamalai will be removed and legal action will be taken on encroachers. Q: There is a delay in providing compensation to kin of those killed in man-animal conflict. Is it possible to create a fund for it at the divisional level?To avoid delay in providing compensation to the victims, a corpus fund will be created and parked at the district level, under the collectors. The compensation amount will be increased to `10 lakh from the present `4 lakh for loss of life due to man-animal conflict. Q: Wages paid to field workers like anti-depredation watchers and anti-fire watchers are not uniform. Any plans to restructure their wages?Anti-poaching watchers are paid `12,000 a month wherein anti-depredation and anti-fire watchers are paid less as they are not used throughout the year. We will take initiative to use their services in other areas besides their routine work and make their wages harmonious. Q: The posts sanctioned in the department were based on the situation in the 1980s. Will there be more skill-oriented posts?There is a backlog in promotion of officers and staff. Once the promotion process is over, depending upon the number of posts vacant we will take steps to create more posts based on the requirement.Q: Funds allocated for critical sectors like removal of exotic trees and weeds are meagre. What is the status of projects funded by Japan Bank for International Cooperation proposed for this purpose?Removal of weeds inside the forest areas is a huge challenge. First, we have to come out with scientific modalities. The JBIC fund is sanctioned. We have to speed up the process of carrying out the allocation for each of the projects. Under one of the projects of JBIC, exotic trees such as wattle and eucalyptus will be replaced with shola species and fruit trees.Q: Are steps being taken to improve quarters of frontline staff in remote areas?We will take immediate action to renovate the quarters in remote areas that are in a dilapidated condition.Q: What actions will be taken to improve the profitability of TANTEA?I held a meeting with the managing director of TANTEA. Shortage of field-level workers is the main problem. They need to increase the labour strength at least by one-and-a-half times. I have instructed them to implement quality control processes. TANTEA will see its profit doubled in a year. Also, the temporary staff at TANTEA will be made permanent employees as per law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/relief-for-loss-of-life-due-to-man-animal-conflict-will-be-increased-to-rs10l/articleshow/82825130.cms||---

If he doesn’t get the drug, the money will be returned,” relative of a 42-year-old MM patient whose seven teeth and jaw bone had to be removed told TOI. Dr Bhavin Patel of a trust-run hospital in Surat said, “There is a severe shortage of injections needed for curing mucormycosis. Initially, we used the injections from our stock, but now patients’ kin are trying to manage from their sources and contacts.” “Manufacturers told us that new supplies will be in by the first week of June. Meanwhile, let’s hope that the government can procure new stock,” he added. Alpesh Patel, president of the Federation of Gujarat State Chemist and Druggist Association, said, “As of today, there is no availability of amphotericin-B. The government has taken steps like issuing notification so that patients admitted in private hospitals can procure it from government hospitals but there is no supply.” He added that the cycle of this drug is 23 to 24 days. “I believe the situation will come under control and the demand-supply gap will be matched within a week as the government has now given approval to more firms to produce this drug. But until then, there will be a shortage,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mm-medicine-shortage-kin-hassled/articleshow/82842022.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain calls for caution on black fungal crisis||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that the capital has seen 197 cases of black fungus or mucormycosis so far and advised Covid-19 patients to not use steroids without doctor’s advice, apart from monitoring and controlling blood sugar levels to prevent the infection that can be fatal. “Black fungus is on an increase because of two reasons — increase in blood sugar level and usage of steroids beyond the advice of doctors, thereby leading to a decrease in immunity levels,” Jain told reporters on Friday, adding steroids should be taken only on doctor’s advice and not beyond the course recommended by the doctor. He also said that black fungus can only be treated through the standard protocol and at hospitals, not at home. “The medicines cannot be purchased from medical stores as this cannot be treated at home, you need hospital admission and the supervision of a doctor. The 197 cases include people from other states as well. Those being discharged from hospitals are also being observed,” he said. Jain said there is a problem of shortage of medicines for black fungus, which is not only in Delhi but the whole country. “The Centre is controlling medicines of black fungus. They are giving medicines according to state-wise quota. They have allocated 2,000 medicines for Delhi,” he said. “Delhi government will give medicines to hospitals as soon as we get them,” he said. He said Delhi’s requirement is much more than what the Centre has given. “How can we equally distribute to hospitals when we have received less? Even the high court has stated that there is a shortage of black fungus medicines in India and the Centre should import the medicines,” he said. “Taking steroids in large amounts will cause your immunity to deteriorate. Black fungus breeds in our environment, mostly in clay, dirt, or rotten things lying around us. A healthy person has very low chances of getting this problem,” he said. He added that due to worsened immunity, patients who have taken steroids should be vigilant till seven days after the course finishes. He said such patients should minimise social interactions and people around them must keep distance from them till then. Jain said controlling and monitoring the blood sugar level is really necessary at this stage. “When our body contracts any virus, bacteria, or fungus, it adversely affects our blood sugar level. The necessary medicines should be taken to monitor it. Those who already suffered from diabetes were given injections in hospitals while they were admitted. On being discharged, they rely heavily on steroid pills, which is a huge risk for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-calls-for-caution-on-black-fungal-crisis/articleshow/82842026.cms||Sidharatha Roy

With hardly any tournaments in last couple of months, most of them are finding it difficult to meet both ends. A caddie’s income depends on a golfer’s daily round of golf, and with no let-up in cases in the city, most of the golfers are either playing tournaments abroad or are confined to their homes. In such a scenario, club members have stepped in with some financial assistance for caddies and their families. “Keeping in mind the Covid-19 protocols, packed lunches are being provided to caddies. Members have also contributed to provide monetary help,” said Dr G S Kochhar, vice-president of the club. Kochhar said the club has been transferring money directly into their bank accounts. “This is being done to ensure no slippages take place and caddies receive money directly, deriving maximum benefit in these difficult times,” he said. Club president Ravibir Singh has urged caddies to follow all instructions being given by the UT administration. He stressed on the need to remain indoors, maintain social distancing and get themselves registered for vaccination at the earliest.Arvind Bajaj, captain of the club, has been ensuring caddies are gainfully utilised in the club and course, when no other avenue of employment is available for them. When TOI approached one of the beneficiaries, he expressed his gratitude to the club for the aid, but said it is getting extremely difficult to manage their families. “The condition is the same as last year, lockdowns aren’t meant for the poor and daily wage earners,” he said. “The club provided us Rs 2,000 each while serving packed lunch boxes a couple of days ago. Let’s see how long it can be sustained,” he added. The caddie said the club has been closed since April 1. “It’s getting difficult each day, don’t know how long will this lockdown continue. Whatever I had saved after working for a few months post-lockdown, it’s getting exhausted,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/struggling-caddies-hope-for-more-relief-from-golf-club/articleshow/82840005.cms||Tridib Baparnash

A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade was hearing his plea for medical bail and had sought his appearance via a video link from Taloja jail and a report from a JJ Hospital panel. Fr Swamy told the bench that when he was arrested and taken to prison eight months ago he could walk, bathe and eat by himself, but due to conditions at the jail, his health had gradually deteriorated. He now needs assistance for his daily routine. Swamy said he would prefer to be sent back to his hometown Ranchi to be with friends rather than be shifted to a hospital. “I was brought in healthy, to Taloja jail eight months back but over that period all my body functions have deteriorated. I can’t eat on my own, can't bathe or walk on my own. Though I have been getting medicines it has not helped… I am unable to meet the demand of eating (they serve rotis in jail). Someone has to feed me through a spoon,” Fr Swamy said. The JJ report, based on Swamy’s examination earlier this week, says he does not need hospitalization. The report said Swamy was normal and responsive but had severe hearing loss, unbalanced gait, lower limb problems and general weakness. It also said he required physical assistance in the form of a walking stick or a wheelchair. Keeping his advanced age and condition in mind, the judges were willing to send him to hospital. The bench said to Swamy, “Your general health is deteriorating... do you want to be admitted at JJ hospital…?” He replied, “ No, I do not want to be. I would prefer to die here. I would prefer this (jail) rather than be admitted to the hospital.’’ Swamy said he had been admitted to JJ on two occasions and he did not think it could help him. Swamy said there were “great economic inequalities” when the court asked if he had any complaints regarding the prison. He wished to be sent home, he said. The judges said the court was hearing arguments on the point of hospital admission only and not on interim bail. His counsel Mihir Desai then requested the court if he could speak to Swamy and persuade him to be shifted to another hospital, like Holy Family in Bandra. With Desai seeking time to argue his plea for bail on health grounds, the matter was adjourned to June 7. The HC also permitted Desai to approach the court before that date if the priest agrees by then to being shifted to Holy Family hospital. Last October, the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai rejected Swamy’s plea for bail on health grounds. He appealed against the rejection before the HC in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/send-me-home-or-let-me-die-in-jail-stan-swamy-says-no-to-hospital/articleshow/82848317.cms||---

---||Delhi||Black fungus: It’s a race against time as Delhi hospitals starved of key drug||NEW DELHI: For five days now, entrepreneur Amit Bhardwaj has been waiting for his wife to be administered Amphotericin B, a drug used to treat black fungus infection. Bhardwaj’s wife was admitted to Max Hospital in Saket on May 6 following a positive test for Covid. Speaking to TOI, Bhardwaj said, “After she contracted black fungus, we arranged for Amphotericin B on May 16. She underwent surgery for the infection, but on May 17, I was told the government had put a control system in place and we couldn’t buy the drug like we did earlier. From May 17 till Friday we haven’t got the drug. I am too scared to try getting it from other sources because I can’t be sure if it is fake.” The exasperated Bhardwaj said, “I don’t think the government’s regulatory system is helpful in any manner. When a patient has to wait for five days for the drug, who will take responsibility if anything goes wrong? The approving panel meets four times a day, but what’s the use when they haven’t approved of my wife’s need for five days? If there is a shortage of the drug, then we should be told about it. There need to be other channels to procure it.” On Friday, TOI had reported about the shortage of Amphotericin B. At least 12 patients have died due to mucormycosis in the city. Delhi government acknowledged the shortage of the drug. In a statement, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday, “There is scarcity of black fungus medicine in the entire country, including Delhi. This drug is under the control of the central government and they are supplying it according to the states’ quotas.” Jain added that most black fungus patients were those discharged from hospital after Covid treatment. Reminiscent of the recent experience of desperate people seeking leads on oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and retrovirals like Remdesivir, people are now posting frantic pleas on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter on ways to procure Amphotericin B. Many patients stated that the hospitals they were admitted in hadn’t received supplies from the government. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, which has around 70 black fungus patients, had applied for Amphotericin B for 23 patients, but the government released the drug only for seven, a hospital official claimed. At Max, Saket, a senior doctor who did not wish to be identified, claimed, “In the last two days, we have not received any supplies of the drug and are instead giving Posaconazole to patients. We have filled in the forms, attached proofs and submitted our requirements, but we haven’t got the drug.” Health minister Jain too is frustrated. “Our demand is much higher than what we have been allocated by the Centre,” he said. “How can we give the drug to hospitals in adequate amounts when we ourselves receive so little? Even Delhi High Court has recognised the shortage and directed the Centre to source it from wherever they can. Amphotericin B cannot be purchased from medical stores because the infection cannot be treated at home, only in a hospital under the supervision of a doctor. Delhi has 197 cases, including some people from outside the city."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-a-race-against-time-as-hosps-starved-of-key-drug/articleshow/82842134.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Ahmedabad||Day 1: Markets reopen in Ahmedabad but footfalls low||AHMEDABAD: Markets that bore a deserted look over the past three weeks, saw some hustle-bustle on Friday as the state government relaxed curbs imposed on commercial activity. Traders in the Walled City opened their shops once again, but did not receive a lot of footfalls. “For most shopkeepers, the first day was spent in settling account books and winding up pending tasks. We also fulfilled some pending order commitments. The deliveries had been scheduled during the lockdown period. People are still apprehensive about getting infected. So, it will take time for footfalls to increase,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). Pent-up demand for little knick-knacks did pour in for many retailers. However, overall, it was all very muted due to widespread apprehensions over contracting Covid, especially the double mutant strain which has more sinister repercussions. “We barely received any customers at the store. Only those who were in dire need of making purchases stepped in. People are scared. Moreoever, due to the summer heat and work from home situation, very few people step out during the day. We are witnessing a recessionary trend. Let’s see how it pans out in the days to come,” said a retailer on C G Road. Dine-in not permitted, restaurateurs irked:The government’s decision to continue with takeaway-only model has irked restauranteurs. Shopkeepers and vendors twere allowed resume business for a limited time, but did not extend that relaxation towards eateries. “Restaurant owners are reeling under severe revenue shortfall. The least was to permit takeaways till11pm so that order volumes can be recovered,” said Dilip Thakkar, a restaurant owner. Estimates by industry players suggest that order volumes are down by 80% against first half of March Very few shops open in malls:Malls were finally allowed to resume business. But amid apprehensions of further restrictions, barely 30% stores across city malls opened. “We are taking all safety precautions. We expect more stores to reopen by the weekend when footfalls will start to improve,” said Aditya Shah, chief financial officer of a city-based mall near S G Highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/day-1-markets-reopen-but-footfalls-low/articleshow/82842120.cms||---

Speaking to district magistrates, CMOs and other senior administrative officials of the Lucknow division during a review on Friday evening, Yogi also said that call centres should be set up to give information about vaccination. Saying that people should be encouraged to get vaccinated in large numbers, he added that the newly appointed pradhans should be asked to assist in this endeavour. While reviewing the status of vaccination, the CM said that no crowding should be allowed at vaccination centres. There should be a vetting area and a separate observation area at each centre. These centres should invite public representatives to visit. Discussing testing, contact tracing, availability of ambulances, distribution of medical kits, availability of oxygen, Yogi said that Hardoi, Unnao, Sitapur and Rae Bareli districts should improve their integrated command and control centres (ICCCs) to the level of the one which is being operated in Lucknow. Saying that people should not have to wait for long to get in touch with the ICCC, he said the number of phone lines should also be increased. He also reviewed the progress on the establishment of oxygen plants in each district. Yogi said that all DMs must speak to the public representatives of their areas and request them to help in setting up oxygen plants. The CM also inspected a vaccination centre set up in a primary health centre at Bakshi Ka Talab and interacted with the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-to-recall-docs-on-deputation-for-covid-patient-care/articleshow/82843538.cms||---

Of all the ventilators received by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad, 15 were handed over to Hingoli. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel has also raised concern over receiving defunct ventilators from PM Cares funds. Chavan said that he recently wrote a letter to all the district civil surgeons in the region to inquire the status of the ventilators received under PM Cares fund, to which Hingoli district civil surgeon replied with a letter claiming that all the 15 ventilators were functional.Being suspicious of the claims being made by the civil surgeon Dr Rajendra Suryawanshi, Chavan on Thursday paid a surprise visit to Hingoli. He found that only one ventilator was working and that too as a Bipap.He said, “Hingoli received 15 ventilators under PM Cares funds out of which only one is functioning as Bipap. There needs to be an inquiry into this.”The one ventilator that was being functional to some extent also had several glitches and there was an issue with oxygen supply. The health facility had arranged an external oxygen supply, said Chavan.Citing the data obtained from Hingoli, Chavan said that 2 out of 15 ventilators are defunct, the remaining 13 ventilators are reflecting a message that there is ‘inadequate oxygen supply’ and ‘oxygen supply failed’. Moreover, all of these ventilators do not have required amount of battery backup.He said, “I am surprised as to why the Hingoli-based health officials are falsely claiming that the ventilators are working, when none of them are functional,” while demanding action against such officials providing false information to the state as well as people’s representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ventilators-sent-to-hingoli-under-pm-cares-defunct-mlc/articleshow/82837777.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||City zoo tigress Jaan tests -ve for Covid-19||Nagpur: Jaan, the Maharajbagh zoo tigress which showed some symptoms of Covid-19, has tested negative for the infection. After the recent heavy showers in the city, there was a health issue with the tigress. Jaan consumed less meat than usual and there was slight nasal discharge. “We decided to test Jaan for Covid-19 and called wildlife vet Dr Mayur Kate of Transit Treatment Centre (TTC), Seminary Hills, who had earlier taken a sample of a tigress brought to the TTC,” said zoo officer-in-charge Dr Sunil Bawaskar. “We took nasopharyngeal swab without sedating the animal. It was possible as the tigress is familiar with zoo veterinarians and the caretakers. The animal was brought to Maharajbagh when it was a month-old,” said Dr Bawaskar. “We were also in touch with vets at Nehru Zoological Park (NZP), Hyderabad, where recently eight lions had tested positive for Covid-19. We also gave supportive medicines to the tigress as suggested by the NZP vets,” said Dr Bawaskar. He said two weeks ago an RT-PCR camp was organized for zoo staff in which all 26 people whose samples were taken had tested negative. Hence, chances of spreading the virus to the tigress through the staff were nil. Secondly, the zoo is closed for visitors and hence the possibility of the virus spreading from humans is also ruled out. Normally, Covid-19 samples of wild animals are sent to ICAR-affiliated National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal. “However, to avoid delay and spread of Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh too, we sent the sample to AIIMS here,” said Bawaskar. Now, the tigress is doing well and consumed 10kg meat, her normal diet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-zoo-tigress-jaan-tests-ve-for-covid-19/articleshow/82842140.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||NE riots: No bail to murder accused||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has rejected the bail plea of a murder accused for his alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots. Justice Suresh Kait noted the fact that the call detail records showed his presence at the crime scene. “The plea of the petitioner that there is no CCTV footage, and so his involvement in the offence is not proved cannot be accepted as there may not be technical evidence in the form of CCTV footage, but the call detail record shows his presence at the spot of crime on the day of incident. His participation in ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’ WhatsApp group is still under scrutiny,” the high court observed. The high court added that the prosecution had placed on record PCR call record, statement of eyewitnesses and other witnesses, which “dissuades this court to keep a lenient view for the petitioner, Pankaj Sharma.” According to police, during the riots on February 27 last year, the bodies of Hashim and his brother Aamir were found in a local drain. An investigation revealed that they were brutally murdered, while the eyewitnesses named Sharma along with co-accused Shivam Bharadwaj. Sharma, who is facing multiple FIRs in the case, sought bail arguing that the eyewitnesses were planted by police and there was no evidence against him. “The allegations against the petitioner are grave. In the alleged incident, a young boy of 19 lost his life. As per the postmortem report, 42 grievous injuries were found on the body, which proved fatal for him. The case is pending at the stage of framing of charge. Besides this, the petitioner is implicated in eight other cases. The apprehension expressed by prosecution that if released on bail, he may threaten or influence the witnesses, is not misplaced,” the court observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-no-bail-to-murder-accused/articleshow/82867060.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The best performing areas will be rewarded through various means. This is being done, the CM said, to generate awareness about the novel coronavirus and ensuring that everyone followed Covid appropriate behaviour. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said that out of the 98,386 revenue villages in the state, complete testing had taken place in 89,512 villages and patients had been found in 28,742 villages where testing was being increased. Teams are yet to visit 8,300 villages. He added that the campaign in rural areas had started on Friday while the one in the ward, being called the ‘Mera ward, corona mukt ward’ would be started soon. “In this initiative, all public representatives and agencies will encourage people to follow Covid protocols and ensure that others follow them too. Villages in a district declared Covid-free first will be given benefits of some social schemes,” Sehgal said. The CM, he said, believed that effort by people, combined with the steps being taken by the government, would go a long way in getting rid of the virus. Sehgal said the government had been preparing for the next possible Covid wave since 2020, as a result of which its door to door surveillance had continued and its teams had reached 17 crore people in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-calls-for-mera-gaon-corona-mukt-gaon-campaign/articleshow/82843549.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Down with WFH? Mumbaikars say best work happens in office||MUMBAI: Are Mumbaikars missing their workspace so much that they are willing to risk an infection or has the waning of the second Covid wave lessened anxieties about commuting to office? A recent survey among corporate, IT and banking professionals has found that while at the national level, 55% of the workforce feel they perform best when not confined to office, just a little over one-fourth of officegoers (28%) in Mumbai agreed with this assessment–a predominant number from the city said their best work happened amongst colleagues and team members. Three-fourths of employees in Bengaluru (75%), on the other hand, said they performed at their peak when not in office. Bengaluru had the highest preference for alternatives to the officespace followed by Delhi (70%) and Kolkata (45%). The massive Covid-19 lockdown has given rise to the largest ‘work from home’ experiment in history. The survey, carried out by Script, a premium furniture brand from Godrej, shows wide regional disparities in work-related responses. Interactions with more than 2,000 corporate/IT/banking professionals in the 18-45 age group across four metros reveals that Indians have become location-agnostic and a new sense of the workplace has emerged, said Rajat Mathur, business head for Script. The interviews were done by an independent research agency, Innovative Research Services (India), under the theme 'A new sense of place'. “…India’s workforce is split between going back to office or not. When employees eventually return to the workplace… 41% plan to maintain working from home best practices they picked up during the lockdown,” the survey report adds. According to the survey, 67% of employees in India respond to work-related messages (WhatsApp, SMS, emails) at home, be it under normal circumstances or amidst the ‘work-from home’ routine. Comparing cities, Mumbai has the highest chunk (85%) of workers who respond to messages related to office work. Kolkata comes next with 65% employees saying they react to any communication that’s work-related even at home, followed Delhi (60%) and Bengaluru (59%). To a query on whether they tracked news about the company even on vacation, a maximum of 48% from Mumbai said ‘yes’ followed by 42% in Kolkata, 29% in Bangalore and 20% in Delhi. And even while introducing themselves, Mumbai workers accorded highest priority to their domain expertise, professional experience and nature of work -Mumbai(93%) followed by Delhi(90%), Bangalore (68%) and Kolkata (64%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-down-with-wfh-city-say-best-work-happens-in-office/articleshow/82843580.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Pune||‘Don’t call candida-linked infections white fungus’||Pune: White patches (lesions) on patients’ tongues, inner cheeks, and palates are caused by candidosis (also spelled candidiasis) — a benign fungal infection. Terming the condition “white fungus” is incorrect, and the misnomer only creates panic, experts from the national task force on Covid-19 said.The infection (caused by fungus candida) is easily treatable with minor and inexpensive anti-fungal oral tablets. It does not require expensive injections, such liposomal amphotericin B — a key drug of choice in treating mucormycosis, an invasive fungal infection (caused by fungus mucor) currently on the rise mainly in Covid-recovered patients across the country“‘White fungus’ for candidosis or any candida-linked infection is a complete misnomer. Doctors and media should refrain from using such incorrect terms as they only create panic among people,” said infectious disease expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national task force.The term stems from white lesions/patches that candidiasis causes in patients. “A patient with candidosis has white patches or lesions mainly on the tongue, inner cheeks, and palate. Hence, a section of the media is calling it white fungus which is, in fact, incorrect and creates unnecessary panic,” he said.In fact, white fungus is a variety of edible mushrooms (tremella fuciformis) used in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine.Candida is part of normal flora on the skin, the oral gastro-intestinal and genito-urinary tracts in most individuals. “Oral candidosis (thrush) can be seen in any immunocompromised patients. It is benign and can be treated with local application of antifungals, or sometimes, tablets. Candida-associated infections are not very common among Covid patients the way mucormycosis is,” Pujari further said.Treating doctors in Pune have reported sporadic cases of candidosis in the last 30 days. “I diagnosed and treated four-Covid recovered patients with oral candidosis. All of them recovered with minor medication within 15 days. Candidosis is not invasive in nature, unlike mucormycosis. Hence, people should not panic,” said oral and maxillofacial surgeon J B Garde.Garde is involved in the diagnosis and treatment of post-Covid fungal infections at prominent hospitals in Pune, including Ruby Hall Clinic and Poona hospital.Another oral surgeon Prasad Dadhe said, “I have seen only two or three cases of candidosis in Covid patients. Those diagnosed had uncontrolled diabetes. The infection settled with minor medication. Candidosis is not life-threatening, unlike mucormycosis.”In extremely rare cases, candidosis spreads to vital organs including the lungs. “However, we have not seen such among Covid patients so far,” said chest physician Mahavir Modi.Candida in the bloodstream is called candidemia. It is often seen in critically ill patients. “We have registered around 40 cases of candida in the bloodstream in critically ill Covid patients ever since the pandemic broke out in March last year,” said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dont-call-candida-linked-infections-white-fungus/articleshow/82842152.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The teams were assisted by the staff from labour commissioner office and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “All the shops and business establishments that faced action on Friday belonged to non-essential category,” Gupta said. The action was the result of rising complaints against such establishments for rampantly violating the lockdown orders. District collector Chavan said that the business establishments are being sealed for violating the norms. “People carrying out business despite being in non-essential services are a cause of concern for everyone as act as silent spreaders,” he said.

The move does not cover medical and paramedical programmes. The decision was taken at a core committee meeting chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani. The results will be prepared by giving fifty per cent weight to internal evaluations and fifty per cent to performance in the previous semester. “The state government has decided to give merit-based progression to college students keeping in view the Covid-19 situation. It is applicable only for this academic year,” said Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister. Education work at schools and colleges have been severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in Gujarat, according to Chudasama. He said the Covid-19 vaccination programme for those of 18 to 44 years is currently under way and that many young students are yet to be vaccinated. Universities will have to conduct exams for final-semester undergraduate and postgraduate students. “In line with the state government’s decision, we will conduct online exams for final-semester undergraduate students from June 8 to June 15. For postgraduate courses, we will soon announce the exam dates,” said Navin Sheth, vice-chancellor, Gujarat Technological University. Education minister Chudasama said that for colleges and universities which had already conducted practical examinations, their marks will be considered for merit-based progression. Gujarat University had in a circular earlier announced that students in Semesters 2 and 4 of BA, BCom, BSc, BBA and BCA as well as MA, MCom, MSc, BEd and MEd programmes would be given merit-based progression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-exams-for-9-5l-students-only-merit-based-progression/articleshow/82842146.cms||---
---||Delhi||Fewer Covid tests led to more deaths, claims BJP||New Delhi: Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and leader of opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri alongside MPs Gautam Gambhir and Hansraj Hans in a press conference alleged that the AAP-led Delhi government decreased the number of Covid tests when cases started increasing in the second week of April to hide the real numbers. The BJP functionaries further claimed that the fewer number of tests were responsible for high number of Covid deaths in the capital. Gupta claimed that Delhi conducted over 1 lakh tests on April 10, but soon, the capital started witnessing fewer tests. After that, the number of tests declined by almost half and never again touched 1 lakh, Gupta stated, adding that the Delhi high court has also lambasted the AAP government over the issue. “Due to fewer tests and delay in test results, many people became critical even before they were able to get tested, leading to many deaths,” said Gupta. While Bidhuri questioned why mohalla clinics were not used as Covid testing centres, Gambhir claimed that due to fewer testing centres, the available ones saw large queues. Responding to the allegations, AAP government said that BJP has no moral authority to question it after sending crores of vaccines meant for Indians abroad to build their image globally. “This is a frivolous allegation since Delhi has consistently been testing the highest nationally at 4,000 tests per million population, which is four times the national average,” AAP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fewer-covid-tests-led-to-more-deaths-claims-bjp/articleshow/82842189.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

More than 300 children will be enrolled and, after undergoing a medical check-up, 150-155 will be selected for the trial. As per the module, enrolment of children in 12 to 18 age group will be done first, followed by younger ones. Dr Sameer Paltewar, director of Meditrina Institute, said they were proud to be a part of the most important human trials of the Covid vaccine. “This is the first trial in the world of any Covid vaccine that will include children as young as two. Our institute is the only trial site in Maharashtra and central India region. Children under the age of 18 years form a large proportion of population. Children back in classrooms, playgrounds, and at birthday parties are essential elements of normal world,” said Dr Paltewar. Children will be selected in three age groups, each having about 50 participants. They will be divided into Group 1 (12-18yrs), Group 2 (6-12yrs), and group 3 (2-6yrs). They will be administered the same Covaxin that is being used for the adults and the same dose of 0.5ml. The vaccine batches certified by Central Drugs Laboratory in Kasauli will only be used. “The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine among children. Healthy volunteers will receive two doses of Covaxin 28 days apart. Group 1 will receive the first jab,” said Dr Khalatkar. Seven days after first dose for 25 participants in the Group 1, safety data will be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and, based on their recommendation, the study will progress by recruiting the remaining participants. After the completion of recruiting participants in Group 1, the recruitment of participants for Group 2 will begin. The same process will be repeated in Group 2 and recruitment will be done in the last phase for Group 3. The total national sample size is 525. Earlier there were three trial sites across the country. Now, there are four. Other three are AIIMS Patna, Felix Hospital, Noida, and Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-150-children-to-join-covaxins-phase-2-3-paediatric-trials-in-city/articleshow/82842167.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The seven-member family has no roof above their head, yet they are not lamenting. Reason: All seven, including three children, saw death up close. When cyclone Tauktae started roaring into Rajula coast on May 18 night, the Kolis had no inkling about its ferocity. They had witnessed extremely heavy downpour and cyclonic winds and assumed that this too would pass. However, when the winds gusting at 170kmph started uprooting everything around them, they could only see death in front of their eyes. The roof of their mud house suddenly blew away, compounding their horror. As heavy rain began pounding the area, Koli, his three children, wife and parents first packed themselves beneath the bedstead. But water soon started flooding their houseAt around 3am, all seven gushed finally inside a toilet block recently built under the government’s scheme at around 3am. For nearly seven hours, the Koli family remained glued to each other inside this small washroom, which turned out to be a life saviour for them. The family was in such a deep shock seeing Tauktae’s savagery that they refused to open the toilet door even after the storm had subsided in the morning. “The hands and legs of my children had swelled as they were clinging to us for nearly seven hours. It was only around 10am that we gathered courage to open the door,” said Koli, a farm labourer.Koli’s father Naja said “This is the scariest cyclone I have seen in my life. We were a bit scared when winds started blowing hard, but as the speed reduced we got relaxed. Suddenly, the intensity grew so much that all roofs around our house started blowing away.”His mother Devuben added, “We lost all hope and feared that all of us would die. As a last resort, we rushed inside the toilet and bathroom which was constructed with cement. This ultimately saved our lives.” Virbhadra Dabhiya, sarpanch of the village said, “Many families did not shift to shelter homes because they did not anticipate such a ferocious cyclone. We tried to evacuate people in vehicles till 11pm on Monday but after that it was not possible as strong winds started blowing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/toilet-was-lifesaving-refuge-from-tauktae-for-family/articleshow/82837623.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Since then, the number has been on a decline consistently. This went below 7,000 on Friday. Consistent decline in hospitalisation has now become a trend and clearly hints at the wave ebbing at a significant pace.Fearing an increase in hospitalisation in the second week of May, the bed capacity had been increased consistently. The highest was on May 11 when 14,221 beds were available for treatment. But by this time, the number of hospitalisation had gone down to below 10,000.“Many small hospitals have stopped admitting Covid patients. There is a consistent decline in the number of patients and hence the hospitals have reduced the number of beds. Mostly those who have stopped are small hospitals,” said Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel.The makeshift free treatment facility at Yagnapurush Sabha Mandap in the BAPS Campus in Atladara was also stopped during the cyclonic conditions earlier this week. It has not resumed operations and no new patients may be admitted there.An official pointed out that none of the hospitals enlisted for Covid treatment were being dropped as designated hospitals. “They will just stop admitting patients if they want to and their beds will not reflect in the portal too. They will remain on the list and if there is another wave, they can start functioning,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hospitals-stop-coronavirus-treatment-as-numbers-decline/articleshow/82837368.cms||Sachin Sharma

Officials said the fourth proposal is also for supply of Russia’s Sputnik V. BMC has so far got all three proposals, all for Sputnik V. While three proposals are from Indian firms, one is from a company registered in the UK. Officials said they will go through the proposals, and it would be the responsibility of the firms to get all approvals from the Centre. Cost of vaccines hasn’t been revealed yet. BMC last week floated a global EOI to buy 50 lakh vaccines or 1 crore doses to speed up its vaccination drive. The EOI was floated in a record 24 hours after it got the state nod to buy its own vaccines. BMC expects to spend Rs 300 crore to Rs 700 crore on vaccines. “We have received a fourth proposal. All the proposals require more paperwork. So the EOI has been extended by a week till May 25. All four are for Sputnik now. We will establish the link of these companies with the original vaccine manufacturer and scrutinise the proposals,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects).  BMC has invited global manufacturers to supply vaccines in three weeks of placing the order. While companies across the world can supply vaccines, those sharing a border with India can’t. It means Chinese vaccine makers won’t be able to take part in the EOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-gets-4th-offer-to-supply-vax-this-too-from-russia/articleshow/82843637.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Now, black fungus twin strikes Lucknow||LUCKNOW: After mucormycosis or black fungus, another fungal infection has been reported among Covid-19 patients. King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has received four cases of aspergillosis. All patients—three men and a woman—are suffering from severe Covid pneumonia and were on steroids when they caught the infection. These patients were referred to KGMU from hospitals in other districts. Doctors said aspergillosis is similar to black fungus and often inflicts lungs of persons with low immunity caused due to diabetes, cancer, organ transplant or those on prolonged use of steroids and antibiotics. Though aspergillosis is not as rare and deadly as black fungus, it can be fatal if not treated in time. Prof Virendra Atam, head of medicine department at KGMU, said that two-three cases of the infection are received every month. The infection can cause death if not attended properly on time.. “Since Covid-19 lowers immunity by damaging lungs, it makes coronavirus patients vulnerable to aspergillosis. Fever, chest pain, cough, coughing blood and shortness of breath are primary symptoms of this infection. It is treated with antifungal drugs,” he added. Microbiologist Dr Mandeep Sen at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences said, “Aspergillosis grows on decaying vegetation and dead leaves and is found in soil. Its spores can also float in moist air. It grows in the form of small ball-like structures in the lungs and can be seen through an HR CT scan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-black-fungus-twin-strikes-city/articleshow/82843607.cms||Nikhil J Nair
---||Chandigarh||Black fungus: 21 cases in PGI, 20 in Mohali, 6 in Panchkula||PANCHKULA/MOHALI: Panchkula has six cases of mucormycosis, with five of them being referral patients from Delhi-NCR, Haryana, and other neighbouring states, while PGI has 21 cases and Mohali 20, as of Friday. “On Thursday night, six cases were detected in Panchkula. All the patients are under treatment at General Hospital and other private hospitals. One of the patients is a resident of Panchkula district,” said civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, She said proper treatment as per protocol is being given to the patients and tests are being conducted on others as well. Of the 21 patients at PGI’s Covid hospital, nine are from Punjab, seven from Haryana, two each from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and one from Rajasthan. On the other hand, Mohali has 20 cases, said civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur. She said five patients have been operated upon and referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala. She said, “We had only one black fungus case of Mohali resident detected two weeks ago. Now, all the 20 recent cases are referrals from Chandigarh, Delhi-NCR, Haryana and parts of Punjab. They are responding well to treatment.” At the same time, Prof Arunaloke Chakraborti working on the fungal infection since last 30 years in the PGI’s department of microbiology blamed excessive use of steroids, Covid-19 and no blood glucose control in diabetic patients for the “unprecedented” outbreak of mucormycosis. In consultation with his peer group in Europe, he has formed a guideline on its treatment in the absence of liposomal amphotericin B, a drug in shortage. “We are expected to get liposomal amphotericin B soon, but in its absence we can use amphotericin B deoxycholate for 3-6 weeks. In case, the infection is in progressive stage, can use posaconazole injection or isavuconazole injection or itraconazole if amphotericin b is unavailable,” said Chakraborti who has drafted these recommendations under fungal infection study forum. Even while the invasive fungal infection is now a notifiable disease, not all private hospitals have shared their data with the health department. “Those with severe Covid are already immunocompromised and with excessive steroids, things are worsening. This provides a breeding ground for the fungus. We have treated 67 cases in the last 15 days. It is really an explosion of the infection,” said Prof Dr Naresh Panda, head of the department of ENT, PGI. Though there is no difference in the presentation of the case, those with uncontrolled diabetes, Covid and excessive steroid therapies are being commonly hit by the fungal infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/black-fungus-21-cases-in-pgi-20-in-mohali-6-in-pgi/articleshow/82840085.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

She also paid him Rs 17,000 as an advance,” said police.“According to the plan, Meenabai made a call to her brother-in-law, Ashok, and asked him to come to her village.

Many academic experts say the government could have explored option of online exams for these students. “Universities have conducted online exams in the past one year amid the pandemic, so it would not have been difficult for them to hold online exams,” said an academician refusing to be named. Last year, after the UGC asked exams to be conducted only for final semester undergraduate students, the government had announced merit promotions for second, fourth, and sixth semester students. M M Patel, principal, Bhavan’s Science College, said, “If a student has not been able to take the exams in the previous semester, he will be marked absentee in current semester as well where MBP is applicable.” MBP will affect those seeking to go abroad. “Students who get MBP for two years will face challenges if opting for foreign studies,” said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/conduct-online-examinations-mbp-not-a-great-idea-experts/articleshow/82842160.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: FIR against captain claims no distress call made for 8 hours||Mumbai: The Yellow Gate police late on Thursday night filed an FIR against the captain of barge P-305, Rakesh Ballav (52), on the basis of a complaint made by chief engineer Mustafirzur Rahman Shaikh (49) that he had not heeded warnings raised about cyclone Tauktae relayed from May 11. Shaikh’s version states that P-305’s anchor cables had begun breaking from 2 am on Monday, and a number of crew members had jumped into the waters by 10.30 am after all the cables had come off, but no distress call was made from the vessel for close to 8 hours despite the emergency. The barge captain is among 15 crew members still missing. Shaikh said he had asked the captain and barge owner to move the barge to a safer location on May 11. According to the FIR, past midnight (12 am) on Monday, wind speed doubled and there was thunder, and at around 2 am, two anchorage steel cables of the total 8 broke, and the barge was held by the remaining 6. At this point, the captain tried to communicate with tugboat ‘Nove (which moves an accommodation barge) so it could reach the spot and pull the barge to a safer location, but he received a signal that the tugboat was 16 nautical miles (30 km) away. Shaikh, recuperating at Apollo Hospital, Tardeo, told TOI, “Despite all this, Ballav did not send any distress signal. After 2 am, 3 more cables broke and the barge started swinging due to heavy winds. By 8 am, the remaining cables broke (wind speed was 60 to 70 knots), and a 17-tonne container fell from the barge. At 9.45 am, the barge hit the ONGC platform, and there was water ingress.” Shaikh said he, along with 10 others, then jumped into the sea and formed a chain in order to stay afloat. At 10.30 am, 20-25 others dropped life rafts and left the barge. They asked the nearby Neelam Field barge for help and relayed a signal to Navy for help, and the crew noticed some vessels far away, but due to heavy winds, could not reach them. “At 5 pm, all others (of the total 261) had jumped in the sea.” The crew kept screaming through the dark in the early hours for help, and 11, including Shaikh, were rescued at around 10 am by an offshore energy vessel. At around noon, INS Kochi left Mumbai on receiving a distress call, and by 4 pm she was at the spot, doing rescue ops. “We have registered a case and our probe is on,” joint CP Vishwas Nangre Patil said. Ballav and others (still unnamed) have been booked under Sections 34 (common intention), 304 (2) (act done with knowledge it is likely to cause death) and 338 (act endangering life) of IPC. If guilty, the accused will get 10 years in jail. Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP S Chaitanya, said, “Ballav is main accused named in the FIR along with others. Other names will be added.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-against-captain-claims-no-distress-call-made-for-8-hours/articleshow/82845214.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The civic body had declared the amount to the dependants of the deceased staffers. A total of 47 employees lost their lives during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. But only 15 dependants got the financial aid that too only half of the promised amount. The final approval from the general body is pending which is causing a delay in providing the help. PMC officials said the staff members were working at the civic hospitals, ambulances and flu centres.  Around 16,000 people are directly or indirectly working in the mitigation of the pandemic. Along with the PMC employees, workers have been taken on contracts for the effort. PMC in its scheme had also given an option of providing jobs to one of the family members of the deceased. If the job option is sought, the financial aid was reduced. “The staff members are coming in direct contact with patients. As part of their duty, they carried out visits in containment zones too,” an official said. Over 900 teams were formed for the door-to-door survey of positive patients. The teams include health officials, teachers, conservancy staff. “We have given the aid to some beneficiaries. The standing committee has approved the proposal. The future process to complete the formalities of approval from the GB is underway. Once complete, the disbursement of the aid will be carried out,” Shivaji Daundkar, head of PMC’s labour department, said. “We are in favour of giving the financial aid. Steps for the approvals have already been taken,” Ganesh Bidkar, leader of house in PMC, said.

Till April 14, the fuel prices had stabilized and remained constant till May 3. However, for the past 17 days, the fuel prices once again started going north. Since May 4, petrol and diesel prices have increased by Rs 2.62 per litre and Rs 3.27 per litre, respectively. Vijay Thakre, vice-president of the Federation of All Maharashtra Petrol Dealers’ Association (FAMPEDA), said “The fuel prices depend on international crude oil and dollar exchange rates. Moreover, various taxes of the state and central government and the new method of daily rate change by the central government are also the reasons behind the rise in fuel prices.” Kuber Jadhav, a city-based farmer, said, “Farming activities are carried out by tractor-mounted equipment. There has been a huge rise in ploughing and other rates making farming activities more costlier. Hence, the government should provide diesel to farmers at subsidized rates. Transporting cost has also increased excessively because of rise in fuel prices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/at-rs-99-80/l-petrol-at-all-time-high-in-nashik/articleshow/82837817.cms||Tushar Pawar

Of the total 1,926 villages across 15 talukas of the district almost every village has had a Covid positive patient. However, on Friday, the number of Covid-free villages has gone up to 889, with the highest 117 out of 144 villages in Peth taluka. “Except the remote areas of Peth, Surgana, Trimbakeshwar talukas of Nashik district almost every village has had a Covid patient. Some of them have had a higher number of cases. But the number of Covid-free villages have now gone up from 300 to about 900 and this is because the number of new cases has gone down owing to the decline in the number of new cases during the past fortnight,” Dr Kapil Aher, health officer of Nashik zilla parishad, said. In rural areas people faced problems during the second wave in getting themselves tested. While home isolation was allowed for asymptomatic or people with mild symptoms, it was not feasible for those living in small houses and in joint families. “Besides people were also reluctant to move away from their homes to Covid centres . Due to this the ZP had set up centres at schools in the villages where positive patients admitted themselves while they were being treated by a group of doctors and health staff during their isolation,” Aher said. The worst affected talukas like Sinnar, Niphad, Nandgaon and Chandwad also now have good number of Covid-free villages as no active case has been reported there in the past ten days. The situation in Deola is not that good as only eight out of the total of 50 villages are Covid-free. “The spread of infection was high due to which it is taking more time for the villages to get into the category. It should be noted that number of active cases have dropped and they are now scattered. The picture will change in few days,” Aher said. Across the district the tribal talukas have higher number of Covid-free villages. After Peth, Surgana and Trimbakeshwar have 113 and 96 Covid-free villages, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/around-900-covid-free-villages-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/82837829.cms||---

A tie-dye art soon turned into a mean to fill the lives of the underprivileged with colours. Not only did 8-year-old Jahaana Vali discover herself in her new-found passion, but it also opened her eyes to a whole new world, not as privileged or rosy as her own but a world which calls for compassion and empathy. After finishing her online exams, Jahaana was busy finding ways to keep her occupied. Making tie-dye T-shirts caught her creative eye and she started getting good at it. “She would make these T-shirts and gift it to her cousins and other family members. It became a family joke that she might start selling them soon,” says her mother Niharika Chugh Vali.  While Niharika is an entrepreneur and founder of an indoor soft playground for kids, her husband Juzer is into construction. Being conscious of Jahaana’s age, both didn’t want their child to get associated with anything commercial. But they did think of directing her craft towards something good during the tough time. That’s how ‘J’s Colour-Pop Art Shop’ took birth on Instagram, in the second week of April. In just a month’s time, Jahaana managed to finish orders of over 25 T-shirts and 100 hair scrunchies. The entire earnings of these products went to Seva Kitchen, a social organization in the city working in the area of providing nutrition to the underprivileged. As reported by TOI recently, Seva Kitchen has been delivering free-of-cost nutritious food to Covid-hit families. People are placing orders for their relatives staying abroadJahaana’s efforts has helped in raising Rs 18,000 towards 30 Seva Kitchen grocery kits for needy families. “The response we got has been overwhelming. People are placing orders for their relatives staying abroad. We are also receiving orders from complete strangers in Jaipur, Ludhiana and other places. Jahaana is having her hands full,” says Niharika, who ensures that her daughter’s playtime and other routine activities are not compromised. The couple is also making it a point to not let Jahaana gloat over all the appreciation and at the same time not get pessimistic while getting introduced to the world of the deprived. “Jahaana realizes that this is not about her but her craft which is helping those who don’t have what she does. Our children are not exposed to the lives of the underprivileged. We try to shelter them, turn their gaze away from those seeking alms. And then they grow up not knowing anything, turn into adults who don’t care,” says Niharika. Every night before going to bed, Jahaana excitedly plans designs and colours for the next dayWanting a solid building of character for their “sensitively inclined” daughter, Jahaana’s parents are choosing ways they feel works best for her. “We read out articles to her, have conversations which we would never in normal course of life. We just want to let her know that even her small efforts matter to others. But there is no pressure. She is doing something which is enjoyable for her and makes her happy,” adds Niharika. Every night before going to bed, Jahaana excitedly plans designs and colours for the next day. “I am enjoying what I am doing. I like making tie-dye T-shirts more. My T-shirts and hair scrunchies are helping people get their food,” the young voice tells TOI. “God bless you Jahaana, may your tribe increase,” says Khushru Poacha who manages Seva Kitchen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jahaana-8-raises-rs18k-for-grocery-kits-to-needy/articleshow/82842202.cms||Manka Behl

Though the rain amount was not much, the shower was intense and the city recorded incidents of minor tree falling, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said. An IMD official told TOI, “The trough over east Uttar Pradesh and its neighbourhood to coastal Karnataka across east Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and North Interior Karnataka has been causing moisture incursion into parts of Maharashtra. This, along with sunny afternoons, has been causing convective rains. These are pre-monsoon showers.” The official said Konkan Goa and Madhya Maharashtra were likely to get isolated very light to light rain during the next 48 hours. The official added that weather was expected to be dry in other parts of the state, especially regions such as Vidharba and Marathwada. Around May 24-25, Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Aurangabad and Jalna and other areas of the state may again receive very light to light rain and witness thundery activity. In Pune city and the district, there are chances of light rain at isolated places till the next 24 hours, after which rain chances will be reduced. The city may see some rain again from May 25.

Police also seized 1,008 vehicles since May 10.At least 27 checkpoints were set up at places including Elavur, Uthukottai, Sathyavedu, Nagalapuram, Ponpadi, Thiruvalankadu, Sholavaram and Thalavaipattu to monitor e-registration.Police said the drones have become a regular part of policing, as police can’t be everywhere. “In the present lockdown, we are flying drones over places where we suspect violations of the lockdown can occur. We identify those places and ensure that police are deployed and those who violate the lockdown are booked,” said a senior police officer.“It is easier to locate the violator in the drone camera. We can alert the police officer deployed at that particular place and get hold of the violators,” said the officer.Pickets have been set up along main roads and other arterial carriageways, to ensure there is strict vigil. Remote monitoring is also needed to implement the lockdown effectively, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/drones-help-cops-book-1951-lockdown-violators/articleshow/82825265.cms||---

---||Pune||Checking points sought at main entrance of rly stn||Pune: The Pune railway authorities have urged the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to set up antigen testing and RT-PCR report checking points at the main entrance of the station too for the benefit of passengers. At present, the checking facilities are deployed at the second entry of the station at the Raja Bahadur Mill Road. Manoj Jhawar, the public relations officer of the Pune rail division, said, “ Earlier the tests were done for passengers coming from Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Goa and Kerala. Now, it has been extended to all states. This has increased the number of passengers who need to be thermal scanned and tested. So, we have urged PMC to set up checking and testing points at the main entrance too so that passengers have an option of exiting from the main gate.” Around 9,000 passengers arrive at the Pune station every day. “Preliminary discussions with the civic body have revealed that the PMC was planning to do so. PMC staffers are deputed at different places so availability of manpower is also an issue,” another rail official said. Passengers said the move could save them a lot of hassles. “Last month, I travelled from Patna to Pune on the Danapur Express, which reached the station at 9pm. After exiting from the second entry, I couldn’t find any transport for nearly an hour and a half. I tried booking cabs, but they cancelled the ride. There were no autorickshaws. Finally, I got one and he charged me Rs 350 to go to Vimannagar,” Piyush Sinha, a working professional, said. Rail officials said the system was flexible. “If a train, for example, the Danapur Express stops at platform number-1, we request the PMC staff to come to the main gate for testing and screening passengers. The system has been developed to ensure minimum contact between incoming and outgoing passengers,” the official said. Up to 10% passengers carry report Only 9-10% of the total passengers arriving at the Pune station carry a negative RT-PCR report, rail officials said, reiterating that the arriving passengers should carry negative RT-PCR reports to avoid any inconvenience. “With a majority not bringing the RT-PCR negative report, the PMC staff is screening and conducting rapid antigen tests on a large number of passengers,” a PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/checking-points-sought-at-main-entrance-of-rly-stn/articleshow/82842225.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Delhi logs 3,000 new Covid cases, 252 deaths; positivity rate dips below 5% for first time since April 6||NEW DELHI: The positivity rate in the capital dipped below 5% for the first time since April 6, with 3,009 new Covid-19 cases recorded on Friday. This significant dip in the positivity rate comes exactly one month after Delhi saw the peak positivity rate of the present wave — 36.24% — on April 22. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that there was a prominent downward trend in Covid cases. “We have dropped down significantly from 28,000 cases to about 3,000, hence, this is a hopeful sign. The positivity rate is now below 5%,” Jain told reporters. “However, we cannot afford complacency and must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by all means,” he said. In the last 24 hours, 63,190 tests were conducted, including 45,685 RT-PCR tests and 17,505 Rapid Antigen Tests, with a positivity rate of 4.76%. While April 6 was the last time the positivity rate was lower than 5% at 4.93%, Friday’s positivity rate is the lowest since April 4 when 4,033 fresh cases were reported with a positivity rate of 4.64%. This is the fifth day in a row that the daily update has remained below the 5,000-mark. The last time Delhi saw a lesser number of Covid-19 cases in a single day was on April 1 with 2,790 fresh cases and a positivity rate of 3.57%. The number of Covid-19 fatalities remained high at 252, taking the toll to 22,831 and a case fatality rate of 1.62%. The month of May has already seen 6,684 people succumb to the disease, the highest in a single month. The number of patients who recovered from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours is more than double the number of new cases reported in the last 24 hours – 7,288 – and the number of active cases dipped to 35,683, compared with 40,214 on Wednesday. The number of active cases in Delhi has seen a dip of 64.2% from the all-time high of 99,725 reported on April 28. The number of Covid-19 patients recuperating in home isolation is 20,673 at present, while 11,388 are admitted in hospitals. Out of the total 6,849 Covid ICU beds in Delhi, 1,830 were vacant at 9pm on Friday, according to the Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard. This includes 434 vacant ICU beds with ventilator out of a total 2,575.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-dips-below-5-for-first-time-since-april-6/articleshow/82842214.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi: In 3 weeks, turnaround in ICU bed situation||NEW DELHI: Around three weeks ago, the capital witnessed its peak of 1,993 new admissions of Covid-19 patients, the highest in a single day. On Thursday, this figure was down to 560, with the number of patients discharged being a much higher 978. Health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday that with the infection rate in Delhi dipping significantly, not only had the availability of Covid beds increased hugely but even the availability of ICU beds was in a comfortable position. On the first day of May, just 15 of the total 5,051 Covid ICU beds were available and even these were mostly in a children’s hospital. On the same day, only 1,333 of the total 21,428 Covid beds were vacant. While the availability of hospital beds has been improving from the middle of this month as Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate consistently dipped, the ICU beds, particularly those with ventilators, were still hard to find as the number of serious patients didn’t come down quickly. The status, however, started changing this week with new ICU beds being added by Delhi government. On Friday evening, the number of vacant Covid ICU beds was 1,840, out of the total 6,849 ICU beds. This includes 434 vacant Covid ICU beds with ventilators, out of 2,575. “With much fewer Covid-19 cases and the low positivity rate, hospital admissions are also very less. From more than 100 new admissions every day, we are not getting more than 20 to 25 now,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Delhi government’s LNJP Hospital, the capital’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility. He said that during the peak of the current wave, the hospital was getting even 125 to 150 patients daily. The number of patients getting admitted in a severe condition has also come down, he added. The addition of nearly 4,000 ward beds and 1,000 ICU beds by Delhi government, including new treatment facilities next to GTB and LNJP hospitals, has also helped. On Friday evening, the highest number of ICU beds with ventilators — 80 — were available at GTB Hospital, followed by 60 at LNJP Hospital, 59 at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid Hospital, 45 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, 34 at Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, 29 at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, 25 at Safdarjung Hospital, and 22 at Acharya Bhikshu Government Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-3-weeks-turnaround-in-icu-bed-situation/articleshow/82842236.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||Sanitation, antibiotic dose can prevent fungal attack||LUCKNOW: Apart from Covid-19 patients with comorbidities and immunocompromised conditions, others can also acquire fungal infections due to overdose of steroids and antibiotics, lack of proper sanitation and hygiene and low immunity due to old age. Take the example of 88 black fungus or mucormycosis patients in KGMU, of whom 18 are from Lucknow and the rest from other districts of the state. All these patients either have severe lung infection or pneumonia due to Covid-19 or have recently recovered from the disease. They were being treated in various other hospitals and referred to KGMU after contracting black fungus infection. Of the total patients, 49 are diabetic and 25 were on prolonged steroids used to treat infection. However, 39 patients are those who had Covid-19 pneumonia, but neither have comorbidities, but were never on steroids. However, they were given high antibiotic doses. Another common factor in these 39 patients was that either they were above 60 years of age or had a long hospital stay, at least of 15 days. According to doctors, long hospital stay means that a patient is exposed to infections for a longer period. If proper hygiene is not maintained, patients with no comorbidity can also acquire infection. Prof Kauser Usman from KGMU’s medicine department said: “Comorbid patients already have low immunity, which declines further due to Covid-19. The immune system gets compromised when steroids or antibiotics are given. If proper sanitation and hygiene is not maintained, chances of infection increases. Elderly people are also vulnerable. If all these conditions are coupled with weight loss due to low nutritional intake, things become challenging.” Prof Sheetal Verma, a faculty member at microbiology department of KGMU, said besides bad bacteria, antibiotics also kill good bacteria which help in maintaining strong immunity. “It has been found that non-judicious use of drugs and poor hygiene also results in infections. Few fungi grow in 1-3 days while some take 21 days. Fungal infection can be detected through CT scan but the culture of infected tissue provides accurate results,” she said. “In some patients, diabetes is induced by Covid-19, hence hospitals must monitor blood sugar levels of non-diabetic Covid patients as well. Steroids should be given for a shorter duration as per requirement,” said the head of KGMU’s medicine department Prof Virendra Atam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sanitation-antibiotic-dose-can-prevent-fungal-attack/articleshow/82843654.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Chennai||Chromepet residents donate vehicle for use of Covid patients||Chennai: In an effort to make resources available to those affected by Covid, residents in and around Chromepet came together to donate an emergency vehicle, 40 oxygen concentrators and cylinders to the local Covid-19 health centres. Close to 1,200 people have made their way at the two major government Covid hospitals in the city’s southern suburbs – Chromepet Government Hospital and Tambaram TB Hospital – ever since the second week of April. Only severe cases manage to get a ‘108’ ambulance to reach Chengalpattu Medical College Hospital or private hospitals for intensive medical care. Those with mild and moderate infection are unable to get a ‘108’ ambulance and private ambulances cost Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 even for short trips. So residents, most of whom are also activists, from Chrompet rented a van for the next three months and converted it into an emergency vehicle so that mild/moderate patients too can be transported to other hospitals or Covid care centres set up in Tambaram and other neighbouring areas. This would roughly cost Rs 2.25 lakh. S M Govindarajan, president of Patel Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association said, “On May 6, we got a panic call from the GH for oxygen cylinders. Within 24 hours, we crowdfunded Rs 2 lakh to buy 20 new cylinders for the hospital. We did not want this to be a one-time act. So till date we ensure that the cylinders are refilled at Gummidipoondi and made available for patients round the clock.”Besides this, he managed to get the help of Bhoomika Trust to mobilise 20 oxygen concentrators for the GH. These were supposed to assist Chennai Super Kings players but with the IPL on hold, the trust decided to donate it for the benefit of patients at government hospitals, said Govindarajan, also head of Lions Club of Thiruneermalai. “We are trying to mobilise 20 more concentrators from the US and it is expected to reach Chennai in the next two days,” said V Santhanam, another resident-activist from Chromepet helped the GH by donating four steel wheel-chairs worth Rs 50,000 and heavy-duty trolleys to transport cylinders. The group has also procured 100-odd new chairs for patients and their attendants, who wait in queue, before admission. “We hope this will inspire many others to help during this crisis,” Santhanam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chromepet-residents-donate-vehicle-for-use-of-covid-patients/articleshow/82825255.cms||Ram Sundaram

The other talukas of the region where water is being supplied via tankers include Chandwad, Deola, Malegaon, Baglan, Nandgaon, Niphad and Sinnar.Sinnar taluka that required highest number of tankers during the summer for the past four years, but this year it has cut down its dependency due to large number of water conservation methods through Jalyukt Shivar and Paani Foundation being carried out there. The parched regions of Yeola, Nandgaon, Chandwad, Deola, Malegaon and Baglan talukas and hilly regions in Trimbak, Peth, Surgana and Igatpuri talukas are getting water through tankers. The talukas in hilly areas receive very heavy rainfall during monsoon and have large number of water storage dams. But the water runs down the hills to the plains and people living on the top are left without any major arrangement of water storage facility. The administration has deployed 18 tankers for 48 villages in Yeola taluka, seven for 14 villages in Peth, six for 11 villages in Chandwad, five each in Baglan and Surgana and the remaining three for the other five talukas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/51-tankers-supply-drinking-water-to-114-nashik-villages/articleshow/82837844.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||India||SC does not rule out custodial torture, gives bail to YSRCP MP||NEW DELHI: Holding that the possibility of rebel YSRCP MP K R Krishnam Raju having been tortured in custody cannot be ruled out, the Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to the lawmaker who was booked for sedition for allegedly crossing the limits in criticising the chief minister and allegedly inciting hatred among communities on the basis of caste and religion. A vacation bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai, after hearing high-voltage rancorous arguments between Raju and AP government for three hours, granted Raju bail, dealing a setback to the Jagan Mohan Reddy government. Raju had alleged custodial torture by Andhra Police and had sought bail saying he was booked for sedition for merely criticising the CM. The SC had on May 17 directed Raju's examination by a medical board at Army Hospital at Secunderabad in presence of a judicial officer to be nominated by the Telangana HC chief justice. The report of the Army medical board showed undisplaced fracture of second toe of left foot, contusions and edema on the soles of Raju and the bench concluded that possibility of his custodial torture cannot be ruled out. The government medical board in its report on May 16 had said there were no external injuries on Raju. While giving bail to Raju, the SC bench asked him to furnish a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh with two sureties in the like amount before the trial court at Guntur. It barred Raju from going to the media and expressing his opinion on any of the issues related to the present case. "Do not display your injuries to the press," the bench warned after the AP government, through senior advocate Dushaynt Dave, showed video clips to the court of Raju putting his injured foot on the car window while being transported from Guntur to Secunderabad for examination at the Army Hospital. The bench said no purpose would be served by keeping Raju either in police or judicial custody as "charges against the petitioner are not such in which custodial interrogation would be required as all statements attributed to him are already on record and FIR has been lodged after a detailed inquiry by the CID branch of AP police". "Considering the totality of circumstances and also the health of the petitioner, especially the fact that he had undergone heart bypass surgery in December 2020, as also the report of the Army Hospital, Secunderabad, we consider it appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail," the bench said while directing him to fully cooperate with the investigations. Appearing for Raju, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said it is a case of state-sponsored terrorism as the sedition charges were slapped merely because Raju had been a vocal critic of the CM and moved court seeking cancellation of bail granted to the CM in certain cases of corruption. He said the SC should direct a CBI probe into Raju's custodial torture. Rohatgi said at an appropriate time he would move for compensation against the state DGP and ADGP (CID) for custodial torture. Dave read out the purported statements of Raju to the press and said these were nothing but inciting violence and hatred of one community against the other, both on caste and community lines. "The state does not want a law and order situation to emerge during the difficult times posed by Covid pandemic," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-does-not-rule-out-custodial-torture-gives-bail-to-ysrcp-mp/articleshow/82848448.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||‘India’s Floyd moment’: Delhi HC quashes tax on O2 device import||NEW DELHI: Terming it a George Floyd moment for India where citizens say “I can’t breathe” due to scarcity of medical oxygen, Delhi High Court on Friday quashed the 12% tax on oxygen concentrators gifted from abroad for personal use. “This is a George Floyd moment for the citizens of this country. The refrain is I can’t breathe, albeit, in a somewhat different context and setting; although in circumstances, some would say, vastly more horrifying and ghastlier. Chased and riven by the merciless novel coronavirus, the citizenry has been driven to desperation and despair,” a bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh observed. It held that imposition of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on oxygen concentrators imported by individuals as gifts for personal use is unconstitutional. The court observed that scarcity of liquid medical oxygen (LMO), medicines, oxygen concentrators, hospital beds, ventilators, and other medical equipment brought out the best and worst in people. “We have messiahs. We have charlatans. We have hoarders...Brave hearts, there are many; doctors, nurses, and personnel manning public institutions. These are people who are at the forefront of this battle, staking their lives, so that the common man could live; beating this adversary, i.e., the virus is their only goal. There is, thus, in this litigation, no adversary other than the virus,” it noted, invoking the Right to Life in a tax matter—a rare case. Even as government opposed the high court’s intervention, arguing that fixing of a rate on goods is the job of the executive, the court highlighted the extraordinary problems posed by the pandemic. “The fact that enough beds were not available in hospitals, which were required for critical patients, forced other patients to look for sources for supply that provide a viable alternative to LMO. Oxygen concentrators appeared to be that alternative. It is in this context that one would have to take judicial notice of the fact that since the production and supply of the oxygen concentrators did not commensurate with its demand, people looked for resources beyond our borders for supply of oxygen concentrators,” the court underlined. The bench said government should relent, or at least lessen the burden of exactions in the very least, in times of war, famine, floods, epidemics and pandemics “since such an approach allows a person to live a life of dignity which is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution.” As a rider, the court said those importing it will have to give an undertaking to the authorities that the device is being imported for personal use and not commercial use. Friday’s verdict came on the plea of a 85-year-old Covid patient challenging the levy of IGST on a concentrator gifted to him by his nephew from abroad for medical use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-quashes-12-tax-on-import-of-o2-devices-for-personal-use/articleshow/82842260.cms||Abhinav Garg

On Wednesday, when Karanwal went to Bhagtowali village to take stock of the operations at a community health clinic, a group of people surrounded him and told him off for not doing enough. “The respect you get is because of your post, you don’t deserve it. If you were not an MLA, we would thrash you with a wooden bar,” a man can be heard saying to the legislator in a video that has since gone viral. Karanwal had dismissed the incident as a “set-up” planned by his rivals who were eying political gains in the upcoming Uttarakhand assembly elections. On Thursday, Karanwal’s personal secretary Jitendra Kumar filed a complaint with Jhabreda police station, demanding action against those who publicly threatened the MLA. Meanwhile, local farmer groups threatened a “large agitation” if any of the farmers who accosted Karanwal were penalised. “We are totally against of BJP legislators visiting villages, even as farmers’ agitation continues at Delhi borders. If police are working under pressure of the ruling BJP, we will stage an agitation against them,” said Vijay Pal Shastri, district president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU). Police said an investigation in underway and if needed, action will be taken. “Of the total accused, two have been identified and the rest are unknown. We are examining the video. The circle officer is keeping tabs on the inquiry.If the complaint is found to be true, prompt action will be taken without taking into account pressure from farmers’ groups or political leaders,” said Ravindra Kumar, in-charge of Jhabreda police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/days-after-jhabreda-bjp-mla-was-accosted-by-locals-in-viral-video-5-booked/articleshow/82840211.cms||Tapan Susheel

We expect the situation to improve from next week. Once ample doses are available, we will start registration of such beneficiaries on the ‘mi jababdar’ application and shortlist them in accordance with the areas of their residences in the twin towns.”Patil said they would micro-plan the drive to avoid any vaccine wastage. “We will identify the areas, or housing societies, with maximum bedridden citizens and appoint manpower accordingly. There will be a period of observation of the vaccine beneficiaries after the shots are administered,” he said. “In case there are few beneficiaries in a specific area or society, we can make the remaining doses available to citizens from the same society or area for their first or second shots. Necessary directives will be issued soon,” he said.“Vaccines should be available to all. Senior citizens confined to their beds should also stay safe from the contagion. We could be the first civic body in the state to start such an initiative,” Patil said.Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol told TOI that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) would also start door-to-door vaccination for bedridden citizens, inhabitants of old-age homes and for people who cannot visit vaccination centres.“We will deploy at least seven mobile vans across the city for the initiative.

Disturbing scenes of stray dogs fighting for available little food have become a common sight, he said.“Stray dogs and other animals are largely dependent on garbage, leftover foods from restaurants, canteens, market places, and other eateries all of which have been shut down in the wake of complete lockdown since May 10,” the petitioner said. This has resulted in the animals starving without food and water, he added.Due to lack of food, stray dogs have become aggressive towards humans and hence it is necessary to ensure adequate supply of food and water to animals, he said..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/form-panel-to-feed-strays-hc-to-tn/articleshow/82825270.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body receives a couple of such applications each day.This has prompted the KMC to issue a set of guidelines for filing such applications. Currently, there are 13 Covid facilities in the district out of which only one is run by a private trust and the rest are run by the KMC.Nikhil More, deputy municipal commissioner said, “There are strict set of guidelines to set up centres which the NGOs must know. They have to provide the plan of the structure, the list of doctors and nurses to be deployed to treat the patients. Most importantly they have to carry out the structural, fire and electrical audits of the buildings.” Also, he said, in case they plan to place oxygenated beds then, they have to provide us the oxygen audit report which have details of the oxygen required, the source from where the oxygen is to be made available and most importantly emergency plan in place in case sudden oxygen shortage.The NGO’s must have a tie-up with local biomedical waste treatment agency to get the Covid waste collected, transported and processed.Currently, one facility is available in the city that too run by the KMC. However the officials operating the plant requires the details about the daily Covid waste generation to plan the processing accordingly. Already around 1,400 kg of Covid waste is generated in the city that is processed in the plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-flooded-with-requests-to-set-up-covid-facilities/articleshow/82837888.cms||---

City requires an estimated 1,000 quintals of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, out of which only 50 quintals is received. KMC had shared numbers of the local vegetable and fruit sellers for home delivery but those providers are also out of stock. APMC secretary Jaywant Patil said, “Before lockdown a daily supply of two thousand quintals arrived in APMC; half of it would go to the city markets while the remaining half went other parts of district. The average daily turn over has come down from Rs 4-5 crore to almost zero in last five days of the lockdown. The supply will be streamlined only after APMC resumes.” Mohid Bagwan, a vegetable seller from Rinmukteshwar vegetable market said, “We can’t provide home delivery with a very limited stock. We will have to face losses as in this limited supply not even our petrol expenses are met. Therefore we only halt in some chowk and wait for the nearby customers”. One of the residents of Nagala Park said, “I saw one vendor selling vegetables on his two wheeler at Mahaveer college chowk. There was so much rush that I refrained myself from going into the crowd when I had to buy the vegetables.” Sharad Satarkar, a vegetable seller from Laxmipuri who is in the list provided by KMC said, “I sell seasonal fruits and currently I am providing home delivery of mangoes. With APMC market being shut, there’s no fresh arrival. If we try to purchase it from some other place then we have to take it on higher prices which won’t be accepted by customers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shortage-of-veggies-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/82837898.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Nagpur||NMC spent Rs 5.71cr on barricading containment zones last year||Nagpur: In 2020-21, Nagpur Municipal Corporation had spent Rs 5.71 crore for barricading containment zones across the city. This was revealed in a proposal submitted by the civic body’s public works department to the standing committee on Friday. The standing committee headed by Prakash Bhoyar gave nod to the proposal. NMC started barricading containment zones during the tenure of the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe during the first wave to curtail spread of Covid-19. According to the proposal, the highest amount was spent by Mangalwari zone (Rs 1.11 crore) followed by Dharampeth zone (Rs 1.04 crore). Dhantoli spent Rs 98.03 lakh while Nehru Nagar spent Rs 96.54 lakh. They were followed by Ashi Nagar (Rs 79.76 lakh), Hanuman Nagar zone (Rs 37.35 lakh), Laxmi Nagar zone (Rs 26.95 lakh) and Lakadganj (Rs 16.98 lakh). Satranjipura and Gandhibagh zones utilized ward funds for the purpose. The panel also gave nod to the education department’s proposal to procure 1,938 android tablets for the students of Class 10 (1,723 nos.) and 12 (215 nos.) for allowing them to attend online classes. NMC will spend Rs 1.75 crore for the same and will also take Rs 19.35 lakh from the supplier as performance security amount. The standing committee also gave nod to the education department’s proposal to earmark Rs 77.35 lakh for purchasing school stationery including schoolbags, water bottles etc. The amount will be spent only if the schools open in the next academic session, the education department said. The department sought the panel’s nod to shortlist contractors by inviting bids through e-tender process. The standing committee also approved the electric department’s proposal to shortlist lowest bidder for strengthening the firefighting system in NMC-run Indira Gandhi Rugnalay in Gandhi Nagar. Against the NMC’s proposed estimate of Rs 45.79 lakh, the panel gave its nod to finalise a bidder who has agreed to install the firefighting system for Rs 36.48 lakh.

The party’s state convenor, Rahul Mhambre, has demanded that Sawant emulate AAP’s Delhi model and announce compensation for families of Covid victims, small household businesses and those who have lost their livelihood during the pandemic. “The chief minister should follow the AAP model of helping people affected by the virus and extend the facilities to Goans which are already provided by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi,” Mhambre said. The Delhi AAP government has announced a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the family of any person who dies due to Covid-19, free education up to the age of 25 to children below the age of 18 who have been orphaned due to Covid-19 along with a monthly dole of Rs 2,500, a monthly compensation of Rs 2,500 to families where the earning member has died due to Covid. Kejriwal has also announced free ration of 10 kgs to every ration card holder in Delhi for the month of May. “Similar facilities should be provided to Goans. We urge the chief minister to consider the sorry plight of motorcycle pilots, small businesses and vendors and provide some relief to them also,” said Mhambre. Meanwhile, AAP vice-president Pratima Coutinho said that Griha Aadhar payments have been stalled by the state government. Coutinho said that with fuel prices touching Rs 91 per litre, the common man in Goa has added woes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/compensate-families-of-covid-victims-demands-aap/articleshow/82842245.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid shifts wrath towards the young||NEW DELHI: With more than 12,000 people succumbing to Covid-19 in the past two months, the pandemic’s current wave has been the deadliest so far. It has been proving to be more fatal for younger people compared to the previous wave that Delhi has battled. While May has seen 6,684 deaths till Friday and no age-wise break-up is available, the data for April shows that 2,526 or 50% of those who succumbed to Covid-19 were 60 years or above. The fatalities in the 45 to 59-year age bracket were 1,634, 32% of all deaths, and the same among the 18-44 years were 892 or 18% of the total Covid deaths last month.  The fatalities in March were 117 and February saw 57 deaths and, due to the comparatively much lower numbers, the data isn’t sufficient for analysis, sources in Delhi government said. However, January, which witnessed more than 300 deaths, shows that the number of people who succumbed to the disease and were 60 years of age or above was 195 or 62% of all fatalities, while the count for the age group of 45-59 years was 78 or 25% and, for the 18-44 years, was 40 or 13% of all deaths. “We have not seen so many young patients in the earlier wave, when most fatalities were of those with comorbidities like diabetes, heart disease or those on dialysis etc. However, this time, we are getting many young patients who were admitted in serious conditions,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Delhi government’s LNJP Hospital, the capital’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility. “We have seen many younger patients with oxygen saturation levels as low as 40-50% and admitted with a lot of complications. We have also lost young healthcare personnel in our hospital, including three nurses, and the youngest fatality being of a 28-year-old,” he said. “The condition of many young patients deteriorated suddenly. We have seen cases where a young patient’s oxygen saturation level was 93-94% at 10am and suddenly at 11am, it dropped to 20-25%,” Dr. Kumar said. “In the previous wave, we didn’t see such severe cases with oxygen level dipping so fast.” Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said this pattern had been witnessed everywhere globally. The elderly have comparatively weaker immune systems and comorbidities like cardio-vascular diseases, lung problems etc. and get infected in the first wave and develop antibodies, even if for four to five months, he said. When younger people get infected, they have “happy hypoxia”, which means they are unable to feel their oxygen level going down until it goes below a critical level. “Due to more lung capacity and lung volume compared with older people, the ‘compensation’ is happening in younger people till oxygen level dips below critical level and they just collapse. It is the same pattern everywhere,” Dr Kumar said. He said that ultimately, everyone would either get vaccinated or get antibodies after being infected and until that happened, the waves would keep coming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-shifts-wrath-towards-the-young/articleshow/82842247.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It retailed at Rs 91.01 per litre on Friday morning. Petrol, too, hit a record high and was now just 68 paise shy of Rs 100 a litre at the city pumps. Oil marketing company officials said it will touch Rs 100 after just three to four more fuel hikes. Thane and Navi Mumbai fuel prices are more expensive, with petrol being sold at Rs 99.45 and diesel at Rs 91.13 on Friday. Now, 13 districts in Maharashtra have petrol price breaching Rs 100 mark; Parbhani has the highest rate of Rs 101.69 a litre. As many as 20 districts in Maharashtra have now breached Rs 90 mark for diesel and this is a cause of concern for several transporters. Nearly 65% of operational costs of transportation of essential and non-essential goods is on fuel, they said. “Diesel prices have been hiked by over Rs 10 this year alone and the revised price on Friday over Rs 91 is alarming. The cascading impact is putting all-out pressure for freight correction to the tune of 8-10% that will further jack up prices of essential commodities,” said a transporter. — Somit Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-diesel-crosses-rs-91-a-litre-and-petrol-68-paise-short-of-rs-100/articleshow/82845322.cms||Somit Sen

Admitting there were shortages in Covid kits for home-isolated Covid patients, Asnodkar said that there was a sudden rise in positive cases which led to the shortages. He said shortages of ambulances to take Covid patients to hospitals were also faced by citizens. “But our BJP MLAs and party workers have arranged ambulances with their own money to take Covid patients to the hospital. But opposition MLAs like Rohan Khaunte, Vijay Sardesai are criticising the government, when they were themselves part of the same government until recently.

Against the demand of 180 injections, 40 were available with the Red Cross, which got sold out within no time. “Around 10 patients came to us, but we had only 40 injections. For each patient, a three-day dose means 18 injections. We could cater to only six patients,” said executive committee member of the Red Cross Society, Lucknow, Jitendra Singh Chauhan. President of the Association of Otolaryn`gologist of India (AOI), Lucknow chapter, Dr Rakesh Srivastava said six patients getting treatment at SIPS approched the authorities with the hospital’s recommendation and all documents, but were sent back citing shortage. After private hospitals complained about the shortage of the drug in the market following surge in cases, health department on Thursday made a provision of providing doses for three days per patient through the Red Cross Society. For this, a patient’s kin have to submit an application to the divisional commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-word-fails-to-mitigate-black-fungus-drug-shortage/articleshow/82843667.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Nagpur||Vax turnout below 6,000 despite 8L above 45 waiting for 1st dose||Nagpur: Covid-19 vaccination dropped below 6,000 in the district on Friday, despite over 8 lakh people from 45+ age group yet to take the first dose. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has plans to undertake microanalysis to understand reasons behind this decline, and ways to cover remaining eligible population. On Friday, 5,449 healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and 45+ people took the jab in the district. Of these, 3,793 beneficiaries were from 45+ age group taking the first dose. There had been 5,231 vaccinations on Thursday, 5,756 on Wednesday, 7,439 on Tuesday and 9,539 on Monday. As per data of state’s public health department, estimated population of the district is 52,72,665 and around 30% (15,81,800) are expected to be above 45 years. Of these, 7,80,205 (49.32%) people from 45+ age group have taken first dose as on May 21. Thus, 8,01,595 eligible people are remaining for vaccination. NMC and Zilla Parishad (ZP) are running 221 centres, each can easily inoculate 300 in a day. Thus, total capacity of the centres in the district is 66,300. But number of beneficiaries has dropped below 6,000 per day. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had given target of 20,000 inoculations per day. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “District is among top five in the state in vaccination. Still, 50% eligible people are yet to be vaccinated. I have instructed all ten zones to undertake microanalysis of ward-wise vaccination performance. We can target localities and selected sectors where coverage is less after microanalysis.” The civic chief added vaccination performance is less in areas where low income group people are residing and also areas affected by second wave. “We are planning to give a push to vaccination programme in these areas. But these things will get clear and proper once we complete ward-wise microanalysis,” he said. Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre said, “Majority of people from slums are not willing to take vaccine. We had to shift vaccination centres from some slums to other places. The same is the case with people above 70 years. We need to guide these people about advantage of vaccination.” Thakre also said, “Some 3.19 lakh people from the district tested positive in second wave from March till date. They will have to wait for three months as per latest guidelines of the government. Majority of these affected people are from 45+ age group.” NMC has also started two drive-in vaccination centres. The civic body had also launched special vaccination days for women and some sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-turnout-below-6000-despite-8l-above-45-waiting-for-1st-dose/articleshow/82842420.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Chennai||At telecounselling centre, calls about beds and death||Chennai: Professor Gladston Xavier was coaxing colleagues at the Greater Chennai Corporation telecounselling centre to break for lunch on Tuesday afternoon when he got a call. The caller, a middle-aged man, was out on the roads of Mogappair with his neighbour in his car looking for a hospital bed. The woman’s husband had died of Covid-19 recently and the man had found her crying for a long time without getting medical care for herself. “Her oxygen saturation was only 20. I immediately asked him to return home and alerted a divisional medical team,” Xavier said. This is the kind of distress calls the 65-member team of psycho-social volunteers handles at the counselling centre daily, working in three shifts. A majority of the callers in the second wave, the volunteers find, are mentally exhausted and express a sinking feeling about death. “Last year, there was less awareness and more fear. This time, people are aware and have less fear, but they feel helpless and don’t know how to deal with death,” Xavier said. The professor from Loyola college recalls a call a few days ago from a 42-year-old man who said he wanted to take his life and was going to write his will as one of his family members had contracted Covid-19. “When we asked him to talk, he broke down,” he said. An elderly couple, who lived by themselves, called to arrange for a bed, but a probe found their oxygen levels were normal and they were just anxious.On the other hand, the distress calls related to food or from guest workers looking for transport are almost nil. “People have food and are satisfied with the government help of Rs 2,000 and rations. What they ask for is help in finding hospital beds, what to do when they test positive and about vaccination,” Xavier said. For people with Covid-like symptoms calling, the volunteers intimate the corporation’s divisional medical team which reaches the spot in 10 minutes. “We get a return call,” he said. There are 200 such teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/at-telecounselling-centre-calls-about-beds-and-death/articleshow/82825298.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

State Congress president Girish Chodankar and opposition leader Digamber Kamat lauded the efforts of the party’s workers during the pandemic and claimed that the government had failed in its duty. “We have already helped people across the state to register for the vaccines and realised that many citizens needed transport to visit vaccination centres. Therefore, in consultation with our party leadership, the NSUI Goa unit decided to launch this vehicle,” said Naushad Choudhary, North Goa NSUI president. Congress urged the state government to procure and obtain vaccine doses before the third wave arrives. Meanwhile, youth Congress workers offered a helping hand to Covid-19 patients and their relatives by distributing water bottles at the North Goa district hospital, the Goa Medical College, the South Goa district hospital, the sub-district hospital, Ponda, and the ESI hospital, Margao. “Our former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi always worked in the interest of the public and for the welfare of society.

---||Mumbai||No hospital, send me home or I’ll die in jail: Fr Stan Swamy||MUMBAI: Fr Stan Swamy, 84, a jailed undertrial for the last eight months in the Elgar Parishad case, told Bombay high court judges in a video conference that he did not want to be shifted to a hospital and that he would rather await death in prison if he was not released on bail. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade was hearing his plea for medical bail and had sought his appearance via a video link from Taloja jail and a report from a JJ Hospital panel. Fr Swamy told the bench that when he was arrested and taken to prison eight months ago he could walk, bathe and eat by himself, but due to conditions at the jail, his health had gradually deteriorated. He now needs assistance for his daily routine. Swamy said he would prefer to be sent back to his hometown Ranchi to be with friends rather than be shifted to a hospital. “I was brought in healthy, to Taloja jail eight months back but over that period all my body functions have deteriorated. I can’t eat on my own, can't bathe or walk on my own. Though I have been getting medicines it has not helped… I am unable to meet the demand of eating (they serve rotis in jail). Someone has to feed me through a spoon,” Fr Swamy said. The JJ report, based on Swamy’s examination earlier this week, says he does not need hospitalization. The report said Swamy was normal and responsive but had severe hearing loss, unbalanced gait, lower limb problems and general weakness. It also said he required physical assistance in the form of a walking stick or a wheelchair. Keeping his advanced age and condition in mind, the judges were willing to send him to hospital. The bench said to Swamy, “Your general health is deteriorating... do you want to be admitted at JJ hospital…?” He replied, “ No, I do not want to be. I would prefer to die here. I would prefer this (jail) rather than be admitted to the hospital.’’ Swamy said he had been admitted to JJ on two occasions and he did not think it could help him. Swamy said there were “great economic inequalities” when the court asked if he had any complaints regarding the prison. He wished to be sent home, he said. The judges said the court was hearing arguments on the point of hospital admission only and not on interim bail. His counsel Mihir Desai then requested the court if he could speak to Swamy and persuade him to be shifted to another hospital, like Holy Family in Bandra. With Desai seeking time to argue his plea for bail on health grounds, the matter was adjourned to June 7. The HC also permitted Desai to approach the court before that date if the priest agrees by then to being shifted to Holy Family hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-hospital-send-me-home-or-ill-die-in-jail/articleshow/82843674.cms||---

The cleaning of small and high drains, which has to be finished by May 30 before the onset of the monsoon, is going on at a snail’s pace, and only 60% of the task has been completed so far. The city has 24 high drains. Besides, there is a total network of 1,800km of small drains to channel the household sewage. These drains need to be cleaned twice a year. While LMC staff cleans the high drains, private agencies are hired by the civic body for the cleaning of small drains. The cleaning work began on April 6 and so far 14 high drains and 1,000 km of small drains have been completed. To achieve the target by May 30, LMC needs to complete the remaining work in just seven days. However, LMC chief engineer of the rubbish removal department RN Tripathi said, “Cleaning of drains is going as per our plans and will be completed by May 30. We have sufficient funds. About 750 workers, permanent and contractual, have been deputed for the task.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-likely-to-miss-may-30-deadline-on-cleaning-drains/articleshow/82843670.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan high court rejects Asaram’s bail plea for treatment||JODHPUR: In a blow to the plea of rape convict Asaram to get ayurvedic treatment in Haridwar, the high court on Friday rejected his prayer for interim bail and temporary suspension of sentence. The court’s rejection came after perusal of the medical report submitted by AIIMS-Jodhpur. Asaram’s counsel, however, stressed on his disinterest in allopathic treatment of his ailment and sought permission to shift him to his ashram in Jodhpur, where all the medical facilities for his ayurvedic treatment be arranged by his followers. But the court rejected this plea stating that, “This court is cognizant of the fact that whenever, the convict has been taken out from prison even for attending the dates of hearing during trial, his followers would form huge congregations which would create law and order situations and presently, the risk of spread of Covid infection would become imminent”. Alternatively, petitioner’s counsel also prayed to shift him to Ayurveda University in Jodhpur itself, for treatment of his gastrointestinal bleeding and other ailments. But the court turned down this plea also with an observation that there was no certificate/opinion of the doctors of the said University that this specific ailment of Asaram could be treated by Ayurveda. Before this, the court cited the recommendation of the medical board, which stated that the condition of Asaram was stable and fit for discharge but added that he required further investigations and follow up for his gastrointestinal bleeding, the treatment of which was not available with AIIMS. The division bench comprising justice Sandeep Mehta and justice Devendra Kachhawaha, however, directed that district and jail administration to ensure proper treatment to Asaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-rejects-asarams-bail-plea-for-treatment/articleshow/82842269.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sisodia receives feedback on exams||New Delhi: Before a meeting with the Centre on the Class XII Boards and other entrance exams, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday held a meeting with the principals and teachers of Delhi government and private schools. He also took feedback of students on an online session on Instagram. There was a consensus that the Board exam should be cancelled. “The consensus that emerged from all the meetings was that, in the absence of vaccines to children, conducting any kind of examinations will only make both the students and the teachers vulnerable to the virus. The teachers and principals said the appropriate decision would be to completely cancel the Board exams. Looking at the severity of the second wave, they added the exam centres may turn into super spreaders,” said Sisodia. At the meeting, the teachers and principals also stressed on the importance of vaccinating students as soon as possible. “The education fraternity recommended that a Class XII promotional policy, similar to the Class X, be initiated. The final grades should be awarded based on unit tests, practical examinations, general tests and pre-board exams already conducted in February-March 2021. In addition, teachers and students also suggested that the ‘historical reference’ of students’ performance — their past grades, projects, activities — be considered for the final evaluation. Options of taking exam be exercised by only those who are willing to take it,” Sisodia said. The principals and teachers also requested the board trust the teachers and consider their suggestions for alternate examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-receives-feedback-on-exams/articleshow/82867218.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||‘To save jobs of seafarers, allot vaccines to MPT, begin jabs’||PANAJI: While other states have given seafarers priority for vaccinations, the Goa government continues to show lack of foresight and pro-activeness, said the Goan Seamen Association of India (GSAI) here on Friday. GSAI said the government’s failure to allocate vaccines for seafarers has put their jobs in jeopardy. With global shipping firms showing a preference for vaccinated crew members, any delay will lead to a loss of jobs, GSAI said. On May 7, the Union ministry for shipping, port & waterways directed all 11 major ports, including Mormugao Port Trust, to set up vaccination centres for seafarers. “It appears that our government has put Goan seafarers out of sight and out of mind,” said GSAI president Frank Viegas. “The government has put Goan seafarers and their jobs in complete crisis.” Viegas said that vaccines have not been allotted to MPT while ports at Mumbai, Cochin and Chennai have already commenced vaccinating seafarers from their respective states. “Our government and authorities need to understand that it is seafarers and the merchant ships which are the second line of defence and also keep the national economy and global economy running. Without vaccination, our seafarers are facing problems of job loss and loss of income as many companies around the world are asking for vaccinated seafarers in the interest of crew safety,” Viegas said. GSAI has requested the state to urgently release vaccine doses to MPT and to at least prioritise seafarers above 45 years and those who have already taken one dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-save-jobs-of-seafarers-allot-vaccines-to-mpt-begin-jabs/articleshow/82842267.cms||---
---||Goa||GFP slams govt for permitting outsiders for vaccines, says prioritise Goans first||Panaji: Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai has slammed the government’s decision to permit individuals from other states to book their vaccinations in Goa while locals are denied slots. Questioning the state’s vaccination policy, Sardesai said that it is the government’s primary responsibility to vaccinate the residents before “rolling out the red carpet” for residents of other states. Sardesai demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane need to explain what the state’s policy for vaccination is. “The government is habitually inclined to neglect and disregard Goa and Goans. They should be vaccinated first, without any question.” The Fatorda MLA also said that health secretary Ravi Dhawan should be removed and appointed as the tourism secretary if he is keen on promoting vaccine tourism. Sardesai said that he was appalled by Dhawan’s “so what” response when questioned about outsiders booking vaccination slots in Goa. He also questioned the logic of using local taxpayer’s money to purchase vaccines through a global tender if non-Goans were going to get a jab. “The government should stop thinking that Goa is a soft pushover state and that the government can do what it wants when it wants,” Sardesai said. Sardesai said that there is a “complete lack of ideas” within the government which is “full of ignorance” and cannot find a way to get Goa back on track. “Goans are not opposed to helping others or welcoming tourists, but at this point, we need to take care of our own house first,” Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-slams-govt-for-permitting-outsiders-for-vaccines-says-prioritise-goans-first/articleshow/82842264.cms||---
---||Delhi||A formula to fix pricing of oxygen concentrators by next week: Centre||New Delhi: The Centre has informed Delhi High Court that it will be ready with a formula to fix pricing of oxygen concentrators by next week. Instead of an across the board fixed MRP, the court has advised the government to come up with a formula that fixes category-wise price of concentrators. Appearing before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, standing counsel Keertiman Singh informed that a meeting was held by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) with industry stakeholders on Wednesday. In its affidavit the Centre assured the court that it has started the “process for fixing the formula for pricing of oxygen concentrators keeping in mind the observations of the court. This formula will be fixed after due consultation with the manufacturers/importers and other stakeholders.” Earlier this week, the court had asked the Centre why it can’t fix a formula to determine the MRP of oxygen concentrators which are in demand for Covid-19 treatment as people were being charged exorbitantly. “We are not asking the government to fix a price in rupee or paisa, but to fix a principle on which oxygen concentrators will be charged as per each category. If this is not an extra ordinary circumstance where government should intervene, then what will be?” the court had said, underlining that there has to be a cap on the price of the product. “There has to be some limit to it. It cannot be limitless. Tomorrow some Chinese manufacturer will say he will sell it at 5X rate, it cannot be allowed…As a government, it is your responsibility that people are actually able to afford the product and not have to pay through their nose. They can’t be taken for a ride,” the court had wondered, making it clear that the government fix a formula to determine the price. It had said the Centre can’t claim the demand is more and supply is less and everything is in flux so it can’t do anything. “This is not an answer. You have to fix it,” it said and suggested of fixing a formula like landed price of the product plus duty charge (GST) plus 15% profit margin. It is hearing a plea relating to fixation of price of oxygen concentrators by Delhi resident Manisha Chauhan who has also sought appointment of special public prosecutors for dealing with such cases before the special fast track courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-formula-to-fix-pricing-of-oxygen-concentrators-by-next-week-centre/articleshow/82842270.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Patna||1999 Senari massacre: Patna high court acquits 11 on death row||PATNA: In two separate judgments, the Patna high court on Friday acquitted 14 people convicted in the 21-year-old infamous Senari massacre citing "poor and contradictory evidence" against them. Setting aside the lower court's verdict, the HC observed that the incident took place on a dark Amavasya night. There was no evidence to show that the extremists used big torches and neither did the police seize any other source of light to establish the deposition of prosecution witnesses, who identified the convicts. Altogether 34 upper caste men were allegedly dragged out of their homes by the armed members of the now-defunct Maoist group MCC. They were taken to Thakurbari of Senari village under Karpi police station in the Jehanabad district (now in Arwal) on the night of March 18, 1999, by the alleged attackers in police uniform. According to the police reports, they were lined up with their hands and legs tied after which their throats and abdomen were slit open with sharp weapons one after another. After nearly 17 years, a trial court of ADJ-III in Jehanabad had held 16 accused guilty and sentenced 11 of them to the death penalty and life imprisonment to the rest three in two separate judgments delivered on November 15 and November 18, 2016. Two convicts are still evading arrest. Charges were framed against 45 accused but 38 faced trial. None of the convicts namely Dukhan Ram Kahar, Bachesh Kumar Singh, Budhan Yadav, Gopal Sao, Butai Yadav, Satyendra Das, Lalan Pasi, Dwarik Paswan, Kariman Paswan, Gorai Paswan, Uma Paswan, sentenced to the death penalty and Mungeshwar Yadav, Vinay Paswan and Arvind Paswan sentenced life imprisonment, were named in the FIR. The division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Singh and Justice Arvind Srivastava, while allowing the criminal appeals of the convicts challenging the judgment and the sentencing of the lower court on Friday, observed that the conviction in a criminal trial is required to be certain and not doubtful. “The burden of proof of guilt of an accused is upon the prosecution. It must stand by itself. In the present case, on appreciation of evidence adduced during the trial, I find that there is real and reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the persons,” the judgment dictated by Justice Singh and agreed by Justice Srivastava read. The high court also found that there is nothing on record that one of the death convicts, Dukhan Ram Kahar, whose conviction was based on court dock identification by prosecution witnesses after 15 years of the incident, was known to them before the incident. The high court observed that the accused were subjected to seven standard and identical questions by the trial court even though the witnesses against them are disparate. “While some accused have been identified by some witnesses, the others have been identified by a single witness. No question was put to them regarding identification by different persons and the places in the village in which they were claimed to be identified,” the court observed. The bench relied on the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in four different cases to observe that material not provided to the accused persons can’t be taken into consideration for convicting them. Senior counsels Krishna Prasad Singh, Surendra Singh, Ansul and Sanjay Kumar appeared for the appellant convicts, Surya Nilambari was appointed amicus curiae while additional advocate general Yogendra Prasad Sinha and other APPs appeared for the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/11-on-death-row-acquitted-of-senari-killings-of-34-people/articleshow/82842524.cms||Debashish Karmakar

At least 20 students have written to the controller of examination, Lucknow University, complaining that their theory marks were reduced in the revised results declared by the university. On April 27, LU had declared the results of BA (Economics Hons) without adding internal assessment marks. After students lodged a complaint, the examination department revised the result blaming the department head responsible for the discrepancy. The university declared the revised results on May 19 after which some students demanded corrections again claiming that their marks in theoretical papers were not correct. “Earlier, I was awarded 40 marks out of 70 in theory paper of ‘History of economics thoughts’. Internal marks was missing at that time. When the revised result was declared, internal marks were added but my total in theoretical subject was reduced by four marks,” said Vishal Singh, a student of BA (Eco Hons). “In ‘Growth and development’ paper, my marks were reduced from 40 to 38. I thought it was only in my case but many of my classmates had similar complaints,” he said. LU spokesman Durgesh Srivastava said, “We will look into the matter and corrections will be made, if required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-goof-up-discrepancies-again-mar-lus-revised-results/articleshow/82843679.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to start antigen tests at all community, primary healthcare centres||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand will start rapid antigen tests at all government community and primary healthcare centres (CHCs and PHCs) across the state, aiming to make testing accessible in remote hill districts, which have seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths in the last two months. An order making this mandatory was issued by secretary (in-charge), health, Dr Pankaj Pandey on Friday. Director of medical education and health, Uttarakhand, Dr SK Gupta, said that there are 79 CHCs and 578 PHCs across the state currently and barring some, most of these have Covid-19 testing facilities. “We also have 494 mobile teams to collect samples from remote areas,” added Dr Gupta. “The facility should be made available at the earliest in all the CHCs and PHCs where it’s not happening currently,” said Dr Pandey. Anoop Nautiyal, a social activist who is tracking the Covid-19 situation in the state, said, “With large number of patients in home isolation in state’s rural areas, it is critical to see if these patients fulfil the isolation guidelines issued by the centre and ICMR. Also, so many patients staying at home does not bode well, as they will not get proper medical care and that might increase mortalities.” While testing is the first step to arrest the rising number of Covid cases, healthcare infrastructure is also in a shambles in the hills. As per the data of Panchayati Raj Department, there were 15,981 active Covid-19 cases in rural areas on May 18, out of which 14,851 (93%) were in home isolation and only 1,008 (6%) patients were hospitalized. Among the nine hill districts of Uttarakhand, Pauri, Tehri, Almora and Rudraprayag are the worst affected. These five have recorded positivity rates above 20% almost every day in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-start-antigen-tests-at-all-community-primary-healthcare-centres/articleshow/82840228.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Mumbai||10 months after AI Exp crash, relief to kin of pilot stuck in bureaucratic maze||New Delhi: The family of Captain Deepak Sathe — one of the two pilots who lost their lives when Air India Express Dubai-Kozhikode flight crash-landed at its destination on August 7, 2020, — has complained of not receiving the compensation given to victims of that accident. While Air India has released the compensation last year itself, the pilot’s family is yet to get the same from Maharashtra labour authorities. The amount of compensation that the family is to receive from AI and insurance is not being disclosed for security reasons. “I lost my father, Captain Deepak Sathe, in the crash of Air India Express IX 1344. Ten months later, individuals in employee compensation commissioner office (Mumbai, BKC) are misguiding and setting up hoops for my mother in the middle of a pandemic,” Dhananjay Sathe tweeted on Thursday. Sources say AI Express gave the first tranche of the compensation to the pilot’s widow last September. The second tranche of compensation from AI was deposited with Kerala state authorities on December 1.  “At the request of the family, that money was transferred to authorities in Mumbai so that they could get it there itself without coming to Kerala,” said sources. “The pilot’s parents are alive. His father reportedly exonerated any claims from the compensation amount on both his and his wife’s behalf. Maharashtra authorities perhaps wanted a separate exoneration letter from the pilot’s mother. This may have caused the delay,” said sources. Maharashtra labour commissioner responded to the pilot’s son’s tweet on Friday, saying “compensation commissioner, Palakkad (Kerala) has transferred the claim amount to compensation commissioner (Labour Court), Maharashtra on March 3, 2021. Labour commissioner, Maharashtra, has (a deputy) to assist Mrs Sathe in filing the claim application before the compensation commissioner (Labour Court), Mumbai, as part of mandatory procedure. There will be no hassle and labour commissionerate will assist Mrs Sathe and family.” On Friday, the Union aviation ministry tweeted that secretary P S Kharola “has contacted chief secretary, Maharashtra, over the issue of employee compensation of Late Captain Dipak Sathe ji... The office of Labour Commissioner, Maharashtra, will also extend all possible help in this matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/10-months-after-ai-exp-crash-relief-to-kin-of-pilot-stuck-in-bureaucratic-maze/articleshow/82845408.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The family, from Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun district, made a living by mining in Sharda and had built a makeshift hut for themselves on its banks. However, incessant rainfall caused the river to swell and water surrounded the hut from all sides, leaving the family trapped. They sent out a distress call to Tanakpur Police on Wednesday night and managed to take shelter in a truck that they found parked nearby. “It rained heavily for two days and our hut was surrounded by water. We would have been washed away had we not found a tractor and taken shelter in it. We spent the entire night, around 10 hours in the tractor, waiting for help. As the water level continued to increase, we had lost all hope of life. Luckily, police arrived on Thursday morning,” said Ranjeet Kasyap, who was rescued along with his wife, five daughters and two sons. Tanakpur station house officer (SHO) Jasveer Singh Chauhan said, “Tanakpur Police, along with Water Police personnel and firefighters, started the rescue operation late on Wednesday night but the swollen river and heavy rain made it impossible for us to reach the family. In the morning, a motorboat reached the family and rescued all nine members.” On Friday, the family was sent to a safe place. Around 300 workers living near Sharda river were shifted to Panchmukhi Dharamshala at Tanakpur, where food and other facilities were made available to them, said Tanakpur sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Kafaltiya. “Some days ago, the administration had arranged a medical camp for the workers and another one will be held on Saturday, and we will conduct Covid-19 tests this time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/family-trapped-overnight-for-days-on-banks-of-sharda-river-rescued-in-10-hour-op/articleshow/82840251.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Delhi||Beds have to be kept aside for VIPs like PM and President, says HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday said beds had to be reserved in hospitals for VIPs such as the Prime Minister and the President. “We can understand if there are some beds which are not used, there will be such a situation. If the Prime Minister of India or the President needs treatment, you have to keep a bed reserved for him in a hospital. That category has to be there. You can’t say no,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh pointed out while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) calling for a centralised and transparent system to help Covid-19 patients locate a bed in hospitals as they follow a “VIP culture” in allocating beds. The bench said it had already passed various orders in Covid-19 related matters, including directions to the hospitals to provide data on availability and occupancy of beds. No further order is needed, it said, clubbing the plea with the main Covid-related hearing on Monday. The PIL, filed earlier this month, argued that in the present situation of health emergency, “there should be some mechanism to ensure that allocation of beds to Covid-19 patients in the hospitals is not arbitrary and unreasonable”. The high court had earlier issued notice and sought Delhi government’s stand on the petition. It noted that orders had been also passed where the court was trying to cap charges of hospitals. On helpdesks at hospitals, the court said receptions already had them.

According to Agarwal, the plants will come up in Barmer state medical college, Kuchaman city in Nagore, Nawalgarh in Jhunjhunu and Sujangarh in Churu. Agarwal said the five generation plants would require an investment of Rs 3.55 crore, besides GST and work orders have already been given. “The setting up of the plants will start soon,” added Agarwal. While the current requirement of oxygen has fallen due to the decline in case load, the government is strengthening the oxygen infrastructure keeping in view a possible third wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hrrl-to-set-up-5-o2-plants-in-raj/articleshow/82842347.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||If we shut borders earlier, essentials would take hit: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant hit out at Goa Forward Party (GFP) president saying Sardesai “has no work to do”, as the GFP chief continued criticising the state government over “mismanagement of Covid in the state”. “Sardesai has no work to do. I have shown his actual Goemkarponn. I am running the government and I have to take decisions considering all the aspects,” Sawant said. He also said that if the state had closed its borders then “...we would have not been able to get essential commodities like rice, vegetables, grocery, medicine, oxygen etc.” The chief minister said that he has to follow guidelines issued by the government of India, adding that the state is not “separated from the country”. Sawant also said that he still gets calls from people who have got stuck in other states because they have not got their RT-PCR negative certificate to enter Goa. The high court had dismissed the state’s application to do away with a RT-PCR negative certificate to enter Goa. Around 5,000 people come to Goa to work in the pharma sector and if they stop, how would the pharma industry work in the state, he said, adding that it is difficult to get a daily RT-PCR negative certificate for those who have to enter Goa for work. Reacting to the state government application for relaxation of the negative testing requirement for entering the state, Sardesai had tweeted, “The high court once again comes to our rescue. A government that repeatedly mocks medical advice, hard data, people’s opinion and plain common sense has lost control not only over the #COVID19 situation in #Goa but also of its sanity. @DrPramodPSawant’s @GovtofGoa is not fit.” Sardesai had also tweeted, “When will @DrPramodPSawant realise that #Goan health safety comes first? How much further is he willing to embarrass & shame #Goa? Why is the @goacm so adamant on no -ve certificates? ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-we-shut-borders-earlier-essentials-would-take-hit-cm/articleshow/82842312.cms||---
---||India||India takes step toward ‘star rating’ of tyres in the country||NEW DELHI/ CHENNAI: The government has kicked off the process to bring a new regime for tyres used in cars, mini bus and heavy vehicles to improve fuel efficiency, safety and for reduction of noise caused due to rolling sound emission. The road transport ministry has proposed mandatory compliance of new norms for tyre manufacturers and importers, which would kick in from October this year. These mandatory norms for rolling resistance (fuel efficiency), wet grip (performance of braking on wet stretches) and rolling sound emissions proposed by the road transport ministry will pave the way for “star rating” or “labeling” of tyres in the country in the near future. This would bring tyres manufactured and sold in India at par with the European standards and the customers can make informed decisions. The new specifications would be rolled out in two phases - all new models of tyres manufactured from October 2021 would have to meet this requirement and this will kick in for fresh manufacturing of existing models of tyres from October 2022. “Labeling of tyres will be the next step. First we want to implement the mandatory compliance of standards for vehicle’s fuel efficiency and safety. Most of the tyre manufacturers in India have global presence and they are complying with the best norms in European countries. So, it won’t be an issue at all,” said an official. In European countries, labeling norms have been in force. According to major tyre companies, two of these three parameters are easy to label. But the wet grip testing infrastructure is still not up and running. Said V K Misra, director-technical, JK Tyre, "This notification is regarding the labelling process which was initiated by BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency). The tyres will also be marked with star ratings as done for white goods. When it comes to rolling resistance (for fuel efficiency) all tyre companies are capable of doing this. When it comes to wet grip (safety requirement), this is still under final commissioning and calibration is currently being done. When it comes to pass by noise, this too can be done. But unless wet grip testing becomes available with 2-3 agencies testing a large variety of tyres, it is not possible and rating cannot be done in isolation. The tyre industry is involved in setting up the norm but till wet grip testing becomes available this cannot be agreed on. We plan to send in industry comments on the draft." Tyre companies also say that Indian tyres being exported to markets like Europe and UK for example are already complying with similar rules. Said Satish Sharma, president, Apollo Tyres: "We sell tyres with labels when we export to developed markets like US and Europe and we are compliant with the specifications in those markets. These rules are meant for educated buyers to make an educated purchase. In the domestic market the testing infrastructure needs to be in place." Welcoming the draft notification, S P Singh of Delhi-based think tank on transport issues, said, “This is a move towards consumer safety, fixing the accountability of importers and for fuel efficiency.” He added though the mandatory marking of BIS benchmark quality for tyres is in vogue under Tyre Quality Control Order, it has not achieved the real objective of fixing the liability and accountability of tyre makers on failures and consequent mandatory recall mechanism at par with global regulations as enforced in the US, EU, China, South Korea, Japan and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-takes-step-toward-star-rating-of-tyres-in-the-country/articleshow/82848468.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh makes black fungus ‘notifiable’ to check spread||LUCKNOW: Alarmed over the black fungus threat, the UP government declared it as a notifiable disease on Friday. With this, all districts will have to alert the Integrated Disease Surveillance Unit of the state health department about every black fungus case and death. Over 170 cases have been reported in UP so far. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said, “A recently appointed expert panel of doctors has issued guidelines on how to handle such cases. The panel has issued directions on how active cases of Covid-19 should be treated and what precautions should be taken so that they do not develop this complication. Guidelines have also been issued on the possible treatment in case a persons contracts black fungus.These guidelines have been sent to all hospitals,” Sehgal said, adding that a virtual conference had been held with doctors to discuss this issue. The CM has said that medicines for mucormycosis should be made available in the state and the health department has been directed to make special efforts to increase its availability. Besides coordinating with the Centre, it has also been asked to contact the drug manufacturing companies and source the necessary medicines directly from them. Yogi also instructed the expert committee on Covid-19 to come up with a revised treatment protocol which integrates new medicines to limit the chance of this secondary infection. On Thursday, the Union health ministry had asked the states and Union territories to make black fungus a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, stating that it was leading to prolonged morbidity and mortality amongst Covid patients. "You are requested to make mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, wherein all government and private health facilities, medical colleges will follow guidelines for screening, diagnosis, management of mucormycosis,” stated the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) advisory on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-makes-black-fungus-notifiable-to-check-spread/articleshow/82843738.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Goa||Goa govt forms task force to prepare for third wave||PANAJI: The state government has formed a 15-member special task force under the chairmanship of chief minister Pramod Sawant to prepare for the third Covid wave. Health minister Vishwajit Rane will be the vice-chairman of the task force that will have both private and government doctors onboard. Sawant said that, as part of the preparations, a 60-bed paediatric ICU will be established at the super-specialty hospital at Bambolim, intensive care units in private as well as government hospitals will be upgraded, and a global tender will be floated to purchase vaccines to meet the state’s requirement. Besides the task force, an expert committee headed by Goa Medical College dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar will review the second and third waves and accordingly advise the state government, the chief minister said. Sawant said that both committees will consist of paediatricians. “It appears that the third Covid wave will hit children, therefore private and GMC paediatricians have been involved in the committees. We will also upgrade infrastructure,” he said, while adding that counsellors too, should be roped in for the third wave. On the subject of people from the neighbouring states booking their vaccine slots in Goa, Sawant said that the booking is with the central government. “We have raised the issue with the Union government. Other states are facing a similar issue,” he said, adding that states cannot ban those from outside their state from booking a vaccine slot. The chief minister said that Goa has asked for excess vaccines and that when the doses are received the drive will become a walk-in one. The state is concerned about the people and we will make vaccines available for them, he said. “We have told the central government that because of people from other states booking their vaccine shots in Goa it has become difficult for Goans to get their vaccine,” Sawant said. About shortage of manpower in hospitals, he said that people are being hired on a regular basis. Later in the day, Sawant held the first meeting of the task force. He said that he has asked doctors to give their requirements within eight days and that the state will be prepared with the equipment and infrastructure for the third wave in a month’s time. A total of 120 paediatrician will be trained, Sawant added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-forms-task-force-to-prepare-for-third-wave/articleshow/82842344.cms||---

In a public notice issued by NDMC, submitting service tax on the licensing fees since June 2007 has been made mandatory. “This is to inform that the licence fee collected by the estate department of NDMC is chargeable to service tax from June 1, 2007, as per the central government notification and the NDMC decision after passing of resolution in August 2020. The service tax is chargeable from June 1, 2007 to June 30, 2017,” stated the notice. It added, “The demand notices for the outstanding service tax have been sent to all licensees concerned.” Traders argued that the service tax for 10 years would run into lakhs even for a small shop. “The service charge for a shop, which has monthly rent of Rs 50,000, will go up to Rs 3.5 lakh. I don’t think people are in a position to even pay salaries or run household expenses in this crisis,” Baljeet Kohli, president of Palika Bazar Traders’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmcs-move-on-service-tax-irks-traders/articleshow/82867275.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||Now, RT-PCR -ve report must for flyers, rail passengers from other states||Nagpur: For the first time in the 14-month-long pandemic, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has made RT-PCR negative report mandatory for flyers and railway passengers entering into the city from other states and Union territories. There are reportedly no such restrictions in remaining 10 districts of Vidarbha. NMC additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Nipane told TOI, “All those flying from other states to city should have RT-PCR negative report, which should not be earlier than 48 hours from an ICMR-approved laboratory. RT-PCR report will be considered from time of swab sample collection. Over 90% of flyers are landing with negative reports. Swab sample of flyers will be collected at the airport at their own cost if they don’t have negative report. NMC has appointed one team at the airport,” he said. Earlier, such guidelines were implemented for flyers coming from only eight states. Nipane said the same guideline has been implemented for railway passengers. “We have engaged five teams at the railway station. Swab sample of all those coming from other states is being collected from Thursday,” he said. However, there will be no monitoring of those coming through roadways. Earlier too, NMC, district administration and police failed to plan and implement a system for those coming through roadways. An official from Nagpur divisional commissionerate said no such guideline has been planned by remaining five districts of the division. Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh also said no such norms have been prepared in five districts of his division. Mumbai and Pune have implemented the same guideline for even interstate flyers. People flying from the city to Mumbai or Pune will require RT-PCR negative report, irrespective of vaccination, as per information released by airline operators. In the city, there are no such restrictions on flyers from other districts of the state. NMC officials said, “Exemption has been granted to officials and public representatives who travelled out of the state for official work and vice-versa. There is no exemption for flyers from other districts landing in the city and they will have to compulsory follow guideline of RT-PCR negative report,” they said. NMC has avoided institutional quarantine and stamping on hand in the latest guidelines. The second wave reportedly started late in other states. Therefore, the authorities here have come up with guidelines to prevent further spike in cases in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-rt-pcr-ve-report-must-for-flyers-rail-passengers-from-other-states/articleshow/82842356.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Police claim this mayhem was a part of a premeditated conspiracy. In all, 16 people, including actor Deep Sidhu, who were arrested have been named in the 3,324-page final report filed on May 17 at Tis Hazari courts complex. The next date of hearing is May 28. The accused have been booked under IPC sections of rioting, attempted murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, attacking on-duty policemen, criminal conspiracy, violent robbery (of service weapons), destruction of evidence, etc. Police had also invoked sections of the Arms Act, Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act in the FIR. Three of the 16 arrested men — Maninder Singh, Khempreet Singh and Jabarjang Singh — are still in judicial custody, while 13 are out on bail. They include Iqbal Singh, Mohinder Singh, Sandeep Singh Sidhu alias Deep Sidhu, Maninder Singh, Jaspreet Singh, Mandeep Singh, Maninder Jeet Singh, Harjot Singh, Akashpreet Singh, Dharminder Singh, Harpreet Singh, Harjeet Singh and Sukhdev Singh. While Delhi Police refused to share details of the chargesheet, sources said the document claimed that a large number of farmers entered Delhi on the pretext of the tractor rally and proceeded towards Red Fort. The protesters allegedly inflicted injuries on over 500 cops, over half of whom remained hospitalised for days. They also hoisted the Sikh religious flag Nishan Sahib atop a minaret. The violence started as early as 8am at Singhu and Ghazipur borders when protesters started breaking barricades and forcing their way out even before the Republic Day celebrations had begun. There was commotion at Tikri border too, and soon the protesters started their rally violating the agreement with police to go on designated routes after 12pm. The protesters from Singhu border allegedly got into a skirmish with cops at Mukarba Chowk after deviating from the rally route and began moving towards Kashmere Gate. By 10am, thousands of tractors managed to enter Delhi, thereby violating the mutually agreed terms and conditions for the rally. ITO also saw spells of clashes. Police used mild force, including tear gas, and snapped internet at many places till the farmers decided to leave in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-planned-conspiracy-at-red-fort/articleshow/82842395.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Mumbai||When will governor decide on MLC nominations: Bombay HC asks state||MUMBAI: The delay by Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari to clear 12 appointments recommended by the state cabinet as members of the legislative council has reached the Bombay high court. The HC on Friday directed that the secretary of the governor be made a party and sought the affidavit by June 9, when the matter will next be heard. The vacation bench also directed the state to file its reply on why it was taking so long when the state had submitted the names as per a cabinet decision on November 6, 2020. The bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Ratan Luth who said that the governor has so far in “breach of his Constitutional obligation” till date not nominated these members. The PIL said that despite two reminders on March 1 and 2, 2021, Koshyari “failed to nominate the 12 persons” for the last six months. Luth’s counsel, Mukul Taly and Gaurav Srivastav, said by failing to act on such nomination, the legislative council as well as the citizens of Maharashtra are deprived of such nominated councillors who have special knowledge and practical experience in fields of literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service. The HC, during the hearing via videoconferencing, finding some substance to hear the PIL on an urgent basis, asked the state to mention in its reply by when would the proposal of the council of ministers be disposed of. It adjourned the matter by two weeks. For the state, lawyers Geeta Shastri and Akshay Shinde submitted that since the council of ministers already tendered their aid and advice to the governor, the petitioner may be directed to make the secretary to the governor a party. Under Article 171 (5) of the Constitution, those nominated to the Upper House shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely — literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service. However, the provision has been used to accommodate political nominees which the governor can object if it is not as per the provisions of the Constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-asks-state-when-will-governor-decide-on-mlc-nominations/articleshow/82843744.cms||---

The issue is related to payment of fees. Around 35 parents signed the letter which was submitted to the police station, in which multiple issues were raised against the school located on Wardha Road. The complaint states that the school stopped online classes after parents were unable to pay pending fee. The letter acknowledges that the school had reduced the fee “to some extent” and demanded payment of pending amount. But due to financial distress brought about due to Covid-19, some parents were unable to clear their dues, the letter added. Parents said they visited the school on Friday, but were not allowed to meet the principal. Parents alleged that results of such students have been blocked by the management and they are unable to login for their online classes as well. One of the parents told TOI that the institute has not formed parents-teachers association as per the guidelines declared by the state government. The complaint goes on to say that on May 1, a letter was issued by the school asking parents to pay up pending fee by May 9. “They have stopped online classes of students and even results have not yet been given to parents. This goes against the order of education department in which it’s clearly mentioned that online classes cannot be stopped,” a parent said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-file-police-complaint-against-school-over-fee-issue/articleshow/82842362.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Long battle stresses out Delhi volunteers||NEW DELHI: As Ankit Gupta set about verifying information and providing help to the Covid-hit in April — when the second wave started to rear its ugly head — he quickly realised that it would be difficult to continue doing it for long because the ordeal was taking a toll on him mentally. Since then, anxiety, depression, insomnia and a general feeling of helplessness have engulfed Gupta and several other volunteers like him, prompting them to go for counselling sessions themselves. Mental health professionals said many volunteers could struggle to get rid of these scars. Gupta, who has been feeding over 2,000 people daily, is a poet who goes by the name "Kisse Kahaniya" on Twitter. On the social media platform, he gets multiple SOSs and requests from Covid patients and their kin for medicines, oxygen, hospital beds, and so on. “Things have been difficult. If we try to help someone and fail, it affects us badly. I am undergoing mental health therapy,” he said. Gupta said he found himself trapped. "Even if we take a short break, we will only think about people whom we were unable to help. I cannot even keep my phone away for an hour as I am sucked into this." Gender rights activist Yogita Bhayana concurred that her phone didn’t stop buzzing. "I had written (on Twitter) that I may not be ‘normal’ again as the trauma people are going through is taking a toll on me too," she said, adding that her sleep pattern was badly affected. Bhayana, however, has found it tough to take time out for counselling. "But I am open to it when things get better. Things were so bad that we hardly had time to eat till a few days ago," she said. The volunteers are also wrecked by a sense of guilt. "Many feel that they could have done more," Bhayana said. Nikita, a law aspirant, said she was unable to sleep and often checks her phone to see if there were any request for help. I feel numb," she added. Snehal Singh, a psychologist who is providing free counselling sessions to Covid volunteers, said there was a widespread feeling of helplessness. "People are being too hard on themselves. There is no self-care, sleep deprivation and appetite loss." Singh said when people went out to help others, they came back with stories that might haunt them forever. "I tell them that their goal is not to help everyone, but to do as much as possible," he added. Bhawna, another volunteer, said she had no medical training. “We took calls from patients’ attendants, trying to figure out what they needed and how we could help them. But due to lack of resources, we often felt helpless and dejected.” She recalled how an attendant once wanted an oxygen bed with dialysis for his mother. “I called up several hospitals and oxygen suppliers, but could come up with nothing. It felt like the worst day of my life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/long-battle-stresses-out-city-volunteers/articleshow/82867308.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Singh accused the Opposition parties of desperately trying to regain lost political ground, because of which they were targeting the ruling government with lies. “Yadav has time and again raised questions about the ongoing vaccination drive and has tried to topple the efficient working of the UP government instead of understanding the pain and suffering of the common people,” Singh said, adding that UP has been the only state to administer 1,58,41,256 doses of Covid vaccines till now, accounting for the maximum number of people being inoculated in any state. He said that phase III of the vaccination drive is also being conducted in a planned and organised manner and 8,52,234 persons in the age group of 18-44 years had been administered doses. Hitting out at Priyanka, Singh said that she had been responsible for spreading lies and termed her strategy as a “shamelessly selfish move”. He said: “Instead of trying to cause obstruction in the working of the government, the Congress should help the common man hit by the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-akhilesh-spreading-lies-bjp/articleshow/82843745.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The two hours’ suspension of work by the resident doctors and interns was also extended to the Covid wards of the hospitals on Friday, which, so far, had been spared by them considering the seriousness infection in the city. The decision of continuing with the protest was taken in a late night meeting of the Resident Doctors’ Association on Thursday after they did not receive any written communique from the government on the assurance by the government in principle to fulfil their demands in the afternoon. President of the association, Rajendra Fageria said that they have been protesting for the past one month and working with black bands around their arms followed by two hours of work suspension as a token of protest. “On Thursday there was a verbal agreement on our demand by the government and we were assured of written assurance by evening. We waited till night but did not receive anything in writing suggesting that the government was not serious. So, we have decided to intensify our agitation”, Fageria said. Among various demands of the resident doctors, major ones include final-year examination of PG Batch 2018 by the end of this month or else all be promoted by granting one-time promotion and promotion of in-service residents to the post of senior residents after completion of three years with three additional increments without any online/offline application. The interns have been demanding a hike in their allowance from Rs 7000 to Rs 24000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-take-out-rally-burn-cms-effigy-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82842367.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

One of these students, Divyanshi of Delhi University’s Satyawati College, has even found a mention in a Mann Ki Baat address of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 19-year-old student is part of the 2nd Delhi Girls Battalion that started with verifying information on oxygen cylinders. It did not stop there and Divyanshi created awareness about plasma donation through her poetry. She has individually helped over 50 families during the second wave and even ensured that it was for free. “I had the feeling that if I am helping one person, I am helping an entire family. Through the contacts I knew, I also collected funds for the families who were in need. I am happy that with the help of people from across the country, I could collect over Rs 4 lakh and help those in need,” said Divyanshi, a second-year BSc student. On being recognised by the PM, Divyanshi said, “It was an incredible and profoundly cherished feeling. PM Modi, an icon of hard work and supreme dedication for the betterment of the nation has mentioned my name, applauded my efforts in fighting Covid-19. I am grateful to him.” An IAS officer, Ajay Kumar, tweeted, “Excellent cadet Divyanshi. You are a role model and a true example of how NCC cadets (put) service above self, nation above everything. Proud of you.” Sarfaraz Ahmed of Jamia Millia Islamia has been helping migrant labourers with ration kits in Bihar. He has also encouraged his friends to come forward and help.

The functionaries also demanded the chief minister to call an all-party meeting to discuss the Covid management in the wake of fears of a third wave. Bidhuri said, though the cases were on a decline, daily deaths continued to remain high. “Kejriwal should immediately convene an all-party meeting, which should include experts and scientists, to discuss the action plan to deal with the third Covid wave,” the BJP functionary said. Bidhuri also claimed that the third wave could target children, so the government should make preparations in advance to safeguard their lives. “It is shocking that Delhi government has not declared black fungus as an epidemic yet even though experts have warned that this could take a turn for the worse. It must make it a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” Bidhuri stated. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said eight other states have declared mucormycosis an epidemic. “It is important to carry out surprise checks for hospital apparatus and to ensure steroids are given only under supervision of senior doctors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/declare-black-fungus-an-epidemic-bjp/articleshow/82867345.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||SP: BJP misleading people over Covid||Lucknow: Taking a jibe at the PM for lauding UP CM for containing the second wave of the pandemic, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the ‘mutual admiration’ is a part of the BJP’s strategy to mislead the people and cover up the shortcomings of a pathetic health infra-structure and increasing count of Covid deaths. “BJP leaves nothing to chance when it comes to chest thumping on false claims merely to mislead the people into believing that everything is alright. The government is in a mode of perpetual denial of the widespread misery among people because of the pandemic and now the menace of black fungus,” he said. “The Prime Minister has coined a new slogan – Jahan bimaar, waheen upchaar (Treatment at people’s doorstep) and has given a certificate of appreciation to himself saying that a lot work has been done in the past 7 years,” the SP chief said in a statement. “If one has to go by the statistics offered by the chief minister, spread of Covid-19 infection, black fungus and vaccination are completely under control despite the fact that lack of health infrastructure in the rural areas and gross mismanagement on the part of the administration has wreaked havoc in villages,” Akhilesh said. “On the vaccination front, UP is lagging behind even when it is compared to states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan,” he said. Akhilesh said despite repeated alerts by experts and doctors of a more severe third wave, where children would be the most vulnerable, the government does not appear to have learnt any lessons and ramp up the vaccination process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-bjp-misleading-people-over-covid/articleshow/82843775.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

According to police, the rescue operation was started immediately to reach the victims. Four bodies were found buried in the debris and one injured worker was rushed to Kullu regional hospital for treatment. Kullu SP Gaurav Singh said, “We received information that the tunnel collapsed at Pancha Nala and six labourers were trapped inside. Rescue teams, police personnel and medical team with ambulances rushed to the spot.” Tunnel collapse: 1 rescued, hospitalisedFour bodies were retrieved from the spot and one injured person was shifted to the hospital, he said, adding: “One another person has been rescued who is completely safe.” Two of the deceased are from Sirmaur district, one from Nepal, and one was a local. The worker who was hospitalised had leg injuries as rocks crushed his leg. The accident happened at about 5.40pm when labourers were doing drilling work in the 600m long diversion tunnel. The whole area, where drilling was underway, collapsed. NHPC is building many hydroelectric projects in the Kullu district and work is still continuing in most even as projects have been commissioned. It is also building the Parbati Hydroelectric Project Stage-II in the region with the proposed power production of 800MW. Work on this mega-hydel project has been going on for many years now.  The project involves digging a 31.52 km-long headrace tunnel to collect water from the Parvati river from Pulga village and its powerhouse will be built at Siund near Sainj. The tunnel has many edit tunnels in between and is believed to be the longest headrace tunnel in India. The Garsa valley is notorious for its fragile land and environment. The region frequently witnesses cloudbursts and flashfloods in the monsoon season. Three workers of HP State Forest Development Corporation Ltd were washed away near Pancha nullah on July 16, 2015. At least 150 labourers working for a hydroelectric project near Garsa were killed by a cloudburst on July16, 2003.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/4-workers-killed-as-nhpc-tunnel-collapses-in-himachal-pradesh/articleshow/82848475.cms||Suresh Sharma

The accused are in-laws of his eldest daughter, who was married off three years back while she is still a minor. The complainant approached the Chittorgarh childline seeking help in getting a police complaint filed under sections of the Pocso Act. After holding a counselling session with the minor, the childline authorities reported the matter to the Chanderiya police station and an FIR was registered under sections 363, 376-D of the IPC and 5,6,16& 17 sections of the Pocso Act. The minor’s father and complainant, a resident of Amravadi in Ahmedabad, hails from Chittorgarh district but currently works and lives in Gujarat. He told the police that he has three daughters, and all are minors. As per the complaint, the man’s second daughter was raped by the 17-year-old brother of her eldest daughter’s husband several times when both the girls had gone to live in Chittorgarh in October 2020. The eldest daughter’s mother-in-law had suffered a paralytic stroke then. The girls were taken back to Ahmedabad in December 2020. One day the second daughter slipped from the stairs and when she was taken to the hospital, the family learnt that she was pregnant. The girl told her parents that her elder sister’s youngest brother-in-law raped her several times during her stay in Chittorgarh. She alleged that the family members forced her to get intimate with the accused and threatened dire consequences if she revealed the truth to anyone. The complainant said that on May 1, his family visited Chittorgarh to attend a marriage function at the eldest daughter’s in-laws’ place. The eldest daughter’s husband abducted the rape survivor. When the complainant asked for his daughter, the in-laws said she would be sent back home after some days. The complainant told the police that the accused and his family members were dangerous and may harm or even kill his daughter. Childline director Bhojraj Singh Padampura said that the complainant did not disclose in the police complaint about the miscarriage but when the minor was counselled, she told them about the pregnancy.

---||Hyderabad||HC junks bank’s plea in hatcheries case||Hyderabad: Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana high court on Thursday refused to entertain an implead petition filed by Canara Bank in the ongoing land tussle between Jamuna Hatcheries belonging to the family members of former minister Eatala Rajender and the state government. While the plea filed by Jamuna Hatcheries sought relief from the intervention of revenue and survey officials in their 59 acres of land in Masaipet mandal in Medak district, the grievance of the Canara Bank was related to the alleged harassment being meted out to its officials by the ACB cops in the same case. The judge said that the bank cannot intervene in the Jamuna Hatcheries case. “You can file an independent petition and avail your legal remedies separately,” the judge said. The bank granted Rs 93 crore loan to Jamuna Hatcheries and is facing questions from the cops. Senior counsel Dipak Bhattacharji, who appeared for Canara Bank, urged the court to allow them to implead the bank in the case filed by Jamuna Hatcheries. “We are facing problems from the cops in the same case and hence the court can hear us in the same case,” he said. The cops from ACB, vigilance along with Medak police are illegally confining the officials of the bank at odd hours, restraining them from leaving the bank. They are also preventing officials from conducting their banking duties. “In addition to this, they are seizing the mobile phones of bank officials and checking the private WhatsApp conversations. We are seeking a direction from this court to the police to follow Covid-19 norms and not to make our officials wait for hours together,” he said. The judge, however, remained unconvinced and said: “ You should have instituted a separate writ petition. We cannot entertain this plea”, he said. At this stage, Manav Gecil Thomas, Canara Bank’s counsel on record, contacted the bank and upon instructions from the bank authorities, informed the court that they are withdrawing the case. The judge dismissed the plea as withdrawn and gave liberty to the bank to avail its legal remedies independently. The main petition filed by Jamuna Hatcheries was earlier posted to July 6. The HC has given interim protection to the kin of the former minister asking the state authorities not to interfere in the land of the former minister’s family without duly notifying them. The court, it can be recalled, also scrapped the preliminary inquiry report of the Medak district collector and asked the state government not to depend on this report for any further action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-junks-banks-plea-in-hatcheries-case/articleshow/82842452.cms||---

The number of AI startups has gone up from 0.68% of the total startups in the country in the year 2000 to 7.50% in 2019, said ‘The AI Index 2021 Annual Report’ by Deepa Mani, Madhumitha Mohan, and Monish K of the Srini Raju Centre for IT and the Networked Economy, ISB. As per the report, in 2019, Karnataka had the maximum number of AI startups at 356, followed by Maharashtra with 215 and 111 in the two Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana. At the other end, the ecosystem in states such as Bihar, Goa, J&K, Jharkhand, Puducherry, and Uttarakhand lacked the presence of any AI startups, it added. AI startup funding also clocked an over 97% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate), from $20 million in 2013 to $233 million in 2019. The percentage share of total funding in AI startups as a part of the total startup ecosystem in India also rose steadily from 0.28% in 2013 to 1.54% in 2019, the report said. Along with startups, there has also been a rapid growth in AI-related job postings across the country in the last few years. However, the AI job postings represented only a small percentage (2% in January 2019 -March 2020) out of the total jobs posted in India, it added. “With the emerging use cases of AI in a vast array of sectors, the challenge remains in generating skilled resources to meet the demand of growing AI-related jobs,” the report said. Deepa Mani, ISB faculty, pointed out that AI has helped Indian businesses to be resilient to the Covid-19 pandemic in the country and helped them redesign their models for tomorrow. The report was launched virtually by Telangana IT and industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan and Microsoft India’s national technology officer Rohini Srivathsa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-startups-jobs-on-rise-in-india-says-isb-study/articleshow/82842469.cms||---

Dwarahat Police have filed a case under sections 384 (Punishment for extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. Police said that the mobile number had been tracked to West Bengal. Negi said Almora SSP Pankaj Bhatt had assured him of quick action in the matter. Negi said the threat calls were part of a political conspiracy, as people had been “trying to discredit him for last two years despite continuous developmental works”. To recall, Negi had been booked for rape and criminal intimidation in September last year after a woman accused him of having raped her and fathered her child. The woman had demanded Rs 5 crore from him as child support but he dismissed the allegations and refused to pay the amount, saying it was an extortion attempt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rape-accused-dwarahat-bjp-mla-mahesh-negi-claims-someone-threatened-attempted-to-extort-rs-60l-from-him/articleshow/82840362.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In a first, Bombay HC allows termination of 24-week triplets pregnancy||MUMBAI: In a first such case, Bombay high court on Friday permitted the medical termination of a 24-week pregnancy with triplets after a J J Hospital panel advised the procedure, saying its continuance will affect the mother’s mental health. A bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade allowed a petition by the 41-year-old woman with a psychiatric issue and her husband to allow MTP of her entire pregnancy as one foetus has anencephaly, where a baby is born without parts of the brain and the skull. Taking note that on May 12, another HC bench had directed a panel to examine her “for the possibility of termination of one foetus only”, the judges on May 17 reconstituted the panel and sought a report on the termination of the “entire” pregnancy. The panel headed by the dean examined the woman on May 18. The panel’s May 20 report said according to her ultrasonography, the first foetus shows anencephaly and is not likely to survive after birth or is likely to survive for a few days. The second foetus has a soft chromosomal marker which suggests it would probably have genetic abnormalities; the chances are very high as the first foetus is anomalous. “Thus the condition of the two foeti fulfils the criteria of ‘substantial risk of serious physical handicap with very high morbidity and occasional mortality’,” it stated. The report said the third foetus is healthy. It also stated psychiatry opinion recommends termination of the whole pregnancy due to the mother’s mental illness, stress of the pregnancy and anomalies in foetuses. Foetal medicine expert Dr Purnima Satoskar advised termination as per the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecogists (London) guidelines pertaining to foeticide prior to termination of pregnancy. “At present, there are no Indian guidelines regarding foeticide prior to termination of healthy or unhealthy foetus,” the report informed. The panel said if HC permits termination, the whole procedure should be done under the direct supervision of Dr Satoskar who has recommended following RCOG guidelines. In their order, the judges noted the couple has a child aged eight and they live with a parent in poverty and are barely able to meet ends.

---||Mumbai||Jail officials must give Bharadwaj med papers in Mumbai: HC||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday directed prison authorities to give all medical records, including test results, to Elgar Parishad accused, former law professor Sudha Bharadwaj on request. The high court said its order on handing over of medical records shall apply to “all prisoners”. Bharadwaj had, through her daughter Maaysha, petitioned the Bombay high court for medical bail and treatment. Her counsel Yug Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy said since she has received medical treatment now pursuant to her petition, the bail plea on medical grounds was not being pressed. But he said that a general order be passed to ensure that prison authorities allow handing over of medical papers and reports to prison inmates rather than one having to approach the court every time they are denied. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the National Investigation Agency, which is investigating the Elgar Parishad case of January 2018, registered in Pune first by the Pune police, where Bharadwaj is one of the accused, alleged to be a Maoist, said a specific order may be passed for her, but not a general one for all prisoners. There are several other orders passed by the high court in public interest litigation to prison authorities, he said. The high court vacation bench of justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade in a video-conference hearing, however, agreed with Chaudhry’s plea that prisoners are also entitled to telephone call with an approved family member after visiting the hospital by following all protocols. “This facility to be made available to all prisoners,’’ said the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jail-officials-must-give-bharadwaj-med-papers-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/82845635.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Goregaon society city’s 1st to hold doorstep vaccination||Mumbai: Goregaon’s Gokhuldham Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Officers Quarters became the first housing society in Mumbai to have doorstep vaccination after tying up with a private covid vaccination centre (PCVC). As many as 400 residents were administered Covaxin shots by doctors and staff from Fortis Hospital on Friday. BMC officials said they were intimated about the private doorstep vaccination and it was done as per the policy issued by the BMC recently. The BMC had recently issued detailed guidelines for vaccination drives to be organised with the help of by PCVC at workplaces and housing societies having sufficient number of willing beneficiaries. “The BMC was intimated, and the vaccination was carried out through the PCVC. This is going to be the way forward as and when vaccine stocks become available. Housing societies and corporates can tie up with PCVCs and get their staff and residents vaccinated,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (Health). As per policy, one PCVC can be linked with one or more workplaces or housing societies, but information about the same will need to be given to the local ward office. Vaccination will be done on a payment basis, and the price per jabwill have to be mutually decided by the PCVC and the respective workplace/housing society. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha who helped the society get connected to Fortis and got clearances from the BMC said that once more vaccines are available, more societies will be able to get doorstep vaccination. “If vaccine stocks are available, then inoculation drive can go very smoothly through doorstep vaccination. The BMC must also set up a model doorstep vaccination centre for societies to adopt, and a help desk must be set up for societies,” Kotecha said. Fortis Hospital said the vaccination went on smoothly. “We had carried out a recce and demo before the vaccination started. We checked the internet connection and the set up well in advance. So when we started it, it went on very smoothly. All the residents were aware and registered on CoWin as per the BMC policy. We got all clearances from them smoothly,” said Rinku Mavani, Business Partner Sales at Fortis Hospital. The BMC guidelines also mention that a nodal officer has to oversee and facilitate all aspects of vaccination at the workplace/housing society, such as registration of beneficiaries and availability of physical and IT infrastructure. It will be mandatory for the beneficiaries to be registered on CoWin app prior to vaccination. RBI spokesperson did not respond to a query from TOI on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-goregaon-society-citys-1st-to-hold-doorstep-vaccination/articleshow/82843886.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bhilwara village learns from past mistakes to check cases||JAIPUR/AJMER: Youngsters wearing a white t-shirt, face covered with mask and shield entering the details of every passerby with scanning body temperatures and sanitising hands may seem like an entry into a corporate office during Covid times. They, however, are youths from Bhilwara’s biggest panchayat Kaliyas trying all they can to restrict the spread of the infection in their village. The panchayat with 6,000 residents has learnt from its mistakes during the first corona wave when it had allowed free movement of people, marriages, festivals and events turning the panchayat into a Covid hotspot. However, during the second wave, the residents have remained successful in keeping the virus at bay. The village recorded 54 Covid cases in the first wave, but had just four positive cases in the second wave till date, while nearby villages are flooded with active cases and are reporting deaths almost every day. The village has reported just one death due to non-Covid reason 27 days ago. “The administration can’t be expected to help every village amd hence a team of 100 youths was formed to help impose strict restrictions to stop the spread of the stronger and more fatal virus,” said Shakti Singh Chundawat, sarpanch of the village, who faced a near-death experience defeating Covid last July. The village youths have been divided into several teams guarding their own check posts, maintaining logbook, door-to-door supply of medicines by Asha Sahyoginis and imposing penalties for violation of corona protocol since April 24. They follow common protocol for death by allowing only four people to cremate and bury the dead. The check-posts have been set up at all three main exits surrounding the village with eight volunteers guarding in five teams. Moolchand Meena, a volunteer at a check-post, said that every day they turned away several visitors with no valid reason. “It sounds bad, but this was what happened last year as free movement of people caused havoc in the village. The cases were just 54, but we had hundreds with symptoms of Covid. Still, we have not come out with of that fear,” Meena said. Volunteers have been given basic training by health workers on Covid and they were provided with a dress code to allow only their movement. Other than guarding, the volunteers deliver grocery door-to-door in the village once a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bhilwara-village-learns-from-past-mistakes-to-check-cases-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82842480.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Jaipur||A shot of hope: Rajasthan's Nagaur village sets an example in vaccination||JAIPUR: A nondescript village, Khudi Kalan, in Nagaur district has set an example as 100% of its population above 60 years had taken at least one dose of the Covid vaccine till May1. The result has also astonished the local authorities that claimed that they have not recorded any Covid-19 deaths in this age group while the fatalities in this age bracket are very common across villages. In the 45+ category, the village vaccinated 70% of its population till May 3. The erratic supply of vaccines has prevented the village from attaining 100% score in the mid-age group to become the first village among the 44,672 in the state to achieve this feat. The village has 2,532 persons above 60 years of age as per the latest voter list. Till May 12 they ended up vaccinating 2,641, the additional 109 were from nearby villages. The village has a population of 21,000. The village is like any other settlement with a highdegree of vaccination hesitancy fuelled by misinformation such as it leads to impotency, side-effects to surface in 2-3 years, decreases life expectancy etc. Here the villagers thought differently which make them lead the vaccination march. The district administration approached the village core committee members to identify those who have a strong influence. “A senior secondary government school principal, Asha worker and ANM, along with the elected representatives like Sarpanch Jass Ram were found to have direct or indirect contacts with most of the houses. The school principal played a pivotal role by encouraging teachers who further communicated messages of vaccination through students. Secondly, the Asha worker and ANM started door-todoor campaigning convincing the families for vaccinations,” said Bhawani Singh Hapawat, district nodal officer, Nagaur. The mix of traditional and modern means of communication was used to dispel the myths. Keeping social distancing in mind, small skits and plays were held at places where elderly spent time in the morning and evening. Once the lockdown was announced, the format changed with Asha worker going from door-to-door showing skits and plays to the families. “I visited 306 houses to show ladies visual content including news reports of how only vaccines can help to fight the virus,” said Kavita Pemaram, an Asha worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nagaur-village-sets-an-example-in-vaccination/articleshow/82842488.cms||Shoeb Khan

The deceased was Md Aijaz, 25, a welder from Kishanbagh in Bahadurpura. At around 11.40 pm on Thursday, when Aijaz was taking a stroll in the lane in front of his house, a neighbour, Rafeeq, a transport businessman, suddenly came towards him and threw water mixed with chilli powder on his face, Charminar ACP G Bhiksham Reddy said.

---||Lucknow||Written, teaching test mandatory for assistant prof post in Uttar Pradesh universities||LUCKNOW: Candidates aspiring to join as teachers in UP universities, including technical and medical institutions, will now have to appear for a written test and make a classroom presentation for selection. In the new set of rules framed by the Raj Bhawan for direct recruitment of academic staff, selection of candidates at entry level (assistant teachers) will be based on five parameters – basic academic score, academic performance index (API), written test, teaching skills and interview. Till now, appointments were made solely on the basis of interviews. While the basic academic score will include marks obtained by candidates at graduate, post-graduate and MPhil or equivalent courses, which has been allocated a total of 20 points, papers published in journals will account for 30 points. Another 20 points have been allocated for written test. The ability of candidates to work on computer for online classes and a classroom presentation will add another 20 points to merit. Only 10 points have been fixed for interview. Former vice-chancellor of Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, Ayodhya, Prof Manoj Dixit, said: “A similar procedure for selection of teachers is followed by central universities. The step will keep fraudulent practices at bay. However, I am not in favour of written test.” Through an order, dated May 18, Governor and Chancellor of state universities Anandiben Patel has asked the vice-chancellors of 30 universities to follow the common recruitment rules. Under the new set of rules, universities will have to constitute a scrutiny committee that will shortlist candidates after calculating their basic academic score and API. The university will then publish the scores obtained by candidates and invite objections. After the release of merit list, the controller of examination will shortlist candidates for the next round. They will be examined on their teaching skills by a 15-minute presentation before students, followed by an interview. For direct selection of associate professors and professors, 20 points will be allotted for basic academic score while 60 points will be set aside for API. The remaining 20 points will be for interview. “Six decades ago, appointment letters were given to people of repute, without any evaluation. Despite the selection parameters, we do not get 20% of such stalwarts. For high quality teachers, the selection process has to be transparent,” said Maulindu Mishra, former president of the Lucknow University Associated Colleges Teachers’ Association (LUACTA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/written-teaching-test-mandatory-for-asst-prof-post-in-universities/articleshow/82843863.cms||Isha Jain

The relief came at almost midnight.The HC was hearing Singh’s petition to quash inspector Bhimrao Ghadge’s FIR and for urgent interim relief to stay the probe and prevent his arrest. Singh’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani said a stay can be granted as the “police have no right to investigate, given a jurisdictional bar”. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade said: “The state refused to extend its assurance to not arrest Singh till next week...” Hence, it began an extensive hearing on the matter after 10pm, after it heard 60 other matters. “Since we would cease to be vacation bench at stroke of midnight, we adjourn the matter to Monday...” said the bench, while granting Singh interim relief.The HC asked, “Why is all this after Singh had a fallout with the state? We are on the issue of malafide.” For the state, former advocate general Darius Khambata said the FIR against Singh is “very serious” and the SC has held that if an offence is cognizable, mere allegations of malafide is not enough to stay probe or quash case. But Jethmalani said Ghadge’s FIR was “grossest subversion of a criminal trial” and an “illegal attempt” to reopen cases against Singh pending trial. He said “ludicrous cases” are being filed against Singh for his letter to the CM against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Advocate S B Talekar, for Ghadge, said his client is the “victim” here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/atrocities-case-bombay-hc-restrains-state-from-arresting-param-bir-till-plea-is-part-heard/articleshow/82843931.cms||---

With 17 patients of black fungus reported so far in the MDM Hospital, the hospital administration has set up a separate ward for these patients.Superintendent MK Aseri said that a taskforce had already been constituted which worked out a treatment protocol for Mucormycosis and now a separate ward has also been set up for the treatment of these patients. He said that a total of 17 patients have been admitted in this ward so far, of which, 16 are confirmed patients of Mucormycosis while the report of one is awaited.HoD (ENT) Bharti Solanki said that all these 16 patients have been operated upon for black fungus and three of them lost their eyes to this deadly fungus. AIIMS also has started receiving patients of black fungus in large numbers and is geared up to deal with these cases. According to information, over 50 patients are admitted in 2 wards reserved for the patients in AIIMS.With the growing cases of the fungus, shortage of medicines has dealt a blow to hospital’s efforts, despite the disease being declared an epidemic in the state. Both AIIMS and MDM Hospital have been facing the shortage of the key anti-fungal medicine Amphotericin B.Sources at AIIMS admitted zero availability of this vial while the MDM Hospital administration claimed that it may run out of the stock anytime, given the surge in the cases.Though, there was adequate stock of the vial both in the hospitals and market, but the growing number of cases has dried up the stock, forcing the patients to run for it in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patients-of-black-fungus-rise-stock-of-medicine-depletes/articleshow/82842499.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Zila & kshetra panchayat chiefs poll may be put off||LUCKNOW: Amid growing concern over Covid spread in UP’s rural heartland after panchayat elections, the state government has decided to tread cautiously before conducting polls for zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons. Seventy-five zila panchayat chairmen are scheduled to be elected by 3,050 zila panchayat members and 826 kshetra panchayat chairpersons by 75,852 ward members through indirect polling. Though it won’t be as mammoth an exercise like panchayat polls, it would once again trigger frenzied political activity. Already, political parties have begun back-channel negotiations with Independent candidates or throwing their weight behind probable candidates. Top sources in the state election commission said, the poll panel had sent a proposal to conduct zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairperson elections in May, soon after the three-tier rural local body elections concluded on May 2. “But the exercise had to be kept in abeyance, following legal petitions and complaints of deaths of polling officials, including teachers,” said a senior official in the commission. A senior official in UP panchayati raj department confirmed to TOI the decision to conduct elections to top posts in zila and kshetra panchayat have been deferred indefinitely, following the pandemic spurt and reported deaths of polling officials in the four-phase panchayat elections held last month. “The final decision will be taken after due consultation with CM Yogi Adityanath and the state election commission,” the official said. Though the panchayati raj department has drafted a formal proposal for the CM’s nod, sources said, government is dragging its feet in organising swearing-in of members of zila panchayat and kshetra panchayats. State election commission sources said, the tenure of zila panchayat chairmen concluded on January 14 and the state government has issued a notification extending their stint by six months — that is till July 14. Likewise, the tenure of kshetra panchayat chairpersons which ended on March 18 has been extended by six months till September 18. Officials in the state poll body said, the commission and the state government have adequate time to conduct these elections, provided the pandemic curve is flattened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zila-kshetra-panchayat-chiefs-poll-may-be-put-off/articleshow/82843892.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Meerut||Heads roll at Meerut hospital after Allahabad high court's ‘Ram bharose’ observation, HOD suspended & another doctor axed||MEERUT: The contract of a senior doctor was terminated and the head of the surgery department was suspended at Meerut’s Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College (LLRMC) on Friday for alleged negligence which had led to cremation of the body of a retired Military Engineering Services (MES) officer as anonymous and unclaimed. The family members of Santosh Kumar (65) continued to get updates on his health for over 10 days after he was cremated. The Allahabad high court, which was hearing a petition on overall Covid-19 situation in Uttar Pradesh, had taken note of the alleged negligence. While slamming the hospital authorities, the court had observed, “If this is the state of affairs of treatment at a medical college in a city like Meerut, then the entire medical system can only be said to be ‘Ram bharose’.” The court had directed the authorities to fix the responsibility and take action against those responsible, “however mighty they are”. On Friday, the hospital administration said it has suspended Sudhir Rathi, professor and head of department (surgery) and terminated the contract of doctor Utkarsh Kaushik. Earlier, action was taken against eight paramedic staffers after a report, submitted by a three-member panel, accepted the goof up. Kumar died in the hospital on April 23, just a day after he was admitted with Covid-19 symptompts. The hospital staff quietly cremated his body as “unclaimed” without trying to find and inform his family, which stayed in the dark until May 3. The family said they had been “getting his regular health updates” over the phone. Reacting to the claim that the family was getting health updates till May 3, principal of the state-run hospital, Gyanendra Kumar, had said, “There was another patient with a similar name in the ICU ward. Ward attendants used to give out the health update of that person when asked about Kumar.” The matter had come to the fore after the daughter of the retired officer, Shifa Shivangi, made an appeal to chief minister Yogi Adityanath asking him to help locate her father. It prompted the hospital to form a probe panel, which later concluded in its report that Kumar was cremated by the staffers after they “failed” to contact the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/heads-roll-at-meerut-hospital-after-hcs-ram-bharose-observation-hod-suspended-another-doc-axed/articleshow/82838239.cms||---

Four of these cases have been referred to Jodhpur-AIIMS.A private ENT hospital received a total of five cases of black fungus in the last one week. One of the patients is suspected to be under treatment in Barmer while the other four were referred to Jodhpur-AIIMS. Dr Kishan Kumawat of the hospital confirmed this.Barmer district collector Lok Bandhu Yadav said using oxygen concentrators without complete information and its ill-effects is increasing the cases of black fungus. The medical management has been asked to ensure proper use of it. He said there is need to spread necessary information about using oxygen concentrators among people. “Proper and safe use of oxygen concentrators will benefit the patients and they can be saved from possible infection of black fungus,” he said. The collector told TOI that the government through its e-upkaran portal is buying oxygen concentrators and complete care is taken about the prescribed standards. He said that oxygen concentrators provided by philanthropists and purchased for domestic use should be used by following proper guidelines. The central government has also issued guidelines for this looking at the seriousness. He said that an oxygen concentrator is an equipment that runs on electricity and makes oxygen from the air in the surrounding area. The patient is provided oxygen through cannula from this equipment. It is important that the oxygen flow is 5 litres per minute from the oxygen concentrator and oxygen should be 90% pure. The flow should be continuous.He said that if the oxygen concentrator is not as per the prescribed standards and if not used properly then it can be dangerous. There are more chances of black fungus infection.He said that at the time of buying oxygen concentrators the user manual, maintenance manual, display board, filter bottle, distilled bottle etc. should be with the equipment. He stressed on strictly following necessary directions in medical institutions and during domestic use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/black-fungus-cases-in-barmer-referred-to-aiims-jodhpur/articleshow/82842495.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It would take big convoys of farmers every Sunday to the protest sites at Delhi borders. The first convoy will be sent on May 23 adopting Covid-19 protocols. And before sending the next jatha, the previous jatha will return to Punjab before Sundays. The farm organisation has also decided to take on the Congress-led Punjab government and BJP-led Union government for “miserably failing to effectively tackle the coronavirus pandemic”. For the purpose, the organisation has decided to hold a sit-in at Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s native town Patiala from May 28 to 30. It has decided to increase the scope of call for observing black day on May 26 by including failure of the governments in tackling Covid apart from opposing the contentious farm laws. The farm organisation has termed the prevailing situation as like ‘sadme ka sidhant’ or ‘aapda me avsar’ (benefit in calamity) being adopted by the Centre in providing benefit to corporates, which is reason why the government has provided relief to aggrieved people. The decisions were taken at the state-level meeting of the organization held at Moga on Thursday evening. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the Union government has miserably failed in preparing ground to take on the pandemic. The Centre had claimed that 162 oxygen plants would be set up in 150 districts of the country, but so far only 33 units have been set up even as close to 3 lakh people have died in the country due to Covid and India has turned out to be the worst country in tackling corona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-group-says-have-plans-to-strengthen-stir/articleshow/82842509.cms||Neel Kamal

Villagers claimed that every second household has a person who is suffering from cold, cough or fever and the16 deaths were sudden following a brief illness of just couple of days. Ladu Singh, who runs a school in Dhabar, told TOI, “There is a bit of carelessness on part of the administration as well as some resistance for testing by the locals. The deaths of the16 persons remain a mystery to us as they were mostly healthy and died suddenly after being ill for a couple of days. Out of the17, one person who died was admitted in hospital because of which we came to know that he was infected.” There around 4,000 residents in the village, which is approximately 20km from the district headquarters. Dhabar sarpanch Sayar Mal said, “Earlier, no one was being tested, but after the numerous deaths, we set up a camp and also got the entire village vaccinated. Previously, we did not feel that there was any need for Covid testing, but now we do not want to take any chance. However, the 16 persons who died might have had some other ailments as well.” Meanwhile, the district administration, on getting information about the deaths, is monitoring the situation. Collector Ansh Deep said, “The samples were taken on Thursday and we are expecting the reports by Friday. Depending on the number of Covid positive cases, if any, we will take further measures like testing the persons who have come in contact with the Covid positive patient. If the testing shows high number of positive cases, then we will find the super spreaders as well. While we are conducting door-to-door surveys to find people who have even mild symptoms, at times people do not go for tests fearing society, but we are taking all steps to ensure that everyone has access to health facilities.” The villagers, however, also claimed that another deterrent in going for a test is the distance from the village to an adequately equipped medical facility which is in Pali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/17-deaths-in-25-days-in-pali-village-send-residents-into-a-tizzy/articleshow/82842503.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Jaipur||Centre increases Rajasthan’s quota for black fungus drug||JAIPUR: The Centre has increased the state government’s allocation for the purchase of liposomal amphotheracin B, an investigational drug for the treatment of black fungus or Mucormycosis. With the increase in allocation, the state government has received 1,600 vials of the drug from Sun Pharma company on Friday. The state has also received 250 vials of the drug from Mylan company and 275 vials from Cipla Pharmaceutical company. However, the government is yet to receive the order it had placed for 2,500 vials of liposomal amphotheracin from Bharat Serums. The state requires 42,000 vials of the injection with 700 cases of black fungus identified in the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma had earlier written to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and demanded 50,000 vials of liposomal amphotericin B for the state. Sharma on Friday said that patients suffering from Mucormycosis, which has been declared as an epidemic and notifiable disease in the state, will also be provided free treatment as Covid. The disease has also been included in the Mukhya Mantri Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana. Sharma said, “About 700 patients of black fungus have been identified in the state so far. The protocol for the treatment of black fungus has been determined by a team of specialised doctors and the listed hospitals are being given instructions to treat them according to this protocol.” “Keeping in mind the need of other specialized doctors, including ENT and ophthalmology in the treatment of black fungus, the hospitals will be listed for treatment of the disease only if prescribed parameters are met. Initially 20 state and private hospitals have been listed for its treatment. Hospitals fulfilling the prescribed parameters will also be listed further. Already, a separate ward has been set up at SMS hospital for the treatment of patients,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-increases-states-quota-2125-vials-of-black-fungus-drug-received/articleshow/82842501.cms||---
---||Patna||Covid fight tough in rural areas of Bihar||ARA/BHAGALPUR/GAYA: While cases of Covid-19 have shown early signs of plateauing, it seems a longer battle has to be fight in rural Bihar against the pandemic in its second wave. For instance, districts like Supaul close to Nepal border in north Bihar have over 2,300 active cases of Covid. Similarly, Madhubani, Nalanda, East Champaran and Begusarai have also over 3,000 active cases. Patna has the highest 7,749 active cases, followed by 3,478 in Muzaffarpur. In Bhojpur district, delay in test, treatment and lack of healthcare facilities are taking a toll on lives of people. “Even our village elders are saying that they have not seen so many deaths (about 15 in one month) in such a short period of time,” said Chandra Bhushan Singh Yadav, a local leader and husband of Meena Devi, the mukhiya (village headman) of Sonepura panchayat under Udwantnagar block of Bhojpur district. He added, “How can we know the cause of their death unless they get themselves tested? There are no test camps or centres in our panchayat. The PHC at Udwantnagar is 15 to 16km from Ara. Moreover, some people fear that they will get infected on visiting hospitals.” Vijay Kumar Singh, former panchayat member of Kasap village, some 11km from Ara, said, “Though the exact cause is not known as villagers did not undergo test, at least 26 people of my village have died in the last 20 days. I am 50-year-old, but I have not seen so many deaths in my village in such a short time. Some of the victims had cough, fever and breathing problems. Not to talk about the poor and illiterate, even some educated people of my village do not wear mask regularly or properly.” Mahesh Singh Yadav of Asni village, said, “Though there is a health centre in our village, hardly any doctor visits there. Recently, a middle-school teacher of my village died of Covid. Moreover, people lack awareness as they are still attending at marriage feasts in large numbers.” The height of ignorance and misinformation among some villagers, which is both shocking and matter of concern, can be gauged from the fact that when this newspaper asked a hawker of Gundi village which is adjacent to Ara town, he said, “I have not taken this month’s ration as some of my co-villagers said everyone who has his name on the ration card will have to get vaccinated. I have heard that people fall ill after getting vaccinated. Why should I take vaccine when I have no ailment?” In Bhagalpur district, Covid-19 has spread fast among the rural population in large numbers. Reports about entire localities getting affected in some villages have also come up. District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Manoj Choudhary said Covid infection was being reported from rural as well as sub-urban areas. “It is mainly because of residents hiding their symptoms and spreading the disease to their family members and society by the time they get really sick and the matter is reported,” the DIO said. He added, “Hesitancy in getting tested even after some symptoms of ailments getting reflected, orthodoxy and fear of social slur of being labelled corona positive, hesitancy in getting vaccines due to false information and non-adherence of Covid guidelines are the major causes for spread of the virus in rural areas.” Dr Choudhary said all primary health centres (PHCs) are conducting one or the other type of pathological tests for corona besides undertaking vaccination process. “However, hesitancy of rural people and preconceived ideas on various issues are the reasons for spread of Covid in villages,” he added. In Gaya, positivity rate in rural areas is 58% as compared to 48% in urban areas. During the last 10 days, there has been a decline in daily Covid cases in urban areas. Due to distance of test centres, not all people are undergoing tests in the rural areas. For example, distance of test centre from Wari panchayat in Dobhi block is around 13km. Not willing to travel the distance and face challenges of movement restrictions during the lockdown, villagers prefer to take medicine from the local medical practitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-fight-tough-in-rural-areas-of-bihar/articleshow/82842261.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Hyderabad||Most students get top marks, relieved||Hyderabad: The SSC exam results brought cheer to class 10 students and their parents on Friday as many students secured top marks as only internal assessment marks were considered for final grades. Students said that securing good marks will boost their morale and will help them perform better in higher classes. “I am very happy that I was awarded 10 GPA in SSC exams. I wanted to study well and secure top marks in inter and graduation as well,” said G Pragna, a private school student. Another student, K Pavan Kumar, said he is satisfied with the result. “If I appeared for the exam, I would have secured about 9.2 GPA. Now, I secured a 9.8 GPA. I am satisfied and happy,” said Kumar, a government school student. Parents said that they are happy that their child’s academic year is not wasted because of the pandemic. “When students did not get to attend physical classes for most of the academic year, I was worried that the year might be declared a zero year. Although it is not ideal that students are promoted without exams, I am happy that my daughter completed her class 10. At least we got some good news in an otherwise horrible year,” said E Srinivas, whose daughter Lasya secured 9.5 GPA. Some, however, said that it would have been better if exams were conducted at a later stage instead of promoting and awarding marks based on internal assessment. “Even those students who hardly secure pass marks got more than 90% marks. They don’t have subject knowledge. They will struggle in higher classes,” said H Bindu, whose brother Vinay secured 9.7 GPA. Teachers said that majority of their students are happy and added that last year far fewer students secured 10 GPA as schools were not aware that exams will be cancelled because of the pandemic. “This year, many secured over 9.8 GPA as schools were aware that final marks will be based on assessment marks,” said Chava Ravi, a government teacher, adding that many students were awarded marks based on online exams as they appeared for internal assessment from home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-students-get-top-marks-relieved/articleshow/82842510.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Hyderabad||Land auctions hit by Covid, Telangana govt’s plans to mop up Rs 10,000 crore go awry||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government’s plans to mobilise Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore by selling government land appears to have gone awry for the second consecutive year. Though the government has identified some land parcels in the city and surrounding Rangareddy district to raise money by auctioning the land, it could not go ahead thanks to the first wave of Covid-19 and now the second wave. Senior officials are worried as the third wave of pandemic is likely to hit sometime in the third quarter of the year and land auctions may not be held this year too. Land auction was last conducted in December 2019 by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) was held in May 2017. The municipal administration and revenue departments have identified about 2,000 acres land including assigned land in the city and outskirts for land auction. The HMDA has taken up development of a layout in 200 acres land (130 to 140 acres developed land) last year in the upmarket Kokapet and the development was almost completed. The authority was waiting for clearance from the government for going ahead with the auction. In Rangareddy and Medchal districts nearly 1500 acres assigned land was identified in Kongara Khurd, Raviryal and Thummaloor villages in Maheshwaram mandal. The government wanted to resume the land from the farmers by paying compensation as it is not being used for agriculture purpose. Municipal administration department principal secretary Arvind Kumar on Thursday visited HMDA land at Miyapur on Thursday. The authority owns about 105 acres land, part of which (about 55 acres) was earlier allotted for developing integrated bus terminal, but it did not happen. The HMDA earlier owned 376 acres in this survey numbers, but it had auctioned 271 acres and balance is still with the metropolitan authority. Sources said the government is also eyeing on the enemy property in survey number 20 and 28 in Miyapur. Some land parcels in Uppal Bhagat are also expected to put for auction by the HMDA. “The government can go for land auction immediately also. But due to slowdown in the real estate sector owing to Covid 19, the government may not get good and competitive price at the juncture,” a senior official of the government said. The Telangana government is badly requiring funds as it had allocated nearly Rs 50,000 crore for various welfare schemes such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, Pensions, agriculture loan waiver, Kalyana Lakshmi-Shaadi Mubarak and KCR Kits etc in the 2021-2022 financial year. The government announced pay revision to the government employees, which is also a burden on the state exchequer. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has announced the state had lost about Rs 50,000 crore in the last financial year due to lockdown and pandemic in the form of state owned taxes, central finance and other sources. However, the government is hopeful of bouncing back from the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-auctions-hit-by-covid-govts-plans-to-mop-up-rs-10k-cr-go-awry/articleshow/82842512.cms||Koride Mahesh

The disease will also be covered under the Chiranjeevi Yojna insurance scheme for free treatment. As per the health department order, mucormycosis patients have been divided into three categories. Charges in private hospitals have been fixed based on these categories and NABH accreditation of hospitals. “NABH accredited hospitals can charge patients with moderate sickness Rs 5,500 per day for being kept in isolation bed with oxygen, Rs 8,250 for patients with severe sickness who will use ICU beds without ventilators and Rs 9,900 for patients with very severe sickness who will use ICU beds with ventilators,” said health minister Raghu Sharma. And for non-NABH category of hospitals, the charges will be Rs 5,000 per day for patients with moderate symptoms, Rs 7,500 for patients with severe symptoms and Rs 9,000 for those with very severe symptoms. “This will include the cost of PPE kits, consultancy, nursing, food, medicine and consumables, and housekeeping charges, among others,” said a health department official.

Of 1,02,641 women, at least 16,333 are from Hyderabad and surrounding districts of Medchal-Malkajgiri and Ranga Reddy. “The surveillance of Covid- 19 will be continued till the second wave recedes and the data on all pregnant women in Telangana is being captured,” one official overseeing the work said. The fever survey is also focussed about finding any coronavirus symptoms among pregnant women. Infected pregnant women with mild and moderate symptoms are being treated locally while serious cases are being shifted to Gandhi hospital. Since the second wave began in March this year, the state-run Gandhi hospital has treated more than 400 pregnant women for coronavirus. “But the death rate is almost negligible, and 10 babies were delivered here. There are about 50 pregnant women who are infected with Covid-19 being treated here,” Dr Raja Rao, Gandhi hospital superintendent said. According to Dr Pramila Sekhar, a senior consultant gynaecologist said, Covid- 19 protocols and treatment for pregnant women are same as regular patients. “The immunity levels are generally less in pregnant women, and they need to be under constant monitoring. But there is no need to be panic as the recovery rate is very high among pregnant women with Covid-19, also as in case of regular people. I handled four or five pregnant women this year, and all them have recovered well,” she pointed out. They should follow the SMS (sanitization of hands, masks, safe distance) protocol, she added. From Monday onwards, medicine facility has been made operational for pregnant women where mandal level health officers will help women who are due for delivery. The district level staff are being trained for performing deliveries for Covid-19 pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-focus-on-safety-of-over-1l-pregnant-women/articleshow/82842515.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The first patient was dosed with molnupiravir, an influenza drug that is being studied for use on non-hospitalised Covid-19 patients, at Yashoda hospital in Hyderabad. The company has also tied up with other hospitals like Gleneagles Global Hospitals and Excel Hospital as well as KIMS Hospital in Secunderabad and Vizag for the trials, which are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in mild Covid-19 patients. The trials will be conducted on around 1,200 patients at 32 centres in nearly 10 cities across the country, Dr Praveen Myneni, medical officer, Natco Pharma told TOI. According to Dr Myneni, around 600 patients suffering from mild Covid-19 who are already undergoing standard treatment will be dosed with molnupiravir, while the remaining 600 patients participating in the trial would be only getting standard Covid-19 treatment. Each patient will be given a bottle of molnupiravir containing 40 capsules of 200mg each. As per the prescribed regimen, the patient will have to take 800mg (200mg x 4 capsules) twice a day for five days, he explained. “Pre-clinical data has shown that Molnupiravir has broad anti-influenza activity, including highly potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Patients treated with molnupiravirachieved response within five days of therapy, indicating that the duration of treatment is short, with the additional advantage of being an oral therapy,” Natco Pharma said. Natco had earlier told the regulator that it is geared up for production of the drug and if given emergency approval for compassionate use on patients given the surge in cases, can start churning out doses at short notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/natco-kicks-off-molnupiravir-phase-3-trials-on-mild-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82843987.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||Pharma co MD turns Covid-19 volunteer||Hyderabad: A young MD of a pharmaceutical firm has taken a sabbatical to devote his time to attend SOS calls from Covid-19 patients and their attendants. Sai Charan Chikkulla receives about 500 calls every day for help ranging from availability of oxygen concentrators on rent to oxygen and ventilator beds in hospitals and medicines to fight black fungus. His pharma connection with different hospitals across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh has come in handy for him to help patients in Hyderabad and across Telugu states. “Since the second wave in the first week of April, I kept my company work aside and devoted my time virtually round-the-clock as a volunteer helping Covid-19 patients,” Sai Charan, who heads Consemen Healthcare Private Ltd, told TOI. Last week, when Sai Charan developed shortness of breath due to continuous work and took rest for half a day on doctor’s advice, he was flooded with 300 direct messages and tweets from patients and attendants on his Twitter handle seeking help. And he had to work overtime to attend to them. It all started when Sai Charan checked the dashboard of the state government where availability of beds was shown, but in reality they were occupied. “Patients are losing precious time in rushing from one hospital to another searching for beds. I thought I could change the situation and started calling hospitals in Hyderabad every morning and update the info on my Twitter handle,” he said. “Since I maintain contacts with doctors, it helps me check real-time availability of beds.” Sai Charan’s task does not end with finding a bed or supplying oxygen cylinders/concentrators or medicines. “As of now, more than 600 families are in contact with me. I have also been maintaining contacts with genuine sources for oxygen cylinders, concentrators, plasma and beds and coordinating with ‘Relief Riders’ in delivering critical medicine and groceries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pharma-co-md-turns-covid-19-volunteer/articleshow/82842514.cms||Syed Akbar

With his son no more, he clung on to things the young squadron leader, Abhinav Choudhary (29), had left behind -- like the tee he would wear during shooting practice at Rashtriya Indian Military College, Dehradun, from where he completed schooling before taking the NDA exam. Abhinav was killed on Thursday night when a MiG-21 Bison fighter jet he was flying crashed in Punjab’s Moga district. “I lost everything I had,” said Choudhary. He was proud, distraught and angry at the same time. Along with his family members, Choudhary joined the rising chorus in the house to ground “obsolete” MiG-21s. “The government should discontinue the obsolete aircraft. I have lost my son… I don’t want others to lose theirs. I request the government with folded hands to discontinue them,” he said. Abhinav is survived by his parents, sister and wife Sonika Chaudhary, whom he wed in December 2019. He had plans to come home on May 15 on leave. But his parents asked him to stay put due to the pandemic. His cousin, Anuj Tokas, 39, a doctor in Karnal, said, “All the MiG-21s have been converted into Bisons by ‘jugaad’. At least 12 to 14 MiG 21s have crashed in the last few years. Why are only Mig-21s crashing?” On Friday morning, IAF tweeted, “There was an aircraft accident last night involving a Bison aircraft of IAF in the western sector. The pilot, Sqn Ldr Abhinav Choudhary, sustained fatal injuries. IAF condoles the tragic loss and stands firmly with the bereaved family.” A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the cause of the accident. Abhinav’s mortal remains will be brought to Meerut where his last rites will be conducted with full military honour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/retire-obsolete-jets-lost-my-son-others-shouldnt-lose-theirs-dad-of-dead-pilot/articleshow/82838298.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Hemaram Choudhary’s resignation a matter of concern, says Sachin Pilot||JAIPUR: Congress leader and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Friday said senior legislator Hemaram Choudhary’s resignation is a matter of concern. “Choudhary is the seniormost MLA of the House. He has been a major contributor to Rajasthan and Congress politics. He had held the post of opposition leader. There is hardly any other example matching his simplicity, honesty and humility in the Congress. His resignation is a matter of grave concern,” Pilot told reporters here. Pilot was responding to a question by media after attending a function organised to pay tributes to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on his death anniversary at the party office here on Friday. The six-time MLA from Gudamalani assembly seat of Barmer, Hemaram Choudhary, had sent his resignation to the state assembly Speaker on Tuesday. Choudhary was the leader of opposition in the Rajasthan assembly and also a former revenue minister. He did mention the reason for his resignation. Choudhary was among the 19 MLAs with Sachin Pilot camp who had rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year. Though these MLAs returned to the party fold after central leadership’s intervention, they are yet to be accommodated in the government or party organisation. Following Hemaram Choudhary’s resignation, another MLA from the camp Ved Prakash Solanki on Wednesday alleged that the Congress workers in the state are demoralised as they were not given participation in governance. He called for decentralisation of power and said that party workers should be given more opportunities in governance. This is being seen as desperation within the Sachin Pilot camp over the delay in political accommodation as was promised by the party high command. Though the Speaker has not yet decided on his resignation, Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra had said it was a party’s ‘family matter’ and would be resolved soon.

The father told the judges his family business had to shut down and he had no money to pay maintenance. The family court had directed him to pay Rs 50,000 per month. While the wife said arrears had reached Rs 8.5 lakh, he disputed it, saying it was Rs 5.6 lakh. He said the family had to sell its cars and he rides a scooter to work where he earns Rs 25,000 per month. To the court’s query, he said he had air-conditioners in every room of his house. Justice Kathawalla then warned, “If you want to act smart with us, you’ll be in difficulty. It is clear you have family business. Don’t compel us to attach your parents’ property.” The judge added, “Don’t ruin your family. You have very good children. Think about their future.” The husband reluctantly agreed to pay Rs 1 lakh arrears per month along with Rs 50,000 monthly maintenance. The judges directed the payments from June. Seeking access to the kids, he said, “My daughter said ‘I hate my father.’” Justice Kathawalla said, “It is your job to regain her confidence.” The judges directed till there was a lockdown, he would speak to his children thrice a week. The judges said he could meet his children after June 10, if the lockdown was lifted. The couple was asked to resolve their disputes amicably. When the wife said she had tried, Justice Kathawalla said, “It has to be from both sides. Forget the past. For the sake of the children see that peace is maintained.” The parties may seek the CJ’s approval to keep the matter part-heard “so that we can continue assisting the family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ensure-peace-for-the-sake-of-kids-hc-to-warring-couple-in-mumbai/articleshow/82844092.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath lauds legislators of Lakhimpur Kheri for ramping up Covid-19 infrastructure||LUCKNOW: Encouraging people, particularly those in rural areas, to swiftly get vaccinated, chief minister Yogi Adityanath told a gathering in Lakhimpur Kheri on Friday that under the “guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has two indigenously developed vaccines and a third one has hit the market”. He said, more vaccines would be delivered in July and the state government’s global tender would further replenish stocks. During a visit to Lakhimpur Kheri to review Covid preparedness, the CM said, people in rural areas would not have to travel far for vaccination as the government was setting up immunisation booths at common service centres. The CM also commended public representatives of the region, saying of the many districts he toured for Covid review, best work had been done by MPs and MLAs of Lakhimpur Kheri. “Public representative here have done an outstanding job and contributed the most for setting up oxygen plants in this area,” he said. Saying the fight against Covid was a community battle in which everyone had to contribute, the CM appealed to people to create awareness about the pandemic and encourage people to follow Covid protocols. The CM said, because of the government’s aggressive handling of the pandemic, there were only 1,400 active cases in Lakhimpur and the positivity rate was down to around 4%. “I have directed the district to raise testing. We are trying to make separate centres for vaccination in rural areas and working towards ramping up health facilities in rural areas,” he said. He reiterated that the state government managed to prove naysayers wrong about Uttar Pradesh’s daily tally scaling 1 lakh-mark by May. “After a peak of 38,055 new cases on April 24, the state clocked 7,700 cases on May 21. On April 30, our active cases were 3.1 lakh because we had a high positivity rate and low recovery. Over past 20 days, we ran an intense campaign and now we have 2.04 lakh fewer active cases since the peak,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-lauds-legislators-of-lakhimpur-kheri-for-ramping-up-covid-19-infra/articleshow/82844003.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The highest number of ventilators (295) were provided to Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad. Another 190 ventilators were given to Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) in Hyderabad. RIMS in Adilabad and MGM Hospital in Warangal were provided 100 ventilators each.  “The Centre is giving everything the state needs to fight the pandemic,” Kishan said, refuting allegations that the Centre has not allocated much to Telagana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ventilators-given-to-46-govt-hospitals-in-t-kishan-reddy/articleshow/82842535.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal loses 37 doctors in Covid second wave, total toll for medical fraternity now 142||KOLKATA: The pandemic continues to claim the lives of doctors. Till date, 142 doctors have died of Covid-19 in Bengal, 37 of them in the second wave. The vaccines appear to have reduced the mortality rate among doctors, with only a third of the deaths being recorded in the post-vaccination period. However, the overall death toll in the country in the second wave has been three times of the first wave. The casualty figures compiled by the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum and released by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Thursday put the countrywide fatalities for doctors at 329 in the second wave. The list of the deceased doctors includes former IMA president and Pandma Shri K K Aggarwal, who succumbed to the virus on Monday. The latest Covid martyr from Bengal was Sudhindra Mohan Bhattacharya of KPC Medical College and Hospital. The 65-year-old lost the battle at 3.30am on Friday. Speaking to TOI, Bengal IMA secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen echoed a concern that cardiologist Devi Shetty had expressed recently: that India will have very few doctors left to man the ICU and Covid wards. “The situation is extremely grave. Like Dr Shetty said, the country is losing doctors every day. Doctors must be careful and protective about themselves. We simply can’t afford to lose them like this,” said Sen. According to Bengal IMA joint secretary Rajib Pandey, the problem lies with the poor doctor-patient ratio. “There are a lot of factors. But the misfortune starts with the dismal number of medicos who must cope with such a huge populace,” Pandey said, pointing out that the ratio had become even more skewed due to the high infectivity rate. He was quick to add that the casualty was still less. "Only three doctors aged below 50 years have died and none of them was vaccinated. Most of those we lost in the second wave were over 60 years old, with co-morbidities. Bhattacharya, for instance, had COPD. Till now, no inoculated doctor aged below 50 has died. In the first wave, there were several casualties in that bracket.” West Bengal Health Service Association member Hiralal Konar lamented the huge shortage of doctors, nurses and other health staff amid the raging pandemic. “There are less than one doctor for every 2,000 in the Indian metros. Despite being vaccinated, doctors are exposed to heavy viral load since they work extra hours and are frequently infected, dealing with Covid patients all day,” he said. The doctors’ organizations have been writing to the government to ensure affordable and adequate care to Covid-infected medics and also vaccination of their families. India has about 1.2 million doctors for its population of 1.3 billion. The number of doctors specifically designated for Covid treatment is far less and remains unknown. Also, several of these doctors and medical staff are still not inoculated, for varied reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-loses-37-docs-in-cov-second-wave-total-toll-for-med-fraternity-now-142/articleshow/82840502.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Happy hypoxia: New concern for doctors in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Happy hypoxia — a silent drop in oxygen level below the required mark without any pressing symptoms or breathing distress — has turned out to be common among a large section of Covid patients in Kolkata, leaving doctors confused and alarmed. Even though it could be very serious, often leading to a cardiac arrest or brain stroke, this group of patients shows no such signs of an impending illness. They instead remain stable and walk and talk with ease. Even their pulse readings are often in the normal range though their oxygen saturation level might have dipped below 80. Hypoxia is a medical condition in which the oxygen level drops below 94%, which is the benchmark for a healthy individual. In the natural course, these patients should feel suffocated, pointed out RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) interventionist Souren Panja. He cited the instance of a patient who walked to the toilet on his own and dropped unconscious. It was revealed that his oxygen saturation had dropped to 75 without any symptom. A corporate communications professional, who has just recovered from Covid, was alarmed when her oximeter showed a reading of 85 but she didn’t have any breathing distress yet. Having failed to find a hospital berth, she was in home isolation. The lady, following her doctor’s advice, lay on her bed in the ‘prone’ position with a pillow under her chest. “After repeating this for two days – whenever my saturation dropped – it never dipped below 95,” she said. Panja added that he has come across scores of Covid patients over the last few weeks who have got admitted with oxygen levels of 80 or 75 but had no breathing distress. On the other hand, late detection of happy hypoxia has proved to be fatal in some cases. A lot of theories have been extended to explain the trend, but the real reasons are still unknown, according to Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “These patients seem to be resilient but may suffer a sudden collapse. Initially, they get acclimatized to low breathing either due to some pre-condition like COPD or asthma. Alternatively, the ‘peripheral receptors’ in their brain may be responding slow to a sudden drop in oxygen and instead helps the body to acclimatize,” explained Sarkar. A drop in oxygen can affect vital organs such as the brain, heart, liver and kidneys. Hypoxia more commonly triggers a cardiac arrest, though a brain stroke is always a possibility, according to some doctors. Most Kolkata private hospitals have instructed their emergency departments to check oxygen levels of Covid patients and take corrective measures immediately. “It’s safer not to go by symptoms since a substantial number could have silent hypoxia. In most cases, it’s seen that pre-existing diseases like COPD, lung fibrosis or asthma have turned them more tolerant to low oxygen levels. On the other hand, there are cases, where a patient after being weaned off oxygen, suffers a drop again but has no symptoms,” said Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/happy-hypoxia-new-concern-for-doctors/articleshow/82840492.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

In Thalassemia, a blood disorder that causes the body to have less haemoglobin than normal, patients require blood transfusion every 15 days. Similarly, in Sickle, a patient doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen and hence requires regular transmission. However, the ongoing lockdown due to the rise in Covid-19 cases has dwindled blood donations, leaving Thalassemia and other blood disorder patients in a fix. Many such patients have made desperate requests on social media seeking blood units. “We urgently required two units of O+ blood for my seven year old son. When we couldn’t get it from the hospital, we put out a post on Facebook and got few donors who were willing to come forward to donate blood,” said Mohammed Ashraf Khan, who works as a driver. Discontinuation of blood donation camps has also affected the stock in blood banks and hospitals. “We provide 30-40 units for 3,000 patients every 15 days. Because of the lockdown, not many are coming forward to donate blood fearing contraction of the virus. We are reaching out to blood banks and many other individuals to donate blood so that we can save the patients,” said Aleem Baig, joint secretary of Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Society (Telangana unit). The society recently received 100 units of blood from the Cyberabad police after they held an internal blood donation camp. Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar also donated blood on Friday. Most blood banks in the state are supplying blood on a replacement basis wherein one has to return the same amount of blood units that one has utilised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-hits-thalassemia-sickle-cell-patients-hard/articleshow/82842530.cms||Preeti Biswas

A police officer said SSI Kumaravel, who was attached to Arachalur police station, had stopped the truck driver at Palaiyakottai check post on Wednesday night, asking him to produce his driving licence and vehicle documents. “When the driver produced the documents that he had stored in digital format on his mobile phone, the SSI said they were not valid and demanded the original papers. When the driver cited the Union government’s guidelines allowing motorists to produce documents in digital format and not to carry original licence and documents with them, an altercation broke out between them,” the officer said. One seeing the driver recording their argument using his mobile phone camera, the officer said, the SSI attempted to snatch the device from him, but in vain. “The SSI then assaulted the driver using a stick. The driver later shared the video among his friends, who circulated the same on social media.” As the video went viral, Erode superintendent of police P Thangadurai had on Thursday ordered V Selvaraj, deputy superintendent of police, Perundurai sub-division, to conduct an inquiry and submit a detailed report. “Senior police officials had in the past received three complaints against the SSI for forcibly demanding bribe from motorists. He had assaulted two motorists a few months ago and he was already warned by senior officials. Based on the DSP’s report, the SP placed the SSI under suspension on Friday,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cop-assaults-truck-driver-demanding-bribe-suspended/articleshow/82842529.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even 21 days after the vaccination drive for this category was started, the health department has been able to give the first jab to nearly 11.84 lakh people out of the 3.5 crore in this category. The health department stated that the problem is with the supply by the Serum Institute of India (SII) as they are sending limited number of vials. Authorities claimed that May 27 onwards when they get Covaxin vials from Bharat Biotech, this might gain momentum.TOI on Friday spoke to the authorities to know about the issues related to the 18+ vaccination and their attempts to solve it. “If we ask them to send 5 lakh vials they send us 1 lakh. Rajasthan is the largest state with 33 districts. We get 1 lakh a day and another 1 lakh after some days, so sending doses to various far-flung districts becomes a problem. We have been urging SII to send at least 5 lakh in one lot since we have a capacity to vaccinate at least 6 lakh people daily,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer on Friday.He added that the department is in constant touch with Bharat Biotech as well and they are expecting to get first lot of Covaxin for 18+ category from May 27. “I believe the problem will be solved when we start getting Covaxin as well. If we get 5 lakh vaccines in a day for this category we can accelerate the vaccination programme,” he added.Meanwhile, on Friday 71,419 got their first jab in the 18+ category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/11-84l-of-3-5-cr-in-18-category-vaccinated-due-to-paucity-of-vaccines-/articleshow/82842544.cms||Ashish Mehta

Corporation authorities have appealed NGOs running the crematoriums to operate the facilities for 24 hours. If that is not viable, they have been instructed to work 12 hours a day, and stay open till 9pm on certain days.For the last two weeks, people who needed to cremate their loved ones, have been running from pillar to post to find a slot in crematoriums. A family that failed to find a crematorium even after 36 hours, had to request PSG Hospitals to keep the body in mortuary. “It was only on the second day after my grandmother’s death could we get a slot in the Pricol-run crematorium,” said Varsha T, who lost her grandmother due to heart attack a fortnight ago.There was such a long queue at crematoriums that the GKD-maintained crematorium cremated Covid-19 victims, but ended burning other bodies in the open. After pictures of open burning of bodies went viral, the civic body ordered all the 11 crematoriums to handle bodies of Covid-19 victims and work from 8am to 8pm.The health department has asked six crematoriums in rural areas to be stay open till 9pm. The health inspector will contact families that have Covid-19 victims and help them book a slot.City health officer Dr S Raja, who chaired a meeting with NGOs maintaining crematoriums on Saturday, said they can cremate 100 bodies a day. “While we did consider the option of keeping crematoriums open through the day, electric and gas machines need around six hours break. Even if a cremation starts at 8pm, it becomes 11pm before the machines can be switched off and staff can go home,” he said.However, three days after crematoriums began working from 8am to 8pm, instead of the earlier 8am to 6pm timing, there is a backlog of at least 20 bodies in CMCH’s mortuary daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/as-deaths-rise-working-time-of-crematoriums-extended/articleshow/82842541.cms||---

The 124th edition of the flower show will be a virtual event due to Covid-19. “The horticulture department had been in the process of preparing the garden for the annual flower show for the last six months. Unfortunately, it had to be cancelled for the second consecutive year due to the pandemic,” said Ramachandran. “Even though people cannot visit the garden in person, the virtual platform would help people across the globe to view the blooms.”Over 25,000 pots of 293 varieties of flowers such as liliums, dahlia, salvia, daisy, viola, verbena, aster, petunia and marigold are on display. The main attraction in the flower gallery is the introduction of varieties such as calla lily, torenia and gerbera. Flowerpots have been arranged to read ‘Covid-19 Vaccinate Yourself’ to raise public awareness. Also, two lakh plants are in bloom in beds in the garden, extending over 22 hectares.“As many as two lakh people would witness the annual flower show every year. Also, over 30 lakh visitors used to visit the garden. Last year and this year, the pandemic curtailed tourism in the Nilgiris, especially during the main seasons,” the minister said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/virtual-flower-show-starts/articleshow/82842553.cms||---

Last year, there were lot of disruptions due to Covid. But this time, we planned it almost a month ago,” said Ullas Thomas, district panchayat president and co-chairman of district disaster management authority (DDMA). Ernakulam has received a 163% excess rainfall from March 1 to May 21. Though the extremely heavy rainfall caused by the cyclone Tauktae in the Arabian Sea along the Kerala coasts resulted in flooding in low-lying coastal areas of Chellanam, Vypeen and Fort Kochi, officials made arrangements to clear the clay sediments brought in by the sea surge and rains. In the last one week alone, Ernakulam has received about 488% excess rainfall. Much of the clogged drains have been cleared and mosquito eradication programmes were implemented earlier. Thomas said that 82 local bodies, including panchayats, municipalities and the corporation, have been asked to set up 24/7 control rooms and ambulance facilities. The local body secretaries and specially-appointed nodal officers must monitor the activities and submit a report. With rapid response teams (RRT) already in place in all local bodies to help with any kind of crisis, mock drills have also been completed. Around 20,000 volunteers who had registered in the Jagratha portal are also part of this network in panchayats. “Now, they are helping in the management of Covid crisis but reaching out to citizens in times of need. We have also suggested that teachers in these local bodies shall be involved in case we need help to run relief camps,” said Thomas. District fire force teams along with local residents cleaned the clay sludge that entered homes in Chellanam panchayat after the temporary structures, including the sea wall, collapsed in sea surge. Around 136 members, including panchayat members and locals, joined in cleaning up the homes, public health centre, schools, roads and public offices on Thursday. While the Orange rule book on the disaster management in Covid has formed the basis for how to manage in the event of a monsoon flooding, reluctance of people to move out of their homes and go into a community space is going to be a challenge, said an RRT volunteer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pre-monsoon-preparedness-in-ernakulam-almost-over/articleshow/82840553.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

He ended up losing his feet, and sustained serious head injuries. Manish Kumar Sengar, a resident of Vishnupuri colony, was suffering from severe depression since his wife's death on May 1. He went to get his motorcycle repaired, but decided to leave it on the Mathura-Bareilly Road and "end his life". Sengar was taken to a local hospital by an ambulance. The hospital referred him to Aligarh for better treatment. “We have admitted him at a private hospital where doctors told us that he sustained head injuries. A surgery will also be done for amputation of his feet,” said the victim’s cousin Rohit, adding he was not in a position to speak. Rohit told TOI that Sengar’s wife Jyoti - in her 20s - died before celebrating their third wedding anniversary. They tied the knot on May 10 in 2018 after Sengar took divorce from his first wife. Sengar has a one-and-a half-year-old daughter. “We did not notice anything unusual in his behaviour. He was talking normally. But, he used to curse Covid a lot after Jyoti's death,” he said. Sengar was working with his uncle in their building material business in Hathras. “Two days ago, he told me that we have to be strong and get out of these difficult times to look after the daughter. But, then, he took this extreme step and is now seriously hurt,” Rohit added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/depressed-over-wifes-death-due-to-covid-man-31-jumps-before-train-loses-his-feet/articleshow/82838432.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Acting on complaints of irregularities in the way vaccines are being administered, bypassing the mandatory Co-Win registration, the department issued a set of guidelines and asked the private CVCs to ensure strict compliance. “All vaccinations must be conducted through Co-Win. Some hospitals that have procured vaccines are yet to register the sites on Co-Win and have officially not begun the inoculation drive,” an official said. Private CVCs stopped getting vaccines from the state from May 1, mandating them to procure their own vials. A majority of private hospitals are yet to get their stock and the few that have got vaccines are procuring Covaxin and Covishield at Rs 1,200 and Rs 600 respectively. “All private hospitals must publish vaccination schedule commensurate with the vaccine doses they have procured sufficiently in advance to provide visibility of appointment slots to citizens on Co-Win,” the guideline stated. Health officials said a CVC attached with a private hospital in New Alipore was asking people to email details to get a slot. The hospital would contact them with the date and time. People also said the centre had been charging Rs 1,550 for a Covaxin dose, but revised it to Rs 2,000 from May 20. Calls and messages to that hospital officials by TOI went unanswered. Woodlands Hospital said all their inoculation is done through Co-Win and all its workplace vaccination centres are registered. “Unless we conduct the inoculation through Co-Win, how will recipients get their certificates?” asked MD and CEO Rupali Basu. “All our workplace vaccination sites are registered through the licencing auth-ority in North 24 Parganas and each recipient is vaccinated in the online mode,” said Charnock Hospital GM Ips-ita Kundu. On Friday, the state procured 1,87,540 Covishield doses.

We have submitted an action plan, which include suggestions by stakeholders and various NGOs such as Parisar.”“An implementation committee was formed with experts from the Savitribai Phule Pune University and PMC officials. We have come up with many plans and projects, majority of which are in the planning stage at present. We have introduced a number of projects to directly and indirectly reduce air pollution, such as green corridor, cycle tracks and road modification, reduction in motorised transport, electric crematorium, mechanical sweepers, water sprinklers, and so on,” he added.An analysis of the air quality of Pune in 2015 under the Air Pollution Knowledge Assessment programme by Urban Emissions revealed that the modelled source contributions highlight transport (including on-road dust), domestic cooking and heating, industries, open waste burning, and influence of outside sources as the key air pollution sources in the urban area. It also recommended that the city needs to aggressively promote public and non-motorised transport and improve road infrastructure to reduce on-road dust re-suspension.Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, PMC, said, “We are implementing urban citizen guidelines, such as increasing space for pedestrians and cyclists.

An official source, who didn’t want to be identified, said Govindan was undergoing treatment in the hospital for the past four days, after he tested positive for Covid. “He was in a state of depression. His relatives were not allowed to meet him since it was an isolation ward and Govindan chose not to interact with the hospital staff too. On Friday around 9am, he went out of the ward on the fourth floor and jumped out. He suffered multiple fractures and died on the spot.” A few days ago, a 65-year-old man undergoing treatment for Covid-19 had committed suicide by hanging in the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital in Salem after his son succumbed to the virus in Dharmapuri government hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/patient-jumps-off-4th-floor-of-hosp-dies/articleshow/82842550.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Squadron Leader Abhinav Choudhary (28), who hailed from Baghpat-Meerut and had got married just over a year ago, had taken off in his MiG-21 ‘Bison’ from the Suratgarh airbase in Rajasthan for a “routine” night combat training sortie. The young fighter pilot was returning to the airbase when his MiG-21 apparently developed a technical snag and crashed, with his body being found about 2 km from the crash site. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to establish the exact reason behind the crash, said an official. This is the third MiG-21 ‘Bison’ crash this year, with the first taking place near Suratgarh in January. The old Soviet-origin MiG-21s, the first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the IAF in 1963, have had a high crash rate over the years. Of the 872 MiG-21s progressively inducted by IAF, over 400 have crashed since 1971-72, killing over 200 pilots and almost 50 civilians on the ground, as was earlier reported by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-pilot-who-got-married-a-year-ago-dies-in-mig-crash/articleshow/82848510.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Wards to be split into micro units to curb Cov deaths||Kolkata: All Covid-designated government hospitals in the city will split up their facility into micro units with each comprising 25-35 beds. A group of doctors and nurses will be assigned to each unit for focused monitoring and management of Covid patients. This, doctors said, would lead to targeted care and timely intervention that would ultimately lead to lower mortality. “The aim is to reduce deaths that are nearly three times the first wave. If infections remain high but deaths decline, the situation can be better managed. Since the condition of Covid patients deteriorates rapidly, immediate intervention is required. This can happen if the patient load that doctors handle isn’t too high,” pointed out gastroenterologist Abhijit Chowdhury, who has been in the forefront of the team strategizing Covid management in Bengal. While the highest death toll in the state during the first wave was 63, it has crossed the 160-mark on several days this month. These figures are of patients who died after being admitted in hospitals post confirmed RT-PCR tests. In addition, there are several more that are dying daily at home or in hospitals without Covid test or before the results arrive. These are then treated as Covid suspects and do not reflect in the mortality figures. Each unit of 25-35 patients will function as a self-sufficient facility with different tiers of doctors assigned to each. “Each unit will be headed by one or two senior physicians and have a reasonable number of doctors to operate 24X7. A team of nursing personnel will also be tagged with the units,” an administrative official. There will also be a quick response team of specialist medical officer, general duty medical officer, staff nurse, medical technologist for critical care unit and others to take care of the critical cases round-the-clock. Consultant surgeon Diptendra Sarkar, who is a member of the Covid management team at SSKM Hospital, said the smaller set-ups would benefit immensely in large Covid hospitals as it was virtually impossible for doctors to pay attention to a patient when there are over 100 in a round.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wards-to-be-split-into-micro-units-to-curb-cov-deaths/articleshow/82840576.cms||Subhro Niyogi

While Air India had released the compensation last year itself, the pilot’s family is yet to get the same from Maharashtra labour authorities. The amount of compensation the family is to receive from AI and insurance is not being disclosed for security reasons. I lost my father, Captain Deepak Sathe, in the crash of AIE IX 1344. Ten months later, individuals in employee compensation commissioner office (Mumbai, BKC) are misguiding and setting up hoops for my mother in the middle of a pandemic, Dhananjay Sathe tweeted on Thursday. Sources say AIE gave the first tranche of the compensation to the pilot’s widow last September. The second tranche from AI was deposited with Kerala authorities on December 1. “At the request of the family, that money was transferred to authorities in Mumbai so that they could get it there itself without coming to Kerala,” said sources. “The pilot’s parents are alive. His father reportedly exonerated any claims from the compensation amount on both his and his wife’s behalf. Maharashtra authorities perhaps wanted a separate exoneration letter from the pilot’s mother. This may have caused the delay,” said sources. Maharashtra labour commissioner responded to the pilot’s son’s tweet on Friday, saying ‘compensation commissioner, Palakkad (Kerala) has transferred the claim amount to compensation commissioner (Labour Court), Maharashtra on March 3, 2021. Labour commissioner, Maharashtra, has (a deputy) to assist Mrs Sathe in filing the claim application before the compensation commissioner (Labour Court), Mumbai, as part of mandatory procedure. There will be no hassle and the labour commissionerate will assist Mrs Sathe and family’. On Friday, the Union aviation ministry tweeted that secretary PS Kharola ‘has contacted chief secretary, Maharashtra, over the issue of employee compensation of Late Captain Dipak Sathe. The compensation amount was deposited by Air India with Employees Compensation Commissioner Palakkad, Kerala. It was then transferred to Employees Compensation Commissioner, Bandra on request of your relatives. It can be disbursed after filing claim by legal heir of the deceased employee before the said authority. It is statutory provision which needs to be followed. Air India is rendering all necessary assistance in expeditious settlement of the claim. The office of labour commissioner, Maharashtra will also extend all possible help in this matter.” AIE Dubai-Kozhikode flight on August 7, 2020, had crash-landed and skidded off the tabletop runway, killing 19 passengers and both pilots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pilots-family-awaits-compensation/articleshow/82840620.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Based on the complaint of hospital authorities, police registered a theft case and launched an investigation. On Thursday, Ranga Reddy district hospital superintendent, Dr M Dasarath informed Gachibowli police, alleging that unknown persons have stolen 50 vials of Covishield vaccine from the hospital premises.

---||Lucknow||HCs shouldn’t pass orders which are impossible to implement: SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed Allahabad high court's order directing the Uttar Pradesh government to provide two ambulances with ICU facilities to every village in the state. While staying the ruling, the apex court said that high courts must ponder over the practicality of their orders and not pass orders which are impossible to implement. The bench's order came on a petition filed by UP government challenging a May 17 order of Allahabad HC, which had ordered several implausible infrastructure creation in the state including provisioning two ambulances with ICU facilities in each of the 97,000 villages in UP within a month. It stayed the HC order. The Supreme Court asked the HCs to exercise restraint in passing orders that are incapable of being implemented and advising them not to deal with pan-India issues like supply of oxygen, medicines and vaccines. "We mention that in matters which have trans-national or international ramifications, the High Courts should refrain and restrain from passing any order since the Supreme Court is dealing with these issues," said a vacation bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai, during a hearing that stretched on till late evening. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for UP, said that the HCs were constitutionally entitled to scrutinise the actions of the state government and point out deficiencies, but passing impractical orders would not only embarrass the state government but also make the officials, who are working round the clock to provide facilities to covid patients, liable for being hauled up for contempt of court. "As such most officials are busy drafting responses to numerous petitions on Covid management filed in various High courts. But, when a HC directs a certain number to be vaccinated or orders making available certain medicines, which are in short supply as their patents are held by foreign companies, it presents a difficult pan-India situation. Should the medicines and vaccines, allotted rationally, be diverted from one state to the other? About international patents, should the matter be not left to be handled diplomatically or at bureaucratic level," the SG asked. He also suggested that the SC could ask the Chief Justices of the HCs to head the benches dealing with the Covid management cases and PILs to bring in uniformity and judicial experience for passing orders that are capable of being implemented. Justices Saran and Gavai said the HCs may have been overenthusiastic in passing certain orders to provide succour to people suffering immensely during the Covid pandemic. However, it disapproved off-the-cuff remarks like ' the health system is in Ram Bharose (at the mercy of God)'. One HC has been constantly berating officials for living in 'ivory towers" and remaining oblivious to sufferings of commoners. "We may appreciate the efforts made by the Hcs in taking up matters relating to Covid management in various states. However, dealing with such matters, the HCs may have unwittingly overstepped and passed orders which are incapable of being implemented," it said. Referring to the Allahabad HC's May 17 order, the SC said, "these are some observations, which may be well meaning and may have been passed on the anxiety of the bench to do good for the general public, but apparently are incapable of being implemented." It asked the UP government to treat the order as advice and move towards implementing them in a phased manner. On the SG's request for entrusting CJs of the HCs to deal with Covid related cases, the SC said that CJ is the master of roster for the HC and he will decide which bench should hear a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hcs-shouldnt-pass-orders-which-are-impossible-to-implement-sc/articleshow/82844080.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The MSRTC security and vigilance officer, Somnath Tikotkar (48), registered a complaint relating to cheating and forgery against the driver, Ratan Lagad (41), from Beed after an inquiry established that he was not fit for driving buses because he had colour blindness. Tikotkar’s FIR said, “The MSRTC had appointed Lagad as driver at Parel bus terminus in Mumbai in March last year...Lagad was given a letter to get his eyes examined in an eye hospital at Bopodi on May 19.

---||Agra||Yamuna shockingly dirty, NGT directs Uttar Pradesh to look into discharge in river||AGRA: Contrary to the claims of National Mission for Clean Ganga that the work on sewerage has been completed in Vrindavan last year, National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday said that sewage and industrial effluents were still being discharged into the Yamuna from Kosi and Vrindavan and directed the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary to look into the matter and take remedial steps. As per the order, the water quality analysis conducted by the UP Pollution Control Board of the Yamuna in Vrindavan for January 2021 recorded biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels at 6.2 mg/L, almost double the maximum permissible levels of up to 3 mg/L. Besides, the total coliform bacteria were detected to be 68,000 MPN/100 ml, about 136 times higher than the maximum allowed levels of 500 MPN/100 ml and the fecal coliform was measured to be 31,000 MPN/100 ml, about 12.4 times higher than the maximum permissible levels of 2,500 MPN/100 ml. These findings are shocking as only two months ago thousands of people took a dip into these waters during the Vaishnav Kumbh event in Vrindavan between February 16 and March 27. However, in a letter dated July 23, 2020, officials of National Mission for Clean Ganga had stated that the work of the Vrindavan sewage project has been completed and the sewerage which was discharging into the Yamuna earlier by 11 drains of Vrindavan Nagar is being drained into the river only after treatment. According to the said letter, the completion date of the project was January 2021. The petitioners’ counsel, Akash Vashishtha, submitted that there were about 40 small and big channels, including 19 storm water drains carrying sewage and industrial effluents into the Yamuna in Vrindavan. “Almost the entire effluent load of Kosi town was falling into the Yamuna unabated. Even during the 40-day Kumbh period recently, sewage and effluents continued to flow into the Yamuna unabated wherein thousands of people performed aachmans and bathed in the same waters,” he told the green court. “Vrindavan is a highly visited spiritual and religious destination. Hundreds of people perform aachmans daily and take bath in the critically polluted waters of Yamuna. This is a serious issue. Despite this court’s directions to the chief secretary, central monitoring committee and the river rejuvenation committees on January 27 this year, all of them have failed to act and comply with the directions,” Vashishtha argued. The tribunal has also directed the monitoring committee, headed by former judge of the Allahabad high court, Justice SVS Rathore, to look into the matter and submit an independent report of the compliance status as on September 30, 2021. The matter is next listed for October 25. The court passed the order on a petition filed by Vrindavan Vaishnavs, Acharya Damodar Shastri and Vijay Kishor Goswami.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/yamuna-shockingly-dirty-ngt-directs-up-to-look-into-discharge-in-river/articleshow/82838487.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Modi on Wednesday approved assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for “immediate relief activities” in Gujarat after conducting an aerial survey of areas hit by cyclone “Tauktae” in the state. “Though ‘Tauktae’, unlike cyclone ‘Nisarga’, did not cause severe destructions in Maharashtra, there has been considerable damage to property in the state’s coastal areas. The PM should have visited the state,” said Pawar, who was in the city for the weekly Covid-19 review meeting. “The PM should have also announced assistance for all the states affected by cyclone “Tauktae” after assessment of the damage, as was done for Gujarat. Apart from Maharashtra, coastal states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Goa were affected by cyclone ‘Tauktae’,” he said. “It would have been nice if the PM, who is the head of the country, visited these states as well and announced the much-needed assistance. Financial assistance was announced for Gujarat, though there was no demand for it,” Pawar added. Ruling parties in the state on Wednesday had questioned why the PM did not visit Maharashtra and announced assistance only for Gujarat. CM Uddhav Thackeray visited the cyclone-hit villages in Sindhudurg to assess the damage and pledged relief once the assessment of losses was over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pm-should-have-visited-state-as-well-post-cyclone-dy-cm/articleshow/82840609.cms||---

The office of the district supply officer has also commenced the distribution of ration products to the cardholders simultaneously at the fair price shops.Shortly after forming the new government on May 7, chief minister M K Stalin had signed the order to provide the Covid-19 dole of Rs 4,000 to 2,07,66,950 rice cardholders in the state in two instalments. The government subsequently allotted Rs 4,153.39 crore to distribute the first instalment of Rs 2,000 immediately. The distribution process commenced on last Saturday.An official with the district supply officer’s office said, “There are 10.18 lakh rice cardholders in the district and we were allotted Rs 203.72 crore. As on Friday, we have distributed the dole to 9.40 lakh (more than 92%) beneficiaries. The distribution process is expected to be completed in another few days.”The district has 1,419 ration shops, which presently function only for four hours from 8am to 12pm. As the month-end is fast approaching, the official said they had started distributing ration products such as rice, sugar, wheat, palm oil and dal from Thursday. The distribution of ration products was stopped on Saturday as the officials were directed to prioritize the distribution of the Covid-19 dole in view of the complete lockdown. “We have to complete the distribution process before the month-end.”A ration shop staffer said most of the beneficiaries had received the financial aid. “Some people were waiting for the distribution process to near completion to avoid the crowd.

Since the second wave of the pandemic, 25,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 and 354 have succumbed to it A large heap of used PPE kits and biomedical waste was found dumped in the open near the post-mortem house at the state government owned SN Medical College here on Friday. Many patients of Agra and nearby districts suffering from various ailments other than Covid visit the SNMC along with caretakers daily and are exposed to the risk of contracting the infection. The hospital authorities claim that a private company entrusted with the task of collecting biomedical waste is collecting it daily. However, the heaps of biomedical waste indicates that proper disposal is not being practised. Attendants of patients claimed that they had seen hospital employees regularly throwing medical waste in the open. Often stray animals like dogs and monkeys scatter them about. Besides, ragpickers also come to collect the plastic waste. Dr Sanjay Kala, SNMC principal, said, “The post-mortem house does not fall in my jurisdiction. It is managed by the health department. However, I will look into the dumping of biomedical waste in the open.” He said, “We have a contract with a private company for the disposal of hazardous medical waste. All the medical waste generated at the hospital is collected in separate containers. It is sprayed with disinfectant and carried to a disposal facility. All the waste is taken out of the vehicle and again disinfected. Finally, all the waste is thrown in an electric furnace.” Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey said, “Dumping of PPE kits and biomedical waste in the open is a serious issue. It can result in rapid spread of Covid-19 and other diseases. We will ensure that the private company tasked for collection and disposal of biomedical waste performs efficiently.” Agra Mayor Naveen Jain said, “People are advised not to throw away the PPE kits and medical waste in the open. Civic body workers have been provided separate bags for the collection of such waste by reaching the doorstep. We will ensure that crematoriums are not littered with PPE kits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/used-ppe-kits-thrown-in-public-spaces-pose-risk-of-spreading-covid-19-in-agra/articleshow/82838539.cms||---

He had visited the hills on several occasions on invitation by the Save Nilgiris Campaign (SNC) to take part in their environment-oriented programmes in the late 80s.One of the early environmentalists of India, Bahuguna, apart from his deep commitment to the conservation of the natural environment of the Himalayas, had an abiding interest in the protection of the natural environment of the Western Ghats in general and the Nilgiris in particular.The Magsaysay award winner visited the Nilgiris on the invitation of the SNC and undertook an extensive tour of the Nilgiris for four days in November 1986, to assess the state of the environment of Nilgiris.He visited around 15 villages of Nilgiris to spread the conservation concerns among the people, according to B J Krishnan, senior environmental advocate and one of the conveners of the Save the Western Ghats Movement.More than 5,000 volunteers participated in the Save Nilgiris Run organised by the SNC in Ooty on May 18, 1988. Bahuguna who was then undergoing treatment in Coimbatore said in a message to the runners, “I hope the hill people will become a source of inspiration to all those who are striving to re-establish the long last harmonious relationship between man and nature.”Krishnan said, “Protection of the natural environment of the Nilgiris was close to the heart of Sunderlal Bahuguna. He always stood by us in our struggle in the cause of the conservation and participated in some of them.”He said, “Natural Nilgiris has lost a friend and the environmentalists their godfather”.The Chipco leader also came to the Nilgiris to visit the Janmam areas to save the forest lands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sundaralal-embraced-nilgiris-too-in-his-environmental-protection-fight/articleshow/82842618.cms||---

However, the cash-starved transport body has said it cannot pay till the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations help them. “We understand the problems faced by the PMPML, but MNGL is in a similar state. Due to the lockdowns, CNG-run vehicles on the roads have reduced drastically. We have issues from our vendors and suppliers. The transport body needs to ensure that they arrange for Rs 30 crore and also provide specific dates on clearing the rest for continued supply,” Deepak Sawant, director of the board of MNGL, told TOI on Friday. Shankar Pawar, director of the PMPML, said they were facing a cash crunch. “A total of Rs 43 crore was used for staff salaries. Buses have not been in full operation for over a year, and the current restrictions have made it worse. Both civic bodies have got no money to provide to the PMPML,” Pawar told TOI. PCMC’s standing committee chairman Nitin Landge said they have always provided their share of funds to the PMPML, but the transport body ignores their voices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-must-pay-at-least-rs-30-crore-for-steady-cng-supply-from-june-1/articleshow/82840616.cms||Joy Sengupta

UP has done maximum tests in the country," said Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath during his visit to Lakhimpur Kheri district on Friday to look after the arrangements at the Covid hospitals and the command centre. Addressing the local administration and BJP members, he said, “Vaccine is a security cover and we are thankful to PM Modi who has given two vaccines to us and now a third vaccine has also been launched. More vaccines will be available in July. Even the state government is ensuring the availability of vaccines to every citizen through global tenders. I request people from rural areas to ensure they administer vaccines. They don’t need to go out for vaccination as we will ensure the dose at service centres in every village where registration can also be done. We need to make people aware and our public representative will work on it and inspire the masses.” "We had 38,000 cases reported on April 24 and today there were 7.7k cases. Our recovery rate has improved significantly mainly because of rigorous campaigns in the rural and urban areas. We are on top with over 4.62 crore tests. We have given vaccines to over 1.60 crore people in the state. Screening of suspected Covid patients in rural areas is done by the monitoring committees.” “The fight against corona is a collective fight of the nation and our priority is to save the lives of all the people. We have to save lives and livelihood. The government has allowed industrial work during Covid curfew just to ensure the livelihood is not affected. We are also trying to make a Covid care centre and a helpdesk at all the industrial centres in the state. The poor will be given free ration [foodgrains] under the PM Garib Kalyan Package from May 20. Around 17 crore will benefit under the scheme," the CM added. Mentioning about the Covid condition in Kheri, the CM said, “There are nearly 1,400 active cases in Kheri and 4% positive at the moment. We will increase testing in Kheri. Efforts were made to ensure oxygen supply at district hospital and community health centres by public representatives in Kheri which is commendable.” Chief medical officer Manoj Agarwal told TOI, “The monitoring committee has also been tasked to convince people from rural areas for vaccination. We are setting up common centres in all villages for registration. We are told that vaccination is the priority of the government as they want to ensure everyone is vaccinated before the next wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-controlled-covid-through-testing-says-cm-yogi/articleshow/82838588.cms||---

The accused have been identified as Shekhar Pariyar and Ashok Singh. The fake website was a clone of the original one with similar colours, logos and layout. The accused were charging people anything between Rs 4,000-6,000 for vaccination by giving them payment links on the site. As soon it came to their notice, police got the website blocked. The accused were nabbed later based on technical surveillance. Pariyar was arrested from Siliguri, West Bengal, after the cops tracked transactions of over Rs 40 lakh to his account. Singh was arrested from Uttarakhand. On Friday, Delhi Police also tweeted an advisory asking people to only use the authentic, government specified portals to register for vaccination. “As we take precaution against #Covid, we must take against #CovidFraud. #Fake vaccination sites found duping ppl. #DelhiPolice urges dont click on fake sites, links. Protect ur money & data. Only log in thru https://t.co/FE7DdUQBCl or CoWin/ArogyaSetu App #StayAlertStaySafe,” it tweeted (sic).

DCP Santosh Meena said that his teams started tracking the suspect, Chieuikem Daniel, after he duped a man named Mohsin in the name of providing Remdesivir injections. He asked for Rs 25,000 for each injection and took Rs 10,000 as advance.

---||Coimbatore||District records 3rd highest test positivity rate||Coimbatore: At 29.9%, the district, which logged 3,243 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Friday, had the third highest test positivity rate in the state after Theni and Chengalpattu for the seven-day period that ended on Wednesday. This means at least three of every 10 samples, which were collected from May 13 to 19, had tested positive for the virus.It is to be noted that Theni and Chengalpattu are rural areas, with much smaller geographical areas and population.As per the data available with the health department, the test positivity rate was only 11.2% in the district during the seven-day period from April 22 to 28. It gradually rose to 16.7% from April 29 to May 5, and then to 25.7% from May 6 to 12, before climbing to 29.9% lately. Authorities were testing only 10,000-odd samples a day even when the daily caseload crossed the 3,000-mark. It was only after the test positivity rate zoomed past 30%, the health department instructed private labs to increase the number of samples for testing. And they have been testing more than 12,700 samples daily since Wednesday.In fact, none of the other big cities in the state, including Trichy, Madurai, Salem and Chennai, have crossed the test positivity rate of 25% till date. While Chennai’s highest test positivity rate was 23.1% last week, Trichy recorded 23.7% this week. Madurai’s highest test positivity rate stands at 14.4%, which it recorded this week.City health officer Dr S Raja said, “This is because Madurai and Trichy are two weeks behind us in this (second) wave. Bengaluru, at its peak, saw a positivity rate of 52%. But in the district, the test positivity rate has begun dropping to less than 25% and the results will be seen by next week-end.”While the rural areas such as Theni, Nagapattinam and Thoothukudi could afford to test lower number of samples, the same practice in an industrial and densely populated area such as Coimbatore is alarming. “This simply means we are not tracing and testing enough contacts. We are testing hardly three people per positive case, while an infected person could transmit the virus to a minimum of 2.4 people and a maximum of 400 people this time around. Many infected contacts may be spreading the virus without realizing the same,” an official, who didn’t want to be identified, said.Presently, the district has 29,345 active Covid-19 cases. Of the 1,31,744 people who were tested positive for the virus in the district till date, 1,01,432 of them, including the 2,244 patients who were discharged on Friday, have recovered. The recovery rate has plunged to a new low of 76.99%.The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, rose to 967 with another 25 people succumbing to the virus in the district. This is the highest-ever single-day toll the district has recorded so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-records-3rd-highest-test-positivity-rate/articleshow/82842649.cms||---

The triazole anti-fungal drug, which has been launched under the PosaOne brand by MSN, has been priced at Rs 600 for each 100mg delayed release tablet and Rs 8,500 for the 300mg injection each, the company said on Friday. The company said it has developed the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as well as the formulation of PosaOne at its in-house R&D and manufacturing units. Pointing out that many patients recovering from Covid-19 have been detected with the rare and deadly fungal infection, the company said with the mortality rates on the rise, accessibility of anti-fungal medication is an unmet deficit in these testing times, which the company is looking to address. The drug was recently approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and matches up to international quality standards, the company said. MSN’s portfolio of Covid-19 treatment drugs includes favipiravir in 200mg, 400mg and 800mg tablet form and baricitinib, for which it recently entered into a royalty-free, non-exclusive voluntary licencing agreement with Eli Lilly. In fact, MSN rolled out the world’s most affordable favipiravir under the Favilow brand at Rs 33 per tablet of 200mg in August last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/msn-rolls-out-black-fungus-drug-in-india/articleshow/82842748.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Leakage in the pipeline accompanied by heavy rainfall in Jaipur in the last few days made the roads prone to cracks. Traffic and water supply to the areas near Amrapali Circle in Vaishali Nagar remained impacted. The first pipeline burst on Thursday evening, while the administration was busy repairing it, on Friday morning, another pipeline just three metres away from the old place burst due to which the road cracked and caved in. Around 50,000 people near Amrapali Circle didn’t receive water in the morning. Praveen Yadav, councillor of ward 54 said, “In my own house there was no water in the morning. I really hope this situation and frequent leakage in pipeline gets resolved. People complained to me about the situation on main road, but due to lockdown they didn’t face lot of problems.” Executive engineer of PHED Devendra Singh said, “The pipeline burst at two places on Thursday and Friday. The pipeline in the area is 30 years old and sometimes cracks appear which ultimately damage the road. It took us a while to lay down a new 10-metre duct pipeline over there which has more durability. The water supply was restored by evening.” The cemented pipeline in the entire city was laid down over 30 years ago, but their time period is over and there is a need to change those to duct lines, which have a longer duration. The plan is on the table, but budget constraints and time to change the pipeline in the entire city are delaying the process. Over the years, many such incidences have occurred in the entire city due to the outdated pipelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/road-caves-in-at-two-spots-near-citys-amrapali-circle/articleshow/82842704.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Natco kicks off molnupiravir phase 3 trials on mild cases||HYDERABAD: Soon after the drug regulator granted approval for conducting phase III clinical trials of anti-viral drug molnupiravir on patients suffering from mild Covid-19 disease, Hyderabad-based pharma player Natco Pharma kicked off the trials in Hyderabad on Friday. The first patient was dosed with molnupiravir, an influenza drug being studied for use on non-hospitalised Covid-19 patients, at Yashoda hospitals, Somajiguda in Hyderabad. The company has also tied up with other hospitals like Gleneagles Global Hospitals and Excel Hospital as well as KIMS Hospital in Secunderabad and Vizag for the trials, which are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in mild Covid-19 patients. The trials will be conducted on around 1,200 patients at 32 centres in nearly 10 cities across the country, Dr Praveen Myneni, medical officer, Natco Pharma told TOI. According to Dr Myneni, around 600 patients suffering from mild Covid-19 who are already undergoing standard treatment will be dosed with molnupiravir, while the remaining 600 participating in the trial would be only getting standard Covid-19 treatment. Each patient will be given a bottle of molnupiravir containing 40 capsules of 200mg each. As per the prescribed regimen, the patient will have to take 800mg (200mg x 4 capsules) twice a day for five days, he explained. A Yashoda spokesman said the patient volunteers will not be admitted in the hospital as it is a OPD (out-patient department) based clinical trial, and will have regular interactions with their physicians at the hospital. “Pre-clinical data has shown that Molnupiravir has broad anti-influenza activity, including highly potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Patients treated with molnupiravirachieved response within five days of therapy, indicating that the duration of treatment is short, with the additional advantage of being an oral therapy,” Natco Pharma said. Natco had earlier told the regulator that it is geared up for production of the drug and if given emergency approval for compassionate use on patients given the surge in cases, can start churning out doses at short notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/natco-kicks-off-molnupiravir-phase-3-trials-on-mild-cases/articleshow/82842775.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Chandigarh||Hospitality industry push for lifting restrictions citing huge losses||Ludhiana: Hospitality industry of Ludhiana is facing huge losses due to Covid restrictions. According to hotel, banquet, marriage palace business owners, the current restrictions are the most strict since last year when lockdowns started and as a result huge losses are being suffered by the industry. The businessmen are of the view that if restrictions are not lifted, it will also prove to be a setback to the state government, as taxes will come down by huge proportion. Amarveer Singh, president of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana said, “The present lockdown restrictions that have been in place for almost three weeks now have caused unprecedented losses to the hospitality sector. The restrictions like only allowing 10 people for marriages and other functions, taking permission for marriages, weekend lockdowns have impacted the businesses. Every hospitality unit, be it a small restaurant, hotel or marriage palace, has suffered losses and as a result everyone is forced to reduce the manpower. Hundreds of people have already lost their jobs and there are small-time entrepreneurs like florists, decorators and event managers who have shutdown their businesses and went back home.” Singh also added, “We are helpless as we cannot do anything to change the situation until the harsh restrictions are done away with. How does the government thinks a business owner will be able to make enough money to pay his staff and pay expenses like power if he is only allowed to do functions for 10 people? Time is running out for our industry, especially hotels and marriage palaces that have huge fixed expenses on maintenance and upkeep but have shutdown temporarily due to no business. The day is not far when majority of these units will shutdown permanently if the restrictions are not eased at the earliest. Moreover, government is also facing huge drop in the revenue collections due to huge drop in number of functions and reduction of people allowed to attend these.” According to Shiv Shankar Rai, general secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers & Welfare Association (PTDA), who also owns a hotel, “Due to current situation, it is very likely that we might survive the pandemic but we — our staff and families — might starve to death due to losses. Government should understand that wedding industry is not a one man show, there are hundreds of people connected with one function alone. There is a complete chain of entrepreneurs like event managers, marriage palace owners, speciality lighting, florists, decorators, special food caterers, housekeeping staff, security services and valet services. In addition to this, everyone has staff and workers which means a single wedding function runs so many houses. So in the wake of current restrictions when about 90% of functions are not taking place, condition of people attached to the hospitality sector is getting from bad to worse. State government needs to assess the ground reality and capping of 10 persons should be increased to 100 at least or fixed at 50% of the total capacity of the venue. If government does not want to do anything then it should get ready for mass closure of hotels, marriage palaces and banquet halls in Ludhiana.” According to S S Makkar, marriage palace owner and president of PTDA, “With wedding industry coming to a standstill, livelihoods of so many people have been impacted and soon there will be record lay-offs. We, therefore, urge the government to lift the restrictions from our industry or else announce a special package for us which should cover our expenses and compensation for our staff and other people working in the industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hospitality-industry-push-for-lifting-restrictions-citing-huge-losses/articleshow/82845917.cms||Mohit Behl

In reply to the writ by Bhuvnesh Sharma, commissioner Nagar Nigam Bharatpur, said the state government made available 60 ventilators to Bharatpur though the capacity at government hospital, Bharatpur, is only 40. He said the 40 ventilators were fitted reserving 20 each for Covid and non-Covid patients. In the remaining 20 ventilators, one was non-functional. Meanwhile, Jindal Super Speciality hospital, Bharatpur, approached the authorities for making available five idle ventilators for emergency use for Covid. The CMHO issued orders to this effect. At that time, there were no guidelines from the government. The government meanwhile took a policy decision on May 11 to allot excess ventilators to private hospitals on condition that private hospitals will not charge for the same. Following the government policy, the district collector constituted a committee to ascertain the number of patients who used the ventilator and amount charged by Jindal hospital. The committee found that 18 patients used the ventilators from April 27 to May 13 and the hospital charged Rs 9,000 per day.

Addressing a virtual ‘MSME Dialogue Series’ programme organized by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) on Friday, Dushyant said small industries in the state are growing due to the presence of big industries like JCB, Maruti, Flipkart, ATL and Honda. Chautala said the Haryana government has taken a historic step in the form of new industrial policy ‘Haryana Enterprises and Employment Policy 2020’ to increase investment and employment in the state. Under this policy, the state government is working towards doubling exports, he added. He said due to the new industrial policy, ATL will set up a mega plant on about 178 acres in Sohna and Flipkart will set up the largest and most high-tech warehouse in Asia on about 140 acres in Haryana. Besides, many big companies like Amaron are showing interest in investing in the state. He said that the arrival of these big mother units will give a boost to the MSMEs of the state too. The deputy CM said there are about 9.70 lakh MSMEs in the state and about 20 lakh people are getting employment through them. He said to promote MSMEs, the state has established a world-class system which allows MSMEs to start operation in 15 days. Chautala also said that the state government is providing exemption to MSMEs, special exemption for upgrade of liquid oxygen plants and assistance to all manufacturing industries related to health.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: CMCH predicts 3rd wave in Oct-Nov, says 2nd wave peaked around May 15||LUDHIANA: As the number of daily cases is witnessing a drop in Ludhiana, an analysis by Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) indicates that the district has crossed Covid peak around May 15 and cases are expected to come down drastically by June end subject to people following Covid norms. The projections have been made by preventive and social medicine department of CMCH, said a doctor on conditions of anonymity. He added that projections are based on recent available data. “After touching peak, the cases are declining now but the decrease is expected to be gradual. Systemic lockdown imposed by authorities helped in flattening the curve or cases wouldn’t have been checked. However, fall in cases will depend on people’s behaviour towards the pandemic and vaccination. If vaccination increases and people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing and practice cough etiquettes, the active cases will fall substantially by June end,” said a doctor involved in the finding. “A third wave is expected around October or November. It is expected that during the probable third wave, rural and young population are likely to get affected more. Children too can get the infection in such wave like it was seen when 11% cases comprised below 18-years-old age group when the schools were opened, which later dropped to less than 2% because of cases from other population.” He explained that a gap of six months is expected between two the waves, as the antibodies developed in those infected last for six months after which there are chances of people contracting the disease again. The team also factored in unseasonal rains that has raised the risk of dengue in July. He added that both dengue and Covid can run together so the authorities need to keep that in mind. “Normally, dengue season is around September, but due to unseasonal rains it may come early in July so both of them need to be managed simultaneously by the authorities,” said the doctor. “Systemic lockdown did help in flatting of the curve and cases are dropping because of that. However, the authorities need to vaccinate as many people as possible and people also need to follow Covid norms,” said Dr Clarence Samuel, head of the preventive and social medicine department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cmch-predicts-3rd-wave-in-oct-nov-says-2nd-wave-peaked-around-may-15/articleshow/82846141.cms||Shariq Majeed

Their quirky banter started with the minister “suspecting” the member of Parliament of “pakka” playing a role in coming up with the “unpronounceable” names of medicines being prescribed to treat Covid-19 and ‘black fungus’ — “Posaconazole, Cresemba, Lipsomal Amphoterecin...And the list goes on...” Tharoor, of course, pleaded “not guilty” to this charge. “How can you indulge in such floccinaucinihiliplification @KTRTRS,” he tweeted, in classic Tharoor style, leaving not just the neta but even followers (on both sides) go looking for their dictionaries or hit Google search! “Left to me, I’d happily call them “CoroNil”, “CoroZero” & even “GoCoronaGo”!” the MP further wrote – his dig at Patanjali’s ‘Coronil’ not lost on the Telangana minister. Tharoor’s reference to pharmacists being “more procrustean”—also googled multiple times—drew an almost immediate, and hilarious, reaction from KTR. “Devudaaaa...had to pull out a dictionary & Tharoorosaurus to comprehend,” he said, bringing much-needed comic relief to Twitter users from an otherwise disconcerting phase.

The court observed that the prosecution had objected to granting the accused bail merely because investigation was on and there was a possibility of the prosecution witnesses being pressurised. “However, there is no reason mentioned for which custodial detention is required,” the court said. The court said considering the nature of the offence, the husband’s plea for release on bail could be allowed subject to stringent conditions. The husband was directed to attend the police station once a week. All accused were directed not to leave Maharashtra without the court’s prior permission. The woman had alleged soon after the wedding her husband began demanding money. She alleged her in-laws too started taunting her and that she was forced to return to her parental home and bring more money and gold. The woman alleged her husband was in the habit of watching porn and he used to commit natural and unnatural sex with her against her wish. The husband and his family denied the allegations. The husband pointed out in court that the website she claimed he was addicted to had been shut down in 2015, four years before they got married. He further said since he was a doctor, his services were essential during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doctor-accused-of-rape-harassment-by-wife-gets-bail/articleshow/82844256.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Chandigarh||Pak artist’s Guru Nanak sculpture tweet draws SGPC’s ire||Amritsar: After the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) asked Pakistan-based Hindu sculptor Fakeero Kaantheso to delete a tweet on the sculpture of the first Sikh master, Guru Nanak Dev, Kaantheso took the plea that the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee had never objected to such sculptures and such creations were being sold in India, too. Following the SGPC’s warning of legal action if he failed to delete the tweet, the sculptor later tweeted, "I didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings". On Thursday night, Kaantheso, the youngest Pakistani Hindu to have received the coveted civilian award, Tamagha-I-Imtiaz, had tweeted a photograph of a sculpture of Guru Nanak Dev that he had made. On Friday, the SGPC objected to this and tweeted, tagging Fakeero, "We urge you to take down this photo of the sculpture immediately as you may attract a legal action for making a sculpture of Guru Nanak Sahib, which is against the principles of Sikh faith..." Fakeero, while talking to TOI over the phone from Pakistan on Friday, said, "There are hundreds of marble sculptures of Guru Nanak Dev on sale in India… Besides, several online stores are selling marble statues of the first Sikh master." He added, "Followers of Baba Nanak from across Pakistan come to me and place orders and install these at their place of worship, so where am I wrong? If SGPC has any objection, it should contact those who got the sculpture made." Fakeero had not deleted the controversial tweet till the time of filing this story, however, he sent a tweet saying, "Please accept my apologies for making the statue of Guru Nanak. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings. I have not worked on the statue from my imagination but by using references from other statues and pictures by various artists. My intentions have never been to hurt anyone." Fakeero’s grandfather belonged to Sanawad Gram, near Indore, in Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pak-artists-guru-nanak-sculpture-tweet-draws-sgpcs-ire/articleshow/82842846.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Aurangabad||Covid patient ends life in Beed; hospital bill was too much: Kin||Aurangabad: A 35-year-old man, undergoing treatment at a private Covid hospital in Beed city, committed suicide by hanging himself in the wee hours of Friday.Following the incident, the family of the deceased has claimed that the man was worried about the hefty bill being charged by the hospital for the treatment and said they were not in a position to make the payment. They also claimed that hospital staff were insisting on immediate payment of the outstanding amount of Rs 1 lakh.The deceased, Ramling Sanap, was a sugarcane cutter by profession and belonged to Tandalachi Wadi in Kej tehsil of the district. A case of accidental death has been registered by Shivajinagar police station.Sanap’s wife Vijaymala said, “I used to talk to my husband over the phone several times in a day. He was worried about the payment of bill and was constantly being nagged by the hospital administration for clearing the bill.”She added, “We paid a sum of Rs 50,000, but the hospital was seeking another Rs 1 lakh. We own two acre of land and I was already in talks to lease the land and get the money for his treatment.”Hospital management, however, refuted the allegations. Dr Shirish Dahiphale said, “The patient had almost recovered and was to be discharged in a day. He was caught on the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras while stepping out of the ward where he was under treatment and later hanging himself to an iron grill.”Sanap’s brother-in-law Pramod Morale blamed the hospital for failing to take proper care of the patients and frequently nagging the patients for clearing the bill. “Apart from taking bulk amount as advance, we were being made to spend around Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000 every day,” he said.Last year in September, a 42-year-old Covid patient had ended his life by jumping from the fourth floor of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Aurangabad.During the preliminary probe, it was found that the man plunged to death from the window of ward number 34. He was admitted to GMCH on September 21. However, after his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to ICU on September 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-patient-ends-life-in-beed-hospital-bill-was-too-much-kin/articleshow/82836470.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Madurai||HC dismisses plea by fireman challenging his transfer order||Madurai: Observing that the court cannot interfere in transfer orders except in rare cases where the transfer has been made in the vindictive manner, the Madras high court dismissed a plea moved by a fireman challenging his transfer order.The petitioner P S Ramesh was appointed as fireman in 1996 and served more than 25 years. Currently, he is working as fireman at Uthamapalayam fire station in Theni district for a period of 20 years. The petitioner had given a complaint against the station fire officer. Following this complaint, an order dated December 17, 2020, was issued to the petitioner transferring him to Ramanathapuram fire station on administrative grounds.Challenging his transfer order, the petitioner had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench stating that the order was passed to punish him as he had sent a complaint against the station fire officer. The court had disposed of the petition by directing the authorities to consider the representation. Since the authorities have passed an order rejecting his request without hearing the petitioner, Ramesh had filed this present petition challenging the rejection order.Justice V M Velumani observed that the petitioner has been working at his native place for over 20 years. Pursuant to the earlier order of this court, the authorities have considered his representation and rejected the same by giving valid reasons. A reading of the order shows that the petitioner was transferred on administrative ground.“Transfer is an incident of service and is made in administrative exigencies. Normally, it is not to be interfered with by the courts. This court consistently has been taking a view that orders of transfer should not be interfered with except in rare cases where the transfer has been made in the vindictive manner,” observed the judge.Taking into account that fact that the transfer order was passed on administrative grounds, the judge dismissed the petition citing that there is no infirmity or illegality in the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-by-fireman-challenging-his-transfer-order/articleshow/82842891.cms||---

He reported back to Rohtak’s Sunaria jail by Friday evening. The dera chief, imprisoned in Rohtak’s Sunaria jail after his conviction in cases of rape and murder, was granted parole to meet mother Naseeb Kaur on October 24 last year too. This time, the high-profile convict sought emergency parole from Sunaria jail superintendent on Monday. The Rohtak jail authorities wrote to Haryana police to find out the health of his mother and also asked the cops to evaluate the application in terms of law and order and to issue a ‘no-objection certificate,’ if found satisfactory. The dera chief left for Gurgaon at 6 am on Friday in police custody and after meeting his mother returned to Sunaria jail. Rohtak jail superintendent Suneel Sangwan told TOI that one-day emergency parole from sunrise to sunset was granted to the convict Ram Rahim to meet his mother. He was sent in police custody and reported back by sunset, Sangwan added. A special court in August 2017 had sentenced Ram Rahim to 20-year imprisonment for raping two women, he was sentenced to 10 years each for the two cases. The terms would run consecutively. In January 2019, he and three others was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a journalist over 16 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/on-parole-dera-chief-meets-mother/articleshow/82842889.cms||Sat Singh

In a message to media, Rawat sought to be excused from interactions, citing problems in speaking after his recovery from Covid. Meanwhile, most Punjab Congress MLAs who have been holding meetings to exert pressure on the chief minister to take decisive action on sacrilege cases too are keen on getting a hearing from Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi, instead of sending observers to the state. “There have been a lot of speculation, but there is still no formal communication from the party’s central leadership,” said a senior Congress leader.

---||Madurai||HC quashes FIR against cartoonist Bala for controversial cartoon||Madurai: The Madras high court has quashed an FIR registered against cartoonist G Balamurugan alias Bala on the ground that there was no criminality involved in the case.Bala posted a cartoon on his Facebook page to express his anger and grief over the self-immolation of four members of a family on Tirunelveli collectorate premises on October 23, 2017, after being troubled by a money lender demanding exorbitant interests.The cartoon depicted the then chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, then Tirunelveli district collector Sandeep Nanduri and then Tirunelveli city commissioner of police Kapil Kumar Sarathkar in an “inappropriate manner”.Based on the complaint of the collector, a case was registered against him by the district crime branch police. He was arrested, and a court released him on bail. Bala filed the present petition before Madurai bench of the high court in 2017, seeking to quash the FIR. Justice G Ilangovan observed that freedom of thought, expression and speech are the foundations upon which democracy survives, without which there can be no democracy and, therefore, no evolution of the human society. However, freedom of thought and expression is subject to the limitations that have been set out in the Article 19(2) of our Constitution.Quoting Benjamin Franklin’s words in 1722 about freedom of speech and expression, the judge said that even after the passage of several centuries, the debate still goes on and will go on endlessly.The judge said the petitioner wanted to express his anger and grief over the inability of the administration, both the executive and police, in containing the collection of exorbitant interest by money lenders.“The perception of looking at the cartoon differs from person to person depending on their ability to see a particular event in a particular dimension. The cartoon was only with reference to the inability of the authorities to act in the aid of the society. So here, the intention of the petitioner is not to defame the authorities, but to expose the gravity of the issue involved,” observed the judge.Citing that this cannot be construed as an intention to indulge in obscenity or defamation, the judge observed that no criminality was involved in this cartoon. Though it might involve ethical questions, the court cannot teach the ethicality to the people and it is for the society to evolve and follow the ethical standards.Hence, the judge quashed the FIR against the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-quashes-fir-against-cartoonist-bala-for-controversial-cartoon/articleshow/82842886.cms||Kaushik Kannan

On Thursday, a delegation of Nagpur IMA and VHA office bearers met Nagpur municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, and additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma and expressed their desire to stop Covid duties. The administration has not issued an official statement for or against the doctors so far. However, NMC released a new order seeking detailed information about insured patients served in private hospitals under various insurance schemes in the last five months. Hospitals have been given seven days to submit this information. In short, the administration is in no mood to listen to the hospitals and they have to continue to work as Epidemic Act has been imposed. Dr Sanjay Deotale, president of IMA Nagpur, said doctors are not getting appreciated for their job. “Leave aside a word of appreciation, now doctors are being threatened with penal action and multiple authorities are flooding them with orders to send varied reports, formats, details, data through emails, hard copies, and WhatsApp groups,” he said. VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat said hospitals cannot function under such administrative overload. “The hospitals were not worried about giving Covid care, but are harassed by the administrative interference seeking confidential data in various formats. The already-taxed hospital personnel are hassled not by clinical duties but by this paperwork,” he added. “One should check the cost incurred on each Covid patients per day in government establishments before pointing fingers at private hospitals,, who are forced to run on capped charges for 80% beds,”said Dr Anil Laddhad, member of Maharashtra Medical Council. VHA convener Dr Anup Marar alleged there is no support from the government in the form of any assistance, subsidies, or grants to private hospitals. “In fact, hospital registration and biomedical waste disposal charges were increased multi-fold. The hospitals are directed to serve within capped charges, and pay from their own pockets for increasing oxygen charges,” he said.

South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri inaugurated the centre in presence of SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti. The ward has 12 oxygen cylinders and 14 concentrators. “To begin with, 25 beds will be available. We have separate entrances for reaching the centre so that the normal activities at the hospital won’t get affected,” said a senior SDMC official. An order on Wednesday by special secretary, department of health and family welfare, gave permissions to run the facility. However, the hospital was told to put forward a separate proposal for oxygen to OSD (H&FW) Oxygen Cell, arrange for consumables like PPE kits, pillow covers and bedsheets along with a laundry facility, and set up a system for dealing of Covid-positive bodies as per existing protocols. “The hospital is linked to Lok Nayak Hospital for treatment of patients who get serious and for the purpose of providing medical logistics and support like oxygen concentrator and cylinders,” stated the order. To arrange for sufficient staff for the already running vaccination centre at this hospital and Covid ward, the civic agency discontinued regular OPDs for ENT, eye, dental and physiotherapy. “However, the OPD at the maternity and child welfare ward is fully operational,” said the official. “We pursued Delhi government for permission for over 20 days and kept sending reminders.” Residents, however, argue that the decision has been taken at a time when beds are relatively easy to avail at other facilities. “The decision might affect the regular operation of the hospital due to diversion of healthcare staff,” said PK Paul, secretary of East Bengal Displaced Persons Association, CR Park. “Ideally, the facility should have started earlier when cases were coming in large numbers in April. We even wrote to Delhi government in this regard a month back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/s-corpns-covid-facility-opens-after-fortnights-wait-for-nod/articleshow/82842911.cms||Vibha Sharma

Many times, patients recover before he or she consumes all the medicines prescribed by their doctors. Some of the medicines are costly, which poor people suffering from the same disease cannot afford. Hence, this initiative has been taken. So far, only a few NGOs have started the initiative in the state. This will be the first time that any civic body or government agency will take up the initiative of medicine bank.P Siva Sankar, the civic chief of Solapur Municipal Corporation said, “At least one of our family members is suffering from some disease or long term ailment. We can afford the medicines as prescribed by the doctors. Many times, the medicines are left unused. In such condition, we tend to throw them. As part of this initiative, the recovered patient can donate it to us so that we can give the costly medicines free of cost to the poor people who need it.”Sankar said a donation box will be kept in all 15 urban health centres of the municipal corporation. The medicines donated will be segregated and arranged by doctors according to the ailments. “We have appealed to the citizens not to donate the medicines, which are already expired. They need to check the expiry date before donating the medicines,” said Sankar.Poor people seeking the medicines have to approach the urban health centres and get themselves screened by the doctors before they get the medicines. Many poor patients due to the high cost of medicines do not undergo treatment and have to face further medical complications. The urban health centres provide primary medical care and patients rely on private hospitals for secondary and tertiary medical care. The prescriptions from the private hospitals for the ongoing treatment will be sufficient to avail free medicines donated to the medicine bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/solapur-civic-body-to-start-medicine-bank/articleshow/82836508.cms||---

It has also been decided to set up oxygen plants even in community health centres across the state. The decision was taken by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy during a review meeting on Covid-19 situation in the state at his Tadepalli camp office on Friday. Jagan told officials to ensure that every hospital with more than 50 beds is made self-sufficient in oxygen supply in the next four months. He also asked them to gear up for the impending third wave which is likely to hit children, as predicted by experts. “Every single hospital in the state should have a dedicated oxygen generator. They should at least produce oxygen to the extent of meeting their own requirements. Ensure the facilities are in place in all government hospitals. For private hospitals, the government can offer incentives or subsidies to encourage their managements to become self-sufficient as far as oxygen supply is concerned. No hospital should depend on external sources for survival. Apart from hospitals producing oxygen for their own consumption, we are also sourcing additional oxygen from various other quarters as well,” Jagan said. Several health experts have voiced concern over children likely to become the most vulnerable section in the third wave of the virus, he said, and added that unavailability of vaccines for this age group further adds to the concern. The chief minister asked health authorities to ramp up facilities for children with special focus on paediatric ICU facilities and closely track the same. Amid the deadly pandemic, it is important to note that the state government is providing free treatment to a mammoth 77 per cent of Covid-19 and black fungus patients under YSR Arogyasri. As on date, out of 38,763 patients being treated in various hospitals across the state, as many as 28,189 are being provided free treatment under the scheme, officials told the chief minister. They also explained the measures undertaken to control the impact of black fungus. Apart from forming an expert committee to monitor, allocate and advise on the availability of drugs and facilities, orders have been placed for all drugs prescribed by doctors to ensure that there is no shortage in future, the CM was informed. As many as 17 hospitals have been identified across the state for treatment of black fungus, depending on the availability of expertise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/all-covid-hosps-to-have-o2-plants-in-4-mths-cm/articleshow/82839000.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Ranchi||Most of missing oxygen cylinders recovered, says Hazaribag SP||HAZARIBAG: Hazaribag SP Karthik S on Friday said that a major chunk of the oxygen cylinders at Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital (HMCH), which allegedly went missing, have been traced and recovered. “We have recovered 264 of the 349 missing D type jumbo oxygen cylinders and 61 of the 104 small oxygen cylinders. The rest will be recovered soon,” the SP said. Karthik, however, did not disclose the identities of the people who allegedly purchased the cylinders from HMCH’s ward boy Suresh Yadav and others, saying that secrecy was vital for the future course of their ongoing investigation. Besides Yadav, another ward boy named Mohammad Asif was arrested for allegedly selling the oxygen cylinders to the relatives of Covid-19 patients. On May 16, HMCH’s medical superintendent had lodged an FIR at the sadar police station, alleging that oxygen cylinders went missing from the hospital premises. A special investigation team, headed by Karthik himself, is looking into the case. “After visiting a refiling factory in Demotand, we concluded that the number of cylinders, which was claimed by the hospital management, was exaggerated and that they had no idea about the exact number of cylinders which went missing,” the SP claimed. The HMCH had claimed that 349 jumbo cylinders, 104 small cylinders and 65 oxygen cylinder regulators had gone missing. The cops claimed that several relatives and those who allegedly purchased the cylinders from the ward boys have dumped them in the hospital campus to evade identification and arrest. “We have obtained the CCTV footage from the hospital and started identifying the people who supplied the cylinders outside the hospital. Five people have been detained in this regard,” Karthik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/most-of-missing-oxygen-cylinders-recovered-hazaribag-sp/articleshow/82840214.cms||---

On Friday, a team of health officials visited market places in the city and gave out special invitation cards to the vendors. As many as 500 vendors were given the cards. “They can turn up at the centre with the card by filling up details and get vaccinated,” district epidemiologist Dr Pawan Kumar said. The special camp for vendors will be held at Agrasen Bhawan in Sector-1 while those for drug store owners and their employees will be held at Milan Bhawan in Sector-4, civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak told TOI. Rajesh Kumar, a vegetable vendor in Chas, said, “I am happy to get the invitation card. It was a warm gesture as we generally are a neglected lot.” Kumar intends to take his wife along with him for the jabs. Kanchan Kumari, a district health official, said, “Vegetable and fruit vendors come in contact with people every day and run a great risk of getting infected. A special camp for them will help to prevent the spread of the infection. We have laid effort to make more and more vendors visit the camp by giving invitation card to them. We will also sensitise the importance of vaccination to the vendors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-invitation-cards-given-to-vendors-drug-store-workers/articleshow/82840229.cms||Divy Khare

They all were desperately hoping to get some news about Kadar Sorathiya (40), the man of the house. He was missing from Jafrabad harbour in Amreli district since Tuesday morning. When TOI team visited the Sorathiya home, the family members were hopeful that Kadar will be back soon. Nobody from their community had the heart to tell them that they were hoping against hope. Local community leader Umar Natupali too advised the TOI team not to express doubt about Kadar’s survival. “The family would not be able to tolerate the pain,” Natupali said. “I have three daughters but the youngest one is very close to her father. She is refusing to have food without him. I have nobody to earn in the family,” Alarakhi told TOI. But within an hour of that meeting Alarakhi’s world came crashing down around her. Reports came that three bodies have been found some three kms away from where Kadar went missing. “Kadar’s body is badly decomposed and stinking. It’s very hard to identify him,” said the man who found the body. Early on Tuesday morning Kadar went to tie the boat at the jetty as the wind speed decreased, his family informed. The boats that are anchored during the cyclone needs to retied to protect them from drowning or colliding with other boats.“There were four persons in the boat that capsized including Kadar, who didn’t know swimming. Fellow ‘khalasis’ told us that he drowned,” Natupali said. Kadar’s other two daughters Antasha and Kashmira, both yet to cross the age of 10, study at government primary school. His father, who worked as a labourer, had died four months ago. Chetan Shiyal, a local political leader from Jafrabad, said that many fishermen are yet to be traced. “Eight fishermen have died and many more are missing. The collector office is asking us about the number of missing persons but it’s difficult to arrive at an exact figure as many boats from Shiyal Beyt operate at the Jafrabad coast. The mobile network is down since past four days and so the fishermen’s families whose members are missing are ot able to contact us,” Shiyal said. “This (Jafrabad) is a fishermen’s harbour. Before the cyclone we had requested the district administration to park these barges somewhere else but they did not listen to us and that caused a lot of damage,” Shiyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/5-year-old-prayed-for-her-father-cyclone-merciless/articleshow/82837645.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ranchi||Black fungus cases cross 300-mark, Jharkhand doctors plead for key medicines||RANCHI: With cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) crossing the 300-mark in Jharkhand, doctors are sending out an SOS on social media, urging the state authorities to procure the required medicines, which are mainly anti-fungal drugs, for they are depleting fast. A city-based doctor, who has appealed to the government to replenish the depleting stock of medicines on social media, said, “I know more than 24 patients who are currently admitted at various hospitals and haven’t received the required medication till Thursday. How are we going to fight the disease if we do not have the drugs?” On Friday, three patients died of black fungus at Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur. According to hospital sources, they succumbed to the infection as they couldn’t get the medicines on time. According to TMH sources, a total of seven patients admitted at the hospital are suspected to be suffering from mucormycosis. The hospital management has now requested the state government to provide them the required medicines at the earliest or the situation may go out of control. In the wake of the shortage, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth has written to Union health minister Dr Harshvardhan, requesting him to provide an adequate amount of anti-fungal drugs at the earliest. “It was brought to my notice that the condition of patients suffering from black fungus is worsening with each passing day as doctors do not have the required drugs. The infection could turn fatal and that is why I have requested the health minister to ensure an adequate supply of the medicines at the earliest,” Seth said. Doctors in Ranchi said that just as oxygen cylinders are essential for treating Covid patients, the anti-fungal medications are life-saving drugs for patients suffering from mucormycosis. Talking to TOI, ophthalmologist at the Shree Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica Superspecialty Hospital Dr Anindya Anuradha said, “At the moment I am treating more than a dozen cases of black fungus and I have also visited a medical college to attend to such patients but the problem is nobody there aren’t enough medicines to treat the patients. If this continues, then the patient will be left with only one option which is surgery, or else it may become fatal.” On Wednesday evening, the state health department had issued treatment protocols regarding black fungus to all the hospitals and as per the government advisory, Amphotericin B, Amphotericin B Lipid Complex (ABLC) injection, Caspofungin plus Lipid polyene, Micafungin OR and Ulafubgin Plus lipid Polyene, among others, are required for treating black fungus. However, none of these medicines are available in the state. Upon contact, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said that they have placed a demand of 2,500 doses of Amphotericin-B with the Centre. He added, “We have already provided 250 doses of the drug to Rims (Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences) as around a dozen patients, which include the confirmed as well as suspected cases of mucormycosis, are currently admitted at the the state-run hospital. We are also planning on procuring Amphotericin-B directly from the manufacturers so that it can be made available to the private hospitals at a reasonable rate.” State drug controller Dr Ritu Sahay said that they are in touch with the manufacturers to procure the supply of the anti-fungal medicines at the earliest. “We have been told that it will take another one week for the supplies to reach Jharkhand,” she added. Meanwhile, the public relations officer at Rims, Dr D K Sinha confirmed that they have received 250 doses of the drug. He said, “We are administered the drug to the black fungus patients. Currently, there are 11 patients, including three confirmed cases and eight suspected ones, admitted at the hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/black-fungus-cases-cross-300-mark-state-docs-plead-for-key-medicines/articleshow/82840182.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Authorities asked to grant bails & parole to avoid Covid spread in jails||RANCHI: A high-powered committee formed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in prisons directed the jail administrations and the Jharkhand State Legal Service Authority to take steps to release inmates on bail, interim bail and parole. The move aims to reduce overcrowding at jails. The formed in pursuance of a Supreme Court order is chaired by Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh of Jharkhand High Court and has principal secretary (home) Rajiv Arun Ekka and IG prison Birendra Bhushan as members. The committee directed to request the courts to release undertrial prisoners involved in offences punishable up to seven years’ imprisonment. The prisoners who are not involved in heinous or economic offences and offences related to Left Wing Extremism would be considered. The shortlisted prisoners should not have a criminal antecedent. In addition to fresh releases, the inmates who were released last year in compliance of a similar order may also be considered after imposing appropriate conditions. The order stated that courts may be requested to consider the bail application of inmates involved in offence of petty nature and grant them bail for a period of 45 days. IG prison was directed to take steps for release of convicts on parole for a period of 90 days. Those who got parole last year may be considered. Speaking on the issue, IG prison Birendra Bhushan said, “An order has been issued to the jail superintendents to shortlist prisoners according to the directives of the committee and provide their names to the district legal service authority.” He said the jail administration will also adopt a lenient view in granting parole to the inmates. Secretary of Ranchi DLSA Abhishek Kumar said, “DLSA will provide legal aid to inmates who need advocates to file bail petitions in light of the committee decision. The work in this regard has already begun.” Official figures state there are 21,441 prisoners in the jails against the occupancy capacity of 16,991. The jails having 200% and more occupancy are Chatra (318), Gumla (297), Latehar (268), Garhwa (209) and Rajmahal (208).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/authorities-asked-to-grant-bails-parole-to-avoid-cov-spread-in-jails/articleshow/82840385.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Will reconsider current rates of Covid treatment, Jharkhand assures private hospitals||RANCHI: The state government on Friday gave the managements of private hospitals in Ranchi and across Jharkhand a verbal assurance to look into the existing rates of Covid-19 treatment. Representatives from various private hospitals sat across the table with health secretary Arun Kumar Singh and flagged their concerns at the department’s campus in Namkum. The Association of Healthcare Providers India urged the department to remove the existing capping on treatment rates of Covid-19. In an effort to stop overcharging in treatment of coronavirus patients in private hospitals, state health department in April this year fixed the treatment charges from Rs 4,000 per day to Rs 18,000 depending on the class of city, certification of the hospital and the kind of bed occupied. “In many cases, the government takes action against hospitals over tweets and messages on social media. We urged the government that it should conduct a probe before taking such action,” Yogesh Gambhir, the state president of AHPI, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/will-reconsider-current-rates-of-cov-treatment-state-assures-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82840206.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Charotar researcher to retrace Homo sapiens’ journey to India||Vadodara/ Anand: When did hominins and the first Homo sapiens groups enter the Indian subcontinent? Geologist Dr Prabhin Sukumaran, will work to reconstruct and understand the history of earth around the last 2.6 million years to find an answer to this question and many more. The researcher from Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) has bagged prestigious 6-month Fulbright-Nehru Academic and Professional Excellence Fellowship to carry out a research project that will throw some light on this period called the quaternary period in geological time. Questions like did they enter the subcontinent through an inland route or through a coastal route, or did they encounter and coexist with different species of archaic humans in the subcontinent will be studied in his visit to the Stable Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory of University of Illinois. There, Sukumaran will carry out reconstruction of the paleoclimate of Central Tapi River Basin, Maharashtra to understand human evolution through the last two million years. “A large number of studies from the Indian subcontinent have witnessed significant progress in archaeological and quaternary geological understanding. However, when the results are compiled to understand some of the primary questions about human evolution and culture change in India and when we try to connect it on a global map, there’s a marked lack of common tie between these results,” he said. “It requires coordination and cooperation between multi-disciplinary researchers including geologists, archaeologists and anthropologists,” said the researcher, adding that the project will help understand the environmental factors for the gradual technological, biological, cultural and behavioural changes that occurred throughout the quaternary period in India. Sukumaran has been recently appointed as secretary of the national working group of human climate interaction of the Association of Quaternary Researchers, the national body of Indian quaternary scientists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/charotar-researcher-to-retrace-homo-sapiens-journey-to-india/articleshow/82837437.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Cyclone Yaas: Specific alerts for Jharkhand possible only after formation of cyclone, says IMD||RANCHI: The weathermen may not be sure about the extent and severity of Yaas — the cyclonic storm building up over southeast and adjoining central Bay of Bengal — but they have predicted a positive impact on the arrival of monsoon in Jharkhand. Yaas is likely to hit the coast of West Bengal and Odisha on May 26. IMD in its evening bulletin on Friday said that the cyclonic circulation over Southwest Bay of Bengal now lies over southeast and adjoining central Bay of Bengal between 3.1km and 5.8km above mean sea level. “Under its influence, a low pressure area is very likely to form over east central Bay of Bengal and adjoining North Andaman Sea around Saturday. It is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24, move northwestwards and reach Odisha-West Bengal coast around May 26 morning,” the bulletin read. Commenting on the development, scientist at IMD Ranchi Abhishek Anand said they are monitoring the developments and will be able to predict the possible impact on Jharkhand and adjoining areas once the low pressure area develops into a cyclonic circulation and starts moving. “All weather offices are on alert and state-specific warnings will be issued,” he said. In a separate bulletin, IMD also declared advancement of the southwest monsoon into some parts of south Bay of Bengal, south Andaman Sea, Nicobar Islands and some parts of North Andaman Sea on Friday in association with the strengthening and deepening of southwesterly winds over the region and widespread rainfall activity. Weather scientist at Birsa Agriculture University Dr Abdul Wadood said that this year monsoon is expected to hit on time and reach Kerala by May 31. In case of timely arrival of monsoon, Jharkhand usually receives rainfall by June 8. “Whether the cyclone would have any adverse impact on Jharkhand is not known but it is certainly going to strengthen the monsoon and result in abundant rainfall during the onset,” he said. Describing the timing of cyclone and monsoon arrival as a boon for farmers, Wadood said the states which depend on rain for farming require good amount of rainfall during the onset when stagnant water helps in sowing. He said that in case of Jharkhand, the regular pre-monsoon showers have already helped farmers prepare their land for sowing. Most of the cyclones developing over Bay of Bengal have mild to severe impact on Jharkhand. “There is no denial of the fact that if a cyclone hits the coast of Odisha and West Bengal, most parts of Jharkhand will receive heavy rainfall but the extent of severity and damage can be predicted by IMD and its models,” Wadood said. The IMD in its extended range forecast issued on Thursday predicted cumulatively, large excess rainfall during the entire week beginning May 28 under the influence of cyclonic circulation. Rainfall is also predicted in most parts of the state towards the end of the week beginning May 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/specific-alerts-for-state-possible-only-after-formation-of-cyclone/articleshow/82840460.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Nagpur||Cop may lose two 2 increments as vegetable throwing video goes viral||Nagpur: A moment’s rage may leave police sub-inspector (PSI) Santosh Khandekar of Jaripatka police station without increments for two years. A video clip of him throwing vegetables of a roadside vendor on the road to enforce Covid restrictions had gone viral. An inquiry was initiated after city police chief Amitesh Kumar cracked the whip, and Zonal DCP Neelotpal has issued show cause notice to seek Khandekar’s reply. Apart from deciding to take punitive action against the erring officer, Kumar also issued a social media message condemning the unruly behaviour. The tweet also underlined the fact that ‘appropriate disciplinary action’ would be initiated. ‘All personnel are being continuously sensitized to act within the parameters of law’, city police tweeted, reflecting on the decision of the top cop. Khandekar was on patrolling duty when he spotted a roadside vegetable vendor at Khushi Nagar in Jaripatka. After repeatedly warning the vendors, Khandekar had proceeded to Mangalwari market to close down the place at 11am, as per the Covid restrictions in place. On his way back to the police station, Khandekar got angry on seeing the vegetable vendor still at the same spot selling materials. He started lifting the vegetables and hurling them around on the street in full public view even as the petrified woman seller stood still. Some of the hurled vegetables also landed on passers-by. The officer also emptied a sack of vegetables on the road in his fury. A video of this episode was shot by a citizen, and it had gone viral. CP Kumar said such unruly behaviour was not expected of an officer under him, and such episode was a blot on the image of the police department, which warranted action against such an incident. “A departmental procedure has been initiated against the officer,” he said.

---||Ranchi||Ranchi: Post-Covid complications rise in absence of specialised care clinics||RANCHI: Purushottam Kumar (34) was discharged from Ranchi sadar hospital’s ICU unit earlier this month after he tested negative for Covid-19. Little over a week later, Kumar complained of difficulties in breathing. As his oxygen saturation levels began plummeting, Kumar was wheeled back into sadar hospital’s Covid-19 ICU ward on Monday afternoon. Rajesh Pragya (name changed on request), returned home a week ago from a city-based private hospital after emerging victorious from a 15-day long fight with Covid-19 infection. On Sunday night, the septuagenarian complained of breathlessness. Soon after, he succumbed to a massive cardiac arrest. A city-based doctor, who was discharged from the hospital after recovering from Covid-19, was airlifted to a private hospital in Hyderabad on Sunday after complaints of breathlessness led to tests, which showed 80% irreversible damage to his lungs. Currently under extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) support, the doctor is due to undergo a lung transplant in coming weeks. Although Covid-19 cases have begun declining in Ranchi, post Covid complications are emerging as silent killers. While the Jharkhand government is not documenting these deaths, there is also a lack of awareness among patients and their kin, which is adding to fatalities. A sizeable chunk of Covid patients, including those who recovered in home isolation, are developing critical complications. Fibrosis of the lungs, cardiac arrests, renal failures, neurological problems, swelling on faces and diabetes are the most common among the complications. Overuse of steroids during treatment can lead to diabetes while usage of blood thinners to prevent clotting in lungs and the heart can lead to internal bleedings and multiorgan failures. “A Covid-19 negative report does not indicate that an individual is alright,” said Dr Sanjay Kumar, vice-president of Ranchi’s Bhagwan Mahavir Medica Superspecialty Hospital. “Once recovered, patients try to return to their normal lives and resume work and in process, they ignore the symptoms of the post Covid-19 complications,” he added. Besides ignorance on part of the patients, there is a shortage of post Covid-19 care clinics. Prominent hospitals, who are treating active patients, do not have enough manpower to attend to the recovered patients. Singh, a veteran physician in Ranchi, said, “In many cases, doctors go by the common protocol such as prescribing doxycycline, ivermectin and other drugs when infection kicks in. The important markers, which can be ascertained through tests like CRP, D-dimer and TCDC tests, are ignored. Post Covid complications can surface anywhere between seven days to nine months and can kill patients silently.” Kumar added that patients who recovered from Covid-19 infection must also regularly take up breathing exercises to re-modulate the functioning of their lungs. “Owing to low immunity, Covid-19 patients are succumbing to bacterial and fungal infections of the lungs. Hence, there is a need for regular check-ups, especially those who turned critical during infection.” Kumar advocated that every hospital in the state should set up post Covid-19 care clinics on priority which can provide staged diagnosis and clinical management. Though the state health department wrote to all government hospitals to set up such clinics, none have come up with one. “Since the cases are decreasing and bed occupancy is falling, we plan to carve out a post Covid-19 care facility from out of the 1,108 Covid-19 beds. Currently, we have asked all departments to submit a plan of action regarding the post Covid-19 management. We are monitoring the situation for a week before setting up the facility,” Rims director Dr Kameshwar Prasad told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/post-covid-complications-rise-in-absence-of-specialised-care-clinics/articleshow/82840364.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Vijayawada||Welfare corporations for 3 communities||Amaravati: The state government has constituted three separate corporations for the welfare and development of upper caste communities— Kamma, Reddy and Kshatriya. The government said that the decision has been taken to extend institutional finance to the poor among the communities in order to achieve a balance in society. The government had already created separate corporations for upper caste communities such as Brahmin, Vysya and Kapu. Special chief secretary G Anantha Ramu said that Kamma, Reddy and Kshatriya are communities among other castes (OCs) which are known as OC communities and most of them are agricultural families. “Though a few individuals possess large land holdings having assured irrigation facilities among the communities, majority of them are small and marginal farmers having no assured irrigation facilities and due to vagaries of monsoon and persistent drought conditions the yield of the crop is affected. The incomes of the families are affected due to raising agricultural input costs and the absence of remunerate prices. This is resulting in poverty among large number of people from these communities,” said the special chief secretary. He further said that the families from these communities laid more emphasis on education of children for which agricultural lands were sold or mortgaged. “Since education is thought to be the alternative tool to eradicate poverty, the farmers are not hesitant to spend money for the future of their children. The economic disparity among the same community is resulting in economic unrest. Institutional finance is required to neutralize the same,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/welfare-corporations-for-3-communities/articleshow/82839048.cms||Samdani MN

A growing number has started demanding not only reduction in examination fees by NU, but also by affiliated colleges, particularly the private ones, who collect tuition, term and other fees. Covid and subsequent lockdown-like restrictions have dealt a blow to the income of their parents. Many of them have either lost jobs or suffered deductions in their salaries. Those in business have also suffered losses. Some students have lost either one or both their parents and are in dire straits. After aggrieved students approached outfits like the ABVP and BJYM, their office-bearers met with pro-vice chancellor Sanjay Dudhe and handed over a request for the waiver. The delegation was led by BJP city president Pravin Datke along with former mayor Sandip Joshi. The duo was accompanied by Shikshan Manch coordinator Kalpana Pande. “Even in the pandemic, colleges are forcing students to pay fees for library, maintenance, uniform, caution and extra-curricular activities. How can they charge all these fees when the colleges were closed throughout the year due to lockdown. We can understand that colleges need to pay staff salaries, but those charges shouldn’t be paid by wrongly charging students,” Datke told TOI. Terming it as sheer harassment of students and parents, he pointed out that both NU and colleges should provide some succour by reducing the fees as a humanitarian gesture. “When NU is conducting all the exams online then why does it need to charge fees? We have demanded a refund of the entire amount to students,” he said. ABVP’s joint in-charge for state’s universities Amit Patle said they had apprised the NU administration of difficulties faced by students. “Besides financial difficulties, they’ve also lost their near and dear ones. In such a situation, it’s inhuman to charge the entire fees. We’ve already launched a campaign for reducing fees on various social media platforms and are receiving an overwhelming response from distressed students,” said Patle. He added that students of engineering and law have been hit the hardest as their fees were quite high and many depend on scholarships which haven’t arrived. NU senate members to meet pro-VC next week NU statutory member Vishnu Changde told TOI that about 20-22 Senate members would be meeting with pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe on Monday with various demands, including fee reduction. “We will be raising the issue of insurance cover to NU employees and its 3.5 lakh students. It was suggested by the UGC last year, but due to the pandemic, the proposal couldn’t be implemented. With many staffers succumbing to the deadly virus, we would be requesting NU authorities to implement this scheme as early as possible so that their family members could be benefitted,” said Changde. The members would also be insisting on providing insurance cover to all its registered students. “We would discuss this issue at the Management Council meeting along with pending scholarships of students from the state government,” Changde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-demand-reduction-in-college-exam-fees-due-to-covid/articleshow/82842964.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 13 feet python rescued, 20 eggs recovered in Amner||NAGPUR: The rescue of a 13-feet-long Indian rock python from Amner, 80km from Warud range, triggered a debate after its release in the forest along with its 20 eggs. On May 19, there was high drama while rescuing the huge python from its den on a farm owned by Prabhakar Chourase. A mob of over 300 people had gathered at the spot and threatened to kill the reptile if it was not rescued immediately. There was already a scare among farmers and labourers who had sighted the python several times near the farm and workers had refused to work. The python was rescued by the volunteers of Amravati-based NGO Help Foundation in the presence of forest and police officials. The farmer had deployed a JCB machine to dig the spot to reach the reptile that was deep inside the hole. “We released the reptile in the forest area safely under the guidance of experts and senior officials. The eggs were also kept nearby in a safe place. This was done on the direction from senior forest officials and suggestion from honorary wildlife warden Sawan Deshmukh,” said Warud RFO PR Bhujade. “No doubt the NGO and the forest department did a good job by saving the python and recovering the eggs, but as Indian rock python is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and is slowly facing extinction, the eggs should have been kept in the control condition and after incubation, the hatchlings should have been released in their natural habitat,” said herpetologist Parag Dandge. There may be various threats to these eggs in the forest and it is possible that they may be eaten up by the other animals. However, RFO Bhujade said, “We have posted forest guards to monitor the eggs.” Meanwhile, Deshmukh added, “The python has already taken control of the eggs and twirled around them immediately after release. Both, the eggs and the reptile are safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/13-feet-python-rescued-20-eggs-recovered/articleshow/82842978.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The incident happened at a papaya orchard at Mallavarappadu in Prakasam district on May 14. Ongole DSP K V V N V Prasad said the juvenile, who hails from West Bengal, was hired by the victim’s son to work on his shrimp pond at Mallavarappadu for two months. On the day of the crime, he had asked the accused and another migrant worker to work in his papaya orchard. The boy reportedly had an altercation with the victim, who was supervising the orchard, on May 14 for not doing the work properly. In a fit of anger, the boy impulsively took a boulder and repeatedly hit the sexagenarian on the head, killing her on the spot, police said, adding that the accused also sexually assaulted the woman after she died and tried to bury the body in the papaya orchard. Preliminary post-mortem indicated sexual violence, cops said. There were also strangulation marks on the woman’s neck. The boy, who was nabbed at Tangutur, reportedly confessed to the crime and will be produced before a juvenile court.

Given the acute shortage of hearse vans and ambulances, especially in the rural areas of Nagpur, many are forced to carry the bodies of Covid victims to the crematoria in private vehicles. What’s worse, a lot of them who don’t have a private vehicle are forced to ferry the bodies in a garbage van. One such incident was reported in Butibori’s Juni Basti locality where a Covid deceased patient was taken to the crematorium in a garbage van. A similar incident was reported in Hingna tehsil where a body was taken in a tempo from Lata Mangeshkar Hospital to city’s Ambazari ghat for the last rites. Given the acute shortage of hearse vans and ambulances, especially in the rural areas of #Nagpur, many are forced t… https://t.co/sdn5pEmkpf— TOI Nagpur (@TOI_Nagpur) 1621679661000A senior official from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) health department confirmed that relatives of Covid deceased were facing severe difficulties to arrange for a hearse van or an ambulance to take the bodies from hospitals and homes to crematoriums. The Regional Transport Office (Nagpur rural) data revealed that not a single hearse van is registered with it as against 168 registered ambulances. “Everyday the NMC is receiving calls from hospitals like Lata Mangeshkar Hospital (Hingna), Swami Vivekananda Hospital (Khapri), Gaikwad Hospital (Khapri) for a hearse van or an ambulance to allow relatives to transport bodies to crematoriums,” the official said. According to residents of Juni Wasti in Butibori, in the last one week, at least two Covid deceased were taken in garbage lifting vehicles to crematorium (on May 13, Jairam Neware (45) and on May 18, Shakuntala Khandare (70) – who died while in home isolation). “Both the bodies had been taken in a garbage van of Butibori Municipal Council,” social worker and a resident of Butibori, Tushar Darekar, told TOI. Relatives of Covid victims from rural Nagpur told TOI that even if they manage to find an ambulance, drivers charge anywhere between Rs5,000 and Rs10,000 for even a short distance. Unlike NMC, which has pressed 11 hearse vans and four minibuses for ferrying bodies to crematoriums, they alleged that in rural Nagpur there were no such arrangements. Even zilla parishad officials were not approachable and the condition is deplorable, the relatives said. Despite repeated attempts, district health officer Deepak Selokar was not available for comment. ZP president Rashmi Barve too did not respond to TOI’s calls. Former ZP president Sandhya Gotmare admitted that rural areas lack ambulances and hearses vans. “The pandemic has caused fatalities of unprecedented proportions. The crisis for hearse vans, ambulances was never felt before,” she said adding that on Friday Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari dedicated three ambulances procured from MLC Girish Vyas’ local area development fund. “These ambulances will be utilized for rural Nagpur only,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-ambulances-or-hearse-vans-covid-dead-taken-to-crematoria-in-garbage-vehicles/articleshow/82843009.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The court was hearing the petition filed by K Kalai Selvan. The petitioner’s father Kaliya Perumal died during service at Thanjavur district in 2012. The petitioner who had completed MA Tamil degree sent an application to the authorities in 2015, seeking appointment.The authorities directed the petitioner to obtain the legal heirship certificate, since his father had two wives. The petitioner filed a civil suit in this regard and since the parties entered into a compromise, the civil suit decreed in favour of the petitioner.The petitioner once again sent his application along with all required documents, however, the same was rejected by the director of public health and preventive medicine,. Justice V M Velumani observed that while the special government pleader submitted that the Thanjavur deputy director of health services has stated that the application has been forwarded to another section of the directorate and it is under consideration, the director has rejected the application.The judge observed that that the petitioner has sent a representation in 2015 seeking appointment on compassionate ground within three years from the date of death of his father. The written instructions of the deputy director, which was produced before the court, shows that the director passed the order without properly appreciating the materials placed before him, said the judge.Hence, the judge set aside the rejection order and directed the authorities to consider the petitioner’s application on compassionate ground and in accordance with law, within eight weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/consider-application-for-compassionate-posting-hc/articleshow/82848605.cms||---

Based on the scores obtained, he was called for recruitment to the post of BT assistant (History). During the certificate verification, it is found that he had obtained a BA History degree in one year duration and therefore his candidature was rejected stating that he was not eligible for appointment.Challenging it, Babu filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench and the single judge passed an order in 2020, allowing his petition with a direction to the Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB), to consider his degree issued by the Madurai Kamaraj University as valid and to appoint him in the post. The TRB has filed the present writ appeal challenging the order.The standing counsel for TRB submitted that Babu joined B.Sc Mathematics, a three years course. He studied the course for two years and thereafter, applied for change of course from B.Sc Mathematics to BA History and completed all the papers in the third year (in one year) and obtained the degree in 1995. He then obtained B.Ed degree and thereafter, applied for the post of BT assistant.He further submitted that the necessary qualification for the said post is a degree in the subject. Since he had obtained the degree in one year, he is not eligible for appointment.A division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that Babu had studied a different subject of Maths thereafter, studied the subject History. Referring to an earlier order of a division bench, the judges observed that in view of the settled position of law, we are of the view that Babu is not entitled for appointment, based on a degree which has been obtained in one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-order-to-appoint-teacher-who-got-degree-in-1-year/articleshow/82848597.cms||---

Rekha and Vaghela were married for 15 years and the couple has two sons and a daughter. While the unsuspecting family members even performed the final rites of the deceased, the victim’s nephew had some doubts and collected circumstantial evidence. He later filed an application before the police which resulted in the arrest of the two accused. According to Sayla police, they have arrested Rekha Vaghela (38) and her paramour Bharat Rangpara (37), a resident of Songadh village in Thangadh taluka of Surendranagar district. Based on the application by the nephew, Ramesh, police launched a probe and called in Rekha for questioning on Thursday. “Rekha spilled the beans and confessed to the crime and revealed the sequence of events that led to the murder of her husband,” said a Sayla police official. According to cops, Rekha was having an extra marital affair with Rangpara who worked as an agricultural labourer and the duo wanted to elope. But before doing so, they decided to eliminate Vaghela and they hatched a devious plan. On May 13, Rekha and her husband went to their farm for the night and as per the plan asked Bharat to come there at midnight. Bharat arrived at midnight and the duo strangulated Vaghela in his sleep,” police said. After committing the murder, Bharat returned to his home and as scripted, Rekha called up Ramesh and informed him that her husband died after getting accidentally trapped in a barbed wire fencing. Ramesh and others reached the spot and even as the family wanted to do an autopsy of the deceased, Rekha resisted their moves and asked them to cremate the body immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/wife-lover-held-for-husbands-slaying/articleshow/82837668.cms||---
---||Madurai||Govt withdraws some cases against anti-Sterlite protesters||Tuticorin: Chief minister M K Stalin on Friday withdrew a section of cases registered against anti-Sterlite protesters and members of the public following the police firing on May 22, 2018 which left 13 dead and hundreds injured in riots and police excesses. The CM also announced in a statement that a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each would be given to 93 people arrested at that time for the injuries and mental agony they suffered.The statement said CBI cases and those booked under Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act (TNPPDL) will not be withdrawn. Cases pending before the Supreme Court in this regard and “a few other cases” will also not be withdrawn. No objection certificate would be issued for pursuing higher education and for jobs to those arrested. A sum of Rs 2 lakh was announced for the aged mother of a man who died in jail after he was remanded in connection with another case.The announcements were based on recommendations given to the government in the interim report by the retired justice Aruna Jagadeesan commission which is probing the riots and deaths. While the statement says the commission was probing deaths, injuries and damages caused during the riots on May 22, 2018, there was no mention of ‘police firing’ that claimed lives. “There is lack of clarity with regard to withdrawal of cases,” says V Velraj, a leading protester who was booked under nearly 135 cases. He alleged that the protesters who were targeted by police were booked under TNPPDL Act. The high court had in August 2018 merged 173 cases in connection with the anti-Sterlite protests into one case. He said that the government should clarify whether those cases are among the more than 230 registered that have been withdrawn. “Tuticorin’s key demand of identifying and arresting police personnel who fired at the protesters and officials who ordered the firing has not been met,” says Krishnamoorthy who had 106 cases against him. Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi told reporters that the finer details of the government’s statement will be issued in a GO in a day or two. “The government is ensuring that they don’t set a wrong precedent by withdrawing the cases registered under TNPPDL Act,” she said.BOXCM hands over appointment orders to kin Madurai: Chief minister M K Stalin on Friday handed over appointment orders for suitable government jobs based on qualification to 17 relatives of the police firing victims. The jobs they were given earlier by the AIADMK government were those of village assistant or cook that are far below their educational qualification. Most of them had completed graduation or more.

---||World||'Significant undercount' of Covid-19 deaths globally, real number about 2 times higher than official stats: WHO||WASHINGTON: At least 3 million people are estimated to have died from the Covid-19 pandemic globally in 2020, about 2 times higher than the 1.8 million official fatality figure reported by countries to the WHO, a "significant undercount" of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to the coronavirus, the global health agency said on Friday. The WHO, in its World Health Statistics report, said that as of December 31, 2020, Covid-19 had infected over 82 million people and killed more than 1.8 million worldwide. But preliminary estimates suggest the total number of global "excess deaths" directly and indirectly attributable to Covid-19 in 2020 amount to at least 3 million, 1.2 million higher than the official figures reported by countries to the World Health Organisation. "With the latest Covid-19 deaths reported to WHO now exceeding 3.3 million, based on the estimates produced for 2020, we are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to Covid-19," WHO said in the report. It said the term "excess deaths" describes deaths beyond what would have been expected under "normal" conditions. "Excess deaths" captures not only confirmed deaths, but also Covid-19 deaths that were not correctly diagnosed and reported as well as deaths attributable to the overall crisis conditions. WHO said these estimates provide a more comprehensive and accurate measure when compared with confirmed Covid-19 deaths alone. "All countries must have the necessary capacity and resources to accurately collect and use health data even in the midst of an ongoing crisis," WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "The Covid-19 pandemic has shown the importance of data and science to build back more resilient health systems and equitably accelerate towards our shared global goals," he said. The report noted that some countries only report Covid-19 deaths occurring in hospitals or the deaths of people who have tested positive for Covid-19. In addition, many countries cannot accurately measure or report cause of death due to inadequate or under-resourced health information systems. "The pandemic has likely increased deaths from other causes due to disruption to health service delivery and routine immunisations, fewer people seeking care, and shortages of funding for non-Covid-19 services," it said. The report highlighted that the pandemic has revealed significant gaps in country health information systems. While high-resource settings have faced challenges related to overstretched capacity and fragmentation, weaker health systems risk jeopardising hard-won health and development gains made in recent decades. The report also noted that Covid-19 has exposed persistent inequalities by income, age, race, sex and geographic location. Despite recent global health gains, across the world people continue to face complex, interconnected threats to their health and well-being rooted in social, economic, political and environmental determinants of health, it said. Further, data from the Covid-19 World Symptoms survey shows a decline in preventive behaviours such as physical distancing, mask wearing and hand washing as household overcrowding increases. "Among people living in uncrowded households, 79 per cent reported trying to physically distance themselves compared with 71 per cent in moderately overcrowded and 65 per cent in extremely overcrowded households. Similar trends were observed for hand washing and mask-wearing, underscoring vulnerabilities due to socioeconomic status." WHO underscored the importance of investing in strong health information systems, saying it is vital to ensure disaggregated data reaches decision-makers and achieve equitable health outcomes. "With stronger, more equitable health information systems we can more accurately measure progress towards the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's Triple Billion targets," the agency said. "We are now less than nine years away from 2030," says Dr Samira Asma, assistant director-general for the Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact at WHO. "We know where the gaps are, and we have the solutions to address them. What we need now is commitment and investment to accelerate progress and reach our goals," Asma said. According to Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker, more than 165,633,000 confirmed cases have been reported globally while over 3,432,000 deaths have occured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/significant-undercount-of-covid-19-deaths-globally-real-number-about-2-times-higher-than-official-stats-who/articleshow/82848634.cms||---

Three women were part of the curfew-breaking merriment. According to an FIR filed with Vastrapur police, a 21-yearold woman from Bodakdev threw her birthday party on Friday and invited her four friends including two women, residents of Vastrapur, aged 22 and 30. The two men were from Juhapura, aged 26 and 24. The FIR said that a team of cops were patrolling at around 1.30am on Friday when they saw a group of people cutting a cake at Judges Bungalow Crossroads. As the cops approached, the celebrants sped away in an SUV. The cops intercepted the vehicle after a brief chase. The cops then learnt of the birthday party and booked the five under the charges of violation of the notification which restricts movement during curfew hours. Provisions of the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act have been invoked as well. ‘Workaholic’ misses cop deadline:In another case filed with Vastrapur police, a man who worked late and was going home at around 9pm on Friday was booked for violating the curfew. According to the FIR, the 43-year-old man from Gandhinagar, who works at a private firm on CG Road, was stopped by cops near Sanjivani T-junction in Vastrapur. He told the cops that his work had delayed him. The cops were not convinced. FIR is the cost of friendship:A man who gave his friend a ride home got an FIR against his name for breaching the curfew norms. According to the FIR filed with Vastrapur police, a man from Mansi Circle in Vastrapur was stopped by cops at around 9.15pm on Friday. He told the cops that he had gone to drop a friend because his friend did not have a vehicle. Police did not deem the reason as valid and booked him for flouting the curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-crossroads-party-in-curfew-piece-of-cake-for-police/articleshow/82848641.cms||---
---||Goa||Residents upset over work near Old Goa’s heritage site||PANAJI: Levelling of extensive tract of land near Old Goa’s iconic St Augustine’s tower ruin has caused a stir in the former capital. The local panchayat belatedly intervened and stopped the work. The clearing and digging activity had been in progress for some months, but local residents and the panchayat thought it was part of the expansion of the national highway at Old Goa. However, suspicions were raised after the work continued during the curfew period. “We inspected the site and asked for documents from the developer, but he had only approval from the town and country planning department that had expired some time back,” sarpanch of the Old Goa panchayat, Janita Madkaikar, told reporters on Friday. The site — a glaring red patch levelled after days of work — abuts the northern side of the national highway and overlooks the world heritage site comprising famous monuments. “The world heritage site has been ruined by this activity and the government should inquire into various aspects to find out how it happened,” panch and local politician Vishal Volvoikar said. A green buffer zone encircling the cluster of monuments has slowly disappeared due to haphazard development and highway expansion during the last few years. Repeated demands by heritage lovers for a master plan to regulate growth sustainably has not been heeded to by the authorities. “For now, we have stopped work at the site with the help of police,” Madkaikar said. Residents voiced concern about the flooding problem in the heritage area and adjoining places, as rain water flow last year was massive and had been impeded by blocked channels. The Basilica of Bom Jesus was mainly affected by dampness and seepage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/residents-upset-over-work-near-old-goas-heritage-site/articleshow/82843343.cms||Paul Fernandes

Work on one lane of the bridge is 80% complete,” Pauskar said. “We wanted to start one four-lane road for use by May or June 2021. The contractor was working accordingly. I personally visited the workshop. Only fitting of the superstructure is pending. Technical persons are required to carry out this work as it is a highly skilled job.

The transport department on Thursday opened the appointment window for operators, however, there was no response on day one, sources from the department said. Two taxi groups — from North and South Goa respectively — visited the directorate of transport head office at Junta House, Panaji on Thursday and expressed their grievances to the department officials and demanded that the fitment process be deferred. “How can we install and run the digital meters until the taxi fares are decided? We will install the meters only after several of our grievances are resolved, for which the department must first call us for a discussion,” said taxi operator Sunil Naik. Laximan ‘Bappa’ Korgaonkar said that it doesn’t make sense to install the devices when the state is still battling the pandemic and tourist influx has drastically reduced. He further reiterated the taxi unions’ demand to scrap the app-based aggregator GoaMiles taxi service, adding that their strike in still ongoing. The department has warned that no permit will be renewed without the fitment of digital meters from May 20. “There is a high court directive to install the meters and a deadline. We don’t have the kind of discretion to stop the process,” transport director, Rajan Satardekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taximen-snub-installation-of-digital-fare-meters/articleshow/82843438.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Lockdown in Kerala till May 30||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The general lockdown currently in place in the state has been extended till May 30. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Friday that the triple lockdown in Malappuram would continue till the cases there comes down significantly. Last week the state had announced triple lockdown in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Malappuram districts following a sharp increase in the prevalence of Covid cases. “Police surveillance and restrictions would be tightened in Malappuram district where test positivity rates remain high. Triple lockdown in other districts would be lifted from Saturday as the test positivity there have come under 25%,” said the chief minister. Meanwhile, Vijayan added that the black fungus infection was not new to Kerala. “However, steps would be taken to ensure the availability of enough drugs for its treatment. An awareness campaign would also be launched,” he said. The chief minister said that the medical service corporation has placed orders for 50,000 doses of a Covid-19 medicine that has been approved by the drugs controller general. It is expected to be available in June, he added. If vaccination was a prerequisite for people travelling abroad for jobs and studies, arrangements would be made to vaccinate them on a priority basis, the CM said. Besides, the field staff of food and civil supplies, FCI, and departments of posts, social welfare, women and child development, and animal husbandry would be included in the priority list for vaccination, it was said. The chief minister claimed that the government was holding discussions with experts on the possibility of setting up a vaccine manufacturing facility in the state. He added that school textbooks were being readied for distribution and their transportation will be brought under the purview of essential services. Also, agriculture labourers would be allowed to carry out their work on fields, provided they keep a self-declaration specifying the purpose of their travel during the lockdown, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/lockdown-in-state-till-may-30/articleshow/82848665.cms||---
---||Goa||Atal Setu’s Merces-Porvorim ramp starts ‘settling’ again||Panaji: The Atal Setu’s south side approach ramp leading towards Porvorim has once again begun to “sink” and will be shut for three months as Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) has asked L&T, which constructed the cable-stayed bridge, to find a “permanent solution” to the annual settlement problem. North Goa collector Ajit Roy has given permission for the up ramp at Merces junction to be closed for major repairs, but has said that the repairs can begin only after PWD finishes the ongoing roadworks from Merces circle to KTC bus stand. “This is the second time it is settling. We have to find a permanent solution,” said a GSIDC senior official while speaking to TOI. The official said that the piling for the up ramp, which has been built in reclaimed land, has to be strengthened or enhanced to ensure that the problem does not surface again. Atal Setu has a defect liability period of five years and L&T has to bear the cost of the major repairs. L&T had tried to resolve the issue in April 2020 when the unevenness caused vehicles to bounce or jerk while approaching the up-ramp. The ramp was closed for a month for repairs, but the problem has resurfaced. “It will take at least three months. It will be permanently strengthened so that there is no further settlement. We cannot go on doing this every year and we have told L&T that there has to be a one time solution,” said the GSIDC official. GSIDC had asked for permission to close down the ramp for repairs from April 15, but Roy said that simultaneous closure of Atal Setu and the KTC to Merces road will lead to traffic congestion. GSIDC and L&T had requested for closure of the up ramp for a period of three months from April 15 to July 15. GSIDC will also repair and hotmix the road from Pundalik Nagar circle, Porvorim to Malim junction. Roy has permitted GSIDC to carry out the work of “only hotmixing and minor works from Pundalik Nagar Circle, Porvorim to Malim Junction” in consultation with Goa police’s traffic cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/atal-setus-merces-porvorim-ramp-starts-settling-again/articleshow/82843456.cms||Newton Sequeira

Goa government also approved the proposal of the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) to carry out a pre-feasibility project study and cleared the draft agreement to be executed with IVL Swedish Environment Research Institute for the same. As per the report by GWMC’s consultant iDeck, the state generates 766 tonne of solid waste per day out of which 345 tonne is dry waste. Of the dry waste, 60 tonne is non-recyclable combustible waste classified as refuse derived fuel (RDF). GWMC transports approximately 600 tonne of RDF per month to cement factories for co-incineration, the cost of transportation for which varies from Rs 20,000 to Rs 26,000 per truck for 12-14 tonne. As this is economically unviable for the state, setting up of a waste to energy plant was proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-set-up-waste-to-energy-plant-swedish-co-to-execute-proj/articleshow/82843477.cms||---

---||Goa||Deadlock over choice of Margao civic body chairperson, deputy||MARGAO: Four days ahead of the special meeting of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) to elect a chairperson and vice-chairperson, the alliance partners of Margao Civic Alliance, Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP), are undecided over their choice of candidates. The Margao Civic Alliance had won 17 of the 25 seats of the MMC in the recently held civic polls, thus managing to hold sway over the municipality. Though GFP’s Fatorda Forward had won nine seats, one more than the tally won by Congress’s Model Margao, it is still unclear which party will now play the role of the elder brother in the alliance. The task of arriving at a unanimous choice for the chairperson has turned out to be all the more difficult for both the alliance partners as several veteran councillors enjoying equally good relations with Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, have staked claim for the post, lobbying for which has already started, sources said. While the Congress panel is determined to have one of its veteran councillors elected as chairperson, GFP is also keen to impose its choice on the alliance and thus take over the reins of the civic body ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. Sources said that negotiations were being worked out and one of the proposals being discussed was to have the chairperson and vice-chairperson’s posts rotated alternately between GFP and Congress candidates during the five-year term. In the 2015 elections, when a similar alliance was formed by GFP and Congress, 11 candidates from GFP’s Fatorda Forward had won, while Kamat’s panel ‘Model Margao’ had won in six wards. The power-sharing formula between GFP and Congress had resulted in GFP-backed Babita Angle Prabhudesai getting elected as chairperson. GFP managed to assert its supremacy over the council throughout the term despite Sardesai’s ouster from the BJP-led government in July 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deadlock-over-choice-of-margao-civic-body-chairperson-deputy/articleshow/82843508.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Sal farmers fear govt compensation will be meagre||BICHOLIM: Stating that they received meagre compensation last year after their plantations were destroyed from flooding in Sal village farmers from Bicholim taluka now fear that the state administration might not compensate them adequately this time too. The flooding was caused when water was released from Tillari dam causing the level of Chapora river to rise. Villagers as well as farmers have demanded that the state compensate them adequately this year. Farmers said they are waiting for the panchanama to be conducted by talathis to assess the losses from Cyclone Tauktae. However state authorities have said that farmers have been directed to first fill up application forms available at the talathi’s office. Agriculture minister Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar had announced that the panchanama would be conducted within three days. The filling up of an application form at this juncture has annoyed farmers and they point to Kavlekar’s assurance that the losses will be assessed physically. Farmers and plantation owners from Sal have suffered huge losses after mature banana, vegetable and chili plantations were destroyed due to Cyclone Taukte. “We were shocked to see the meager amount of compensation we received against the losses faced due to flooding,” said farmer Babi Raut. Farmers said that they would have generated a good income from bananas during the forthcoming Ganesh Chaturthi festival, however that hope now lies shattered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sal-farmers-fear-govt-compensation-will-be-meagre/articleshow/82843531.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden, South Korea's Moon Jae-in express willingness to engage North Korea||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday injected fresh urgency into attempts to engage North Korea in dialogue over its nuclear weapons program with Biden saying he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un under the right conditions. At a joint news conference, Biden and Moon both said the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is their goal. Biden said he was "under no illusions" about the difficulty of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenals after his predecessors failed. "We both are deeply concerned about the situation," Biden said. North Korea thus far has rebuffed US entreaties for diplomacy since Biden took over from Donald Trump, who had three summits with Kim and the two famously exchanged "beautiful letters." Kim nonetheless refused to give up his nuclear weapons but did impose a freeze on testing them. Biden said he would be willing to meet Kim under the right conditions, depending on if Kim agreed to discuss his nuclear program and that his advisers first met with their North Korean counterparts to lay the groundwork for talks between the leaders. Biden said for him to meet with Kim there would have to be a commitment from the North Korean leader "that there's discussion about his nuclear arsenal." "I would not do what had been done in the recent past; I would not give him all he's looking for - international recognition as legitimate and allow him to move in the direction of appearing to be more, serious about what he wasn't at all serious about," he said. Biden's comments appeared to reflect a shift in his thinking about a meeting. The White House had said in March it was not Biden's intention to meet with Kim. Biden's administration in its early months undertook a broad review of North Korea policy but has said little about what the new policy actually entails. US officials have said only that Biden's policy would not be the approach favored by President Barack Obama of refusing to engage the North, and not Trump's flashy summitry. In their day of talks, Biden and Moon reaffirmed the strong alliance between the two countries after the strains created by Trump, who badgered Moon as weak and threatened to pull US troops out of South Korea. Moon was the second foreign leader - after Japan's prime minister - to visit the White House since Biden took office in January, and Biden said their conversations amounted to talks between "old friends." The two leaders also discussed China and Taiwan. Taiwan has complained of repeated military activities by Beijing in recent months, with China’s air force making frequent forays into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone. "We've shared the view that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is extremely important, and we agreed to work together on that matter while considering special characteristics in relations between China and Taiwan," Moon said. Moon said the United States and South Korea would combine capabilities to supply Covid-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region. They also discussed how to tackle climate change. But North Korea dominated their joint news conference, held in the White House East Room. Biden said the two countries will have a "shared approach" to North Korea and that he and Moon shared a willingness to engage diplomatically with the North "to take pragmatic steps to reduce tensions." Biden said a state department official, Sung Kim, would serve as a special US envoy for North Korea. Moon said the envoy would help explore whether North Korea is willing to engage diplomatically and he expected a positive response from Pyongyang. Sung Kim is a veteran Korean-American diplomat who has served as ambassador to the Philippines and Indonesia and most recently in an acting capacity as the top US diplomat for East Asia. He led preparatory talks to set up the Trump-Kim summits. Moon welcomed what he called Biden's realistic, pragmatic approach to North Korea and called denuclearization a top priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-south-koreas-moon-jae-in-express-willingness-to-engage-north-korea/articleshow/82848691.cms||---

Most of the fallen trees are being cleared by labourers engaged by the respective panchayats. However, panchayat members said there is a shortage of labourers and mechanised saws, because of which a large number of fallen trees are still to be cleared. The Pilerne Fire Station, which oversees the coastal belt, said they received 150 calls of fallen trees, of which they had cleared 37 till Thursday, with 113 still to be cleared. However, electricity has been restored in most parts of the Calangute-Candolim belt. The heavy rains along with strong winds also brought down a number of trees uprooting and damaging the power poles in Anjuna as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clearing-of-fallen-trees-still-on-in-calangute/articleshow/82843543.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu government withdraws some cases against anti-Sterlite protesters||TUTICORIN: Chief minister M K Stalin on Friday withdrew a section of cases registered against anti-Sterlite protesters and members of the public following the police firing on May 22, 2018 which left 13 dead and hundreds injured in riots and police excesses. The CM also announced in a statement that a compensation of ₹1 lakh each would be given to 93 people arrested at that time for the injuries and mental agony they suffered. The statement said CBI cases and those booked under Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act (TNPPDL) will not be withdrawn. Cases pending before the Supreme Court in this regard and “a few other cases” will also not be withdrawn. No objection certificate would be issued for pursuing higher education and for jobs to those arrested. A sum of ₹2 lakh was announced for the aged mother of a man who died in jail after he was remanded in connection with another case. The announcements were based on recommendations given to the government in the interim report by the retired justice Aruna Jagadeesan commission which is probing the riots and deaths. While the statement says the commission was probing deaths, injuries and damages caused during the riots on May 22, 2018, there was no mention of ‘police firing’ that claimed lives. “There is lack of clarity with regard to withdrawal of cases,” says V Velraj, a leading protester who was booked under nearly 135 cases. He alleged that the protesters who were targeted by police were booked under TNPPDL Act. The high court had in August 2018 merged 173 cases in connection with the anti-Sterlite protests into one case. He said that the government should clarify whether those cases are among the more than 230 registered that have been withdrawn. “Tuticorin’s key demand of identifying and arresting police personnel who fired at the protesters and officials who ordered the firing has not been met,” says Krishnamoorthy who had 106 cases against him. Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi told reporters that the finer details of the government’s statement will be issued in a GO in a day or two. “The government is ensuring that they don’t set a wrong precedent by withdrawing the cases registered under TNPPDL Act,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-government-withdraws-some-cases-against-anti-sterlite-protesters/articleshow/82848689.cms||M K Ananth

Sohel was hacked to death in November 2019 at Regional Transport Office (RTO) over a petty issue. Gohel was arrested in this case and was sent to jail. A few weeks ago, Gohel and Dabhi got bail in the murder case. Since then Payak and his men kept a watch on them. Gohel was engaged in sand transportation business and regularly used visit Machhu river near Mayka village regularly. On Thursday too Gohel, along with Dabhi, went to Machhu river to load sand in the truck. Payak and his men, who were hiding by the roadside, intercepted Rahul’s truck with an SUV. The assailants dragged Gohel down from the truck and stabbed him many times and he died at the spot.

It has also threatened to intensify the protests after May 26 if there is no positive response from the government. The last round of talks between farmers’ representatives and Union ministers was held on January 22. The two sides had held 11 rounds of talks till they were suspended by the Centre. Union ministers had informed SKM that negotiations from their side had been completed, but farmers could approach the Centre any time. Modi too said his government was just a phone call away. The rift between farm unions and the Centre had deepened after the incidents of January 26 that led to arrests of several farm activists by Delhi police. Going by the spike in Covid-19 cases in the second wave, the SKM in its letter to Modi has highlighted that it does not want to put the protesting farmers at risk of health hazards and did not want to distract the Centre at this juncture. “Your government shut the doors for any dialogue since January 22. We have so far lost more than 470 colleagues due to this obstinacy on the part of your government,” the letter said. With this, SKM has put the ball in the Centre’s court. SKM reiterated its demands — repeal of the three new farm laws, legal guarantee for every farmer on MSP (C2+50%), besides protection from adverse impact of the proposed electricity bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/talk-to-farmers-or-face-bigger-stir-kisan-body-writes-to-pm/articleshow/82848723.cms||Neel Kamal

Hence, between May 2 and May 12, cases increased from 20,000 to 30,000, ” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. “Now, it has taken eight days to move from 30,000 cases to 35,000 cases,” he said. The R-naught or the reproduction rate of the infection is now close to 1.1 compared to 1.4 recorded at the start of the second wave on April 11. “This is because of a combination of factors including increased testing, early isolation, and the effect of lockdown,” he said. The sharpest decline was in Chennai, where cases have dropped from around 7,500 on May 12 to 6,073 on Thursday. On Friday, it dropped further to 5,913 and the average waiting time for oxygen and ICU beds too went down with additional beds and stringent triaging. “We are hoping that with decline in cases, there will be decline in deaths too, Radhakrishnan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-19-new-cases-up-but-rate-of-growth-falling-across-tamil-nadu-over-past-15-days/articleshow/82848748.cms||---

AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the intent behind BJP’s “forgery” is to defame Congress because it had undertaken selfless relief activities during the pandemic while Modi government and the ruling party refused to acknowledge the problem. “When Congress is out in the field helping with whatever possible — oxygen, medicine, ambulance etc, the ruling BJP is busy maligning us through absolute fakery. They created fake content just to divert attention from their own failure. We are happy that BJP and its leadership’s bluff has been called. They have been exposed!!” Venugopal said. He said it is futile to ask BJP chief J P Nadda to crack down on “forgery” by his partymen since he had taken the lead in peddling fake content. Congress on Friday observed the 30th death anniversary of party mascot and former PM Rajiv Gandhi by kickstarting fresh Covid relief activities “Seva”, based on a plan finalised by AICC’s relief task force headed by veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad. Azad said the relief plan will be carried out for as long as it was required given that it was going to be a long fight against the pandemic. A weekly review will guide local units on the future focus of relief. Congress said that since April, the relief work undertaken by the party has resulted in arranging 1,600 ambulances, 1.3 lakh hospital beds, 64,000 ooxygen cylinders, 15 lakh home isolation kits, 3.2 lakh critical medications, 89,000 tele-consultations, 50,000 oxygen concentrator requests, 5,000 plasma requests, 976 doctors for Hello Doctor – the party’s pan-India tele-consultation initiative – besides masks, food and other help like vaccine assistance and money from legislators’ area development funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vindicated-says-congress-as-twitter-red-flags-bjp-tweets-on-toolkit/articleshow/82848768.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The seven-member commission will have a tenure of three years, an order issued by Deepali Naik, director of the directorate of women and child development, said. A former member of the commission said that the previous body was not active as it should have been and meetings were not held regularly. For a while, the commission remained without a chairperson last year and its functioning was affected. “There is so much the commission can do as the watchdog of child rights. The abuse and exploitation of children in Goa may not be as rampant as in other states, but it can’t be said that the children here are totally protected,” she said without wanting to be named.

---||Nagpur||Composer Laxman of Raam-Laxman fame passes away||Nagpur: Music director Vijay Patil, popularly known as the Laxman of Raam-Laxman duo, passed away at his city residence in the early hours of Saturday. Patil earned fame for providing music to comic Dada Kondke’s Marathi films and Hindi movies like ‘Hum Aapke Hai Kaun’ and ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’. Patil, born and brought up in Nagpur, started as a singer and instrumentalist in city’s popular orchestra groups. Later, he shifted to Mumbai with an ambition to become a music director. With his friend Surender ‘Raam’ Kadam, Patil formed a team which was given the sobriquet ‘Raam-Laxman’ by Kondke. It was the well-known Marathi filmmaker-cum-actor who gave them their break in the film industry with ‘Pandu Havaldar’ in 1975. Even after the death of Kadam soon after the pair bagged its first Hindi film ‘Agent Vinod’, Patil continued providing melodies to more than 75 Hindi, Marathi and Bhojpuri films as ‘Ram-Laxman’. Rajshri Productions’ songs in ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ (Filmfare award), ‘Hum Aapke Hai Kaun’ (many awards) and ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’ proved to be super-duper hits. ‘Lavleena aa gaya main’ from ‘Agent Vinod’ in 1977 and ‘Deva ho deva, Ganapati Deva’ from ‘Humse Bhadkar Kaun’ in 1981 stand out in his oeuvre. Patil composed many chartbusters during the 1980s and 1990s before the advent of Nadeem Shravan and Annu Malik. Ten years ago, a brain stroke made it difficult for Patil to sing and compose. He shifted to Nagpur and was residing with son Amar who too is into music. Patil kept away from the media and lived a quiet life in Untkhana area of the city. Family members said that Patil was not a Covid-19 patient and had taken both doses of Covid vaccine. On Friday night he complained of chest pain. Before he could be shifted to a hospital, Patil got a severe cardiac arrest and died at home itself around 2 am. His last rites were performed at Mokshadhaam Ghat. People from Nagpur’s music industry were the first to pay tributes to Patil. “He was a dear friend. I will remember his association with Kader Orchestra. When we started a music academy, I had invited him to inaugurate it. Despite being unwell, he came,” said singer MA Kader. The music of Raam-Laxman was based on the basics of orchestra and took the legacy of Laxmikant-Pyarelal forward. Melody, even in foot-tapping numbers, was a special feature of their music. Use of traditional Indian instruments along with the typical orchestra set-up made their songs popular. Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar also tweeted tributes to Vijay Patil. “Felt very sad hearing the news about talented and popular composer Raam Laxmanji (Vijay Patil). He was a nice person. Many songs composed by him and sung by me became very popular. My sincere tributes to him,” she said. In 2018, Raam-Laxman was bestowed the Lata Mangeshkar Puraskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/composer-laxman-of-raam-laxman-fame-passes-away/articleshow/82855629.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

This follows a request from Palaniswami to the M K Stalin government, seeking approval for continued stay given his position that is equivalent to that of a minister. Palaniswami has been staying in the bungalow, Sevvanthi, ever since he became a member of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s cabinet in 2011. “The state public works department issued an allotment order to Palaniswami. The allotment was made without fixation of rent. Also, Palaniswami cannot avail the house rent allowance as a member of legislative assembly,” said a source. The department has instructed the buildings wing and the Chennai regional office to permit the leader of opposition to reside in the same bungalow. More than 20 former AIADMK ministers vacated their bungalows, while the rest, including former deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, are looking for rental options in the city. His associates said Panneerselvam found an apartment in Raja Annamalaipuram in the city and may move in soon. The public works department did not issue any notice to the former ministers to vacate since the TN Ministers and Presiding Officers of Legislature (Furnishing and Maintenance of Government Houses and Provision of Amenities) Rules, 1977, allows a grace period of two months for them to vacate, after demitting office and on a rental of Rs 250 per month. On the expiry of grace period in addition to the recovery of fair rent, there shall be compulsion to vacate the house. “At least, three former ministers had requested for continued stay for two months and was granted permission, but one had vacated,” another source said. The higher ups in the government told the PWD ‘not to disturb’ the former ministers until they vacated the bungalows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-government-allows-former-chief-minister-edappadi-k-palaniswami-to-stay-on-at-greenways-road/articleshow/82848778.cms||Julie Mariappan

In Nizamabad’s Sirikonda village, A Bhumayya, who was recovering from Covid-19, developed symptoms of black fungus and succumbed on Friday morning. In another incident in Suryapet, a 50-year-old patient died in the early hours of Thursday after being treated in the area hospital, while the third death was recorded in Parakal on Wednesday when a person named Sudarshan succumbed to mucormycosis. “There are also unconfirmed reports of one death each from Kamareddy and Nalgonda districts from black fungus. But it needs to be checked,” a senior health official said. Health department sources said a local TRS leader from Khammam town was taken to a private hospital in Bengaluru for treatment of mucormycosis, but he breathed his last on Wednesday. He was infected with Covid-19 after the recent civic polls. ENT Koti sets up new ward to treat mucorWith an increasing number of cases, the designated treatment centre ENT Koti has set up another ward for the treatment of black fungus patients. On Wednesday, the hospital had 59 patients and added 59 more by Friday. Efforts are on to convert this hospital for the treatment of black fungus with 200 beds from the present strength of 50 beds. “This year, more cases of mucormycosis are surfacing because of more Covid-19 cases. It most affects diabetic patients who are admitted in ICU for other ailments and not just for Covid-19,” Dr Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital, said. The expert committee reportedly received more than 700 applications for Liposomal Amphotericin B, Posaconazole and Isavuconazole for treatment. For the treatment, each patient needs 21 vials. “We have only 300 injections available, earlier the need was very less and companies also stopped manufacturing. Now immediate availability will be difficult as they have to import raw material from other countries like Germany,” a top official told TOI. The state-run Gandhi Hospital has also created a separate ward for these patients and around 25 patients are being treated there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/black-fungus-claims-3-lives-in-telangana-amphotericin-b-shot-scarce/articleshow/82848769.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||India||Who pioneered high fee demand by successful lawyers?||NEW DELHI: Who started the trend of senior advocates demanding very high fees for appearing for litigants in Supreme Court? Senior advocates A M Singhvi and Vikas Singh on Friday, during banter in video-conferencing platform for a vacation bench in Supreme Court, revealed that it was former law minister Shanti Bhushan who started the trend of charging high fees for single appearance in cases before the apex court. Singhvi, one of the top lawyers of the country commanding fees that could be matched by few at present, said finding such high charges awkward, senior advocate Murli Bhandare, who held two terms as president of Supreme Court Bar Association, had proposed a resolution capping the legal fees to be charged by senior advocates. “But, Shanti Bhushan tore that resolution and threw it in the dustbin and asked how SCBA could implement its resolution limiting the fees of senior advocates,” Singhvi said. Singh agreed with Singhvi that Bhushan was the pioneer in charging high fees. At present many senior advocates command a fee in excess of Rs10 lakh for arguing miscellaneous matters before the SC, which generally does not last more than 10 minutes. The banter started with SCBA president Vikas Singh jokingly inquiring from solicitor general Tushar Mehta as to who is earning more, he or attorney general K K Venugopal. When SG said that he could not disclose the earnings of the AG, Singh said that “the cat is out of the bag”. SG immediately said that Venugopal had been charging high fees even before he became an AG. “AG’s income is definitely much more than mine,” he said. In his characteristic deftness, SG in lighter vein said Vikas Singh as SCBA president should pass a resolution similar to the one attempted by Bhandare. “You pass the resolution and together we will take it to Singhvi,” he said. A smiling Singhvi was saved from reacting as the bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai assembled. The bench disarmed them by saying “we have been at the bar before becoming judges. We know how lawyers exchange naughty gossips”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/who-pioneered-high-fee-demand-by-successful-lawyers/articleshow/82848788.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Surendra Tavade allowed a plea by the 41-year-old woman with a psychiatric issue and her husband to allow MTP of her entire pregnancy as one fetus has anencephaly, where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull. Taking note that on May 12, another HC bench had directed a panel to examine her “for the possibility of termination of one fetus only”, the judges on May 17 reconstituted the panel and sought a report on the termination of the “entire” pregnancy. The panel’s May 20 report said the first fetus showed anencephaly and is not likely to survive. The second has a soft chromosomal marker which means it would probably have genetic abnormalities. The report said the third fetus was healthy. Foetal medicine expert Dr Purnima Satoskar advised termination as per Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecogists guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-bombay-hc-allows-woman-to-abort-24-week-triplets/articleshow/82848805.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The state also recorded its highest toll of 467 deaths. Chennai, however, continued to record a marginal dip in fresh infections with Friday’s number at 5,913 against 6,073 on Thursday and 6,297 on Wednesday. With the number of recoveries dropping to 24,478, the number of active cases in the state increased to 2,74,629 ---fourth highest in the country next to Karnataka (5.14 lakh), Maharashtra (3.67 lakh) and Kerala (3.06 lakh). As a result finding a bed, particularly oxygen-supported, continues to remain difficult. The government has added 3,420 additional O2 and ICU beds in Covid hospitals during the last one week. Less than 5% of these beds were vacant and available for admission on Friday evening. Health Minister Ma Subramaniam reiterated that beds were alloted in government hospitals based on the severity of the infection and patient condition. In Chennai, ambulance continued to queue up outside Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and Stanley Medical College Hospital -- only 17 ICU beds and 526 O2 beds were vacant on Friday evening. The number of active cases in the city remained above the 47,000-mark for almost a week now. The infection count (5,913) continued to exceed the discharges (4,590). The situation is no different in neighbouring districts of Chengalpattu (2,226), Thiruvallur (1,667) and Kancheepuram (1,145 fresh cases). In Coimbatore (3,243), the second worst-affected district, the weekly test positivity rate (TPR) has almost doubled within a span of three weeks. The present TPR is 29.9 and is much higher than the state figure of 20.3. On Sunday, a total of 1,74,112 samples were tested at 267 labs in TN.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-19-tamil-nadu-records-36184-cases-as-infections-dip-in-chennai/articleshow/82848779.cms||---

While two were admitted on Thursday, four people were brought to the hospital on Friday. Hospital authorities said that all six were male patients, living in and around Salem. A separate isolation ward has been created and a special team of doctors has been deputed to treat them. Doctors said the six have symptoms of black fungus such as redness in the eyes, swollen cheeks, headache and nasal congestion. Dean of Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital Valli Sathyamoorthy, however, said they are yet to confirm if it was black fungal infection. “They have symptoms. But we have to confirm if it is black fungus. We have to get an opinion from experts,’’ she said. The patients are being administered antifungal drugs as part of the treatment. Most of them were diabetic and hence medication was being given to control diabetes. “ENT specialists are also there taking care of them,’’ Valli Sathyamoorthy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/six-men-with-symptoms-of-black-fungus-admitted-at-salem-government-hospital/articleshow/82848809.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||No technology transfer from Indian Council of Medical Research & National Institute of Virology, Covaxin is ours, say Bharat Biotech||HYDERABAD: Amid the chorus from several quarters for sharing Covaxin technology with other players on the ground that it had been co-developed along with government bodies, a top Bharat Biotech official has said that there was no technology transfer from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) or National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The collaboration with ICMR and NIV was only to the extent of procuring the SARSCoV-2 strain and studies that were conducted on large animals, monkeys and hamsters as the private sector does not have access to such large animals, Bharat Biotech joint managing director Suchitra Ella said during panel discussions on vaccines organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) along with a couple of TV channels late on Friday evening. “When we reached out to ICMR-NIV we only reached out for the strain of the virus. There was no technology as such coming to the industry from the academic body at that point of time. We just needed our hands on the strain and that’s what we got from Pune. From there on it was developed in-house, completely funded in-house and taken through all the testing, animal, toxicology and human testing...,” Ella said. BB expects study on children to begin in JuneSo this is something that I would like to set straight. Yes, the NIV Pune and ICMR have been collaborating to the sense that the animal studies that had to be done on monkeys and hamsters and we in the private industry don’t have access to have such large animals…It is not a technology transfer, it was a strain and then we also did the clinical studies for the large animals with ICMR,” she reiterated. On the children’s trials of Covaxin, she said the company expects the study to begin in June and have the safety data from the study in the next two to three months after that. The children’s study will only be a safety study as the immunogenicity and efficacy of Covaxin have already been proven in a large number of volunteers but no trials were conducted on children in the 2-12 years age bracket, she explained. “If all goes well and the second wave does not get between us…we look at a timeline of 60-90 days maximum…within that timeframe we hope to have good safety data published for children and submitted to the drug controller general,” said Ella, who is also the vicechairperson of CII’s southern region Addressing concerns over testing on children, Ella pointed out that nearly 70% of the company’s vaccines are paediatric vaccines and said the company knows how important and sensitive it is to get the trials rolling especially during the second wave of the pandemic. “…having conducted paediatric trials on more than 5,00,000 babies and infants across 20 countries in the world we know that this is doable…,” she said On the intranasal vaccine, she said the Phase I trials have been completed and the company hopes to finish the Phase II and III trials quickly as the administration pathway is much easier (than an injectable vaccine) but she refused to commit to a timeline on when the vaccine would be ready for use citing regulatory and procedural steps that have to be completed as per international clinical practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-technology-transfer-from-indian-council-of-medical-research-national-institute-of-virology-covaxin-is-ours-say-bharat-biotech/articleshow/82848876.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

But it was not all – Ahmedabad city, which accounted for about 25-28% of daily positive cases, recorded cases below 1,000 after 43 days, too. It was also the eighth consecutive day for the state to record daily cases below 10,000. With this, the state ranks third among the top 10 Indian states with highest cumulative cases. Gujarat reduced 36% cases in seven days between May 14 and 20 (50,867) compared to the figures of May 7 to13 (79,381). The mortality reduction is slightly lower at 30% - from 805 to 564. The mortality rate remained almost the same at 1%. Among the states, Uttar Pradesh reduced the weekly cases from 1.55 lakh to 70,550 - recording 54.5% drop, whereas Rajasthan reduced the cases by 36% - from 1.18 lakh to 75,668. Gujarat is 10th among the Indian states in terms of active cases at 84,421 on Friday. The fall is apparent with the share of eight major cities shrinking below 50%. Experts pointed out that Ahmedabad and Surat used to account for close to 50% of the cases. Both the cities’ daily cases have fallen below 1,000 on Friday compared to 4,821 and 1,849 recorded by Ahmedabad and Surat respectively on April 21 – exactly a month ago. Dr Dhiren Mehta, secretary of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that the number of footfalls has reduced for the Covid patients at city clinics and hospitals. “It is a welcome sign, and the hard work by the authorities and citizens must continue to ensure further drop,” he said. “The number of patients on ventilators and in ICUs have also reduced, but not as significantly in Ahmedabad.” The experts have now advised to focus more on the rural areas where the surge could take place if adequate care is not taken. A senior public health expert said that the number of cases from rural areas is lower due to lower daily testing. “We must ensure that all possible cases are found in time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-3rd-to-post-big-weekly-gains-in-reducing-covid-cases/articleshow/82848881.cms||---

According to Dr Joshi, while endocrinologists would see a diabetic patient with mucormycosis once in two months, the pandemic changed that. “Now doctors are seeing multiple cases in a day,” said Dr Joshi, a member of the Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. For the article published in the medical journal ‘Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews’, the doctors reviewed medical literature until May 12, 2021, and found that the highest incidence was in India — 83 out of 101 cases across the world. More than two-thirds of these patients had uncontrolled diabetes and two-thirds had received a course of steroid for Covid. These findings suggest control of diabetes and judicious use of steroid is necessary to reduce black fungal infection, they said. Global prevalence of mucormycosis varies between 0.005 and 1.7 per million population, but its prevalence in India is nearly 80 times higher (0.14 per 1,000). “India has the highest cases of mucormycosis in the world,’’ said Dr Misra. Considering India is considered the diabetes capital of the world, it is not surprising. However, Dr Misra believes the current situation at best could be called an escalation and not an epidemic. “For over 30 lakh Covid cases in India, there are 5,000 to 7,000 cases of mucormycosis. This is not as high as renal failure or even heart failure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-diabetes-steroids-fuelling-black-fungus-outbreak-study/articleshow/82848878.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Adivasis use neem oil to 'ward off Covid'||JAMSHEDPUR: Few Adivasi pockets in West Singhbhum and East Singhbhum district have kept the Covid-19 pandemic at bay with neem oil, a traditional medicine used since the time of their ancestors. Panchabhoya village, located in Kumardungi block of West Singhbhum, around 75km from here, has about 70 families. Since the start of the pandemic last year, they have cut themselves off from the urban areas, literally. Neither do they go out of their village without reason nor let anyone enter their place easily. Pikul Bage, a resident, said, "Use of neem oil is not new for Adivasis. We have been using it to cure various kinds of infectious diseases and keep ourselves fit and healthy. It is found in every household here." He said after the surge of Covid cases in the district and the state, the villagers have started using this oil vigorously daily. Bage claimed that not a single village has been infected by the virus so far. "Neem oil is like a shield for us. Whenever we out of the house, we smear our entire bodies with neem oil. We also use it as sanitiser and for washing hands. If any person has to out out of the village, he or she has to take a bath before being allowed inside," he said. Moreover, the villagers have barricaded the main road which passes through the village, so that outsiders cannot enter their area without a reason. Migrant workers from the area, who have returned from outside the state, have to live in isolation for a week at the shelters set up outside the village. Similarly, the Birhor and Sabar primitive tribals living in the forest area of Ghatshila sub-division of East Singhbhum district proudly claimed that they are Covid free. Around 500 members from both Birhor and Sabar have shut themselves in their villages since the outbreak of the pandemic. Though both these tribal groups have lost many of their members to tuberculosis and alcohol, not a single person has been infected by the Covid-19 virus. Arun Sabar, a resident of Haluboni, said since the time they heard of the disease, they have not ventured out to the city areas and depended on things found in their villages. He added that if they go out and get infected, they are likely to die as hardly any medical help is available in their areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/adivasis-ward-of-covid-with-neem-oil-shutting-themselves-out/articleshow/82840660.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay quits, Mamata Banerjee may contest bypoll from Bhowanipore||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to fight the assembly bypolls from her home turf Bhowanipore, after sitting MLA and state agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay quit as MLA on Friday, vacating the seat. Banerjee, a two-time winner from this assembly segment (she had won from this seat in 2011 and 2016), had fought the 2021 polls from Nandigram, but lost narrowly to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari. Weeks after Adhikari quit TMC, she had announced her decision to fight from Nandigram, referring to Bhowanipore as her “boro bon (elder sister)”, and Nandigram “mejo bon (middle sister)”. She now has to get herself elected within six months because, according to Article 164 of the Constitution, a minister who is not an MLA for six months ceases to be a minister. Chattopadhyay, who had won from neighbouring Rashbehari in 2016, defeated BJP’s Rudranil Ghosh from Bhowanipore by a huge margin (29,000 votes) this time around. He quit exactly 10 days after he took oath as a cabinet minister on May 11, tendering his resignation to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee. “I submitted my resignation on my own,” said the Trinamool veteran. “I, and many of my colleagues, felt that Mamata Banerjee should continue as CM. In that case, she has to get elected within six months. Bhowanipore has been her home turf and a safe seat. I took care of the constituency while she was away in Nandigram.” An MLA from Baruipur in 1991, Shobhandeb is the first MLA elected on a Trinamool ticket from Rashbehari in 1998. This is not the first time that elected Trinamool MLAs paved the way for Banerjee. She didn’t contest the landmark 2011 assembly polls, the year she assumed office as CM after her party defeated the Left Front. Trinamool president Subrata Bakshi, the state public works and transport minister then, had then resigned as MLA to make way for Banerjee to contest the bypoll from Bhowanipore. Bakshi later got elected to Parliament. Chattopadhyay’s opting out in favour of Banerjee might put him on a political trajectory similar to Bakshi’s. According to Trinamool sources, the state agricultural minister is not very keen on getting a Rajya Sabha berth. They hinted that Chattaopadhyay, instead, was looking for some other assembly constituency to get elected from. The Trinamool veteran himself had no comment on this. “I am a loyal soldier of Mamata Banerjee. I leave it to her to take a call,” he said. There are five assembly seats going to bypolls, apart from Bhowanipore: Khardah, Shantipur, Samserganj, Jangipur and Dinhata. Polls couldn’t be held at Samserganj and Jangipur due to death of candidates; the Trinamool candidate from Khardah, Kajal Sinha, died of Covid after he won; and two BJP MPs (Jagannath Sarkar and Nisith Pramanik) who won the assembly polls from Shantipur and Dinhata gave up the MLA posts because they wanted to retain their MP posts. Chattopadhyay’s chance of contesting from Khardah seems remote because that happens to be the home turf of finance minister Amit Mitra, who also needs to get elected within six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sobhandeb-quits-didi-may-contest-bypoll-from-bhowanipore/articleshow/82843102.cms||---

Suffering from so many ailments, he battled on all fronts with courage,” said Kinjal Patel, daughter-in-law of Piyush Patel who is suffering from mucormycosis. The 62-year-old has been fighting against the deadly fungus for last four months with a partially functioning heart and his last CT scan showed that he may have finally started to conquer mucormycosis. “The fungus has gone down by about 40% in his lungs. His condition is much better and he now moves around at home,” Kinjal, a resident of Gotri, said. But the battle wasn’t easy for Piyush who is suffering from multiple ailments including diabetes and hypertension. It was in December last year that Piyush was detected with Coronavirus and had to be put on oxygen in the ICU where he spent 28 days. Out of his four weeks stay, 18 days were for Covid treatment and another 10 days for removing water from his lungs. “Just when we thought that he was fine, my father-in-law started feeling breathless and had a bloated stomach in February. We again took him for the check-up and it was then that he was detected with mucormycosis. It was a very new term at that time as there were hardly any mucormycosis cases,” Kinjal explained. The doctors began treating him but Piyush’s kidney wasn’t functioning normally so he couldn’t be given injections to treat mucormycosis. “He was to be put on dialysis so that the treatment could begin. He was also suffering from liver ascites that caused abdominal swelling. We were really worried if he could endure the treatment with a weak kidney and dysfunctional liver. Between March and April, he was in hospital for 32 days,” Kinjal told TOI. In April, the doctors suggested surgery to remove the fungus but the Patel family decided against it. “He underwent bypass surgery in 2019 and his heart is functioning only at 40% capacity. Putting him on the surgery table would have been very risky so we decided to continue with the medicines,” she said. Piyush’s mucormycosis finally started showing a decline towards the end of April. “He is still on home dialysis and taking several doses of medicines. But what a fight he gave to Covid as well as the black fungus,” said Amit Patel, son-in-law of Piyush, who retired from Gujarat Refinery some years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/62-yr-old-with-multiple-weak-organs-slays-covid-then-mm/articleshow/82837496.cms||Tushar Tere

Garhwa SP Shrikant S Khotre said, “The deceased constable was checking the e-pass of commuters when he was hit by the speeding motorcycle and he succumbed to his injuries on the spot.” According to police sources, Subhash tried to evade the cops and sped up his bike, which is when he hit Rai. “The incident would not have occurred if the on duty cops had set up a barricade,” Ravi Khushwaha, president of the district policemen’s association, claimed. The deceased was identified as Pramod Rai (40), who was a native of Chatterpur in Palamu district. Subhash Kumar (26), who was riding the motorcycle with two of his friends riding pillion, sustained grievous injuries and he eventually died at Garhwa sadar hospital. He hailed from Bhikhi More.

---||Kolkata||Calcutta high court: House arrest for netas as bail plea moves to 5-judge bench||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Friday released from judicial custody all four senior politicians arrested in the Narada case but remanded them in house arrest while allowing them to work from home through video-conferencing. A two-member HC bench — comprising acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee — first passed two separate orders on Wednesday, one ordering house arrest and another allowing interim bail for cabinet ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool MLA Madan Mitra and former city mayor Sovan Chatterjee. The court on Friday repeated the house-arrest order and permitted the ministers “to deal with the files sent to them online and hold meetings through video-conferencing”; it also turned down CBI’s plea to stay the house-arrest order for a week. The two-member bench then referred the case to a larger, five-member bench, comprising acting CJ Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Arijit Banerjee. This bench will hear on Monday the CBI plea to transfer the case to a court outside Bengal as well as the politicians’ plea for bail. Justice Banerjee, in his Wednesday’s order allowing interim bail, said all four were “advanced in age and suffered from various age-related and other ailments” and added that the CBI itself had admitted that they had cooperated with the investigating officer. Three of them were MLAs, two of whom were also ministers, and one was a former Kolkata mayor and all were permanent Kolkata residents; so there was little chance of them absconding, this order reasoned. Justice Banerjee, while referring to the CBI’s claims that they may tamper with evidence, said: “This argument does not appeal to me. The case is from 2014. The FIR is from 2017. If the applicants indeed had to tamper with evidence, they would have done it by now.” He also said the CBI had told the court that a charge sheet was submitted. “If that be so, I have not understood as to how custodial detention of the applicants is necessary any more or how further investigation against the other accused persons will be hampered if the applicants are not detained in custody.” The order passed by ACJ Bindal ordering house arrest, however, said: “Extraordinary situations need extra-ordinary solutions.” The order referred to Monday’s incidents and said: “These have direct bearing on the ‘public trust and confidence of the people in the judicial system’ and the rule of law versus mobocracy. Legal issues cannot be allowed to be raised and settled in streets as these are not decided by show of strength but on merits in accordance with law.” “The CBI’s arguments — that the proceedings for granting bail were vitiated by the unprecedented protests led by the CM — are yet to be examined,” he added. The order passed by the bench on Friday said it would be “appropriate if the entire matter was heard by a larger bench”. It then said that the May 17 order, which put a stay on their interim bail, would be “modified” considering “the age and health issues of the accused” and added that the four be put “under house arrest”. Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta immediately urged for the order to be stayed for a week but the bench turned down this plea. Senior advocate and Trinamool MP Kalyan Banerjee referred to the impact of this order on Covid work, prompting the HC to allow them to work from home; but it also ordered that a log of visitors to their home be maintained along with CCTV footage of the entrance to their respective houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/house-arrest-for-netas-as-bail-plea-moves-to-5-judge-bench/articleshow/82843177.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

In the wake of such changes, the state health department has requested the Centre for 10,000 doses of the drug. Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “DG-2 has been found to be effective against the Sars-Cov-2 virus and as soon as we receive the 10,000 doses, we will start administering them to the Covid patients.” Some private hospitals in Ranchi have allegedly reduced their dependency on Remdesivir as the demand for the drug has gone down drastically. “We have observed a steep decline in the demand for Remdesivir in the city in the past five days,” state drug controller Dr Ritu Sahay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-requests-for-10k-doses-of-dg-2-for-cov-treatment/articleshow/82840617.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Caste abuse’: National Commission for Backward Classes notice to IIT-Kharagpur||KHARAGPUR: The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) has sought a point-wise reply within 15 days from the UGC and IITKharagpur over alleged “casteist subordination of SC/ST students” by a teacher in April. The NCBC notice (a copy of which is with TOI) has been served to the secretary of UGC and the director of IIT-Kgp on behalf of commission chairman Bhagwan Lal Sahani, and is said to be based on complaints registered by students of several IITs, including Bombay, Delhi, Madras and Guwahati, besides Kharagpur. On April 26, a video was posted on social media where a teacher of IIT-Kgp’s humanities department was reportedly heard “abusing and misbehaving with” SC/ST students attending a preparatory programme online. A complaint via email was lodged by students with IIT authorities. The latter initiated an inquiry and on May 12, suspended the accused “till further orders”.  IIT students also petitioned NCBC to look into the matter, which prompted the notice. IIT-Kgp registrar Tamal Nath said: “We have not received any information about the complaint lodged with NCBC. We are following our process and an inquiry is being conducted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/caste-abuse-ncbc-notice-to-iit-kgp/articleshow/82843228.cms||Sujoy Khanra

As he sought help from the international community on Friday, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli “lamented” that India hadn’t sent a “promised” consignment of one million doses and that the second wave in Nepal had resulted from the recent surge in infections in India as the two countries had an open border. Oli said a new variant had been detected and it was affecting people of all age groups. “The first dose of vaccines will be meaningless, because without the second dose in time it won’t work,” Oli told a Japanese publication, adding Nepal had sought help from China, US and others. Apart from Nepal and Bangladesh, India’s most solid friend in the near Indian Ocean, the Maldives, too is in dire need of help. According to sources in Male, even the extended 12-week gap for Covishield vaccine second dose is now elapsing for 60,000 people in the archipelago. Similarly, Nepal officials told TOI on Thursday that there are 1.7 million Nepal citizens who are waiting to be fully vaccinated after taking the first dose. While expressing understanding of India’s predicament, these countries, along with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, have been asking India to get the Serum Institute of India to fulfil its contractual obligations to them. MEA was silent on queries on resumption of supplies to the neighbourhood but on India's own shortage, it had said on Thursday that the government is in touch with the US for both procurement and scaling up manufacturing of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nepal-looks-to-vaccine-from-india-seeks-global-assistance/articleshow/82848994.cms||Sachin Parashar
