The panel could not meet till now because of assembly elections in five states. The panel comprises Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha. The top CBI post fell vacant on February 3 and the CBI additional director was named as the officiating director. As the Centre could not convene the meeting of the selection panel in next few weeks, Congress leader on the panel Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury left for West Bengal elections which have just ended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panel-likely-to-meet-next-week-to-pick-next-cbi-chief/articleshow/82441255.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The German major has taken this step to ensure its pilots and cabin crew operating the 10 weekly return flights to India do not require a layover in the Covid-ravaged metros here. One set of crew will operate from Frankfurt to Dubai; another set from Dubai to Delhi/Mumbai/Bengaluru and back to Dubai and then a third set will operate the aircraft — a Boeing 747-8 these days — back to Germany, say sources. As a result, the about 7-hour journey between Frankfurt and Delhi/Mumbai will now take over 9 hours. And the 11-hour flight between Frankfurt and Bengaluru will take about 13 hours now. Passengers will remain seated inside the aircraft during crew change. For this duration flight, a B-747 has 2-3 pilots and over 15 cabin crew. Aviation sources in Dubai said: “When the Lufthansa crew operates flights from Germany, they can stay in a city hotel for a layover in Dubai. When the crew returns after operating a flight to and from India, the world’s worst Covid hotspot at the moment, they will have to stay in transit inside Dubai Airport and fly from there itself to Frankfurt later on without going to the city.” Lufthansa will be operating quick turnaround flights from India. The crew will stay inside the aircraft while in Delhi/Mumbai/Bengaluru and fly back to Dubai. Indian aviation ministry has been getting requests from several airlines to exempt pilots operating international flights from RT-PCR tests, which is not allowed as per current norms here. However, it made an exception for crew of QTA international flights who do not alight from aircraft. “Considering that cockpit crew remain within aircraft in a sterile environment of the flight deck and the cabin crew are protected by PPE, these crew operating international QTA flights are exempted from RT-PCR test on arrival at Indian airports,” says an order issued by the aviation ministry last month. Lufthansa currently operates 10 weekly flights between Frankfurt and Delhi (4), Mumbai (3) and Bengaluru (3).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lufthansas-germany-india-germany-flights-to-now-stop-over-in-dubai-for-crew-change/articleshow/82441473.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Experts are sharply divided||AB Pandya (FOR)With uneven rain, river linking only way to ensure equitable distribution of waterInterlinking of rivers will help the country fulfill its dream of ensuring equitable distribution of water and, thereby, prosperity for all. There have been several such steps in this direction, and in 1980 a National Perspective Plan was formalised. This involved transfer of water from water-surplus basins to water-deficit basins/regions in which 30 links were identified. Somehow, the term ‘river interlinking’ stuck in the public imagination though its real name could have been the National Inter- Basin Water Transfer Project. So why do we need to link rivers? Though India receives about 4,000 BCM (billion cubic meters) of precipitation annually, utilisable resources are only 1,123 BCM. Even these are not distributed evenly in space or time. Most of the precipitation occurs in about 90 days in a year and the distribution of annual average availability ranges from 510 BCM for Ganga, 527 BCM from Brahmaputra and 11.02 BCM for Pennar and 12.06 BCM for Sabarmati. This shows the skew between potential demands and availability. It has, therefore, been recognised that the inter-basin transfer of water is the only recourse for making an equitable distribution of water across the country and thereby ensuring equal opportunities of development. Inter-basin water transfer is not a new concept and there have been many such successful examples in the country. It has been practised in our country since 1887 when the Mulla Periyar dam was built and waters of the west-flowing river basin were transferred to east flowing Vaigai basin transforming agricultural development in and around Madurai for about 68,000 hectares. Just ask any one in Madurai about the role this water plays in their lives. Similarly, we have already made trans- basin transfers in case of the Beas Satluj link, Sardar Sahayak pariyojana, Sardar Sarovar project, Kurnool Cudddapah canal etc which are functioning well. In the US, the Colorado-Big Thompson project has been functioning since the 1930s and has contributed greatly to the economy of Colorado state. Critics of this concept propound myths like massive rehabilitation requirements, environmental damage etc but these are all based on conjecture rather than reality. One of the crucial features of the project is location of reservoirs in areas with very low population density with only the canals running in agricultural areas. More than connecting multiple rivers like an electricity grid, the project aims at serving irrigation to the lower commands and transferring the corresponding surplus waters from upper commands to the neighbouring basin. We do not have an extreme disparity in terms of flora and fauna between neighbouring basins in peninsular India. Hence, this talk of mixing of waters and invasion of foreign species etc are not founded in any reality. Existing water transfers have also not indicated any such effects. There is a clamour about the disruption of climate due to such transfers. Once again, the same is purely conjectural as the impacts required to be created for such a climate change versus the actual transfers envisaged are tiny. As an example, the total yield of Ganga and Brahmaputra combined in Bay of Bengal is more than 1,000 BCM whereas the diversion is likely to be no more than 40 BCM annually and that too will ultimately result in reaching Bay of Bengal due to land topography. In any case, the linkage between any of the basins and their outlets into the seas are not being modified. On the other hand, the proposals can provide 172 lakh hectares of annual irrigation which, considering an average farm size of one hectare, can benefit 17.2 million farmer families and possibly 86 million people. In addition, 780 million can get assured drinking water supply. Surface water in water scarce areas will stop unsustainable groundwater utilisation as well. Thus, the benefits far outweigh costs. The question as to why such beneficial schemes are not yet getting implemented is due to our internal wrangling. Ken Betwa happens to be the first link which was identified for implementation. It will benefit the perennially water-short Bundelkhand region and other associated regions of Bina and upper Betwa basins. Besides irrigation and drinking water, it will generate 103 MW of hydropower and 27 MW solar power. Like any other infrastructure project, KBLP will also have some environmental and resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) issues. Daudhan reservoir will cause submergence of about 9,000 ha land of which 5,800 ha is forest land. However, with a comprehensive environment management plan (EMP), compensatory afforestation and liberal R&R policy, these impacts will be taken care of. A comprehensive landscape management plan is also being prepared for the conservation of Panna Tiger Reserve. Even wildlife will get sustenance in hot summers with assured water supply from the reservoir. The reservoir remaining at relatively low level will expose large tracts of land allowing fodder to be grown, benefitting the lower rung of wildlife which, in turn, can support the whole pyramid. The project will provide year-round employment in Bundelkhand region, controlling forced migration to far flung areas for livelihood. The assured drinking water supply will also uplift health standards of the local populace. AB Pandya is Secretary General, International Commission on Irrigation and DrainageRohan D'Souza (AGAINST)Our quest to control rivers doesn’t account for the stiff ecological costAt first glance, the Interlinking Rivers Programme (ILRP) offers great appeal. India is generously endowed with a sprawling river system but though bounteous and generous, these rivers are whimsical: prone to recurring floods, bone-dry droughts and with vast volumes winding circuitously before wastefully emptying into the sea. Enter the engineer with a grand vision. Why not link India’s river network through dams, diversions and barrages, while impounding much of their flows within giant reservoirs that are connected? Then wire this mix of concrete and steel infrastructure with software involving a couple of equations, data sets, sensors and the ingenuity of some hard hat engineers and, soon enough, all the rivers can be put on tap. That is, capture the surplus flows of a river and transfer it to a water deficit or stressed region. This, in fact, is the best argument put forward for the Ken-Betwa link. On closer scrutiny, however, this fantastical and elegant ILRP notion falls flat. The disconnect between idea and reality, in fact, plays out at three levels. First, the entire project rests on a wrong assumption. There is no such thing as a river with a ‘surplus flow’. Since the 1980s, studies under the broad field of ‘river ecology’ have convincingly established that a river cannot be defined as ‘lots of water’ in a channel. Rather, every river is a fluvial highway that connects flora and fauna across and between floodplains, wetlands, deltas and estuaries. In sum, it delivers innumerable environmental services such as creating fish habitats, replenishing soil, sustaining biodiversity and sculpting land through erosion and deposition. Seasonal variability floods or low flows are vital to enabling the river to constantly evolve its rich diversity of ecological relations. The Brahmaputra or the Ganga, for example, should therefore be understood not as massive flows but as a collection of ecological relations and environmental services. If a river is thus a biological regime, then it cannot have a surplus flow. If the principal assumption is clearly wrong, it should also come as no surprise when a second order of complications follows from the first. Notably, the flawed reasoning that often goes with making economic calculations for the project. It is now fairly well known that many if not every big dam or large-scale irrigation project in India has a tendency to get their cost and benefit ratios mostly muddled. To a great extent, this is because economics as a discipline continues to have a hard time developing methodologies that can meaningfully capture ecological costs. This gets even messier when grappling with plotting future scenarios. Consequently, for all the assumed benefits of irrigation and electricity from large dams, the long-term impacts from water logging, salinity or the loss of fisheries have yet to be meaningfully added up. That is, no reliable assessment has thus far been carried out that can meaningfully tell us whether over 70 years of large-scale water infrastructure development were worth the ecological costs. But the wrong assumption and flawed reasoning that haunts the ILRP is actually indicative of a far more profound and fatal limitation. Recent scholarship, mostly by historians, has ably described how water infrastructure and management in post Independent India has tended to retain a strong colonial engineering mindset. The earliest version of the ILRP was, in fact, first championed in the 1850s by the famed colonial engineer and irrigator General Sir Arthur Cotton. Titled the Peninsular Scheme, Cotton’s plan was to build navigation canals that would link Karachi (now in Pakistan) to Madras (Chennai) via Kanpur, Kolkata and Cuttack with additional lines crawling upwards to Pune. In terms of rivers, this meant connecting the Indus to the Ganga with canals before dropping the latter steeply to the South to link up with the Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari and finally the Cauvery. And if such a vast navigation network could be built, the General then confidently concluded, there would be no need for the railways in British India. Though Cotton’s Peninsular Scheme came to grief, the colonial quest for river control remains. Notably in the poorly understood claim that rivers are mere flows that need to be regulated and can be put to work by dams, barrages, weirs, embankments and canal systems. Starkly missing in the picture is how we make sense of the river as a complex biological pulse. Does this mean that rivers should never be engineered? No. The argument is for ‘smart engineering’, which is a rapidly evolving approach in Europe. Smart engineers build projects that are in active dialogue with social scientists, ecologists and specially those who specialise in design. Cement and contractor engineering can no longer address ecological complexity and the ILRP is the last surviving dinosaur in that tradition. If the coming challenges of water shortages and extreme flood events are to be meaningfully dealt with, then Indian engineering has to embrace new knowledge and be inventive enough to enable a productive conversation between science, ecology, history, sociology and art. A river, after all, is more than just water.

"We do not want to quarrel with you now," Banerjee said. "We were sworn in at 10.45 am on Wednesday, the first stern letter from the Centre reached us at 7 pm the same evening and a central team arrived on Thursday morning. Did central teams ever come to ask about oxygen and vaccine shortage? We wish the Centre was similarly proactive when Hathras (gang rape incident) happened and riots took place in Delhi or Uttar Pradesh," she added. Banerjee announced Rs 2 lakh as compensation for the next of kin of 16 people who died in post-poll violence, "most of them before May 3, when the model poll code of conduct was in force and law and order was under the Election Commission". "I know money cannot bring back those who have died but this will provide some relief to the bereaved families," she said. One of the dead was a Sanjukta Morcha supporter and the rest were from BJP and Trinamool. Banerjee then appealed to the Centre and BJP: "...Let good sense prevail. A lot of fake videos are in circulation. Stop instigating people. A fake video was sent to me on Wednesday night showing a woman being assaulted. Later, it turned out to be a dispute over tree-felling," she said. "All BJP CMs have been asked to speak against me," she said in response to Assam BJP leaders' contention that BJP workers from Bengal were taking shelter in Assam. "Cooch Behar borders Assam. People from Assam come to Bengal when there are disturbances there. It is significant that BJP has won most seats in Cooch Behar," she said. Banerjee has said most of the violence is happening in areas where BJP has won. The Bengal CM questioned the presence of central ministers in Bengal who, she said, “were going to villages and instigating communal riots”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/accept-mandate-and-allow-us-to-work-now-didi-tells-centre/articleshow/82442943.cms||---

Thulasi Maddineni, BBMP commissioner in-charge of the south zone war room, said about 30 workers did not turn up, while the war room required all its 210 employees to be present. She said some miscreants had posted the names of all 210 workers with their mobile numbers and they were getting random calls, with some even issuing them threats. “The woman employees, especially, are scared. We had to talk to their parents and request to send them to work but only a few were convinced,” said Maddineni. She said officials are in talks with Crystal Group, the agency supplying contact workers, to get it to deploy new workers. Bommanahalli and east zone war rooms also saw many employees skipping work. The south zone war room came under spotlight after BJP lawmakers led by Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya visited it on Tuesday and admonished officials, alleging a bed-for-bribe scam was being perpetrated. Surya read out names of 17 Muslim workers even though the control room had 210 names on its rolls. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said attendance had improved in other seven zones, although they continued to be understaffed. Police detained eight workers on Thursday for questioning. Even the BBMP Citizen Help Desk, liaising with hospitals on patients’ behalf, struggled to deploy volunteers at hospitals. “South zone is the worst hit. Of 50 volunteers, only 26 showed up,” said Girish Mattennavar, director of the help desk. Mattennavar said he sent WhatsApp messages to all volunteers, appealing to them not to pay heed to rumours being spread on social media.

---||Business||After US nod, EU, NZ too ready to discuss waiver of IPR on vaccines||NEW DELHI: The Biden administration's backing for talks on Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibility for vaccines at WTO has prodded others such as the European Union, a key opponent, out of its waiver hesitancy, but trade negotiators are treading with caution. The move, first proposed by India and South Africa in October, is seen to be critical to ramp up and democratise Covid-19 vaccine and drug production and increase access in developing and poor countries. For months, there was a stalemate as the proposal was opposed by developed countries. "The EU is also ready to discuss any proposal that addresses the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner," European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday, hours after a statement from US trade representative Katherine Tai, who supported negotiations on the issue. "And that's why we are ready to discuss how the US proposal for waiver on intellectual property protection for covered vaccines could help achieve that objective," she told an online conference, weeks after the trading bloc had told WTO members that this was a no-go area. The Indian government appeared pleased with the progress after months of deadlock. "We welcome US government supporting this initiative and joining 120 other countries working towards affordable Covid-19 vaccines," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Twitter. Experience shows that numbers can be deceptive as several countries are known to switch sides at the last moment on crucial issues at WTO, where decisions are taken unanimously. Yet, the severity of the pandemic and the realisation that even rich countries with vaccinated populations will remain vulnerable unless a big chunk of the global population has been inoculated against the virus has led the US and EU to drop their resistance, producing a ray of hope of about the possibility of a consensus. "We are hopeful that with a consensus-based approach, the waiver can be approved quickly," New Delhi said in a statement. For now, Indian negotiators are keeping their fingers crossed, waiting to see how the other traditional naysayers – Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Canada and Brazil – react, and acknowledge that the statements from the US and the EU only signal a start of some tough negotiations in Geneva over the coming weeks. Significantly, the dilution of US’s traditional resistance, following intense pressure from civil society, was limited to talks on vaccines, while India and South Africa’s joint proposal at WTO had sought to extend the flexibility to Covid-19 related medicines as well. Trade experts also caution that the waiver, if the WTO membership agrees, will be limited to the final product while the challenge of sourcing inputs, many of them patent-protected, will also have to be overcome even if patents on the vaccines are waived. “Time is of essence. It is important to see how quickly we can start negotiations and how soon a decision is reached. We also need to ensure that the final decision is such that it benefits the developing and poor countries, including those without manufacturing facility,” said Biswajit Dhar, a professor at JNU. Abhijit Das, who heads the Centre for WTO studies, too cautioned against immediate celebrations. “This is a bold and positive step from the US but a big battle lies ahead when detailed negotiations start on the scope and duration of the waiver.” India is seen as a major potential beneficiary because of the infrastructure and experience it has in vaccine production. However, along with South Africa, it is coordinating its moves with other countries to work out a comprehensive proposal which will seek patent holiday for vaccines as well as their components. As could be expected, with the prospect of loss of billions of dollars facing them, initial statements from the pharma lobby were not welcoming. “…as we have consistently stated, a waiver is the simple but the wrong answer to what is a complex problem. Waiving patents of Covid-19 vaccines will not increase production nor provide practical solutions needed to battle this global health crisis. On the contrary, it is likely to lead to disruption; while distracting from addressing the real challenges in scaling up production and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally,” Geneva-based pharma lobby group IFPMA said in a statement. JNU’s Dhar emphasised that the pharma companies are the ones who really need to come on board given that they own the intellectual property.

The government in its appeal contended that it is trying its best to meet the needs of various states and order passed by the HC would hamper its effort to ensure supply of oxygen to other states as per their requirements which would lead to complete collapse of the system.

---||India||HC ‘murder charge’ remarks against EC were harsh, says SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday termed the Madras High Court's "murder charge" remarks against the Election Commission as "harsh" and the "metaphor inappropriate" as it walked a tightrope between praising the role of HCs during the pandemic and advising judges against making off-the-cuff remarks during hearings. In a 31-page judgment on the EC's appeal against the HC's remarks, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah achieved three objectives - assuaged the EC's hurt, ensured that judges did not feel restrained from questioning the actions of constitutional bodies and the executive during the pandemic, and expanded the media's right to cover court proceedings. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, "The remarks of the high court were harsh. The metaphor inappropriate." However, it was quick to clarify that it was not blaming the HC for remarks that could have been made during the flow of dialogue process intrinsic to judicial scrutiny of actions of constitutional bodies and the executive during the pandemic. "The HC, if indeed it did make the oral observations which have been alluded to, did not seek to attribute culpability for the Covid-19 pandemic in the country to the EC. What it would have instead intended to do was to urge the EC to ensure stricter compliance of Covid-19 related protocols during elections," the bench said. It further clarified that oral observations by judges of superior courts during a hearing did not form part of court records and were at best meant to elicit a studied response from the authorities for reaching a just conclusion. "These oral remarks are not a part of the official judicial record and, therefore, the question of expunging them does not arise. It is trite to say that a formal opinion of a judicial institution is reflected through its judgments and orders, and not its oral observations during the hearing," it said. However, the bench appeared worried about an emerging trend of judges making caustic observations against litigants during hearings, be it constitutional bodies, governments or individual litigants. “We must emphasise the need for judges to exercise caution in off-the-cuff remarks in open court, which may be susceptible to misinterpretation,” Justice Chandrachud said.

Two FIRs have been registered so far and a third FIR could be filed soon, subject to verification of the complaint. The police have set up a helpline and provided an email address where "victims" of fake news can report any such instance. The immediate trigger was a post on social media by a south Kolkata youth, now working in Delhi, complaining about his portrayal as a "martyr" on the "West Bengal BJP" Facebook page. "I am Abhro Banerjee, living and hale and hearty and around 1,300km away from Sitalkuchi. BJP IT Cell is now claiming I am Manik Moitra and died in Sitalkuchi. Please don't believe these fake posts and please don't worry. I repeat: I am (still) alive," he tweeted along with a screenshot of the post that allegedly misrepresented him as a "martyr" from Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar. The 5.28-minute clip was later taken down from the "West Bengal BJP" Facebook page, but it was live on the "@BJP4India" Twitter handle until much later. This tweet, too, was deleted later, but it had been shared thousands of times by then. When contacted for comment on Thursday morning, BJP's Bengal spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, "I will enquire and get back to you. Let me check the details first." The "BJPBengal" Twitter handle clarified that Banerjee's image was "erroneously included in the video". "Mamik Moitro succumbed to his injuries in Sitalkuchi following violence by Trinamool members," the tweet said. Banerjee told TOI he had nothing to add to his tweet. His friends said they were "worried" about what was happening. "This factory of lies is very dangerous," one of them said. News related to violence in post-poll Bengal has several shades. Some of it is real, other parts fake. False narratives of any kind serve to obscure the truth and to that extent make it more difficult to identify and deal with the real problem. Sifting facts from fiction is the most important thing now.Times NowPolice officials said citizens could contact them by tweet or email or phone to report fake news. "Our cyber cell is probing the complaints we have received and we have already registered two FIRs. Complaints include fake news, false representations, threats issued over the internet and use of old clips from unrelated incidents to foment trouble," joint commissioner of police (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said. Another official said charges against the alleged offenders included publishing or circulating statements or reports containing rumours or news with the intent to create or promote feelings of enmity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-cops-file-firs-to-bust-fake-news-on-clashes/articleshow/82446299.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Centre had supplied 730 MT of oxygen on Wednesday, which was more than the SC's 700 MT benchmark, but insisted that there should be a simultaneous audit of oxygen utilisation in Delhi as experts were of the firm view that the state could manage the situation with 500-600 MT with proper distribution and utilisation as Mumbai has been doing. To buttress the Centre's stand that Delhi was seeking excess oxygen, the SG said, "On Wednesday, not one complaint of stock out was received from Delhi. It may be noted that this was based on supplies of oxygen of 585 MT the day before on May 4, made to Delhi." For Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra said the Centre's allocation did not reflect ground realities and was mere paperwork and if at all an audit was required, it should of the central government's arbitrary allocations. He then went on to say that as yet, the Centre had not taken over the entire fleet of oxygen tankers in the country for engaging them in equitable and timely distribution of oxygen to states. Though the SC has directed the Centre to maintain 700 MT oxygen supply to Delhi till Monday, Mehta informed a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah that the supplies would drop to 560 MT on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. For two days after that, it would be 640 MT and 700 MT, respectively. For May 11 and 12, it would be 560 MT. Supply would increase to 640 MT and 700 MT on May 13 and 14, respectively, the Centre said. Mehra turned the heat on the Centre by telling the bench that though the SC has stayed contempt proceedings against the Centre, it continues to be in breach of SC orders for maintaining supply of 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi, a mark which is going to be met only twice in the next eight days. "If allocation of a lesser quantity of oxygen was enough to meet the demand of Delhi hospitals, why are patients and their relatives running from hospital to hospital, which are sending SOS messages about no oxygen or its alarmingly low levels. No one can deny the scarcity of oxygen. There should be no oxygen audit in Delhi at this juncture as that will divert the attention of medical professionals and hospitals from treatment of Covid patients," Mehra said. Delhi government said that the Centre appeared to be hell bent on launching a witch-hunt in this difficult time. The bench said that it would not allow courts to be used as a platform for the recrimination or a witch-hunt against the Delhi government. The Delhi government further told the SC that increasing oxygen allocation for Delhi by another 200 MT would result in a cut of 2-3% of allocations for other states. "The Centre keeps repeating that increasing Delhi's allocation will reduce that of other states. It does not lie in the Centre's mouth to say this when no state has complained till now. The Centre has not been able to meet the demand of 700 MT and is now going to reduce it to 560 MT for the next three days. This is a continuing contumacious conduct by the Centre," Mehra said. The solicitor general said a survey was conducted on Wednesday evening about the oxygen stock at 56 major hospitals in Delhi and 11 oxygen refillers. "The findings of the survey showed significant stock in hospitals in Delhi. Large quantities of oxygen, which reached Delhi in the evening yesterday (730 MT), have still not been distributed to hospitals, and that will improve the stock further," he said. Mehta accused the Delhi government of being slow in offloading oxygen from tankers and allowing them to go back for refill. "Unloading is taking too long since Delhi has huge excess supply. This is causing delay in turnaround of tankers and fresh supplies. Any plan will only succeed if tankers and containers unload in maximum eight hours so that they can go back to the eastern part of India or Gujarat and get more supplies for replenishing the stocks," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-govt-opposes-o2-use-audit-says-study-allocation/articleshow/82447070.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Of them, about 29,000 have been vaccinated so far. The ECR GM has directed railway officials to expedite vaccination drive in railways as it is the only way to fight the deadly virus,” ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said. The ECR headquarters at Hajipur has total strength of 2,564 employees, including senior officials. Of them, only 800 have so far been vaccinated. Similarly, 4,919 of 14,640 employees in Danapur division of the ECR have got jabs. Of the 10,804 employees in Samastipur division, 3,559 have been inoculated so far. Kumar said Sonepur division has about 12,820 railway employees and 5,553 of them and their family members have been vaccinated so far.

Vehicle movement was also comparatively lesser on the day as people curtailed unnecessary movement. Ten shops that had violated the norms were sealed. Only essential stores such as grocery and rice stores, markets, meat stalls and hotels at specified timings without dine-in facility were allowed to function till 12pm. Milk booths and medicals were allowed to operate around the clock. Some textile stores around Meenakshi Amman temple opened shops in violation of the lockdown rules and operated. At least 10 shops were sealed by the revenue officials. Madurai district authorities warned of strict action against violation of the lockdown rules. Police teams moved around the city starting from 12pm to check whether the rules are being followed. Those who were still operating were asked to shut. R Asokan, a rice storekeeper from K Pudur said, “I opened the shop only at 10am and had to close it within two hours. There were no considerable sales.” Public transport was allowed to operate as usual, but taxi and share autos did not attract many passengers. TNSTC and private mini bus operators operated buses as usual, but with less crowd. An official from the transport department said buses were operated as usual in routine timings despite few seats being occupied. Comparatively, mofussil buses witnessed better crowds. “There was an order to ply buses only with 50% capacity. There was no need to impose the order as the number of passengers in city buses did not even come close to the 50% capacity,” the official said. Tasmac shops, which were opened between 8am and 12pm witnessed a decent crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/crowds-thin-on-day-1-of-new-curbs/articleshow/82441184.cms||---

The VC on Thursday wrote to the health department requesting logistical help to convert the hostel into a safe home for patients who test positive. Earlier, students and teachers had written to the VC requesting permission to convert a part of the university and the hostel into safe homes. The health department, too, had given its nod to set up a safe home on campus. “We will be helping in whatever way possible. A committee will be set up with representatives of all stakeholders. But the university cannot make the medical arrangements, so the administration has written to the health department,” said Partha Pratim Roy, general secretary of the Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association. Students of Presidency University, too, have written to the authorities about converting the campus and hostel on College Street and the campus in New Town into safe homes. A decision is yet to be taken. St Xavier’s University is setting up an isolation home on the New Town campus with Hidco. It will primarily cater to local residents without space to isolate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-presi-xav-plan-campus-safe-homes/articleshow/82441247.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Business||IP waiver: US move may help ramp up vax capacity||Mumbai: The US policy U-turn of supporting waiver of intellectual property on Covid vaccines could help developing countries like India to manufacture patented vaccines, as well as those which are not yet available in the country. These may include vaccines from UK’s AstraZeneca, US firms J&J, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, Russia’s Gamaleya Center, and domestic firm Bharat Biotech. The US said it would also participate in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations to support the temporary waiving of protections, and work with the private sector and other partners to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. The decision puts pressure on innovators to share technology and intellectual property (IP), which could lead to vaccine companies — those not licensed — to ramp up manufacturing in several countries, including India. With IP barriers removed, biotech companies and those that make biologics may have the capability to roll out these vaccines in India. AstraZeneca and Novavax have licensed their vaccines to Pune-based Serum Institute of India, J&J has tied up with Bio E, while Russian Direct Investment Fund has partnered with six domestic companies, including Gland Pharma, Hetero and Virchow Biotech. Bharat Biotech will share technology for manufacture of indigenous vaccine Covaxin with Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals. Experts also pointed out that the issue of technology transfer, know-how and manufacturing capacity could still be a huge challenge for progress on the vaccine front, unless the IP holders voluntarily share knowledge. For instance, in March, Canadian vaccine producer Biolyse revealed it had sought but failed to secure an IP licensing agreement with J&J to produce a Covid vaccine. The company had said it had the capacity to produce without technology transfer, if legal barriers were removed. Shares of Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax plunged after the US announced its decision to waive patent protection on Covid vaccines. Public health experts said the waiver should be extended to medicines and other medical tools, as proposed under India and South Africa’s submission to the WTO. If the US supports the waiver proposal at WTO, then there may be crucial progress with regard to Covid therapeutics, even as vaccines may take time to be rolled out. “With the delays in vaccination and more and more people getting sick, it is important that the waiver extends to Covid drugs. This would give the much-needed boost to generic companies to manufacture drugs, which can be used to treat Covid. There is a promising pipeline of emerging medicines being tested globally, including Pfizer’s drug. Significantly, the USTR decision not to penalise countries pursuing compulsory licensing to address the Covid challenge, will also give companies confidence to push ahead with generic versions,’’ Leena Menghaney, global IP adviser, MSF Access Campaign told TOI. There are a few on-patent expensive drugs approved for emergency use against Covid in certain countries (Remdesivir, Baricitinib), and more in the pipeline (Molnupiravir, Proxalutamide). Generics could be available in a few months if patents are removed. Domestic companies have largely avoided challenging patents, and seeking CLs, with policymakers not being proactive, due to the feared backlash from the US. According to the IP expert, given the huge surge in Covid cases, the government should process Natco’s CL application in a time-bound manner. Further, the drug controller general needs to ensure that there is no patent linkage in the regulatory process so that emergency approvals are available to generic producers of patented medicines. Also, a timely decision-making has to be ensured on pending compulsory licensing applications. “It is crucial that this (US) waiver not just apply to preventative vaccines, but should also cover other medical products for Covid, including treatments for people who fall ill and diagnostics to help curb the spread, as originally proposed by India and South Africa seven months ago. MSF appeals to Norway, EU, the UK, Canada, and Japan to join the US in the negotiations and stop stalling the proposal to waive off all IP restrictions that may be faced in expanding the number of manufacturers to meet the needs of the developing world,’’ Menghaney said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ip-waiver-us-move-may-help-ramp-up-vax-capacity/articleshow/82442957.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Residents feel the recent raids by the government officials on those selling oxygen cylinders were a relief, but tough measures against such people should continue. For instance, flow meters and other equipment required for oxygen cylinders are still being sold at an exorbitant price. A social worker, who helps Covid-19 patients and their family members, said the flow meters attached oxygen cylinders were being hoarded and sold on black market. He said a person looking for flow meter was asked to pay anywhere between Rs 6,000 and Rs 12,000 at three different shops on Govind Mitra Road on Wednesday. “The maximum actual price of a flow meter is just Rs 1,200. The shopkeepers are hoarding these products,” he said, adding oxygen cylinders and other necessary equipment and drugs being confiscated by the government officials should be made available to the needy. Recalling the pain which her family had gone through a week back, 30-year-old Shaida Haque said she was desperately looking for an oxygen cylinder for her father-in-law and shocked when a person on the other side of a phone call asked her to pay Rs 95,000 for a cylinder. “His oxygen saturation level had come down to 80. I started calling my friends and relatives for help and finally got the cellphone number a person. The man, however, asked me to pay Rs 95,000 for one oxygen cylinder. Thanks to good Samaritans, I managed to get one from an NGO. However, I could not save the life of my father-in-law,” she added. Apart from oxygen cylinders, people are also struggling to get basic medicines. One Ekhlaq Ahmad (28) said he visited several shops on Ashok Rajpath to buy multivitamin tablets, but to no avail. “Finding medicines like Remdesivir and, Tocilizumab and Fabiflu is still a herculean task here,” he added. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said gap between the demand and supply and hoarding have led to shortage of medicines. “The government has developed a process to enable hospitals to procure Remdesivir from the government depot,” he added. Govt fixes ambulance rates:After receiving several complaints about ambulance drivers harassing people and charging extra money amid Covid-19 pandemic, the state health department has finally fixed the charge according to the type of ambulance and distance covered. All these vehicles will have basic life-support system and medicines. For a distance of up to 50km, a small car will cost Rs 1,500 and the one with air-condition (AC) facility Rs 1,700. Bolero, Sumo, Marshal or any vehicle in this category will cost Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,100 with AC. In case, the distance is more than 50km, an additional Rs 18 will be charged per kilometre for all categories of ambulances. Vehicles like maxi, city ride, winger, tempo (with 12-22 seats) will charge Rs 2,500 and Xylo, Scorpio and Travera Rs 2,500 for 50km. In case the distance is more than 50km, an additional Rs 25 per kilometre will be charged. The health department has said action would be taken against those violating the norms and charging additional money. One can also raise ambulance-related query on 06202751107.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/profits-of-doom-black-market-thrives-amid-covid-pandemic/articleshow/82439550.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The 'punishments' range from having to say sorry with folded hands to getting whacked with a baton, and some even having to undergo the humiliation of being made to squat while holding both ears. Many videos of these self-styled punishments have gone viral. One such video reportedly of Fatuha in rural Patna surfaced on Thursday which shows police personnel forcing two lockdown violators to do the squatting and then making them slap each other. They were then let off with a warning not to roam about without any purpose. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, however, said that these incidents surfacing in the news or social media are rare. “More than 95% of people who are venturing out of their homes have genuine and valid reasons,” he said, adding, there are 23,000 people in Patna who are Covid-19 positive of whom 3,000 are in hospitals. “At least two to three attendants of each of the patients would come on the road for medicines, doctors, visiting hospitals, diagnostic centres and other purposes. Besides, several other persons having urgent official work and other valid works are also coming on the road. Only these crowds are visible,” SSP added. However, Sharma also that there are a handful of people who are coming on the road without any purpose. “They are carrying all valid vehicle documents. Most return home after policemen request them to. It is only when some people refuse to comply that gives rise to a peculiar situation where the police can neither arrest nor penalise them. These are one or two incidents where police have to become a little strict,” he said. SSP Sharma further said that even amid such a crisis scenario, there are people who cite reasons for going to the bank for mere updating passbooks. “We have no option left but to let them go after giving them a pep-talk,” he added. Patna high court senior advocate Yogesh Chandra Verma, however, said the police is not behaving in a friendly manner. “I was scheduled to go for vaccination today but avoided due to fear that police might stop at several locations. Police must behave in a friendly manner amid the present crisis scenario,” he said, adding, senior police authorities should look into this. He said lockdown is not the solution. The health infrastructure, which is in poor shape, needs to be enhanced on a large scale to deal with the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lockdown-violators-face-the-music-in-city/articleshow/82439534.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||44 private hospitals in Patna halt vaccination||PATNA: Immunisation drive against the deadly Covid-19 virus has come to a halt in all the 44 private hospitals of Patna. However, the government has made arrangements to give second dose of the vaccine Covishield in nearest government hospitals. DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh said following a direction from the State Health Society, the functioning of vaccination centres set up in private hospitals were stopped. “However, 145 government hospitals are running the immunisation drive as per the health department's guidelines,” the DM added. District immunisation officer ( DIO) Dr SP Vinayak said as vaccination strategy in the state was being reviewed, 44 immunisation centres running in private hospitals were asked to stop functioning. He said, under the new strategy now private hospitals would be required to get the vaccines directly from the manufacturing companies on certain terms and conditions. “Fresh applications would be invited from the private hospitals of the district willing to join the immunisation drive on changed conditions,” he said. Vinayak, however, said those who had taken their first dose of Covishield in any private hospital may now get the second shot in any government hospital two days in a week—Monday and Thursday. Covishield is also available at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences vaccination centre. “Altogether 145 government hospitals including 44 in the urban areas like PMCH, NMCH and AIIMS-P and 101 in rural areas have been assigned the task of immunisation,” he added. Dr Talat Halim, regional director of Paras HMRI hospital said, “The hospital is getting several calls from persons who got their first dose at this hospital to inquire as where to get the second shot of the Covishield vaccine.” Meanwhile, the Bihar Industries Association ( BIA) president Ram Lal Khetan and secretary Anil Kumar Singh in a statement urged the CM, deputy CMs and health minister to reconsider the government decision to dissociate private hospitals from immunisation drive. They said the state has witnessed huge loss of life and challenges before the health system in the second wave of the covid 19. Now, there was strong chance of the third wave of this deadly virus and mass immunisation was the only shield to protect against the infection. The BIA demanded inclusion of not only the private hospitals but also some social organisations in the inoculation drive in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/44-private-hosps-in-city-halt-vaccination/articleshow/82439526.cms||VK Tripathi

Prasad (62), who earlier worked at a private firm in Patna, had to pay exorbitant fare as no vehicle was available at Mithapur bus stand to reach home. He was returning from Digha in western Patna after attending a wedding ceremony on May 5. With only a few vehicles plying on roads, people have to face hardship due to lockdown. “I have just landed at the Patna airport from Surat via Delhi and am looking for a vehicle for Muzaffarpur. I don’t know how much I have to pay for the car,” said Raju Kumar, a resident of Jatkauli in Muzaffarpur district. Raju’s father Gajendra Ojha (65) has tested positive for Covid-19. “I had to pay more to the private airlines compared to normal charges due to the pandemic. Also, I have to pay more for the car,” he said while waiting for a car outside the airport. Ganga Ram’s story is more pathetic. Ram (43), a resident of Patepur in Vaishali district, had waited for a bus at Mithapur bus stand since morning. “I alighted from the train at the Karbigahia end of Patna Junction at 4.30am. It’s 10am, but there is no vehicle,” he said. Many people were seen walking on foot on the pavements to reach home. That is also not allowed. “I have to show my e-ticket to a police constable on duty at Hajipur junction. Only then I was allowed to go outside the premises to catch a bus for Samastipur,” a visibly upset Rajesh Kumar said. Additional director general (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said police forces have been provided to the important districts for effective enforcement of the lockdown. Patna has been provided five additional companies of the police force. On the first day of the lockdown, seven people were arrested and FIRs lodged against five for violating Covid-19 guidelines. Similarly, 448 vehicles were seized and a sum of Rs 7.97 lakh fine was realised from them. However, vehicles engaged in essential services have been exempted from purview of the lockdown. “Those travelling for valid reasons don’t need to worry,” the ADG added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/its-tough-for-people-to-reach-home-from-rly-stations-airport/articleshow/82439069.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar: Small shopkeepers, pharmacists go online to survive during pandemic||PATNA: Even as the Covid-19 pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the small businesses due to nationwide lockdown last year, some adopted technology and creative thinking to survive. As the senior citizens and ailing people are unable to visit shops to buy groceries, vegetables and medicines for fear of getting infected with the Covid-19 virus, these small shopkeepers are extending a helping hand to them and supplying the essential items of their need on their doorsteps. The customers are supposed to WhatsApp the list of items to the shopkeepers or dictate the same on mobile. Some advanced shopkeepers have also developed their websites to receive online orders of their customers. They have hired some youths to deliver the goods to the customers and collect money from them either in cash or through POS machines, following all the Covid protocol. Retired professor of botany, who resides in Boring Road area, said he purchases most of the daily use items from his known shopkeepers who take orders on mobile phone and deliver the items within two hours. He makes the payment to the shopkeeper online. Niranjan Yadav, owner of a general store near Boring Road crossing, said he learnt this style of business during the lockdowns last year when many customers stopped coming to his shop and requested him to send the items at their homes. “They also offered me some additional incentives. I hired a man for delivering the items to the customers without charging any additional amount from them. This system not only benefited the customers but also saved me from huge financial loss owing to dwindling sales during the lockdown,” he said. Another grocery shop owner at Kasturba Path in West Anandpuri, Dilip Sharma has also started supplying food items, milk and other dairy products besides some vegetables on the doorsteps of his customers in that locality. He receives the orders through SMS or WhatsApp and gets the items delivered to the customers within an hour or so, he added. Shankar Das, who owns a small kirana shop at Kankarbagh, said people don’t want to leave their homes. “They want everything online, even if stores like ours are open for limited hours every day. Hence, we had to respond to that and arrange for delivering the desired items at the customers’ residences,” he said. Shankar now spends much of his day speaking with customers on WhatsApp, sharing pictures of his stock and initiating online transactions through GooglePay. A number of medicine shops and vegetable sellers have also started supplying medicines (on valid prescriptions of a doctor or hospital only) on the doorsteps of their customers. Some of them are also serving the needs of Ccovid patients gracefully by supplying essential medicines to their homes, said retired telecom engineer Gopal Sharan Singh of Gai Ghat locality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/small-shopkeepers-pharmacists-go-online-to-survive-during-pandemic/articleshow/82439229.cms||B K Mishra

His report came positive. When his doctor insisted for a CT scan after his blood tests revealed high sugar levels and inflammatory markers, it was found that 50% of his lung was involved. His oxygen saturation too had dipped to 85. All this on Day-1 itself. He is now admitted in the hospital with his son whose scan has revealed nearly 60% damage to his lungs by the virus. Even as the debate on the importance of HRCT rages on after the statement of AIIMS-D director Dr Randeep Guleria that HRCT did not serve any purpose in mild and home isolated Covid-19 patients, city-based radiologists are busy with a high number of infected and suspected patients lining up for high-resolution CT (HRCT) of thorax (chest and lungs) to understand the lung involvement and severity of the infection. Doctors say the CT score of the lungs is helping save many lives, especially in the current wave when the strain seems to be attacking lungs more ferociously than ever. Live updates: Coronavirus Pulmonologist Dr Rahul Jalan, a city-based pulmonologist, said that in the post-Diwali wave in 2020, the average HRCT score (counted out of 25 based on each segment of lungs) was 6 to 8. “This time, it’s as high as 12 to 14 for average patients. It’s not all – even at the lower score, the patients report hypoxia (deprivation of adequate oxygen supply) this time, pointing at the change in the virus profile,” he said. “Current strain seems to attack lungs more furiously. More young patients are found to have moderate to severe lung disease compared to earlier waves,” said senior radiologist Dr Hemant Patel. Read AlsoDelhi: How Covid virus is settling deep down in lungs, making diagnosis toughDelhi hospitals are getting cases where a patient has typical symptoms of Covid-19 but tests negative for the viral infection, sometimes twice or thrice even through RT-PCR. Doctors say it is possible that the virus didn’t colonise the nasal or throat cavity and hence the swab samples didn’t yield aRadiologist Dr Amit Gupta said the average HRCT score has nearly doubled in the patients compared to the last wave Gujarat had seen in November. “Infectivity has increased – from 60% showing lung involvement in 2020, today 80% have lung damage” he said. Read AlsoAll-time high: India records 4.14 lakh new Covid cases in a dayIndia on Friday reported a record 4.14 lakh new Covid-19 cases taking the total tally of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country to 2.15 crore. With more than 3,900 new deaths, India's Covid-19 death has reached 2.34 lakh, as per Union health ministry data. ​On Friday, India reported 4,14,188 newWhat are its implications? The HRCT thorax – which shows clear (black) to completely infected (white) and has ground-glass opacity in between – also indicates lung capacity. Dr Manoj Singh, a city-based pulmonologist, said that this time around, the oxygen requirement has increased manifold due to higher involvement of lungs. “Majority of the patients require oxygen support from day 1. It was not the case in the last surge – at least for the majority of patients,” he said. Dr Sahil Shah, a city-based radiologist and joint secretary of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that the virus mutation has surely resulted in higher lung infection. “Several patients report lung infection right from the onset, which earlier used to take about five-six days. We however recommend the patients to wait for five days for the diagnosis if their symptoms are not very severe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-wave-has-launched-a-deadly-assault-on-lungs/articleshow/82442559.cms||Parth Shastri

On May 2, there was a second inspection by Patna high court advocate Mrigank Mauli, who submitted a detailed report in which he indicated the irregularity in consumption and supply of oxygen cylinders at the PMCH.A division bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah had appointed Mauli as amicus curiae while hearing three PILs on the grim pandemic situation. It had formed the committee of Dr Bhadani. The report has been taken on record by the high court.As per the report, Mauli found no patient kept on oxygen in the gynaecology ward on May 2, but even then manifold oxygen point log showed consumption of four type-D oxygen cylinders each with a capacity of 7,000 litres of oxygen from 7 am to 1 pm. Mauli wrote in his report that it "defies logic".For the RSB ward, Mauli mentioned that it’s consuming 348 type-D cylinders per day while, if calculated, it should consume a maximum of 150 cylinders per day.Mauli also found during the inspection that the pressure of type-D cylinders was less than what it should be, thereby showing a shortage of gas in every cylinder. For IGCC, which consists of critical care units such as general surgery, nephrology and neurology, Mauli found it has been consuming 120 type-D oxygen cylinders daily while it should have used only 13 cylinders per day.Mauli also found a newly constructed pressure-swing absorption plant next to the IGCC, but he found it locked and non-functional. After IGCC, Mauli inspected the ENT ward which was shown to be consuming 61 type-D in the logbook with only 23 patients on oxygen with a maximum flow of 5 litres per minute, which means the ENT ward should consume only 23 cylinders per day.Mauli also mentioned in the report that no record of type-B oxygen cylinders was maintained in the Tata ward even when there was a huge inflow and outflow of such cylinders. He mentioned that in the paediatric ward, too, it showed disproportionate oxygen consumption.Mauli suggested that there should be a real-time audit of oxygen consumption in different units of PMCH by an independent committee consisting of a bio-medical engineer and must have members from central government institutes and no member from state government medical institute should be in it.He also suggested that oxygen supply should be under constant monitoring which is currently being done by an outsourced agency and there should be a mechanism to check oxygen amount in every cylinder. The high court has observed that these facts are disturbing and the report speaks for itself.Incidentally, Patna DM Chandrashekar Singh had also written a letter to the health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit on April 28 asking him to get an audit done of demand, actual need and availability of oxygen at the government medical colleges and hospitals in Patna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/inspection-report-filed-in-hc-shows-oxygen-irregularities-at-pmch-wards/articleshow/82439627.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Cognizant quarterly revenue up 2.4%, trails behind peers||Chennai: IT major Cognizant, on Thursday, beat street estimates posting year-on-year revenue growth of 2.4% in constant currency (CC) terms for the January-March quarter (Q1) trailing the growth posted by its peers. At $4.4 billion, the company’s revenue grew marginally from the $4.2 billion in revenue it made in the quarter ended December 2020- a period which saw the company’s profits contract for the first time ever. The revenue growth factors in 300 basis points (100 basis points = 1%) of growth from acquisitions, and 90 basis points of negative impact from the exit of certain content services. The performance, though better sequentially, lags behind rivals like TCS and Infosys for the comparable period. TCS posted 5.9% revenue growth (CC terms) and Infosys revenues grew 9.6% in the March quarter. A surge in demand for software solutions from the healthcare sector and Cognizant’s acquisitions in the digital segment aided performance this quarter. Digital revenues were up by around 15% year-on-year. Digital business now makes up 44% of the total revenue- up from 39% in the prior year period. Quarterly net income stood at $505 million in Q1-2021- a 37% increase from $367 million in the same quarter last year, and also a surge from $316 million income it posted in December. Cognizant follows the calendar year as its fiscal year. However, attrition continued to rise in the quarter and is impacting margins outlook. Cognizant pulled back margin guidance to 15.2%-15.7% compared to 15.2-16.2% earlier due to shortage of digital skills, war for talent, and higher subcontractor costs. “Although, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition, reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent…,” Brian Humphries, CEO, Cognizant, told analysts in the earnings call. “This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent,” he added. Quarterly annualized attrition stood at 21% compared to 19% in the previous quarter. Voluntary attrition grew to 18% from 16% in December. Cognizant upped its revenue outlook for the upcoming quarter and for full fiscal 2021. For Q2, it expects revenue in the range of $4.42-$4.46 billion representing 8- 9% growth in constant currency which includes inorganic contribution of around 400 bps. Cognizant expects full year 2021 revenue to be in the range of $17.8-$18.1 billion- representing a 5.5%-7.5% growth in CC terms compared to 4%-7% range it guided last quarter. Analysts believe the tech titan’s two-year turnaround strategy, headed by the new management team, remains in a "work-in-progress" mode. Moshe Khatri at WedBush said in a note that while the company continues to invest in expanding its salesforce, disruption created by “internal changes,” they are in the process of devising plans to contain current levels of attrition. Kawaljeet Saluja of Kotak Institutional Equities believes the underperformance in the financial services vertical is an issue for Cognizant, and can be attributed to insourcing by a few large banks, lower penetration of digital services in the banking and loss of share to aggressive competitors. “ Health of financial services will be critical for catch-up in growth with competition,” he said in a note.Financial services continue to lag, as revenues from the sector declined 1.7% year-on-year. Healthcare revenue grew 7%. Communications, media and tech vertical revenue grew 3.1% thanks to recent acquisitions. Cognizant acquired digital enterprises Servian, Linium, Magenic Technologies, and ESG Mobility in the quarter. Regarding pipeline, Humphries said clients are being decisive, and discretionary projects are being funded giving optimism. “But as I said earlier, talent shortages and attrition are a much bigger concern for me at this moment in time than macro demand,” he added. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share for shareholders of record as on May 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cognizant-quarterly-revenue-up-2-4-trails-behind-peers/articleshow/82442187.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Life without helps 2.0: Kol families struggle to balance office & home||Kolkata: Those hard and tiring days of the summer of 2020 are back. In the absence of local trains, it’s back to the initial months of lockdown when people had to manage without domestic help. Once again, juggling between household chores and jobs has become a major challenge. Papri Saha, who runs an advertising consultancy firm in Salt Lake’s GC Block, hadn’t caught up with Wednesday’s news, busy that she was organizing a hospital bed for a relative infected with Covid. On Thursday morning, she was woken up by her housemaid’s call early in the morning. “My maid, said she couldn’t come to work because there is a lockdown. I quickly opened the newspaper and realized what has happened. There’s no lockdown. But there are no local trains either,” the resident of Salt Lake’s GC Block rued. “I was completely caught off guard. Cooking, washing, mopping and then rushing to work… I was so tired that I thought I would take the day off. But that was not possible. So here I am, having slogged eight hours in office, back in the kitchen, dishing out some stew and rice for dinner. From tomorrow, I must be more organized,” the 40-year-old said. Psychiatrist Siladitya Roy, who lives in a two-storey house at Mandeville Gardens, went through a similar ordeal. The caregiver for his ailing mother didn’t turn up. “In times of crisis like this, we understand the importance of blue-collared workers who keeps the entire system at home running. My part-time help also dropped out for the same reason — local trains. You can imagine what a tough time we had doing the household chores, looking after my mother and also managing patients over video calls and phones,” sighed Roy. Once again, the distancing between the city and its support system has begun in the absence of local trains. Sucharita Chatterjee, a homemaker from Salt Lake’s BA Block, was distraught: “For how long is this restriction being clamped? I hear there’s a third wave coming. So, our house helps won’t be coming in for a long time.” Her husband Anindya stayed back and helped out. “From tomorrow, he will be back at work. What then?” wondered Sucharita. Subhasree Basu, a homemaker from Jadavpur, has been indisposed since Wednesday. On Thursday, she still had to sweep the floors, clean the dishes and cook for her family and pet dog as her maid from Laxmikantapur failed to report. “Last year, she shifted base and started living in our neighbourhood. I asked her if she would do it again. It is difficult getting replacements all of a sudden,” Subhasree said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/life-without-helps-2-0-kol-families-struggle-to-balance-office-home/articleshow/82441212.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

He is not the only one who has taken a conscious decision to stay back so that patient services is not disrupted. Many healthcare workers who travel from districts have decided to stay either in hospitals or in the vicinity to avoid commute hassles. Hospitals are now trying find accommodation for them. “Around 25% of our support staff avails local train. Even as we are trying to hire rooms in the hospital locality, people are not willing rent out rooms. Hopefully, we will be arranging their accommodation soon,” said Subhasish Datta, general manager (operations) at Ruby. While most hospitals have nursing hostel and majority of doctors commute by their private vehicles, the support staffers depend on public transport. “Only doctors and nurses cannot run hospitals. These support staff are crucial for food, cleaning and aiding the doctors. Many are facing problem travelling to work,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO of Belle Vue Clinic. Private hospitals have even requested the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission to intervene and check the feasibility of running local trains for healthcare workers. They have cited about local trains being allo-wed in Mumbai to ferry healthcare workers. “We have many support staff commuting from Baruipur and Naihati. We wanted to put them in nearby hotels, but they are being used as satellite centres. But we have to find an alternative,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-workers-commute-woes-keep-hosps-worried/articleshow/82441252.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A complaint case was filed in 2019 by the Baptist Union Church, Bakerganj, against the developer, M/s Utkarsh Sfatik Ltd, claiming that the firm was not the lawful owner of the 7.52acres of land of the project titled ‘The Residency-City Centre". The complainant Rev Moses V Thomas, pastor-cum-priest-in charge at the Baptist Union Church claimed that the land was acquired through wrongful means. The respondent, Utkarsh Sfatik Ltd through its managing director, Saday Krishna Kanoria, later stated that frivolous allegations have been levelled having no basis and complaint does not come under the purview of related clauses of RERA Act, 2016. It was further stated that the dispute on land ownership and pendency of cases is in the Patna high court. In the light of few petitions and counter-petitions filed at Patna high court and one at Delhi high court, the full bench of RERA, Bihar, consisting of chairman Afzal Amanullah and its member R B Sinha recently ordered that “no registration shall be done of any properties, constructed or situated on the said 7.52 acres of land till such time as the issues of the title and legitimacy of sale are finally decided by the honourable courts where these matters are pending.” The RERA, however, permitted the registration granted to the developer by the Authority under RERA Act to remain in force till its due date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rera-puts-stay-on-property-registration-in-lodipur-project/articleshow/82439361.cms||---

---||Patna||Cloud of uncertainty hovers over panchayat polls in Bihar||PATNA: Cloud of uncertainty is hovering over the election to three-tier panchayati raj system in the state as cases of Covid-19 infections have gained alarming proportions and are increasing day by day. On April 21, the state election commission had said that a final call on holding the panchayat polls would be taken after review of the Covid-19 situation after a fortnight. The deadline lapsed on Thursday. However, there is no sign of improvement in Covid-19 situation in the state. “The panchayati raj department is now working in an alternative arrangement if elections were not held on time,” a senior officer of the state panchayati raj department said. The term of the representatives of the panchayati raj institutions will come to an end on June 15. As per the provisions of Panchayati Raj Act 2006, the election is to be conducted before the expiry of the five-year term, which does not seem to be possible this time. When contacted, panchayati raj department minister Samrat Choudhary said that the ball is in the court of the election commission, which has to take a final call on the issue. “The department will provide the required assistance to the election commission,” he confided. Authoritative sources said that such a complex situation has come before the department for the first time ever since the panchayat elections are being held in the state. Around 2.58 lakh representatives of gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zila parishad are to be elected. "If elections are postponed, then the block development officer, deputy development commissioner and the district magistrates will be assigned the task of carrying out development works in panchayats," another official of the panchayati raj department said. He, however, clarified that for the purpose, the proposal of the department has to be approved from the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cloud-of-uncertainty-hovers-over-panchayat-polls-in-bihar/articleshow/82440354.cms||Ramashankar
---||Goa||Will decide on lockdown in 2-3 days, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday said the state government is positively considering the request from BJP MLAs to impose a total lockdown in Goa to bring the Covid spread under control. He said after carrying out discussions with cabinet ministers and stakeholders a decision will be taken within the next two to three days. Sawant said that even if a lockdown is imposed the stores selling essentials will remain open. “Many MLAs were of the view today that we should consider having a lockdown. Actually, the restrictions we have imposed are more stringent than the lockdown we had last year. Anyhow, considering everyone’s views, the discussions by the government are on. We are keen that no essential supplies should be shut,” Sawant said. As the highest number of per day new Covid-19 cases was reported on Thursday, the chief minister held a meeting with BJP MLAs through video conferencing to discuss the situation. Sawant said he has advised BJP MLAs to set up constituency-wise war-rooms. “I advised them to start a 24X7 war room in each of their constituencies where they can give at least one call a day to each and every patient in their constituency under home-isolation. This will help them advice patients on whether they need hospitalisation based on their oxygen level and other readings. They should provide them with an ambulance if hospitalisation is required at the constituency level and provide medicines, groceries etc at home for patients under home-isolation,” he said. He said that 74 oxygen concentrators have been supplied to the Goa Medical College on Thursday. After the meeting, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavalekar said that all participating MLAs were in favour of a lockdown and said that the CM will make an announcement in this regard soon. “We discussed having a lockdown. Given the current situation and the manner in which cases have shot up, it would be better to have a lockdown to bring the situation under control, though there are already restrictions in place. A lockdown will be good,” he said. However, Kavalekar, asked if there had been negligence on the part of the government in announcing a lockdown earlier given Goa’s Covid-19 situation, he replied in the negative. “From time to time, the necessary decisions have been taken, but some people are not observing the restrictions as they should have. I have said now that a lockdown should be there. We discussed that if cases are rising despite the restrictions then it is advisable to go for a lockdown and see how it goes,” Kavalekar said. The deputy CM said that in many rural areas of the state citizens are still not observing SOPs, which is making it difficult to bring the cases under control. “We are trying to create awareness, but some people are still not serious about following the restrictions. Each one must take precautions at their own level. People should not come out unnecessarily and need to try to stay indoors as much as possible. One should leave home only if it is absolutely necessary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-will-decide-on-lockdown-in-2-3-days/articleshow/82445173.cms||---

Schools, colleges, coaching institutes and other education instructions are already closed till May 15 in adherence to the restrictions imposed by the state government and classes in the schools are mostly being conducted online. Father Edison J Armstrong, principal of St Michael’s High School, said the summer vacation in the school will start from May 6. “Few teachers and parents of some students have either been infected with the virus or they are recovering. It was found necessary to provide a break to students as well as teachers to make a fresh start once things normalise. Assignments have been given to students for summer vacation,” he said. Echoing similar views, Don Bosco Academy principal Mary Alphonso said: “The pandemic has affected many of our students, teachers and staff, which caused difficulties for both teachers and students to continue the online class sessions. Nevertheless, the summer break has been preponed considering the present scenario in the state. The summer vacation will start from May 8.” The summer break in Litera valley School is slated to start from May 26, but there is a probability that the dates might get shifted a bit earlier, said its principal Sharat Kumar Singh. “The school will hold a review meeting to decide the exact duration of summer break and suspension of online classes,” he said. Gyan Niketan, on the other hand, will continue its online classes. “We will utilise the period with regular online classes to cover the syllabus and get the results,” said Shailendra Mohan Jha, vice-principal. Pammy singh, whose daughter studies in Class 1, said, “As there is a rise in Covid-19 cases, we are already scared. The hectic schedule of online classes adds more stress.” Arihant Mukesh, a student of Class 8, said early summer breaks are favourable for examination preparation and improving mental health as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/amid-covid-pvt-schools-advance-summer-vacation/articleshow/82439433.cms||---

The conclusions are a part of an assessment of one lakh Covid-19 positive patients commissioned by the state health department though the final outcomes are yet to be released. The retrospective study noted that 6,500 people had taken at least one dose of the vaccine.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “The assessment commissioned by the UP government showed that over 95% of the vaccinated positives showed zero to mild symptoms, while another 3.5% had to go to level-1 health care facility (which is needed when there is no facility to isolate the patient at home),” sources said, adding that the final outcomes are expected in a week or so. Experts endorseThe indications are endorsed by experts. SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman and his wife are a case in point. The two had tested positive to the pandemic infection despite taking both the doses. “Being doctors we are constantly at the risk of contracting the infection. However, the vaccines saved us from problems that pose a threat to life. In fact, very mild symptoms appeared in us and were resolved in a week. There is no doubt over vaccines and we are proof of it,” he said urging people to shun their fears and get the jab without wasting time.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Chief medical superintendent, Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital Dr PS Singh said: “We noted that the severity of the disease among those vaccinated even once was lesser than the other patients. We believe that vaccination could have laid an impact on the replication of the viruses. This saved patients from severe forms of problems like cytokine storms and inflammation.” Exceptions may existDespite the visible benefits of the vaccine, there are cases in which some persons died because of the coronavirus infection. Experts said that exceptions can exist. Citing international data, experts at the Union health ministry said: “Both the vaccines being used in India have indicated an 80% efficacy. Covid deaths despite vaccine coverage can be linked to a number of factors like age of the patient, presence of pre-existing comorbidities and time of intervention. In addition to this, a patient's individual response to medicines and therapies also play a role in matters of life and death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/silver-lining-vaccinated-patients-respond-better-to-covid-19-treatment-claims-study/articleshow/82444808.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Patna||Lalu to address RJD netas for first time after getting bail on May 9||PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad will address all MLAs, MLCs and senior functionaries of the party through video conferencing from New Delhi on May 9. It would be his first public appearance since getting bail after serving a sentence for about three years in the multi-crore fodder scam cases. RJD spokesperson and former MLA Shakti Singh Yadav confirmed on Thursday that the RJD national president would address the legislators, former legislators, candidates of 2020 assembly polls and senior office-bearers of the party at 2 pm on Sunday. Lalu is at present staying at his eldest daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti's residence in New Delhi. “Since he is not coming to Patna due to his health condition, it has been decided that he will interact with senior leaders of the party through video conferencing. His 'guidance' will boost the morale of the functionaries at a time when the nation is passing through a critical phase. There is no government worth the name in the country,” Shakti Singh Yadav told this newspaper over the phone. Insiders in the party said the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who is in New Delhi, will also attend the virtual meeting. Lalu Prasad's virtual meeting assumed significance in the wake of dissension in a section of workers of the party over Tejashwi's "apathetic attitude" towards the relatives of former Siwan MP Md Shahabuddin, who died of Covid19 infection at a Delhi hospital on May 1. Some leaders were so disheartened with the development that they resigned from the party. Former deputy chairman of Bihar legislative council and state vice-president of RJD Salim Pervez, state secretary technical cell Md Sohrab Quraishi, RJD Nawada district president Kamrul Bari and state vice-president of RJD legal cell Md Sadaqat Ali are prominent among those who resigned from the primary membership of the party. In addition, two RJD MLAs—Awadh Bihari Choudhary and Harishankar Yadav—tried to meet late Shahabuddin's wife Hena Sahab at her Pratappur residence in Siwan but in vain. They, however, called on the former Siwan MP's son Osama Sahab, when the family returned to Pratappur from New Delhi after burial on Wednesday. The family expected Tejashwi to help the family bring the body to Siwan for burial, which didn't materialise. As a result, the body was buried at the ITO burial ground in the national capital. On the other hand, former CM and HAM(S) national president Jitan Ram Manjhi took a swipe at Lalu Prasad on the latter's decision to attend a virtual meeting after being released from jail. Manjhi tweeted, “Kitna hin virtual meeting kar lijiye. Ab sabko pata lag gaya hai ki bure waqt mein aap apno ka saath chhod dete hain.” Manjhi didn't stop there. He reminded Lalu Prasad of the treatment meted out to 'sahab', which could never be forgotten. With Lalu becoming active in politics after a lull, the political temperature in Bihar is set to rise in the days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-to-address-rjd-netas-for-first-time-after-getting-bail-on-may-9/articleshow/82439316.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vadodara||Covid spreads menacingly in Vadodara rural pockets||Vadodara: Covid-19 seems to have taken rural areas of the Vadodara district under its control. From just around 15 per cent of cases in these pockets in the beginning of this month, more than half of the cases reported at present are from areas outside the Vadodara city limits. It was always believed that the rural areas of the district were better off despite having nearly half the population of the district. Roughly, the remaining half is in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) areas. In the first wave too, only some towns in the district and areas adjoining the city had shown a large number of cases with only stray cases in the remaining areas. But with no lockdown and free movement, Covid-19 seems to have reached even the interiors of the district. Cases are being reported from several villages that are away from the city and towns in the city or do not have industrial areas with high movement of workers and employees from the city. While the city’s contribution to the total number of cases may have stabilised, there will be no immediate respite. “This will not reduce hospitalisations. We are seeing some stabilisation in the city presently, but will have to wait for some time,” said VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. Sources pointed out that as long as he situation in the districts surrounding Vadodara and even areas of Vadodara district outside VMC limits did not improve, hospitalisation would continue. On Monday evening itself, officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao noted, that 776 patients were admitted at the SSG Hospital and almost all ventilators were in use. “Inflow of patients still continuing,” he stated. The situation of vacant ICU and ventilator beds in the city is also grim on Moneday evening with only 14 ventilator beds and 104 ICU beds without ventilators vacant. Of the 14 ventilators beds only seven were BIPAP ventilators that the much needed. A senior official had said last week that the next two weeks could be a bad time to fall ill with Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-spreads-menacingly-in-vadodara-rural-pockets/articleshow/82439268.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Madurai||MP writes to Centre seeking O2 for state||Madurai: In a letter to the Union minister of health and family welfare, Dr Harsha Vardhan, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has expressing shock that Tamil Nadu had not been included in the supply plan for medical oxygen released by Dr Sanjay Roy, director, National Health Mission, on May 5. This is a grave injustice to the state, he said. The MP said that the allocation to TN was 280 MT ten days ago. Now the demand has increased due to the steep rise in the number of Covid cases. According to medical experts, the demand is close to 500 MT. The reports of the central government acknowledge the fact and estimate it at 400 MT. Yet the above letter on the supply plan for medical oxygen did not have the name of Tmil Nadu in it. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Kerala, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Odisha, and Union Territories of Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir figure in the list. As many as 13 people died at the Government Medical College Hospital in Chengalpattu on Tuesday night. As many as 309 out of the 447 admissions required oxygen. The similar situation prevails throughout Tamil Nadu. Hospitals are seeing an increased number of patients and there are a lot of complications with the fear of losing lives. There is a need to increase the medical oxygen allocation for Tamil Nadu without further delay, he said and urged the Union minister to intervene in the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-writes-to-centre-seeking-o2-for-state/articleshow/82441181.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Buzz missing at markets but timing tweak saves the day||Kolkata: Wholesale markets in Posta and Burrabzar wore a deserted look on Thursday, a day after the administration decided to suspend suburban train services and imposed curbs on movement of goods vehicles. Many retailers from the vicinity ferried essential items on their bikes or rickshaws. Limited number of goods vehicles were used to transport items to markets in different areas. Labourers were around because many traders had arranged for them to stay in the godowns because most of them travel from areas in Howrah, Hooghly and the two 24 Parganas. “The business did not take a hit because we had made arrangements yesterday as soon as the government announced about the train and bus restrictions,” said Mukesh Saraf, a wholesaler of spices in Posta. “But we do not know how long we can continue like this because it is going to be a long-drawn process,” said Saraf. The traders witnessed better business after the slot in the second half was changed from 3pm to 5pm to 5pm to 7pm. In the morning, shops and stores selling non-essential items can open for business between 7am and 10am. “We received more customers today than we would during the 3pm and 5pm slot. It would be very hot that time and people would be at offices. Today, many people did shopping after shutting their establishments or while returning home from office,” said Anwar Khan, a vegetable vendor in Tiretta market in central Kolkata. Several people fasting during Ramzan were also facing problems purchasing vegetables and fruits in the evening. “I had to go out at 3pm when it would be very hot. By 4pm, shops could be very crowded. But the revised timing is much better,” said Mohammad Ishtiaque, a resident of Bow Street. Kolkata Police has also formed dedicated teams at all police stations to ensure twice a day that local markets shut down on time. The cops also employed drones at some of the bigger markets to ensure that the crowd dispersed after 10am in the morning. In at least two places — Chakraberia and Gariahat — the cops had to intervene and ask the vendors to leave. Police have decided to shift some of the bigger community markets to nearby parks and grounds to control the access, a process that earned them dividends during the partial lockdown last year. Some of the markets that have either been shifted or will be shifted soon are in areas like Beliaghata, Maniktala, Muchibazar and Bagmari Bazar. Beniapukur Market and Mominpore Chhoti Bazar, too, are likely to be shifted to nearby open spaces like last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buzz-missing-at-markets-but-timing-tweak-saves-the-day/articleshow/82441254.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Class XI e-lessons start as boards prepare mark sheets||Kolkata: For the first time ever, children of Class XI in CBSE and CISCE schools have joined classes without sitting for their board examinations. While some schools started classes earlier this week, several began on Thursday. Schools are also preparing the students’ board results simultaneously — CISCE schools will send in the marks by May 15 and CBSE schools have formed their committees and started tabulations after submitting the internal marks of 20% to the board. Getting provisional admission to Class XI in the different streams, before the board results are declared, has been a norm in city schools for long. Schools have always depended on marks scored throughout classes IX and X to decide on the stream selection and admission. The board scores were never a criteria for getting admission to Class XI, but were always taken as formality for changing the provisional admission to a final one. The refrain that one heard in schools was that this tradition has come in handy for the boards this time since the results are being prepared for keeping the students’ school performances in mind, something that is done by educational institutions abroad. On Tuesday evening, an instruction from CBSE said there should be no watertight compartment of streams during Plus-II admissions. Most city schools said admissions were over and since the board has always been flexible over choosing of the fifth and sixth subjects, even humanities students have been allowed to take science and mathematics papers. “We started lessons for Class XI in the online mode from Monday. In our school, we offer a large number of subjects and have allowed students to choose after checking their performances in classes IX and X,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Lessons for Class XI started on Thursday at Birla High School, DPS Ruby Park and Asian International School, while schools like La Martiniere, Rammohan Mission and Heritage started earlier this week. “CBSE has reiterated what we were doing,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School. At Rammohan Mission, where Class XI lessons have started, no outside admissions were possible for the science stream but 30% students have taken admission from other schools in humanities, said principal Sujoy Biswas. “It would have been great to see my child write her first board exam. But we are happy that her new classes have started,” said Snehendu Koner, whose daughter Anushka started her Class XI lessons at La Martiniere for Girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/class-xi-e-lessons-start-as-boards-prepare-mark-sheets/articleshow/82441241.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Metro slashes services, hours as staffers depend on spl trains to report to work||Kolkata: Suspension of suburban trains has had its effect on the north-south Metro. The carrier will run fewer trains from Friday for reduced operational hours because several Metro staffers from the suburbs who commute by local trains are now entirely dependent on the staff-special trains run by Eastern and South-Eastern Railway. From Friday, there will be 192 services along the north-south corridor on weekdays. The first trains will leave the terminal at 8am and the last trains at 8pm. Sunday services of the north-south line will start at 10am instead of 9am. The city’s transport lifeline has been registering a lower passenger count over the last fortnight with people keeping indoors to avoid infection. With only around 1.2 lakh daily footfall, Metro Railway had already announced reducing the number of services from 238 to 216 along the north-south corridor from Thursday. But after chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced suspension of local trains, Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said some more services will have to be cut. On Wednesday, the GM had said, “There will be 216 services tomorrow. But we will have to reduce trains further in the absence of local trains. Our staff members will now have to depend on the Eastern Railway and South-Eastern Railway staff specials to come to work. We need to match operational hours with these staff specials.” On Thursday, Metro pushed its starting service from 7.10am to 7.30am and the last service was at 9pm instead of 9.10pm. From Friday, the first trains will leave Dakshineswar, Dum Dum and Kavi Subhas stations at 8am instead of 7.30am while the last trains will leave Dakshineswar at 7.48pm instead of 8.48pm. The last trains from Dum Dum and Kavi Subhas stations will leave at 8pm instead of 9pm. On Sundays, there will be 82 services instead of 98 and the last trains will leave Dakshineswar at 7.48pm and at 8pm from Dum Dum and Kavi Subhas stations. “We had to revise timings and will run fewer services because our staff members won’t be able to report to work early in the morning since there are no local trains and they will be commuting by staff-special trains,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-slashes-services-hours-as-staffers-depend-on-spl-trains-to-report-to-work/articleshow/82441263.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Autos make hay as transport options dry up||Kolkata: Auto rickshaws emerged as a transport lifeline on many routes on Thursday after the state government put curbs on other modes of transport to stop the spread of the virus, but several passengers complained they were fleeced and arm-twisted into paying more. There were long queues on several auto routes since Thursday morning as government buses and Metro Rail were operating at half their capacity and suburban railways operations have been suspended by the administration. There were fewer public buses since Thursday morning, adding to the discomfort of officer-goers. Though most firms have implemented the 50% WFH module, several people are still having to go to offices. With shops selling non-essential items operating from 7am to 10am and again from 5pm to7p and wholesale and retail markets remaining open throughout the day, thousands of owners and employees need to reach their workplace. Many of them took multiple connecting autos from their homes to workplaces while others settled for a combination of bus and auto journey. Passengers alleged on some routes auto charged them almost double the fare. “The number of commuters on Wednesday and Thursday were almost same but transport options have been more than halved, which has created immense crisis,” said Vaibhav Pachisia, standing in the auto queue at Ultadanga. “On other days, I take a bus from my residence in Baguiati to reach MG Road. But today, even after waiting for over 20 minutes, I did not get a bus. So, I took an auto from Baguiati to Ultadanga. From here, I will go to Sovabazar in an auto and walk half a kilometre till BK Pal to take another auto to reach MG Road,” said the hosiery trader. Autos on routes culminating in or around the central business district witnessed maximum rush of passengers. A senior police officer in the central division said police personnel will keep a vigil on auto routes from Friday onwards. “We do not want commuters to be harassed,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/autos-make-hay-as-transport-options-dry-up/articleshow/82441310.cms||Zeeshan Javed

There are also other difficulties such as providing a separate entry and exit for Covid patients, a separate floor for doctors and nurses to quarantine and adequate oxygen supply,” state secretary IMA A K Ravikumar, who runs Mouthi Hospital at Vadavalli, said.The 550-bedded Ganga Hospital, which had initially allotted 35 beds for Covid-19, has now allotted an additional 130 beds for infected people. They say they cannot increase it further to 50% in this situation. “People who were injured in accidents, develop orthopaedic tumours and spinal injuries during these times also need treatment otherwise they will get paralyzed or disabled,” chairman of the hospital’s orthopaedic and spinal surgery ward Dr S Rajasekaran said.“Handling Covid-19 requires a lot more nurses and doctors because of the treatment involved. In Covid-19, all staff who work for one week need to be quarantined for one week. They also work only six-hour shifts, compared to eight-hour shifts, and if one nurse gets infected, the entire shift goes into isolation,” he said.Most single speciality hospitals are accepting only mildly symptomatic patients, who do not have breathing difficulties.“We can’t manage patients who crash into a cytokine storm affecting their organs and requiring ventilator support,” said a doctor at a gastroenterology hospital in the city.“We don’t have pulmonologists and even enough oxygen to provide high flow oxygen to all our Covid patients if they worsen,” he added.IMA instead suggests a system wherein every area, one hospital is converted entirely into a severe Covid-19 patient hospital. “If one 100-bed hospital among every two or three hospitals is converted into a Covid-19 hospital, they can follow all norms. Surrounding hospitals can hand over their oxygen and ventilators and even staff if required. This way, there won’t be mixing of Covid and non-Covid patients and only one hospital in an area will run around for oxygen,” Dr Ravikumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ima-against-allotting-50-hospital-beds-to-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82442843.cms||---

The team won the award for identifying that pain generating inflammatory molecules were present in back pain patients, whose end plates were inflamed. Patients with severe back pain may also have bacteria in the end plate, which also probably needs to be addressed while treating them.The paper, titled ‘Why do modic changes result in poor clinical outcomes? Novel insights from Proteomic analysis of lumbar discs with modic changes’, will be published in the Spine Journal. “Many patients have low back pain. While 85% become alright on their own, 10% require medical therapy and 5% need surgery.

---||Business||Non-profit, social cos may get to raise funds||Mumbai: A Sebi-appointed panel has proposed that social enterprises may be allowed to raise funds using the proposed social stock exchange (SSE) platform through instruments like zero coupon bonds, mutual funds and development bonds. It also recommended that an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore should be put in a fund that will be managed by Nabard and should be used for initial training and capacity building, mainly among NGOs, relating to the SSE. The Sebi panel also proposed that social enterprises that include for-profit enterprise (FPE) and not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) would be allowed on the SSE. It said corporate foundations, political and religious organisations, among other entities should not be allowed on this platform. The permitted entities should pass strict scrutiny, the panel report said. “To inculcate a cultural shift towards a disclosure based regime, (the panel) has recommended prior registration of NPOs with SSE before fundraising,” a Sebi release said. “All (social enterprises) on SSE will be required to make disclosure of social impact on an annual basis consisting of strategic intent and planning, approach and the impact scorecard.” The panel also recommended that the entities be audited by social auditors and only reputed firms/institutions having expertise in the area of social audit shall be allowed to carry out social audits. “These concepts of social auditors and capacity building fund are unique to fundraising for social enterprises in India, and would facilitate SSE in its activities,” the report said. The regulator has sought comments from the public till June 20 on the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-profit-social-cos-may-get-to-raise-funds/articleshow/82443195.cms||---

Patel’s cement and building material manufacturing unit, Nuvoco Vistas Corp has filed a draft prospectus for an IPO to raise Rs 5,000 crore. About nine years ago, Patel had taken Nirma private through delisting. Over the last few years, Nuvoco Vistas has emerged in the current form through the merger of Lafarge’s India arm and the cement division of Kolkata-based Emami. Both these units were bought over by Patel’s Nirma group and merged to form a single unit which is currently the fifth largest cements and building material company in India. Of the total Rs 5,000 crore being raised through the IPO, up to Rs 1,500 crore will go to the company as it will issue new equity shares. The balance Rs 3,500 crore will accrue to the promoters who are selling part of their stake in the company.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Parents’ masks delay babies’ smiling, cooing skills||VADODARA/SURAT: New dad Nitin Parikh (name changed) started worrying when his six-month-old baby boy wasn’t responding to the gestures and smile. He called up a paediatrician and the diagnosis left him stumped. The doctor told him that the Covid pandemic is having a totally different level of effect on babies, particularly those below two years of age. Masks are indeed a saviour from Covid-19 infection but the constant screen of parents’ and grandparents’ faces at home is adversely affecting the development of babies’ social milestones like smiling and cooing. Paediatricians across the state are unanimous about the adverse effect of face masks on the newborns’ social skills in the new normal. “The sensory stimulation among many kids below two years of age is missing. They are not able to understand the facial gestures quickly and their social milestones are also getting delayed by an average 2-3 months,” said Dr Tushar Shah, executive board member, Academy of Paediatrics Gujarat. “Since they were born and began to understand the world around, babies below two years are seeing everyone wearing face masks. They can’t see facial gestures like anger, laughter or joy when they meet anyone. Except at home, these kids see their parents too in face masks,” Shah told TOI. “Usually babies start smiling, cooing and responding to gestures after they turn three months old. But now these skills are getting delayed by a few months. I have been getting calls from worried parents over the last several months,” Shah, former secretary of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Vadodara, said. Experts said that lack of social interaction and strict home confinement is affecting their ability to integrate with the society. Doctors in Surat too have been getting calls from anxious parents having kids aged between six months and 18 months. “Every fifth day, we are getting a case wherein parents notice that their child’s interaction is problematic. Some babies are actually behaving like autistic kids,” said Dr Sanjeev Rao, a senior paediatrician in Surat. Dr Viraj Patel, a veteran paediatrician in Ahmedabad, said, "Long-term effects can be delayed speech, poor social interaction and even learning disabilities.” She suggested that family members, especially, mothers should constantly keep talking and interacting with their babies while doing the routine chores like changing diapers. “If the children are grown up to 1-1.5 years, flash boards and soft music can also be used to develop concentration," Dr Patel said. Parents noticed the delayed development of responses in their kids, said Rao, adding that masks are screening children from developing their skills in understanding or grasping facial gestures and emotions. Dr Shah further added that spending most of their time at home and hardly any interaction with outsiders have affected kids’ social and learning skills. Dr Bankim Parikh, a paediatrician in Vadodara, said, “Kids usually start learning from the world around by the time they turn two. But over the last one year, there is minimal fraternisation so the social skills among younger ones are getting delayed. In some cases, the children’s speech skills may also get delayed due to lack of communication.

---||Business||Banks ready health booster shot||Mumbai: Banks are set to launch multiple schemes under the RBI’s Rs 50,000-crore on-tap liquidity window announced on Wednesday. The schemes are aimed at rapidly boosting private investment in healthcare and financing individuals who have contracted Covid. In a meeting with the finance ministry, large public sector banks discussed the possibility of making available credit online using the liquidity facility. Banks will go to the drawing board and will design the schemes with extremely competitive rates and draw up the eligibility criteria. According to bankers, a ramp-up in capacity in pharma and hospitals can be done only through brownfield projects, where existing units expand. This includes adding new lines for drugs, adding oxygen plants, and increasing the number of beds in hospitals. The creation of private capacity in healthcare is seen as important as government hospitals may find it difficult to get doctors. Greenfield capacity is expected to come up in the form of new diagnostic centres and nursing homes in smaller towns. The advantage of an off-the-shelf scheme is that terms and conditions are standardised and loans can be sanctioned without delay. Banks can monitor it better by creating a vertical for the special schemes and smaller loans for Covid treatment can be sanctioned at all branches across the country. Meanwhile, two large loans to vaccine makers Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, which had received in-principal approval from public sector banks are likely to get the advantage of the scheme. According to sources, Rs 500-crore fund and non-fund-based credit line have been extended to Serum Institute — makers of Covishield by Bank of Baroda. The loan is understood to have been sanctioned ahead of RBI’s measures, but the final approval came on Wednesday when the Rs 50,000-crore liquidity facility was announced for the healthcare sector. Bank of Baroda did not comment on the matter. According to reports, SBI has extended a credit line to Bharat Biotech — makers of Covaxin. While the bank did not comment on the report, sources said the country’s largest lender is supporting many government initiatives to control Covid. A research report by the SBI said that the Rs 50,000-crore funding is 9% of India’s total health spending of Rs 6 lakh crore under private final consumption expenditure in FY20. Bankers say that besides vaccine makers, pharma companies are expected to pick up another major chunk of this facility as the creation of fresh capacity would require major investment. The finance minister had allotted Rs 35,000 crore in the Union Budget, which saw a 138% jump in allocation to health. Even this increased allocation is expected to be insufficient as the cost of vaccination is estimated to be twice the budgeted amount. According to a report on healthcare by rating agency ICRA, the sector is expected to record a 20% growth in revenue during the current fiscal as against a 19% contraction in FY21. Hospitals, which had planned expansion, had to hold back last year as Covid resulted in many Indians postponing elective procedures. As a result, non-Covid hospitals saw low occupancy for several months last year. Occupancy is expected to bounce back to 60% in FY22 from 50% in FY21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-ready-health-booster-shot/articleshow/82442934.cms||Mayur Shetty

Ramesh Chand, a resident of Ganauli village, Raipur Rani, had gone for the wedding of his nephew to Shahzadpur, Ambala. His neighbour Parmal and seven others were dancing to music played by a disc jockey (DJ). All of them were shouting and behaving in an uncouth manner, he alleged. Ramesh said he walked up to Parmal and asked him to act with some decency. “Parmal, instead, starting fighting. The other guests intervened and the matter was resolved,” he alleged. When Ramesh along with his nephew was going home to Raipur Rani, a car overtook their vehicle and blocked the way. Parmal and one Ramesh Chand along with three others allegedly pulled Ramesh out from the vehicle. They allegedly thrashed him with a wooden baton and an iron rod, hitting him on his head and face. When people gathered, the accused fled towards Naraingarh. Ramesh was admitted to General Hospital, Sector 6. Police registered a case under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several person with same intention) of the IPC at the Raipur Rani police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/grooms-uncle-stops-unruly-guests-from-dancing-gets-thrashed-after-wedding/articleshow/82407402.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The department has formed a team to nab them. Several videos that went viral on social media on Thursday showed the men throwing stones at elephants and beating them with sticks. “Preliminary inquiry revealed that P Selvam, 32, T Kalimuthu, 25 and J Arunkumar, 30, were herding cattle when they saw two elephants and a calf. They tried to shoo away the animals and threw stones at them. When the elephants charged towards them, the men ran away and again attacked the animals using sticks and stones. Their friends, who sought refuge atop trees, recorded the scene using mobile phones,” an official said. A team led by assistant director of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) Ganeshram visited the tribal settlement on Thursday morning to nab the trio. “But they had escaped to the reserve forest to evade arrest. We met the head of the settlement and asked him to hand over the men to the department. He has agreed to do that,” the official said. “We also warned the tribal people against attacking wild animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/three-tribal-men-attack-elephants-booked/articleshow/82442848.cms||A Subburaj
---||Lucknow||IITian who engineered political career in rural hinterland||LUCKNOW: Ajit Singh was at the peak of his engineering career in the US when his ailing father and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh called him back to Delhi in the early 1980s. An alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur and Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Singh, in fact, was one of the very few Indians who had worked with software giant IBM. But Singh, born in a small village Bhadola in Meerut on February 12, 1939, was destined for a long political journey that started with getting elected to Rajya Sabha in 1986 on a Lok Dal ticket. After Charan Singh’s death in 1987, Ajit formed Lok Dal (Ajit) and became the president of Janata Party in 1988. He became the general secretary of Janata Dal which was formed after the merger of various political factions to take on the Congress. In 1989, he first got elected to Lok Sabha from Baghpat and became industry minister in the then National Front government led by VP Singh. Singh again won from Baghpat on a Janata Dal ticket in 1991 but switched over to the Congress in 1995 to become minister of food in the then PV Narasimha Rao government. He then got elected from Baghpat on a Congress ticket in 1996 but soon resigned from the party and Lok Sabha to form Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Singh, subsequently, got re-elected to Lok Sabha in 1997 byelections. The influential Jat leader, who was known for allying with politicial parties across the spectrum, however, lost Baghpat to BJP’s Sompal in 1998 but managed to wrest it back in 1999 Lok Sabha elections. In 2001, he joined hands with the BJP and became union agriculture minister in the Atal Behari Vajpayee government. Singh managed to win the Lok Sabha elections from Baghpat in 2004 and then again in 2009. In 2011, he allied with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and became the civil aviation minister. The emergence of BJP as a massive political force under the leadership of Narendra Modi, however, brought Singh’s political career to a screeching halt. In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Singh lost Baghpat to BJP’s Satyapal Singh. In fact, Singh finished a distant third in his own stronghold securing barely 19.86% votes. Experts said that the setback to Singh’s political fortunes was the result of a dramatic shift in Jat votes in favour of the BJP. The phenomenon repeated itself in 2017 UP assembly elections when RLD got completely routed, winning just one seat – Chhaprauli. Its lone MLA, Ramendra Singh Ramala, too, later switched over to the BJP. A politically bruised Ajit Singh quit Baghpat to contest from Muzaffarnagar in 2019 Lok Sabha elections but got defeated by BJP’s Sanjeev Baliyan by a margin of around 6,000 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iitian-who-engineered-pol-career-in-rural-hinterland/articleshow/82444858.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Mumbai||Marathas seek review petition and OBC benefits, plan rallies||MUMBAI: Unhappy with the state government after the Supreme Court struck down reservation for the Maratha community, restive Maratha organisations planned responses ranging from a review petition and rallies to a demand that they should receive the benefits extended to the OBC community. “We have decided to file a review petition and hope that the Maratha quota will be retained. There were a few points left in the arguments and we hope they are considered positively,” said Vinod Patil, one of the petitioners for the Maratha quota. Patil said that the community could no longer rely on political parties and had to fight its own battles. “Why did the Congress vote for the SEBC Act in the legislature if it felt the proposal from the BJP-led Fadnavis government was wrong?” he asked. Read AlsoNo review on 50% cap on reservation, quota for Marathas invalid: Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the Maharashtra law granting reservation to Maratha community. The court said that people from Maratha community cannot be declared as educationally and socially backward.Members of the Sakal Maratha Samaj met Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj, the head of erstwhile Kolhapur royal family and a backbone of the movement. “We have not lost hope. But until we get a concrete and legally acceptable reservation, we demand the government extend all benefits meant for OBCs to Maratha youth. They must get concession in fees, scholarships for studies and research and age relaxation in competitive exams,” said Vasantrao Mulik, convenor of the forum. He demanded funds for the SARTHI institute, which trains Maratha students to become government officers, and an increased allocation for the Annasaheb Patil Arthik Vikas Mahamandal, which provides funds for entrepreneurship. Vinayak Mete, the BJP-backed MLC from Beed and Shiv Sangram leader announced rallies from May 16. Earlier, he had demanded the resignation of PWD minister Ashok Chavan, who headed the sub-committee for Maratha reservation. The Maratha Kranti Morcha, which was at the forefront of organising more than 50 such rallies to press for the Maratha reservations has distanced itself from Mete’s stand. OBC leaders said they would fight against Maratha attempts to seek reservation under the OBC category. They said they would write to CM Uddhav Thackeray. Former MLA Prakash Shendge said OBC leaders had an online meeting on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-marathas-seek-review-petition-and-obc-benefits-plan-rallies/articleshow/82444946.cms||---
---||Pune||22 temporary jails opened in state for isolation of nCoV + ve inmates; More to come up||Pune: The state prisons department has opened 22 temporary jails and five Covid care centres (CCCs) in various districts across Maharashtra, including Pune and Mumbai, since April 20 for isolation and treatment of undertrial prisoners or inmates testing positive for Covid-19 virus. The department recently asked the superintendents of all 60 jails in the state to co-ordinate with their respective local administrations for setting up at least two temporary jails in their districts on a priority basis. The objective is to ensure that there is no spread of the virus in main prison complexes, which already have inmates much more than their sanctioned capacities. As was the case during the first Covid-19 wave last year, schools and hostel buildings located near the main jail complexes will be utilised as temporary jails. “Newly-arrested persons remanded in judicial custody will first be tested for nCoV and then kept in one of the temporary jails till their test reports are received. Only those testing negative will be moved into the main prison complex ,while those testing positive will be isolated for treatment and care at the second temporary jail. They will be moved to the main complex only after full recovery,” additional director general of prisons Sunil Ramanand told TOI on Thursday. He said, “During the Covid surge last year, the respective local administrations had helped us in opening over 30 temporary jails. All these facilities were later closed after the cases declined and the situation came under control. Since the number of positive cases has again started increasing this year, we have asked all our jail superintendents to re-acquire temporary jails.” The prisons chief said, “We have opened 22 temporary jails and CCCs in Pune, Mumbai and other places in the state as of now. We hope to open 38 more such jails in about 10 days’ time. The prisons department and the local administration will provide medical staff for treating inmates testing positive. The department will maintain internal security, while the police commissioners and the district superintendents of police offices will maintain external security at the temporary jails.” “I have also issued instructions to all jail superintendents to hold meetings with the principal district and sessions judges at district levels to carry out a review of the inmates released on temporary bail and emergency parole,” he added.

The brothers have not been on talking terms after Alagiri, once considered the DMK’s strongman in Madurai, was expelled from the party eight years ago by his father. With reconciliation efforts failing to yield results, he fell silent and kept away from the limelight. Even at their father’s funeral, the brothers were seen sitting apart. In January, Alagiri had organised a meeting in Madurai at which he claimed that Stalin would never become the leader of the DMK. Now, after mediation by some of his supporters, Alagiri called up his younger brother to greet him. “The expected participation of his son and daughter in the swearing-in ceremony is proof that all is well in the family,” said Isakkimuthu, an Alagiri confidante. “We believe things will be alright,” said S Ramachandran, another supporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/alagiri-greets-cm-elect-brother-stalin/articleshow/82441192.cms||---

Police said that they had received information about a man named Mubin Chauhan selling the injections near his house at Vasila society in Bharuch town. Based on the information, cops laid a trap for Chauhan by sending a dummy customer to purchase the injection from him. When Chauhan arrived at a pre-decided spot to sell the vials, cops nabbed him. Four vials of Remdesivir were found on Chauhan. When questioned, Chauhan told cops that he had got the vials from Maqbool Chauhan, who is absconding. Chauhan also told police that he was planning to sell each vial for Rs 20,000. The accused was later handed over to B Division police station where an offence was registered against him and his father. Police have appealed to citizens to not purchase such life-saving medicines and oxygen cylinders from those involved in their illegal sale. “We understand that people need these medicines only under emergency circumstances, but instead of encouraging such people by purchasing from them at high prices, public should inform us,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/one-held-with-four-vials-of-remdesivir-in-bharuch/articleshow/82439540.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 11-hour power cut angers residents of Goregaon West||MUMBAI: Residents of Link Road and M G Road in Goregaon (West) faced a harrowing time on Thursday as many had no power supply for as long as 11-12 hours. It was a major inconvenience for those working from home, and also those in isolation due to Covid-19. The summer heat and humidity added to the woes. Adani Electricity said in a tweet that the outage was “due to multiple high tension network abnormality.” Social media was abuzz with complaints on Thursday morning, with Adani getting several tweets from citizens. TimesViewWith residents working from home, a power outage for a few hours can be an ordeal. Power experts say as per regulations, consumers who are put to hardships due to prolonged power outage can directly approach the utility firm to seek compensation and make them liable for the disruption. Power providers must strengthen the infrastructure to ensure it can take a higher load during a surge in demand and minimise technical faults.Among the first to complain was Nishchay Agrawal in a 5am tweet: “@Adani_Elec_Mum There is no power in Goregaon West Mumbai since midnight hours. No customer care, no authentic information about the restoration...” To this, Adani Electricity replied : “Dear Customer, The outage is due to multiple high tension network abnormality. Our technicians are striving hard to have this resolved at the earliest...”  Consumer Parth @Twistedparth tweeted: “It’s been 12 hours there is no electricity at Motilal Nagar in Goregaon West. Crying babies, patients and elders in distress while Adani Electricity keeps sending messages of restoration every hour.” An Adani official said: “The outage was due to multiple faults in our HT (high tension) network and increase in demand due to a rise in temperature and humidity. We restored supply by alternate arrangement/diesel generator sets. Entire load could not be restored due to system constraints, but the network was normalised by early afternoon." Consumer Mohammed Basit Khan tweeted: “The entire colony along Badi Masjid Road, Motilal Nagar no-2, Goregaon West is impacted. Here we have 20,000 people which include kids, medical patients and so on. I would want compensation for the pain which I have to bear.” He had no power since 1am. Power expert Ashok Pendse said the faults are mainly due to overload in hot weather. “Work from home has added to it. The need of the hour is for the power utility firm to ensure load augmentation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-hour-power-cut-angers-residents-of-goregaon-west/articleshow/82441203.cms||Somit Sen
---||Chandigarh||Traders on roads against Punjab government ‘pick and choose policy’||MOHALI: The Mohali district traders came out on roads to protest the pick and choose policy of the Punjab government over allowing some shops, including liquor vends, to operate, while disallowing other shops like clothing, cosmetics, stationery etc. to close during the lockdown. The traders, while protesting at Phase VII and 3B2 in Mohali on Thursday, said either the government must allow all the shops to open or no shop must be allowed to operate during the lockdown. Phase VII market association president Gurmukh Singh Walia said, “We believe that the Punjab government is adopting pick and choose policy. It is hard to believe that liquor comes under essential category, whereas traders selling stationery, cosmetics do not fall under essential category. We demand the government to either shut down all the shops or allow all of them to operate.” The traders have also opposed the revised curfew directions of closing the shops by 5 pm. They said they have already faced huge losses due to the lockdown last year, and now when the time had come to earn, another lockdown has further pushed them into debts. Mohali Beopar Mandal president Sarabjit Singh Paras said, “We appeal the chief minister to relax the day curfew by allowing shops to open during the day as closing the same by 5 pm is against them. We have already sustained huge loses and many traders are on the verge of closure due to the last year’s lockdown and again we are on the verge of incurring huge losses.” Other traders said the daily night curfew from 6 pm to 5 am on all days is prohibiting all the non-essential activities. Week-end curfew from 5 am on Saturday up to 5 am on Monday has further dented their earnings. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said following the orders of the chief minister, the home department has issued a detailed order imposing additional restrictions to be strictly imposed throughout the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/traders-on-roads-against-pb-govts-pick-and-choose-policy/articleshow/82442899.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ajit Singh, RLD chief & voice of farmers, succumbs to Covid||LUCKNOW: The lethal second Covid wave claimed the life of former Union minister and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh on Thursday. He was 82. Singh, one of the senior most politicians in the country is survived by his wife, son and two daughters. Ajit Singh, son of farmer leader and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh, breathed his last around 8.20am at a private hospital in Gurugram where he was admitted after testing positive for Covid on April 20. His son and RLD vice-president Jayant Chaurdhary broke the news on Twitter. “Chaudhary sahab nahi rahe (Chaudhary sahab is no more),” Jayant tweeted. चौधरी साहब नहीं रहे!🙏🏽 https://t.co/7cnLkf0c6K— Jayant Chaudhary (@jayantrld) 1620272415000Singh’s last rites were performed in Gurugram. Ajit Singh’s family issued a statement saying they appreciated the efforts put in by his medical team and the support expressed by his many supporters and well-wishers. “Chaudhary Ajit Singh’s last rites were carried out maintaining Covid protocols. At this sensitive time, it is our express request not to come to Delhi to visit family or express grief. At this hour, giving full regard to Covid protocols and lending a helping hand if possible to relief efforts will be the appropriate way of paying tribute to Chaudhary Sahab,” the family said.RLD sources said the party decided not to announce Singh’s death immediately as his supporters would have thronged the hospital and his residence in large numbers which could have posed a problem in the wake of the pandemic. “It was announced only after Singh’s last rites were performed by the family,” a senior RLD leader said. Party national secretary Anil Dubey told TOI that his association with the stalwart leader spanned nearly 32 years and was a personal loss. Ajit Singh always stood for cause of farmers: PM  Lucknow: Leaders cutting across political lines paid tributes to Ajit Singh, a seven-time MP from UP’s Baghpat district. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that Ajit Singh always stood for the cause of farmers. He termed Singh as an able leader who held responsibilities of various ministries in the past. “My condolences to his family and supporters,” the PM said. Governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, too, expressed grief on the death of RLD chief. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra termed Singh’s death as a grave loss to Indian politics and society. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said Ajit Singh was a ‘messiah of farmers and labourers’. BSP chief Mayawati said RLD chief was hugely popular among his supporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ajit-singh-rld-chief-voice-of-farmers-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/82444936.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||Availability of hospital beds with O2 support improves||Pune: Availability of beds with oxygen support has improved across the district with an increase in the number of such facilities.Around two weeks ago, the district had 14,068 beds. These included oxygen supported beds and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, with and without ventilator support. Of these, only 476 beds were available.The number of such beds increased to 16,185 by Thursday, of which 1,984 are available. The vacancy has particularly improved in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, where 882 oxygen supported beds and 127 ICU beds (without ventilator support) are vacant. In Pune civic limits, the number of oxygen supported beds has improved (See graphic). Experts said the improvement in oxygen supply in the region, its judicious use by hospitals and a dip in the out-patient department patients was expected to ease the situation further in the coming days.Rajesh Patil, commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), told TOI, “The main reason for the improvement in the number of oxygen support beds in the twin towns is that we have focussed on the health of patients in home isolation. We ensured that their health updates are collected on time and they recover while in home isolation. It has worked and the bed vacancy has improved. The war room inspection, dedicated call centre and the helpline are some of the measures that have played a key role.”He added that the number of positive patients per day was steady with a 21% positivity rate from last week. “The positivity rate had gone up to 32% two weeks ago,” he said.Subhash Salunke, adviser to the state government on Covid-19 and former director general of health services (Maharashtra), told TOI that the bed availability was indeed improving across the region. “But we are focussing on improving the vacancy of ICU beds. Even the cases seem to be going down. But we cannot afford to be complacent,” he said.Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said the use of oxygen, as well as the availability of oxygen supported beds, has improved in the region. “We should, however, be aware that it can be a temporary trend,” he said.Kiran Thorat, owner of Care Lifeline Hospital in Thergaon, said the streamlining of oxygen supply in the civic limits had helped in easing O2-related emergencies. Pune Municipal Corporation’s Congress leader Ulhas aka Aba Bagul claimed that the civic body’s helpline was not offering adequate information about bed availability. “Instead of providing urgent and immediate information, the person offering assistance via helpline seeks patients’ details such as oxygen saturation and HR-CT score. This leads to delay in treatment,” Bagul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/availability-of-hospital-beds-with-o2-support-improves/articleshow/82442909.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Of these, eight have died, four in 2020 and the other half this year. The four victims of this year had not been vaccinated, said a senior police official. In 2020, nearly 500 cops got infected, while the remaining 211 turned Covid-19 positive during 2021. According to officials, the rate of infection in the second wave has remained low among the ranks is because of vaccination. “Surat city police is at the top of vaccination list in the state with 95 percent of its staff getting the first dose of vaccine, while 86 percent got the second dose as well. Due to vaccination the cases are less in police even when they come in direct contact with many people daily,” city police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI. Of the 5,609 personnel in city police 5,320 have got their first dose of vaccine. Those who are yet to get the jab include those who have been advised by doctors. Currently 163 cops are Covid-19 positive, of whom one has been shifted to hospital for treatment while others are in home isolation. “Due to vaccination, those who are infected have minor illness and are recovering well. I talked to cop Jaswantsinh Bariya who is in the hospital on Thursday and he is now out of oxygen support. He will be discharged soon,” said Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vaccination-stalls-spread-of-virus-among-cops-this-yr/articleshow/82439585.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The drive-in vaccination centre administers vaccine to people while they are seated in their vehicles. After getting their shots, they can spend the mandatory 30-minute observation period inside their vehicle as well. The beneficiaries must pay the parking charges until they drive out. The drive-in vaccination centre has been set up following a demand for home vaccination of those unable to queue up outside centres and the inoculation drive is still to take off in housing societies. “The initiative is a must for Pune residents. It isn’t possible for such people to visit vaccination sites, so it should be provided to them at the doorstep,” said Tupe. He has written to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) urging the civic body set up a drive-in vaccination site. PMC officials said the civic administration will carry out vaccination as per instructions provided by the state government. “The civic administration has been carrying out vaccinations across the city areas. Vaccination drives are being held even at workplaces. The decision about a drive-in vaccination facility will be taken in due course of time, subject to availability of doses,” said a senior PMC official. Earlier this week, Mumbai’s first drive-in vaccination centre started at BMC’s Kohinoor Parking Lot in Dadar. Hundreds queued up to get the elderly and immobile patients vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-rises-for-drive-in-vaccination-hub-in-city/articleshow/82442911.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh can move vacation bench, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: A bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale on Thursday adjourned the petition filed by former home minister Anil Deshmukh and observed that since the CBI had been served it on Wednesday and had asked for time, it should be given reasonable time to file its reply. In the petition, Deshmukh sought quashing of the FIR field against him by the CBI. The high court then gave Deshmukh liberty to move the vacation bench in case of extreme urgency with 48-hour notice to the CBI. The bench passed an order stating that Singh had sought four weeks, which is “vehemently opposed by Desai” who submits “there is an urgency”. The high court said it was inclined to grant the CBI reasonable time to file its reply, but on Desai’s request, granted Deshmukh liberty to approach the court for any extremely urgent relief during the court vacation, but with prior notice to the CBI. Deshmukh’s petition said the FIR followed a “biased, dubious” inquiry, “with ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta” against him. Calling the first information report (FIR) against him “false”, Deshmukh said that prior sanction was necessary to register the FIR against him as he was a minister when the offence was alleged to have occurred. He said the FIR made “bald and vague allegations” and no case of allegations of “illegal gratification” under Section 7 of the PCA or criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the IPC. The FIR is to have him “arrested, with an ulterior motive”, said the former minister. The petition said the high directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry and to take further steps “in accordance with law”. He said since the state had last year withdrawn its general consent to the CBI for investigation of offences occurring here, barring a direct order by the high court or the Supreme Court, which was lacking in the case, the agency could not lodge an FIR and investigate it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-can-move-vacation-bench-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/82443033.cms||---

Zoo director Rajkumar Jadhav said that instructions have been given to the entire staff taking care of big cats to be on high alert and ensure optimum sanitization and hygiene. “As per instructions of the Central Zoo Authority, all measures are being followed since last year. However, with information coming in from the Hyderabad Zoo, we have become even more alert. The team of veterinarians have been instructed to observe the cats each day and look for any unusual behavior,” he said. The zoo, which is under the Pune Municipal Corporation, houses two lions, six tigers and three leopards apart from other animals. The official said that special care has been taken to ensure that the meat was safe for animal consumption. “Instructions have been given to put the meat in boiling water for at least 10 minutes before serving it to big cats. Also, before starting work in the cages, attendants must wear masks, boots, gloves and ensure that their boots are disinfected. Unless it is urgent, the cats should be left alone,” he said. All municipal gardens, including the zoo, have been closed due to the pandemic. “The stress is on daily examination of big cats by the team of doctors. If needed, we will contact the Central Zoo Authority. Presently, all big cats at the zoo are doing fine. Every staff member at the zoo has taken one or two doses of the vaccine,” Jadhav said. The staff members have been asked to keep two different sets of clothes on campus. They are not allowed to wear the same clothes while commuting to work when they are on duty. An arrangement was made at the entry gate of the zoo for disinfectants and sanitisation, an official said.

---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh: Encroached Krishna bed given for land pooling, CID alleges||HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Department (CID) has filed an affidavit in the AP high court revealing details of the alleged Amaravati assigned land scam in which former CM N Chandrababu Naidu was named as an accused. The CID found lands that were shown as government lands in records were submitted for the land pooling scheme (LPS) by private individuals. The probe also found contradicting versions of revenue records in the capital area where one report said records were missing and the other said it was surrendered to then Guntur joint collector Cherukuri Sridhar. The CID further alleged that encroached Krishna river bed was given away for land pooling. The CID registered an FIR against Naidu on March 12 under IPC section of criminal conspiracy and sections of Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act after conducting a preliminary enquiry. The CID alleged that Naidu as chairman of APCRDA and former minister P Narayana as ex-officio vice-chairman were closely associated with the functioning of APCRDA. “Sridhar played a key role initially as joint collector, as in-charge of land-related matters in Guntur district and subsequently as commissioner of APCRDA,” the CID charged. Sridhar as joint collector had unofficially called for original land revenue records of the capital city area and other adjacent villages from Thullur, Tadepalli and Mangalagiri tahsildar offices, it said. The CID alleged in its affidavit, “The preliminary investigation report clearly established the modus operandi of the accused in connivance with several persons. There were illegal claims for allotment of plots and their acceptance and benefits were provided to several ineligible persons causing a loss to the APCRDA. As per revenue records, the encroachers were not issued assigned pattas. The land in their possession was government land and they were cultivating the lands unauthorised without any assignment pattas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/encroached-krishna-bed-given-for-land-pooling-cid-alleges/articleshow/82442913.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

North Goa Congress vice-president Chandan Mandreker said that there is no medical assistance provided to Covid positive patients under home isolation in Siolim. “Some doctors are not answering phone calls of the patients and there is a shortage of oximeters and other components from the home-isolation kit being provided by the government,” he said.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Cabinet nod to 25% honorarium for health staff on Covid-19 duty||LUCKNOW: The state cabinet on Thursday approved a Covid honorarium, entailing the payment of additional 25% over and above the regular pay, for heatlh workers deployed in Covid wards at government hospitals. The decision will be applicable retrospectively from May 1, 2021. Principal secretary (medical education) Alok Kumar said the step had been taken to not just increase available manpower in the state but also to boost the morale of health workers who had been working hard to combat the pandemic for over a year. The approval came three days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath declared that an honorarium would be given to health workers. “The cabinet on Thursday approved the additional pay to health workers, including doctors, ward boys, nurses, cleaners and anyone who is performing duty in Covid wards. They will get an additional 25% of their salary above their monthly payout," Kumar said. The increment will also be applicable on outsourced employees who will get 25% additional payment over their monthly remuneration,” Kumar said, adding that it was the government’s way of letting them know that it was with them in the hour of crisis. Citing the possibility of the third wave of coronavirus later in the year, as suggested by experts, Kumar said it was necessary for the government to arrange for trained manpower. “For this, the government has taken two crucial decisions. It has been decided for the first time ever daily stipend would be given to MBBS interns or those in their final year, and final year students of MSc and BSc (nursing) and technicians. The government has fixed daily stipend of Rs 500 for those doing internship after MBBS, Rs 400 for MSc (nursing), Rs 300 for BSc (nursing), and Rs 300 for those in MBBS final year. Active quarantine will be included in this package along with allowance for food, as is given to other Covid staff,” he said. Through the health and medical education departments, the government will also release an advertisement for hiring of retired health workers and those in private sector who would volunteer to work in Covid wards. They will be paid 25% more than the approved rate under the National Health Mission. The hiring of such persons will be decentralised. Interviews and appointments will be conducted by principals of medical colleges and the district health committee of health department, which is headed by the district magistrate and the chief medical officer as secretary. “We are expecting a monthly expenditure of Rs 50 crore on these initiatives. This will be applicable from May 1 to July 31, 2021 and will be extended, if necessary,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-nod-to-25-honorarium-for-health-staff-on-covid-19-duty/articleshow/82444985.cms||---

The society’s newly-elected executive committee reviewed the allotments and found that a plot worth Rs 40 crore was registered in the name of one Sireesha for a mere Rs 2 lakh. The society’s current secretary had filed a complaint at the Jubilee Hills police station and they registered an FIR against the former executive committee, comprising Narendra Chowdary, Ch Krishna Murthy, A Suresh Reddy, P Hanumantha Rao along with two sub-registrars, D Srinivas Kumar and J Pranay Kumar. The complainant said that even the person whom they showed as Sireesha and transferred the plot was not the person. Sireesha is currently staying in the US and a woman impersonated her as part of a criminal conspiracy. The advocates, appearing for the accused, urged the court to grant them anticipatory bail. Assistant public prosecutor Sudarsan Sara along with the complainant opposed any relief to the accused. The judge granted anticipatory bail to all applicants on the condition that they should furnish two sureties worth Rs one lakh each and surrender their passports before the trial court. They should also extend their cooperation to police and furnish all required documents as and when sought.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-members-of-jubilee-hills-hsg-body-get-bail-in-plot-case/articleshow/82442926.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The patient Lalit Mishra was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city where he died on Wednesday. His family contacted an ambulance driver to ferry his body to the cremation site. The ambulance driver Bablu charged Rs 2,500 from the family of the deceased, even though the local administration has made arrangement for free transportation of dead bodies to cremation site in the time of pandemic. ADM (supply) Dr Basant Agarwal said, a family member of the deceased Saurabh Mishra alerted the Covid nodal officer who lodged an FIR against the ambulance driver at Gwaltoli police station. “During investigation, the charges were found to be true.

---||India||Media has right to report exchanges during hearings: SC||NEW DELHI: Moving away from a nine-year-old judgment putting curbs on coverage of court proceedings to protect the rights of the accused, the Supreme Court on Thursday said the media had an unfettered right to report exchanges during hearings as it rejected the Election Commission's plea that the media be restricted to publishing only court orders and judgments. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, "This court stands as a staunch proponent of the freedom of the media to report court proceedings. This, we believe, is integral to the freedom of speech and expression of those who speak, of those who wish to hear and to be heard and above all, in holding the judiciary accountable to the values which justify its existence as a constitutional institution." Citing the fillip the freedom struggle got from the reportage of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak's sedition trial, the bench said, "The heart of the matter, which is the first prayer that the EC has raised - that of seeking a restraint on the media on reporting court proceedings. The basis of its application was that nothing apart from what forms a part of the official judicial record should be reported. This prayer of the EC strikes at two fundamental principles guaranteed under the Constitution - open court proceedings, and the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression." Importantly, the court brought up the issue of livestreaming of court proceedings, as is the practice in the Supreme Courts of the US and the UK. Justice Chandrachud said though the SC three years ago in the Swapnil Tripathi case had in principle approved the live telecast of SC hearings and suggested the modalities, it is yet to implement the same in letter and spirit. Times ViewCourt orders are important. So are observations made during the hearings. These days several online media organisations also tweet observations live. Objecting to news flow in any form would actually mean denying people the right to full information. It is great that the apex court has embraced the need of the times."Unless livestreaming and archival of court proceedings sees the light of day (three years have elapsed since the decision in Swapnil Tripathi), the absence of records of oral proceedings will continue to bedevil the system," Justice Chandrachud said while ruing the absence of material to confirm Madras HC's purported hurtful remarks against the EC, which was widely reported in the media, causing consternations to the constitutional body mandated to conduct free and fair elections. "With the advent of technology, we are seeing reporting proliferate through social media forums which provide real-time updates to a much wider audience. This is an extension of the freedom of speech and expression that the media possesses. This constitutes a virtual extension of the open court. This phenomenon is not a cause of apprehension, but a celebration of our constitutional ethos which bolsters the integrity of the judiciary by focusing attention on its functions," the bench said.

Swabs of 14 Asiatic lions in Etawah Safari had been sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareilly, for RT-PCR tests for Covid-19. The institute conducted the tests and found one lion positive for the infection, while another was considered as a suspected case. Rest 12 lions have tested negative. As per sources, Safari authorities had raised an alarm a few days ago when they came across two lions coughing and suffering from a runny nose besides loss of appetite. Talking to TOI, joint director Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnosis (CADRAD) at IVRI, Bareilly, Dr KP Singh said, the Covid test report of one lion was positive while one seems to be a suspected case. Dr Singh said the chain of transmission of virus could have taken place through any asymptomatic human carrier, probably caretakers, working at the Safari. “We have asked the safari authorities to shift the infected animals in complete isolation and to instruct the caretakers to wear protective gear and masks,” he added. The Safari has been shut for public as a precautionary measure. The Etawah Lion Safari authorities said the two lions are undergoing treatment at the veterinary hospital in the premises and all necessary precautions are being taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/lion-tests-covid-positive-at-etawah-safari/articleshow/82442593.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath: Home isolation patients to get O2 from specific centres||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that family members of patients in home isolation should not be made to run around for oxygen. He said that a proper protocol should be made so that specific filling centres are set aside for home isolation patients. Details of these centres along with documents required should be told to patients so that when required they do not have to panic and know where to go. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said that a system will be devised under which people would be told what documents they need to show and where they should go to procure an oxygen cylinder. This, he said, would be applicable to both Covid and non-Covid patients. Sehgal said that on Wednesday, 823-tonne oxygen was supplied to hospitals across the state. “Oxygen Express trains are running continuously. A train with 80 tonnes of oxygen from Jamnagar is also expected anytime. Currently, 89 tankers are working in UP, up from 32 earlier. The Centre has given 14 tankers of 400 tonnes capacity to the state. Tankers have been made available by private industrial groups such as Reliance and Adani,” he said. Public sector units are also setting up oxygen plants. The sugarcane development and sugar industries and excise departments are also working towards oxygen generation in sugar plants. Oxygen concentrators have been made available at community health centres and in large hospitals. The CM has also directed districts to purchase more concentrators based on their needs. The state is also getting oxygen concentrators from private industrial and commercial companies as part of their CSR. The state is in the process of issuing a global tender for cryogenic oxygen cylinders. In addition to this, said a spokesperson, a control room is monitoring demand and supply of oxygen to ensure that no area faces a shortage. Tankers have been fitted with GPS to monitor their movement. The government has also appointed seven institutes for an oxygen audit to reduce its wastage. The Air Force and Indian Railways are also helping in quick movement of oxygen tankers to and from filling points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-home-isolation-patients-to-get-o2-from-specific-centres/articleshow/82445016.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: 11 out of 15 new containment zones located in rural areas||PRAYAGRAJ: With the number of containment zones rising in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets, the officials of the health department have intensified sample collection exercise in rural areas. Sample this: 11 out of 15 new containment zones, declared by the joint team of police, health and administration on Wednesday, are located in rural areas. Officials said that testing will not only detect new Covid cases, but will also help in mapping high containment zones and framing an intervention plan. The massive testing drive is an effort towards breaking the chain of the deadly virus in villages and blocks. Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Rishi Sahai told TOI, “An aggressive door-to-door surveillance has been taken up in all 23 blocks of the district. He added, “A total of 60 health teams are monitoring the situation in Naini, Phaphamau, Soroan, Jari Bazar, Chak Dodi (Arail), Phulpur, Tikri, Esmileganj, Jhunsi and other rural areas after a surge in Covid cases was reported in these areas this week.” Teams are focusing on looking for people with Covid-like symptoms, and getting them tested. Random antigen and RT-PCR tests in crowded pockets have also been carried out. As vegetable markets and mandis operate only in the mornings in trans-Ganga and Yamuna areas, a testing drive among vendors has also been planned. A senior health official, meanwhile, said that rising Covid cases has also impacted the vaccination drive. Less number of beneficiaries is turning up at vaccination centres in rural areas. RRTs (rapid response teams) are surveying and testing every house in each ward, whenever required. Now, teams have also been engaged to conduct contact tracing of positive patients and ensure their treatment. Teams, with the help of monitoring committees, have also been asked to visit the houses of migrants who had recently returned from big cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Ahemdabad and Benguluru. Between May 1 and 5, a total of 58,292 samples were collected for testing—11,743 on May 5, 11,434 on May 4, 11,770 on May 3, 10,006 on May 2 and 13,339 on May 1. As many as 4,271 positive cases were detected, including 596 on May 5, 683 on May 4, 863 on May 3, 984 on May 2 and 1,145 on May 1. A majority of cases was detected from rural areas, and this forced the health authorities to turn their attention towards rural pockets for carrying out 3Ts (testing, tracking and treating).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/11-out-of-15-new-containment-zones-located-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82442782.cms||---
---||Goa||Entry into Goa only with Covid -ve certificate: HC; difficult, says CM||PANAJI: With Goa’s “high positivity rate” of Covid-19 cases continuing to wreak havoc in the tiniest state, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday directed the government to ensure that no persons are permitted entry into the state from May 10 onwards without a negative certificate. Remarking that the state should have imposed these minimum restrictions on its own, a division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar—hearing a slew of public interest litigations on the government measures to stop the spread of the pandemic—in an interim order told the “state administration to ensure that no persons are permitted entry into the state unless they possess a negative certificate obtained within 72 hours from the time they seek entry into the state.” Hours after the high court order, chief minister Pramod Sawant said seeking a Covid-negative certificate from every person entering Goa will burden the already strained state administration and infrastructure. “It is okay if it is a tourist you are asking for a certificate. What about those who come by train? What do we do when one does not have a Covid-negative certificate? State will again have to do their tests for free, provide them food. Already there is such a strain at present on the entire administration. But we will submit the affidavit sought from us,” he said. Earlier advocate general Devidas Pangam had told the court that Goa relies on neighbouring states for most essentials and the insistence on a negative certificate will impact supplies. He submitted that the central government does not support sealing borders of any state during these times. “We see no justification in the state of Goa not insisting on a negative certificate from persons who seek entry into Goa at this crucial juncture when reports indicate that the positivity rate in Goa is as high as 52%. Some suitable mechanisms can always be formulated by the state to ensure that some testing facilities are available at the borders or entry points so that the supply of essentialities or the ingress of essential personnel are not affected,” the court observed. TOI in a series of reports for over a month has been highlighting the state’s unpreparedness in dealing with the second wave and insisting on stringent curbs to stop the spread of the killer virus and transparency measures to benefit the people of Goa. Sawant said if the state starts asking every person entering Goa for a negative certificate, then they would have to ask from even truckers who bring in milk, vegetables and chicken. “If we ask them for certificates, they will be unable to produce it... we need to give this a thought,” he said. But the high court had made it clear that the state government can formulate a protocol to deal with the issues of essential supplies and the procedure for entry of persons involved in essential supplies and said, “Citing such instances to justify wholesale waiver of restrictions in such critical times is not justifiable in any case. This issue will arise mainly to travellers by road”. Referring to those entering the state by train and flight, the HC said, “It is too much to suggest that all such travellers are mainly involved in supplying essential services or goods in Goa. The state government will, therefore, have to insist upon a negative certificate before such persons enter Goa.” The HC said the interim direction will be effective from May 10 to enable the state administration to publicise the new measures. With the situation “spiralling out of control”, the court has also sought to know from the government whether there is any thought process on the issue of lockdown. The court was hearing PILs filed by South Goa Advocates’ Association, Armando Gonsalves and Roshan Mathias regarding the difficulties faced in terms of oxygen supply, medical infrastructure, supply of essential medicines, testing facilities and vaccination drive. The petitions also sought to know the measures adopted by the government to prevent the spread of the epidemic, including banning mass gatherings, social distancing, entry of persons into the state and lockdown. While seeking an affidavit regarding the oxygen requirement and stock of essential medicines, the court asked the government to bring in transparency about the availability of medical facilities by putting the information in the public domain. It observed that this would avoid “unnecessary anxiety” and “rumour mongering”. The court also sought information about the steps taken to augment stocks of essential medicines available in the state. The case is likely to come up for hearing on May 11. The court directed the government to provide adequate protection to healthcare professionals at hospitals. Regarding their security, the court said, “We are quite mindful of the fact that patients and their relatives are stressed out and even desperate. Nevertheless, a message must go out loud and clear that there will be zero tolerance for any form of physical or verbal violence against healthcare professionals. Such violence is simply not acceptable and must be dealt with by a firm hand.” Referring to Supreme Court directions issued to the Centre to collaborate with states to prepare a buffer stock of oxygen for emergency purposes, the high court asked the state administration to indicate whether all such facilities are in place. The court also sought to know about the status of oxygen availability. It has directed the government to file an affidavit on oxygen requirements and the steps taken by the administration to have plants to manufacture oxygen in the state itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/entry-into-goa-only-with-covid-ve-certificate-hc-difficult-says-cm/articleshow/82445384.cms||---

Officials said this category is dependent on Covishield supply from the Centre to the state, which then distributes it to districts. On Tuesday night, Pune district got around 73,800 doses of the vaccine. Thursday’s drive used up 65,000 doses. Officials said Pune district received around 25,000 Covishield doses on Thursday evening from the Centre, which will be used for the 45+ category. But preference will be given to those who are due for their second dose. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “PMC and Pune rural have been given 10,000 doses each. Since these doses are coming from the Centre to the state, they will be used only for the 45-plus age group.” As for Covaxin, Deshmukh said the earlier batch of 32,000 doses the district received was procured by the state directly from Bharat Biotech. He said, “This stock is being used for the 18-44 group.” Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, said, “We have been told that vaccine supply will improve. Until then, we are managing with whatever stock we have.” On Thursday, as many as 22,957 beneficiaries in the district got their Covid shots. A total of 6,500 were from the 18-44 age group. More than 1,000 people in the 45-plus group were given their second jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-vaccine-reserves-likely-to-impact-45-plus-drive-in-district/articleshow/82442935.cms||Piyush Bhusari

There were complaints from ward number 21 and 32, but the results were found correct. Speaking to reporters, the DM said, “There were complaints of errors in counting in district panchayat ward numbers 21, 32, 45, 60 and 61. After booth-wise matching of votes, the results of ward number 21 and 32 were found correct and clerical mistake was found in the result of ward number 45.” “An FIR has been lodged against the returning officer Virendra Kumar, who is executive engineer in irrigation department and a letter for action against him would be written to Election Commission,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/3-panchayat-poll-resultsrevised-after-recounting/articleshow/82442690.cms||---

Altogether 33 private facilities, most of them offering paid care along with meals and comfortable ambiance, have come up at hotels, recreational centres and wedding halls in the past two months. Besides, there are five Pune Municipal Corporation-run Covid care centres meant for asymptomatic and mild patients who do not have separate room and toilet at home and cannot afford care at the private facilities “The current scene is paradoxical. On one hand, the city has so many private isolation facilities with a sizeable amount of dead-stock of oxygen cylinders lying unused. On the other hand, several small Covid hospitals with ICU units either stopping new admissions or shifting their patients to big hospitals for want of medical oxygen,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India (Pune branch) — an association of small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune. “Keeping a few cylinders for emergency use is reasonable enough. But many private Covid care centres in the city have made a provision of huge oxygen storage tank, called Dura, which is equivalent to 30 jumbo cylinders. We want the Pune Municipal Corporation authorities to audit the use of oxygen cylinders at such CCCs and give out some of this stock to the small hospitals on a rotational basis," Patil said. “Many asymptomatic or mildly infected patients from affording class want to remain under medical supervision 24X7. The private isolation facilities mainly cash in on them,” said health activist Abhijit More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-for-audit-of-dead-stock-of-o2-cylinders-idle-at-pvt-isolation-centres/articleshow/82442942.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In a contentious move, secretary R Vijayanand, on Thursday morning named M Narayana as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to ombudsman Justice (retd) Nisar Ahmed Kukur and ethics officer Justice (retd) T Meena Kumar. President Mohammed Azharuddin termed the appointment illegal and a serious violation of the rules and procedures laid down by the Lodha committee. “He (Narayana) will be available during office hours and all complaints will be received by him and the same will be referred to the ombudsman and ethics officer depending on the case,” reads a communication from the secretary to HCA members. The appointment of ombudsman and ethics officer has been a bone of contention with two groups naming different judges for the position. Recently the Ranga Reddy court had stated that “the ombudsman and the ethics officers hadn’t taken charge.” HCA has sought clarification of the high court judgment by filing a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme court, which is pending for listing.” “When the officials haven’t still taken charge, what was the necessity to appoint an OSD for them,” questioned a club secretary. In his letter to the club secretaries, Azharuddin questioned the move and spelt out reasons why the appointment was illegal. “Under rule 19 (2) & rule 24 (13), the power to lay guidelines and manage day to day affairs of the association is the function of the CEO. The secretary cannot assume the powers of the CEO and therefore the order is in violation of the rules,” he said. The president added that the AGM on April 11 ratified the appointment of Justice (retd) Deepak Verma as ombudsman under Rule 8(3)(f) — an appointment contested by the secretary. “Any other name projected as the ombudsman is illegal and contrary to rules." Azhar also said that five members of the Apex council, including the secretary, are facing an inquiry by the ombudsman under Rule 41 (1) (b) of the HCA constitution and cannot make such appointments. He urged the members to ignore the illegal communication of the secretary. “I have been fighting a battle since the last 18 months to prevent illegality in functioning of the HCA. The clean-up should start from the top of the structure. I request you all to ignore the illegal communication of the secretary,” Azharuddin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-wrangling-refuses-to-end/articleshow/82442946.cms||Solomon S Kumar

Long queues of customers were seen outside grocery, bakery, medicine and other shops in all districts. SOPs regarding corona curfew reached people late on Wednesday night. Although shops selling essentials will remain open, private vehicles will be allowed only for emergency purposes. For the first time in many days, markets received many customers with everyone stocking up on essentials. Newlywed couple Pradeep and Shalini bought ration for two months and stocked vegetables for a few days. Pradeep said SOPs on curfew were unclear but all he could understand was that people could travel only using public transport facilities. “Travelling in buses is not safe these days and private vehicles will not be allowed by the police. I’m not stocking essentials but buying them in advance to avoid any problem during the curfew,” he said. People also thronged medicine shops, with most buyers getting vitamin C, zink, multi-vitamins, face masks and sanitiser bottles. Gagan Chaudhary, who bought a packet of medical face masks and a few bottles of hand sanitiser said, “The cost of all products required to protect us from Covid-19 is likely to increase in the coming days. Consumption of these masks has increased in the last few days as we are using double masks – one woollen mask and one medical mask.” Even electronics, readymade garments, hair and beauty salons received many customers all day. People also flocked at petrol pumps. Corona curfew will remain in force in Himachal from 6am on May 7 to 6am on May 17. Most people feel that the government will extend curfew after 10 days. Emergency movement will continue and construction, farming as well as horticultural work will not be stopped. Public transport will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Movement of labourers for various construction works will also be allowed. Deputy commissioners of all districts on Thursday also issued guidelines regarding corona curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/markets-crowded-on-corona-curfew-eve/articleshow/82442940.cms||---

But certain pockets in all eight zones of the city are still worrying the civic body officials. Most of these wards fall under the Athwa and Rander zones which are consistently reporting maximum cases in the city. On Thursday, Athwa recorded 250 fresh cases, while Rander recorded 258. Surat Municipal Corporation has narrowed down its focus to 22 sanitation wards of the city where the positivity rate is still high. While the Surat city’s positivity rate is around 3.5% in these 22 wards, the positivity rate hovers around 5%. Civic body officials said that in these areas, entire families are getting infected which is majorly contributing to the total cases in the city. “Due to the high positivity rate, there are higher possibilities of community spread which may again increase the case,” said an official. “We want people in these wards to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, using hand sanitizers, washing hands frequently and maintaining social distancing,” said deputy commissioner Dr Ashish Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/amid-decline-certain-ve-pockets-niggle-smc/articleshow/82439723.cms||---

---||Jaipur||District collectors not recognising forest staff as frontline workers for vaccination||JAIPUR: Frontline forest personnel working amid Covid curfew continue to stand vulnerable as the district collectors are in no mood to include them among the corona warriors’ list. Many forest staff aged between 18 and 44 alleged that they were not vaccinated at the government dispensaries without getting a pre-booked time slot. On May 2, forest department’s principal secretary Shreya Guha wrote a letter to all district collectors to vaccinate the forest staff as cases of infection have increased. The letter seems to have had no effect on the district collectors. Bhupendra Singh, district coordinator of Van Vibhag Samasya Samadhan Sangh, said, “Two days after the direction issued by the principal secretary, forest, many of us reached to take first jab at Itwa Katholi. However, they were denied claiming district collectors have not issued orders. In majority of districts the forest frontline staff have not been vaccinated.” After the second Covid wave hit the forest department’s frontline staff hard, the principal secretary on Sunday wrote to include the forest staff in the list of functions which requires essential staff. At present, more than 40 forest personnel have been tested positive across the state. A divisional forest officer (DFO), who wished not to be named, said, “Despite a letter was written to the collector two days ago, we have not received any response. As the wait is growing, many jittery forest staff members are directly approaching senior forest officials through messages. Attempts are on to start a vaccination drive soon.” There are 200 forest personnel in every district and their total strength is approximately 5,000 across the state. The frontline forest personnel working in various districts were vulnerable to Covid infection as they were coming in contact with villagers, tourists, and contractors while carrying out their official responsibility. It is also stated as summers have approached, many a times the staff have to combat wildfires with the assistance of local villagers. As forest staff have an interface with villagers, it exposes them to the virus. Also, to roll out Ghar Ghar Aushadi scheme, the staff across the state will work in close association with labourers at forest nurseries to develop saplings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/district-collectors-not-recognising-forest-staff-as-frontline-workers-for-vaccination/articleshow/82442949.cms||---
---||Jaipur||RT-PCR negative reports not being recognised to allow government employees rejoin duty in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: A faulty order of the state government has become an instrument of harassment for many of its employees on probation (upto three years) as they have to run from pillar to post to produce a medical certificate saying that they have been cured of Covid. Currently, RT-PCR negative reports are not being recognised to allow government employees to rejoin duty. Also, Chief Medical Health Officer (CMHO) certificate is required to authenticate the patient’s fitness and avail quarantine leaves. An employee who wished not to be named and has recently recovered said, “I am waiting to rejoin in absence of medical certificate. Patients who have tested negative after treatment have to submit the medical certificate to join duty again. Even, if they join, their salary will be deducted, till the time the certificate is submitted.” Many have requested that the government should take RT-PCR reports into consideration as the process is tedious. The new employees can avail earned leaves, casual leaves, and medical leaves only after completing service of three years. Another staff in police administration said, “At a time when the health department is under stress, it is difficult to procure medical certificates and the state government should amend its rule. Moreover, procuring medical staff from a CMHO remains a task.” It was further informed that it is also difficult to procure certificate from the CMHO if a treatment has taken place in a private hospital or at home. An employee working in Alwar said, a system should be developed statewide like Pali and Jodhpur districts where certificates are issued online. “In these two districts, a Covid positive test report, only RT-PCR test having Specimen Referral Form (SRF) ID, from an ICMR-approved testing lab is required. The employee can upload the ID on the website to get an approval from the CMHO,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rt-pcr-ve-reports-not-being-recognised-to-allow-govt-employees-rejoin-duty/articleshow/82442944.cms||---

Police said the accused killed the victim due to property disputes. The deceased was identified as N Narayana, 48, a farmer from Pochamma Colony in Bhirkoor. Narayana’s wife Shanta Bai and their daughter, Jyothy, 26, bludgeoned him to death, Bhirkoor sub-inspector (SI) K Rajesh said. On Thursday morning, villagers alerted police about the murder of Narayana. “Shanta Bai and Jyothy bludgeoned him to death when he was sleeping in front of the house in the early hours of Thursday. We are verifying the role of Narayana’s son Prasad,” the SI said. During the preliminary probe, police found out that Narayana had six acres of agricultural land and his family members were asking him to give them a share in the property. He, however, did not agree. “Narayana’s daughter Jyothy is a widow. She was asking Narayana to give her an acre of land. Narayana’s wife Shanta Bai was also asking for an acre and he was unwilling to give them any share. Angry with Narayana, the accused killed him,” the SI said. Police arrested the accused under Section 302 (Murder) of Indian Penal Code and the body was shifted for post-mortem examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmer-killed-by-kin-over-property/articleshow/82442952.cms||---

According to the employees, veterinary services come under essential services and all hospitals are open. Department employees have been engaged in Covid duties in hospitals in many districts, but not a single preventive measure like PPE kit or masks were provided by the government. They also do not come under frontline workers. Rajasthan Veterinary Service Association general secretary Arjun Singh said, “This is quite shameful that our lives do not have any value. We need support from the administration, but even after losing 10 employees, not a single reaction from our minister Lal Chand Kataria shows that government is not serious about us. In districts where our employees are appointed for Covid duty, we have to make their own arrangements for security.” Similar complaints were received last year when animal husbandry employees were appointed in Covid wards without been given even gloves or sanitizers. The employees are demanding Rs 50 lakh compensation in case of death of employees, vaccination drive, special arrangements like food and lodging for employees who are found positive during duty. There are more than 9,000 veterinary employees and more than 2,500 doctors currently working in the state who are going on field every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/veterinary-employees-demand-frontline-workers-status/articleshow/82442953.cms||---

The local bodies should help those in home isolation in procuring essentials, the directives stated. Civic bodies have also been asked to maintain confidentiality of the patients while helping them so that the infected persons do not face social stigma. “Covid positive in home isolation need to be monitored to avoid spread of infection. Panchayats and municipal bodies have been asked to monitor the infected. The list will be shared by the respective health officers of the directorate of health services,” member secretary of state disaster management authority, Sanjay Kumar said. Panchayats and municipalities may provide support to these persons with provisions like medicines, food or any other items required by them. The local bodies should also help to provide the patients with ambulance support in case they need it to be taken for hospitalisation, Kumar has said. Civic bodies should ensure that the restrictions imposed by the collectors under Section 144 are being strictly adhered to in the respective areas and to make sure that establishments which have been directed to remain shut follow the orders. “They may take the support of local police for the same in coordination with the deputy collectors, who may also be informed in case of violation or non-compliance of orders,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/civic-bodies-must-aid-those-in-home-isolation-says-govt/articleshow/82445139.cms||---

Against 3,884 new cases, 5,013 patients — 1,129 more than the new cases — got discharged. The state health department website put the number of active cases in Ahmedabad district at 66,466, or about 38% of the state’s total active cases. The fall in cases reduced bed occupancy marginally. On Thursday, 86% of 6,696 beds were occupied. The number was 92% on Wednesday. “After a long time, 7 beds with ventilator and 29 ICU beds were vacant. It’s sa good sign. Occupancy went below 90% after about one and a half months. Bed availability, however, might still be an issue at major hospitals,” said a senior member of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA). The long queues of ambulances on the Civil Hospital campus were non-existent. Sources, however, attributed the phenomenon to a change in protocol where hospitals call ambulances to bring in patients depending on vacancies. Meanwhile, there was ruckus at Dhanvantari Hospital due to delay in handing over a body. The kin raised a stink after the phone line to talk to patients went kaput. The authorities, claimed the issues were later ironed out. On Thursday, the state health department issued a new directive for admission of Covid patients where positive RT-PCR reports was no longer a necessity if a patient showed Covid symptoms. S/he can be admitted and treatment would be started, said officials. Gujarat on Thursday crossed 8,000 Covid deaths. The state is 10th in mortality in India. Analysis of the figures reveal that the last 1,000 deaths were recorded in seven days, the second fastest. The fastest 1,000 deaths were recorded in six days between April 24 and 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dip-in-new-cases-but-bed-availability-still-an-issue/articleshow/82441299.cms||---

As per GO 41 issued in 2016, the beneficiaries fall under encroachers’ list in objectionable land, which was originally part of Krishna river. “Claims of several individuals in violation of the law were considered and annuity was paid, causing loss to the APCRDA,” the CID alleged.  The GO was not placed before the council of ministers or the legislative assembly as mandated by the APCRDA Act. “Claimants who offered land under the LPS were close associates and strong activists of TDP,” it said. The CID further alleged that these persons had prior knowledge about GO 41 and created a panic among gullible persons that government would take away their lands with no returnable benefits. “After creating panic, the accused entered into unregistered sale agreements and sales with the assignees by paying meagre amounts. After the agreements, they submitted the land for pooling and got plots worth crores from the APCRDA. Some of them sold these allotted plots at higher prices and made crores,” it added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/some-sold-plots-at-higher-price-made-crores/articleshow/82442963.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Fuel demand crashes 70% due to restrictions, VAT mop up takes a hit||JAIPUR: Demand for auto fuels has crashed 70% lending a heavy blow to the state’s VAT revenue collections. Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association said the daily loss could be around Rs 17 crore. The restriction on the movement of private vehicles is not the only reason. The association said the state’s guidelines for controlling the Covid is playing an equal hand. “By limiting the fuel retailing time to five hours, the state is losing many customers. While goods carriers are allowed to tank up round the clock, a significant number of the vehicles are avoiding Rajasthan and buying from neighbouring states. The five-hour window has caused an uncertainty and the drivers are wary of taking any risk,” said Suneet Bagai, president of the association. “Secondly,” Bagai said, “There are many private vehicles which travel to the state or through it for emergency work. Here again, they buy fuel from other states as they cannot get petrol in Rajasthan after 12pm.” He said when there are already restrictions for people on coming out on the road, the need to again limit the time for fuel stations does not have any logic. “If people are not allowed to come on the road after the relaxation time up to 11am, on what logic they will go to the fuel stations. It only creates discomfort for people who are travelling due to emergency and uncertainty for goods carriers on the highways,” added Bagai. Giving a back of the envelope calculation, he said the state sells about 70 crore litres of petrol and 400 crore litre diesel in a year. “The annual VAT collection is roughly about Rs 9,000 crore. Since the demand has decreased by around 70%, the lost tax per day works out to be around Rs 17 crore. But some of the loss can be mitigated if time for sales is made 24 hours on the highways,” added Bagai. TOI tried to reach Ravi Jain, commissioner, commercial taxes department, to ascertain the impact of the Covid guidelines on VAT collections from the auto fuels, but could not get a response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fuel-demand-crashes-70-due-to-restrictions-vat-mop-up-takes-a-hit/articleshow/82442967.cms||---

The woman constable Sukhjit Singh and home guard Rajvir Singh, regulating traffic at the Ajmer Gate saw two youths — Ibrar and Fardeen, wearing a helmet but without masks coming from the other end. Since unnecessary movement is restricted in the city due to a surge in infections and masks are compulsory, the duo attempted to stop them to inquire why they were loitering on the roads. “The bikers appeared to have got panicked on seeing traffic police approaching them and applied brakes and fell on the ground. Upon seeing Sukhjit and Rajvir rushing towards them, Ibrar with his helmet hit Sukhjit on her head and on the chest of Rajvir. He ran away towards his home at Kareem Manzil on MI Road while Fardeen was caught by traffic police,” said Ishwar Singh, investigation officer, Vidhayak Puri police station. Both were rushed to SMS hospital where they were given medical aid. “Both are out of danger,” said Singh. The drama didn’t stop here.

Vishweshwar Reddy, who was TRS MP from Chevella between 2014 and 2018, met Eatala to know his future plans and reportedly discussed about floating a new party. Eatala has already got an invite from other parties like the BJP and its leaders have reportedly approached him. The Huzurabad MLA, however, sought more time. “I met Rajender to extend my moral support to him as he was my colleague when I was in the TRS. His wife is my relative. I told him it is a lifetime opportunity to take the right decision,” Vishweshwar Reddy told TOI. After quitting the TRS, Vishvishwar joined Congress. Recently, he quit the Congress and is contemplating his future course of action. Meanwhile, the state government is cracking the whip on followers of Eatala. On Thursday, his close aide and Veenavanka ZPTC member Vanamala’s husband Sadhava Reddy received notices from Karimnagar District Cooperative Bank along with 12 others in a case of alleged misappropriation of funds when Sadhava Reddy was chairman of Veenavanka branch five years ago. The bank authorities in their notices asked him to remit Rs 18 lakh within 10 days or else the bank would auction his properties to recover the amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/konda-discusses-new-party-plans-with-eatala/articleshow/82442972.cms||Koride Mahesh

Petrol and diesel prices have witnessed a hike for the third consecutive day on Thursday, after remaining unchanged for 18 days, between April 6 to May 3, 2021. जब तक पांच राज्यों में विधानसभा चुनाव चल रहे थे, मोदी सरकार ने पेट्रोल डीजल की कीमतों में कोई बदलाव नहीं किया जबकि… https://t.co/8cM2VURmRW— Ashok Gehlot (@ashokgehlot51) 1620294082000He said the central government should reduce the tax on petrol and diesel and give relief to the “already troubled” people. The chief minister stressed that as long as the assembly elections were underway in five states, the Modi government did not make any changes in the prices of petrol and diesel while crude oil prices were changing daily in the international market. “As soon as the results of the elections came, the central government increased the prices of petrol and diesel and started putting burden on the people who are already affected by the pandemic,” he tweeted. “The Modi government is charging many times more tax on diesel, petrol than the UPA government, due to which inflation is continuously increasing,” he said. In one of the steepest increase since daily price revision was started, petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 31 paise as oil companies raised rates for the third straight day to pass on to consumers the increase in international oil prices. Petrol price in Rajasthan was increased to Rs 97.36 per litre while diesel rates went up to Rs 89.92, according to a price notification by the state-owned fuel retailers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-targets-modi-govt-over-rise-in-fuel-prices/articleshow/82442978.cms||---
---||Delhi||Police raids on to arrest accused in wrestler murder||New Delhi: A day after a case was registered against wrestler Sushil Kumar and his associates for allegedly beating to death another wrestler inside Chhatrasal Stadium, raids are on in Delhi and Haryana to nab the absconding Olympian and others. One of them, Prince Dalal, was arrested on Wednesday. Police have found that the fight took place over a flat owned by Kumar in Model Town where the victim, an international-level wrestler, had previously been living. According to police, 23-year-old Sagar Dhankad, son of a Delhi Police head constable, and Kumar had an ongoing dispute over its rent. Dhankad’s friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, were injured. Police have found that Kumar and his associates, Ajay, Prince and others — named in the FIR based on Sonu’s statement — are absconding and their mobile phones are switched off. The cops are also probing the possibility of involvement of the Kala Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi and Neeraj Bawania gangs in the fight as preliminary findings suggest that Sonu has alleged links with Jathedi while the accused are stated to be close to Bawania. However, police are yet to establish any link of them with the murder. Bishnoi has been brought on remand from the Ajmer jail and is being interrogated by Special Cell. The cops are also looking into Sonu’s alleged involvement in a previous murder and his links with the Jathedi gang. Kumar has, however, denied his involvement in the assault. Kumar lived inside the stadium but the CCTV cameras in front of his house near gate number 1 was probably damaged as no footage could be retrieved from them, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-raids-on-to-arrest-accused-in-wrestler-murder/articleshow/82442995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The motive behind the murder could not be established immediately. Sayyed’s neighbour Rafique Shaikh (45) registered an FIR relating to murder against unidentified men under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. “Syyed’s economic condition was very poor. Thus, for the past two years, Shaikh was taking care of Syyed’s two meals a day,” inspector Ashok Kadam of the Cantonment police said. Kadam said, “Shaikh wished to buy Syyed new clothes on the occasion of Ramzan Eid on May 14. So, he wanted to take him to a tailor for measurements on Thursday. When Shaikh visited Syyed’s resident, he was found dead with injuries on the right side of his head.” “Shaikh informed the police of the incident. We sent the victim’s body to Sassoon general hospital for post-mortem.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State: Will send cops to Hyd, not arrest Shukla till next HC date||Mumbai: Maharashtra government on Thursday informed Bombay high court that it was willing to send a police team to Hyderabad to video record the statement of former state intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla in connection with the FIR registered against unknown persons over ‘leaking’ her confidential report on alleged politician-police nexus on transfers and postings. The state further said it would not arrest Shukla before the next date—June 14—as HC adjourned the matter beyond its summer vacation, that starts next week. Shukla is currently posted in Hyderabad as additional director general, south Zone, CRPF. Claiming that she was being “hounded because she was a whistleblower to the rotten nexus between politicians and policemen in assigning powerful po-sts”, Shukla, a 1988 batch IPS officer, had petitioned the HC apprehending arrest. She sought ord-ers to stay a April 26 summons to appear before BKC cyber crime police station and to quash the FIR or transfer the probe to CBI. On Thursday, during the videoconference hearing before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale, former advocate general Darius Khambata and public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, appearing for the state, stated its willingness to send a team to Hyderabad to record her statement under CrPC Section 160, which provides that a woman shall in response to a summons not be required to “attend any place other than the place” in which she resides. Khambata said if she is unable to travel due to the pandemic, the state team would go and record her statement, but she should be alone. But senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Shukla, said the law permits the presence of her lawyer. The HC said all legal provisions to be followed. Stating that Shukla would “fully cooperate” with the police team, Jethmalani pointed out that her statement was already recorded by the CBI as part of the preliminary enquiry on April 16. The HC had on April 5 directed the PE into former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter to the CM alleging “corrupt malpractices” by then home minister Anil Deshmukh, which was the basis of a complaint filed at Malabar Hill police station by advocate Jaishri Patil. Khambata said there can be no investigation in this matter by the CBI. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for CBI said it was only following HC’s orders. The HC directed both, Shukla and the state to “strictly abide by the statements made by them before the court through their respective senior advocates”. The HC order further said its observations “may not be construed as an impediment for the CBI” to further probe the FIR against Deshmukh. The HC clarified that its observations “are restricted” to Shukla’s petition and would have no bearing on the various quashing petitions filed by Singh, Deshmukh and the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-will-send-cops-to-hyd-not-arrest-shukla-till-next-hc-date/articleshow/82445209.cms||---

The high court also asked the chief secretary to give details on the availability of oxygen, medicines for Covid-19 treatment, hospitalizations, disposal of PPE kits, vaccination drive along with Covid deaths and cremation process. It also sought a response on deaths reported due to lack of oxygen.

The matter has been posted for further hearing on Friday. Till Tuesday, the matter was heard by the division bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah who had made scathing remarks against the state government for its failure to control the pandemic. During the hearing, the state government submitted that it could procure only 154 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen on Wednesday against the increased daily quota of 214 metric tonnes. The state government also pressed its demand for 300 metric tonnes of oxygen daily from the Centre. Appearing for the state, Supreme Court counsel Vikash Singh submitted that they don’t have enough cryogenic tankers for procuring liquid oxygen and assistance from the Centre on this matter. Following this, the bench asked the Centre to respond by when it would make available cryogenic oxygen tankers to the state. The state government at present has six cryogenic tankers and the Centre is scheduled to provide seven more. Of the seven, four will come from Jharkhand and three more would be provided by the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). The bench directed the Centre’s additional solicitor general KN Singh to apprise it by Friday about the status of all seven cryogenic oxygen tankers. The bench orally observed that it was not for governing the state but to see the governance. “Let us save the lives of the people first and crooks would be taken care of later on,” the bench orally observed. The high court also directed the three-member technical team headed by AIIMS-Patna anaesthesia department head, Dr Umesh Kumar, Bhadani to file its report on the situation as per earlier direction.

---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh high court interim order gives boost to anti-corruption probes||HYDERABAD: An interim order given by the AP high court last week to the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) in the Sangam Dairy case to unravel the truth behind Guntur Dairy’s conversion from a cooperative entity to a mutually cooperative entity and finally into a private company of its former chairman Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar may give a fillip to anti-corruption probes. Experts said the interim order gives strength to investigation agencies as it made it clear that a change in the law need not necessarily be read as an impediment to the investigators. AP advocate general S Sriram said the Prevention of Corruption Act’s (PCA) repealed provisions can be applied for carrying out an investigation. “Repeal of the law does not negate the offence,” he contended. Senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao, who appeared for Narendra Kumar, however, argued that the ACB had no powers to investigate in 2018 an ‘old crime’ that took place prior to the amendment of the PCA, 1988. The ACB had booked the case against the accused under provisions like 13(1)(c) and 13(I)(d) which had been repealed without any saving clauses, he said. Rao said the alleged crime was not investigated when it was committed or at least during the time the law was in force. “Now, the law has been repealed and hence the probe agency has lost the power under this section to inquire into the issue,” the senior counsel contended. Sriram argued that the general clauses Act allows investigation to be initiated even after the repeal of the law. “As long as the ingredients required for making out a case are there, a probe into a case of huge public importance cannot be stopped under the guise of technicalities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/andhra-hc-interim-order-gives-boost-to-anti-corruption-probes/articleshow/82443071.cms||---

The IAS officers’ committee headed by panchayat raj secretary Raghunandan Rao completed its field visit and is expected to submit its report on Friday. The committee found the sheds raised by Eatala’s firm Jamuna Hatcheries. Jamuna, wife of the former minister, however, did not take permission from the civic authorities and leased them out to private parties, the committee found out. Committee members were reportedly of the opinion that the sheds could be brought down immediately without issuing any notice as the new Municipality Act and Panchayat Raj act empowers the authorities to remove illegal structures without serving a notice. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-200-unauthorised-constructions-identified/articleshow/82443029.cms||---

During a meeting called by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a few traders associations also decided to go for a voluntary lockdown for the next week. However, a few others want the government to make a formal announcement for strict implementation. CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said the people were suffering due to lack of medical facilities. “The gravity of the situation can be easily gauged from the fact that since the past 15 days, Delhi High Court has been daily hearing the issue of oxygen shortage. The traders at the meeting had a unanimous opinion that the Covid situation in Delhi has gone out of control, so they should continue to keep their markets closed,” said Khandelwal. Some traders alleged that despite the lockdown, some people were opening their godowns/shops to supply goods to retailers, and demanded strict implementation of the restrictions to break the Covid chain. Rakesh Yadav, president of Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, said a decision should be taken by the Centre and Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-want-lockdown-till-may-17/articleshow/82443069.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Supreme Court moved over Shrey fire inquiry||AHMEDABAD: Relatives of the victims of the Shrey Hospital fire have moved the Supreme Court after the Gujarat high court permitted the Justice (retd) D A Mehta inquiry commission to submit its report on the two fires at Covid-19 hospitals. The inquiry commission submitted its report after the division bench lifted a stay granted by a single judge on submission of the report. The stay was ordered in response to the petition filed by Kalpit Shah and others seeking certain reliefs including permission to visit the Shrey Hospital ICU with a photographer and their demand for documents placed before the inquiry commission by other parties. They made this demand to the inquiry commission in February after the commission sought to record their evidence. The commission refused their request and this resulted in litigation. As the single judge stayed the inquiry commission from submitting its report to the government, the state government challenged the stay order before a division bench and cited urgency in submission of the report. As fire killed 18 persons at a Covid hospital in Bharuch, a PIL has now demanded the inquiry report be made public immediately so the government may benefit from suggestions made by the commission and prevent a similar tragedy in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sc-moved-over-shrey-fire-inquiry/articleshow/82441288.cms||---

Housing minister Jitendra Awhad recently met builders and developers and urged them to vaccinate workers and tenants of their ongoing Mhada and SRA projects. “I have made an appeal to Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (MCHI) and Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) all developers in SRA and Mhada to get the vaccination done as a social duty. Already, many developers have agreed,” Awhad said. SRA estimates have it that the city has 12.50 lakh slums with 62 lakh residents. Rajesh Jain of Numec Group, which has SRA projects in the city, said builders would come forward. “But there should be guidelines and we will need support of corporators. We are taking an initiative to vaccinate workers,” he said. “Credai-MCHI, through its 1800-plus developers, will manage free vaccination for over 2 lakh workers.

Many among the village’s population of 3,100 daily visit Amreli for employment purpose or purchase of essential commodities that are not available at Nana Ankadiya. Despite the proximity and dependence on Amreli town, the second wave of Covid-19 hasn’t created the kind of havoc at Nana Ankadiya like it has at other parts of the state. Only 20 from the village have tested positive for the coronavirus in the second wave and none of them needed to be hospitalized. The secret behind the village’s resistance against the deadly virus is high percentage of vaccination. “The credit for less infection goes to maximum vaccination. Almost 85% villagers above the age of 45 have been vaccinated,” informs Prant officer C K Unghad. Nana Akadiya village has witnessed just two deaths in last three months, both of them because of ailments related to old age. “The village has zero-casualty due to Covid. The village crematorium is used to cremate Covid bodies from Amreli city. A team of villagers also collect woods for this purpose,” Unghad added. Despite the low Covid numbers the village is not letting the guard down. The village has 10-bed Covid Community Centre for those who need isolation. There is no charge for admission at this centre and food is also provided by the village panchayat. Damji Javiya, the sarpanch of the village said, “We are observing people’s health in consultation with the health department staff. They do home-to-home surveillance and prescribe medicines. We ensure that people get tested at the initial stage and suspect patients are isolated early.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/high-vaccination-low-cases-this-village-shows-how-to-control-ncov/articleshow/82439898.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Crematoriums in Bopal, Ambli turning bodies away||AHMEDABAD: An advocate practising in the Gujarat high court, Kaivan Patel, had to bring his relative’s body to the Thaltej crematorium from Bopal after a crematorium in Bopal refused to allow her cremation. When Patel and his family members inquired at the Ambli village crematorium, they were forwarded a message doing the rounds on social media. The message was in the name of one Khodiyar Yuvak Mandal and was addressed to residents of Ambli village telling them that in this Covid-19 situation, nobody except a resident of Ambli village will be allowed cremation in the village crematorium. It also asked Ambli villagers to communicate this to residents of housing societies around the village, and that no cremation of a person who had died of Covid-19 would be permitted. This message was enough for Patel to ask the hearse van driver to take the body to Thaltej crematorium, where he had to wait in a queue to cremate the 90-year-old grandmother of his wife. “She died a natural death and there was nobody from the family who could help because most of the members are quarantined. We inquired with Bopal crematorium but got a refusal. And then we received such messages from Ambli,” the lawyer said and added that he decided to take up the issue in the high court. DySP Ahmedabad rural, K T Kamaria, said police have not yet received any complaint in this regard. But he said, “Earlier too when there was no Covid-19 pandemic, these villagers did not allow others to cremate bodies at their crematoriums.” Officials at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) said though these areas now fall under the civic body’s jurisdiction, operation and management of the crematoriums at Bopal and Ambli have not been taken over yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/crematoriums-in-bopal-ambli-turning-bodies-away/articleshow/82441294.cms||---

This was revealed after crime branch got custody of the prime accused, Vivek Maheshwari, 34, a resident of Siddharth Vatika on Sama-Savli Road in Vadodara, from Vadodara police on Thursday. He runs a medical store in Anand. Ahmedabad city crime branch has got Maheshwari’s custody till May 8. During his interrogation, he revealed that the other accused, Dishant and Nitesh Joshi, conspired with him to sell spurious remdesivir injections at exorbitant rates to make quick money. “During his interrogation, he told the cops that Nitesh Joshi had found antibiotics which could be used for lungs infections or for other respiratory issues on a website named Indiamart and procured antibiotics from it,” said a crime branch officer. The officer said the accused pasted labels of HETERO and Jubi-R on the vials and began selling them as remdesivir. The racket was busted on April 29, by when the accused had been selling the spurious injections for 10 days and had sold 350 spurious injections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/accused-bought-antibiotics-online/articleshow/82441272.cms||---
---||Delhi||Working on how to make O2 distribution transparent: IIT-Delhi||NEW DELHI: Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi is looking to assist Delhi government by streamlining their portal for oxygen distribution to hospitals and people in home isolation. On Wednesday, Delhi High Court had told the government to consider taking the help from IIT-D and DTU. The high court had directed the government to ask the two institutes to prepare a blueprint for the supply and distribution infrastructure of liquid medical oxygen and oxygen cylinders to the national capital, TOI had reported. “The estimations should be prepared on the basis of the plans that are worked out by the consultants/experts in consultation with other wings of the GNCTD, such as DGHS and the various hospitals and nursing homes,” said justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli. Sanjay Dhir, associate professor for strategic management in the department of management studies said the institute had already begun discussions on this. “On Thursday morning, director V Ramgopal Rao connected me to the secretary of the government, who is looking for IT solutions for the management of the oxygen supplies,” he said. Dhir said that the institute even gave a demonstration to the high court on Thursday. “We have been working on the Co-Win portal and the government’s Remdesivir distribution portal, which is created to curb the black marketing of the injections. IIT-D showed a flow chart and technical expertise on how to involve stake-holders and make the system transparent,” he said. The institute can help Delhi government in deciding how to distribute oxygen, what would be the checkpoints and how to track it, said the associate professor. As there is no time to create new technology for this, IIT-D said it will try to ensure the tech currently used by Delhi government is being fully utilised. “We will make the tracking system robust, so that everyone knows where the oxygen is. We are still in the midst of the peak of the second wave, so it is necessary to streamline the processes,” Dhir added. Earlier, IIT-Delhi had distributed oxygen cylinders from their laboratories to the Delhi government. Director Rao, who had also contracted Covid, on his recovery tweeted that the institute was handing over “many cylinders to local administration” and will be giving more. The high court has also asked Delhi government to approach DTU for assistance. Yogesh Singh, DTU vice-chancellor told TOI that the institute has not communicated with the government yet. “We have a number of supply-chain experts who can help the government with the distribution of resources,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/working-on-how-to-make-o2-distribution-transparent-iit-d/articleshow/82443116.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: In a first, Warangal, Khammam to have women mayors||HYDERABAD: In a first perhaps, all the major municipal corporations in the state will have women mayors. Following Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC) and Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) will also get woman mayors. Apart from these two corporations, four municipalities will have women chairpersons. Elections to the mayoral and chairperson posts will be held on Friday. The KMC mayoral post is reserved for general women, while it is reserved for BC general in GWMC. The TRS has reportedly assured mayor post to former MP and TRS mahila wing president Gundu Sudha Rani in GWMC though it is reserved for BC general candidate. Party sources said generally a leader who had already been an MP won’t contest as a corporator in the civic elections. But in Sudha Rani’s case, the party leadership had assured her of the mayoral post and fielded her as a corporator from division 29 in the GWMC elections. Though half a dozen people are trying to secure the coveted post, the party is most likely to prefer Sudha Rani in Friday’s election. In Khammam, minister Puvvada Ajya Kumar tried to field his wife in the elections with an eye on the mayor post. His wife Vasantha Laxmi filed her nomination but withdrew it later following the directions of the party leadership. More than half a dozen corporators are trying for the post. Meanwhile, the TRS leadership has handed over names of the mayoral and deputy mayor candidates’ names to the party observers, which will be opened on Friday morning asking the corporators and councillors to obey the party’s decision. The party has also decided to issue whip to corporators though there is no chance for opposition parties to secure mayor and chairperson posts. The TRS appointed ministers A Indrakaran Reddy and Gangula Kamalakar for GWMC mayoral polls, minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy and party general secretary N Naresh Reddy to Khammam, minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav to Kothur, party general secretary T Ravinder Rao to Nakrekal, former Karimnagar mayor Ravinder Singh and forest development corporation chairman V Pratap Reddy to Siddipet, minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy to Atchampet and civil supplies corporation chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy to Jadcherla for ensuring smooth election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-1st-warangal-khammam-to-have-women-mayors/articleshow/82443098.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Delhi||Panel for a fresh round of parole to decongest jails||New Delhi: A meeting of Delhi High Court’s high-powered committee headed by justice Vipin Sanghi and other senior officers over de-congestion of Delhi prisons has revealed that as on May 3, 2021, there were 319 Covid-positive inmates, of whom 65 recovered, five died and 249 were active cases; whereas 135 staffers were positive, of whom eight recovered. Also, in February 2021, a total of 5,124 inmates were released on bail and parole from the prisons to reduce risk of infection spread and maintain social distancing norms. It also came on record that so far more than 85% of the jail staff have been vaccinated, besides 564 inmates being inoculated. The committee also observed that currently India in general and Delhi in particular were “engulfed” by the second wave of Covid-19, which according to medical experts was more virulent and fatal in comparison to last year’s strain. “In a matter of a few weeks, this wave has left everyone gasping for air. It has led everyone to struggle to breathe or with asphyxia, which is the most terrifying human experience,” the committee said. Justice Sanghi suggested that as the new variant of Covid-19 was more virulent, the jail staff as well as inmates be directed and provided with double masks – one surgical mask and a cloth mask. Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel assured to provide these masks to the jail staff and inmates. Considering that the present situation had taken a “360 degree turn”, the committee deliberated upon the urgent need to take steps to prevent the outbreak inside jails. Therefore, it was highlighted that it was essential to identify and determine the categories of prisoners who could once again be released on interim bail or parole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-for-a-fresh-round-of-parole-to-decongest-jails/articleshow/82443205.cms||Aamir Khan

According to officials, the buffalo fell into the well around 11pm on May 5. “A villager noticed the buffalo struggling in the well on early Thursday morning and informed the sarpanch, who reached out to us. We suspect the wild animal must have accidentally fallen into the well as there was no light around, and the well has no compound wall or fence,” said Prakash, deputy forest range officer, Sirpur. He said that since the water level was low, the animal could survive the night. Around 7am, forest officials reached the spot with an earthmover. “We pulled it out and guided it towards the forest, helping it cross the river,” said Prakash. Officials suspect that a herd of Indian gaur may have crossed the Maharashtra border in search of food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indian-gaur-rescued-from-well/articleshow/82443107.cms||---

---||Goa||Forced to do jugaad, sharing one O2 port with 3 patients: GMC docs||PANAJI: Supply is yet to meet the rising demand for oxygen at Goa Medical College. Critical Covid patients, lucky enough to get a bed and be connected to centralised oxygen via ports, struggle to breathe during pressure fluctuations, while those connected to cylinders must source it from outside when refills don’t come in time. A relative told TOI that oxygen pressure to his relative’s NIV would drop every morning between 4 am and 8 am. Doctors at the hospital said that they have no option, but to allow relatives to arrange for their own oxygen cylinders. “It has come to this stage where no matter what tell the administration we are not getting sufficient supply. The government has been depending on one supplier all these years for reasons best known to it. If a patient requires a cylinder and arranges for it, and if I cannot provide it myself, why should I say no? I want to keep my patient alive,” the doctor said, adding “We are not making money out of this. We are not even getting our salary on time.” Another doctor working in a Covid ward said oxygen is being rationed. “Basically, we are doing juggad and sharing one oxygen port with as many as three patients. It’s not supposed to be this way, but we have no option. This way nobody gets enough oxygen, but everybody gets something. Oxygen is more important than money,” the doctor told TOI. After the hue and cry, oxygen concentrators were installed in many Covid wards on Thursday delivering up to five litres per minute. “It's something better than nothing and only requires electricity. It won’t be useful for the really bad patients, but is ok for those with very low oxygen requirements. It’s less advanced, but useful when nothing else is available and welcome all the same,” a doctor said. Doctors at GMC told TOI that the infrastructure is old and wasn’t upgraded after the first wave and central oxygen pressure drops at times contributing to untimely deaths. The administration does not have to deal with angry relatives, one doctor said. “We are the ones seeing so many die due to lack of oxygen.” “It’s easy to know when oxygen pressure drops. All the non-invasive ventilators (NIVs) monitors start showing an error ‘O2 regulation’ and a red light begins to blink, indicating that the central supply is very low. We scramble to call the oxygen supplier and tell them to get the oxygen as soon as possible as we see oxygen saturation of patients on NIV dropping. Relatives have gotten used to identifying this as they see the patients beginning to feel uneasy, and are getting their own cylinders as backups,” another doctor told TOI. A healthcare worker at GMC said that the scene was different during the last wave when the variant was much milder and when most patients’ oxygen levels could be maintained on room air without external oxygen. “Today practically everybody coming to GMC is extremely bad with severe pneumonia and almost all are reaching the CCRR breathless, requiring oxygen. They come with their lungs badly damaged with bad CT scores of 20+/ 25.” As a result the healthcare worker said that it takes longer to treat patients. “Few people are lucky enough to be on NIVs. The rest of the people are just as bad, but will not get machines unless someone on a NIV dies. Last year, patients were recovering within five to seven days and going home. This time patients require NIV in the initial stages itself, which is a bad prognostic factor and will require that much longer to recover and will continue using NIV until then,” the healthcare worker said. Increasing the number of NIVs in the hospital is of no use as the infrastructure cannot deliver the required amount of piped oxygen with the strain of so many machines, the health worker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forced-to-do-jugaad-sharing-one-o2-port-with-3-patients-gmc-docs/articleshow/82445290.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Phagwara SP Sarabjit Singh Bahia said the clip reached them on Wednesday and they registered the case. The FIR mentions that from the media clip it emerged that several people gathered at the marriage function. The Punjab government has restricted number to 10 for marriage functions and this restriction was in place when Sugandha’s marriage was held. She hails from Jalandhar and the resort where the marriage function was held is located on the Phagwara-Jalandhar stretch of the national highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/singer-sugandha-husband-booked-for-violating-curbs/articleshow/82443110.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 100 workers fix water line in just 6 hours||KOLKATA: Water supply from Garden Reach Waterworks resumed ahead of the schedule on Thursday evening, with the engineering and maintenance team from Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s water supply department completing the work in double quick time despite being able to deploy only one-third of the workforce due to Covid restrictions. “We had initially decided to go for a shutdown till dawn on Friday. But given the hot weather and difficulties that people face without water, we worked on a tight schedule and completed it by evening. Supply was resumed at 4.45 pm,” a KMC water supply department official said on Thursday. Water supply had been suspended at 10am. However, it was an uphill task for the civic body to complete the work amid the pandemic where the civic engineers had to keep in mind the Covid-protocols while engaging mechanics and labourers for the repair and maintenance work conceded the civic official. What should have been a routine shutdown turned into a major challenge for the civic body as it undertook the work and completed it on time with 100 workers instead of 300, who would have otherwise deployed. Besides repairing leakages in major pipelines at Garden Reach Waterworks and routine maintenance of valves and electrical installations, the KMC also undertook installation of pipes and valves at the waterworks. Pre-summer maintenance work was also undertaken at several water booster pumping stations in Kalighat, Chetla, Behala, Daspara, Siriti, Garfa, Bansdroni, Ranikuthi and Layelka. The preventive maintenance work will help ensure uninterrupted supply during the summer months to entire Behala, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Garia, Chetla, Kalighat, Rashbehari, Kasba, Garfa, Dhakuria, Golf Green, and some areas located adjacent to EM Bypass. The last time KMC water supply department had taken up such a major repair work was at Garden Reach Waterworks in January. “We are trying to go for a comprehensive repair process keeping in mind heavy demand for potable water during peak of summer,” said a KMC senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/100-workers-fix-water-line-in-just-6-hours/articleshow/82441362.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Nagpur||Govt projects drop to 41k active cases, 3,208 surplus beds in dist by May 16||Nagpur: Considering the declining trend in Covid-19 positive cases over last one week, the state government has projected active positive cases in the district will drop from existing 64,597 to 40,919, leaving 3,208 surplus beds in hospitals by May 16. As per government data, weekly growth rate and test positivity rate (TPR) of the district are also on decline. All these parameters indicate April was the peak of second wave and cases will continue to drop further in May. It is probably for the first time the government has given projection of decline in cases and surplus beds in the district. In its latest projection sent to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district administration a day ago, the government said the district will have 1,353 surplus beds with oxygen supply, 1,496 in ICU and 359 beds with ventilators for a total of 3,208 surplus beds in hospitals as per projections for May 16. The government has also projected deficit of 6,871 beds in Covid Care Centres (CCC) whereas scenario in the district is totally different. Less than 1% of total active positive patients are in CCCs since the beginning of second wave, and many CCCs are yet to be brought into use citing patients preferring home isolation. Around 80% patients are in home isolation. On April 21, the government had projected steep rise in active cases to 1,23,680 by May 2. In reality, there were 74,127 active cases on May 2 as district started to see decline in cases from April 30. With decline in weekly growth rate and TPR to some extent, the government revised projection of active cases to 1,13,093 by May 11. The district witnessed consistent decline in cases from April 30 to May 4. From 7,496 cases on April 29, cases came down to 4,182 on May 4. The cases slightly increased to 4,399 on May 5 and 4,900 on May 6. With reduction in active cases, government and private hospitals have started to see vacant beds after more than a month. In the evening on Thursday, 1,225 beds were vacant, 1,112 with oxygen supply, 112 in ICU and one with ventilator. As per state data, weekly growth rate of the district was 1.54 as on May 4 whereas it was 2.03 on April 27 and 2.24 on April 19. Similarly, weekly TPR of the district is also on decline. Weekly TPR was 35.02% on April 19 and dropped to 32.65% on April 27 and further to 29.03% on May 4. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “There is all possibility of steep fall in number of cases in next two weeks in the district. I used to get over 90 patients in OPD on daily basis, of which around 20 required admission. For last couple of days, I am seeing only 40 patients in OPD, of which just two need hospitalization.” As per state’s projection, active cases will also come down in Yavatmal from 6,786 on Thursday to 3,173 by May 16, Bhandara 8,571 to 6,209 and Chandrapur 26,842 to 26,124 in Vidarbha.

---||Pune||Collector says 25 PSA plants in district to come by May-end||Pune: Collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Thursday said the district would get 25 pressure swing adsorption medical oxygen plants by the end of May. “These PSA plants will come up in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic limits and also the rural areas. These should ease oxygen supply in the district,” he told TOI. The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a technology used to separate gas species from a mixture of gases under pressure. On Thursday, the collector conducted a detailed oxygen audit meeting and directed all major health hubs to judiciously follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) on using the gas essential for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “The district administration has checked the use of oxygen in three major hospitals and could curtail the consumption of the gas by 48% in 10 days,” Deshmukh said. “We had told the health hubs — the jumbo units in the PCMC limits and Auto Cluster — to follow the SOPs as issued by the Centre,” he added. The district gets about 315 tonnes of oxygen from five units, four from Pune and one from Thane. However, the actual requirement is 331 tonnes. “The additional supplies have been drawn from the existing units and 10 tonnes have been procured from Jamnagar by road,” Deshmukh said, adding that around 85 doctors were on Thursday trained on the SOPs to be followed for using oxygen judiciously. Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope in a statement said he would raise with the Centre its decision to reduce 50 tonnes of oxygen supply to Maharashtra. “If the Centre does not provide oxygen, the state will face a serious shortage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/collector-says-25-psa-plants-in-district-to-come-by-may-end/articleshow/82443184.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The FIR was later transferred to Bazaar Peth police station in Kalyan.The vacation bench will preside from next week.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: City police reserve Goregaon hotel for +ve cops with mild symptoms||Mumbai: Policemen with mild symptoms of Covid-19 need not worry about finding a place to isolate themselves any longer. The department has reserved all rooms of a hotel in a western suburb to accommodate such personnel, so that their families do not risk catching the infection. A senior IPS officer said, “Those suffering from mild symptoms or those who are asymptomatic are required to be home quarantined. But a majority of the constabulary lives in cramped quarters and has no separate room for isolation. They are constantly worried about passing the infection to their spouse or parents.” When these personnel were advised to get admitted to Covid care centres, they showed reluctance. The reason was they feared staying in the midst of critical patients. The force, too, has a Covid care centre in Santacruz for symptomatic and seriously ill cops. The department then hit upon the idea of having an isolation centre reserved only for policemen. They approached household appliance manufacturer Cello and an NGO to get a sponsorship. “All 89 rooms of The Fern, Goregaon, have been reserved for three months. Each room has double occupancy. If a spouse or a child of a policeman has tested positive with him, they can join him at the isolation centre and keep the rest of the family safe at home,” said Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner (north region). The BMC has agreed to allocate six doctors, working in shifts, to monitor those isolating. “In home quarantine, there is nobody to check the oxygen level and other parameters of an isolated policeman. In case his health condition deteriorates, his family would have to run helter skelter to get him hospitalised. This can be avoided if he is isolating at the hotel and is being monitored by doctors,” said Sawant. Even personnel with comorbidities like diabetes or blood pressure can be monitored regularly at the centre. Medicines and immunity boosters will be provided at no cost, besides nutritious breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel started operating as an isolation centre on Wednesday and within 24 hours, four personnel checked in. The centre is open for officers as well as constables across ranks, police stations and branches. The Mumbai police force has lost 110 offiers and staff since the outbreak began in March last year. Overall, more than 8,600 personnel have tested positive since the pandemic started. Currently, about 384 personnel are positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-police-reserve-goregaon-hotel-for-ve-cops-with-mild-symptoms/articleshow/82441468.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Goa||Sheikh Hassan Haroon, Goa’s first Muslim minister, passes away at 84||Panaji: Former speaker of the Goa Legislative Assembly and five-time Mormugao MLA, Sheikh Hassan Haroon passed away on Thursday at his residence in Caranzalem after a lengthy battle with diabetes. The first Muslim minister of Goa, Haroon played a key role in the establishment of the Bombay high court in Panaji and setting up of the industrial estates at Verna, Canacona and Cuncolim. He was 84 when he passed away, said his family members. Goa police accorded him a traditional salute when his final rites were conducted at St Inez. BJP as well as the opposition paid tributes to him and to his family. “Saddened to hear about the demise of Sheikh Hassan Haroon. My condolences to his family,” minister of state for defence Shripad Naik said. Though he served as a Congress MLA in the Goa Legislative Assembly from 1977 to 1994 and from 1999 to 2002, he switched over to BJP after leading a breakaway group of five Congress MLAs to merge with BJP. “Deeply pained by the passing away of Sheikh Hassan Haroon. He lived a simple life and contributed for the betterment of Goa. My condolences to his family,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat said. Haroon served as the industry minister from 1999 to 2002, speaker from 1991 to 1995 and as law and revenue minister from 1980 to 1989. After leaving the Indian National Congress, he floated his own political party called Indian National Congress (Sheikh Hassan) on August 17, 2002. Later, this party merged with BJP. “Deeply saddened by the sad news of demise of former minister and speaker Sheikh Hassan Haroon. For five terms he represented Mormugao constituency in Goa Assembly. My condolences to his family members and admirers,” former South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar said. In the 2002 state elections, Hassan stood as a BJP candidate, but lost. In the aftermath of the anti-Muslim communal riots in Curchorem, Hassan moved away from BJP. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he lent his support to South Goa Congress candidate Francisco Sardinha. “Saddened to hear the sad news of the passing away of Haroon, the former Goa speaker and minister. He will be remembered for his contribution to the growth of Goa. The Congress party extend our deepest sympathies to his son Arif and family. May he rest in everlasting peace,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sheikh-hassan-haroon-goas-first-muslim-minister-passes-away-at-84/articleshow/82443308.cms||---

On May 15, the batch is likely to be handed over to Hetero Labs,” said Mahendra Kshirsagar, owner and managing director of Genetek. US-based Gilead Sciences, which holds the patent for the anti-viral drug, had granted licence to seven pharmaceutical companies in India, including Hetero Labs Limited, to produce the drug. Genetek had procured loan licenses from Hetero for five years to manufacture the drug. “We would be able to produce 25,000 vials daily for seven days,” said Kshirsagar. Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari on Thursday visited Genetek. Gadkari has been instrumental in starting Remdesivir production in Vidarbha. Underlining the significance of producing the anti-viral drug here, Gadkari said it was challenging to get approvals from the department concerned as the drug is patented. “We had to seek a way out as Remdesivir shortage was leading to many complications, including Covid deaths,” he said. Kshirsagar said following the two-day ingredient testing, Genetek labs’ team of 25 scientists managed to complete filling of the first batch. In yet another development, vials meant for testing of the ‘Form fill seal’ (FFS) technology, in which medical-grade plastic would be used as vials, too were prepared. They would be put through separate suitability and stability testing. FFS testing would take place for one-and-half month following which approval would be sought. “We would be able to produce 2.5 lakhs vials of Remdesivir in plastic vials but the quantity would depend on availability of raw material and intermediates which need to be brought from foreign countries,” said Kshirsagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wardha-lab-prepares-first-batch-of-25000-rem-vials/articleshow/82443264.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The present curfew ends at 6am on May 12. Health minister K Sudhakar said, “I needn’t say how this ‘janata curfew’ has been ineffective with congregations continuing. The trend is not limited to Bengaluru; districts, too, have failed to see its strict implementation. The result is not to our expectation,” he told reporters. Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who heads Covid-19 task force, admitted that the situation “is, of course, grim, but it (announcing a complete lockdown) would be the chief minister’s call”. Sources said the chief minister was taking inputs from all stakeholders. Cannot leave citizens of Karnataka in lurch says SC, refuses to interfere with HC orderThe Supreme Court Friday said it will not leave Karnataka citizens in lurch as it refused to interfere with the Karnataka High Court order asking the Centre to increase the daily oxygen allocation for the state from 965 MT to 1200 MT for treating Covid-19 patients. A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the high court order of May 5 is a well calibrated, deliberated and judicious exercise of power". It refused to accept the Centre's contention that if every high court starts passing orders for allocating oxygen, it would make the supply network of the country "unworkable". The bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre, that it has read the sequence of events and it can say that it is "well calibrated, deliberated and judicious exercise of power after taking into account the number of COVID-19 positive cases.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt says curfew ineffective, lockdown call on May 10||BENGALURU: Halfway down the two-week curfew, Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar on Thursday admitted that it has not had desired effect in stopping the surge of Covid-19 cases amid strong indications that the Karnataka government may opt for a full-scale two-week lockdown at a crucial meeting on May 10.

---||Delhi||6 cases of Covid-induced ‘black fungus’ reported||New Delhi: Doctors at a leading private facility here are seeing a rise in the number of Covid-triggered mucormycisis cases, according to a statement from the hospital. Mucormycisis is a fungal infection triggered by Covid-19. Black fungus or mucormycosis has been a cause of disease and death of patients in transplants, ICUs and immunodeficient patients since long. According to Dr Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, “We are seeing a rise again in this dangerous fungal infection triggered by Covid-19. In the last two days, we have admitted six cases of mucormycisis. Last year, this deadly infection caused a high mortality with many patients suffering from the loss of eyesight and the removal of the nose and the jaw bone.” Dr Ajay Swaroop, the chairman of the ENT department at the hospital, said the use of steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 coupled with the fact that many coronavirus patients have diabetes could be one of the reasons for this rise in the number of black fungus cases again. He said the infection is commonly seen in patients who have recovered from Covid-19 but have comorbidities such as diabetes, kidney or heart failure or cancer.

Local businesses backed the lockdown by downing shutters to help the area break the chain of the spread of the virus. From Wednesday, Chicalim and Chicolna-Bogmalo panchayats imposed an eight-day lockdown, while Sancoale panchayat had a seven-day lockdown. The Velsao-Pale-Issorchim panchayat has also called for an 11-day lockdown. Besides this, four wards of the Mormugao municipal council from ward numbers 21 to 24 of the Dabolim constituency are observing a lockdown for a week after their newly-elected councillors submitted a memorandum to the Mormugao deputy collector informing him of the plans. Essential services were open from 6am to 11am and remained closed for the rest of the day. Social distancing was also being strictly followed while purchasing essential supplies from stores. Though restaurants were open for takeaways, roadside carts selling food items were not allowed to operate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/majority-of-mormugao-remains-shut/articleshow/82445415.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai to get six more drive-in vaccination centres for 60+ citizens||MUMBAI: Following the success of its first drive-in vaccination centre within a civic parking lot in Dadar, the BMC has decided to set up one such facility for citizens above 60 years of age in the other six administrative zones too within 24 hours. BMC commissioner I S Chahal, in his order issued on Thursday, listed a few options where such a drive-in vaccination facility could be created, including Andheri Sports Complex, Cooperage ground, Oval Maidan, MIG grounds, MCA grounds, Wankhede stadium, and Ghatkopar police grounds. According to the directive, citizens aged above 60 can get their Covishield doses at the new facilities by appointment only. The beneficiary to be vaccinated should not drive to the centre; he/she should be accompanied by an attendant or a driver to deal with adverse events following immunization, if any. Following positive reviews from people who got vaccinated at the Dadar drive-in centre, there was a demand for similar facilities across the city. Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha said he has written to the civic body demanding a drive-in vaccination centre on Kalidas auditorium premises in his constituency. “The auditorium has adequate space to accommodate those coming in vehicles to take the jab with separate entry and exit gates. Mulund has almost 60,000 senior citizens, and even if 25,000 of them may have already taken the jab, there are many left to be administered the vaccine. Hence, there is a need for such a facility for those persons who are not very mobile,” he added. On May 4, in a first for the city, the multi-storey Kohinoor parking lot in Dadar was turned into a civic vaccination centre with a drive-in facility where senior citizens and the differently abled were given their jabs while seated in their parked vehicles. After getting their shots, they were made to spend the mandatory 30-minute observation period inside their vehicles as well. Citizens who brought in their vehicles had to pay parking charges—Rs 60 an hour. On day one, 417 persons took the jab while seated in their cars at Kohinoor parking lot. Meanwhile, the BMC has decided to take in only 350 vehicles daily following cars at the Dadar vaccination centre, after cars were found queuing up on the road leading to a traffic jam on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-to-get-six-more-drive-in-vax-centres-for-60-citizens/articleshow/82443350.cms||Richa Pinto

Tiwari said Gadkari, a fellow Vidarbha politician from the BJP, had arranged medicines, ventilators, beds and oxygen for hospitals and he worked hard with dedication. He reminded Modi that NCP chief Sharad Pawar was the first in-charge of the authority for almost 18 years and later the then PM Manmohan Singh headed it.

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Positivity rate continues declining trend in Delhi, at 24%||NEW DELHI: The positivity rate of Covid-19 in Delhi declined for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday.  From 30% on May 3, it dipped to 27% on May 4, 26% on May 5 and 24% on May 6. In April third week, Delhi’s positivity rate—number of positive cases from those tested—had touched 36%, which was among the highest in the country. The numbers of new cases and deaths have also reduced significantly raising hopes of improvement in the outbreak situation. On Thursday, the city recorded 19,133 new cases from 78,780 tests conducted in 24 hours. This is the third time in the last four days that the number of new cases remained below 20,000. Earlier, on May 3 and May 4, the city had recorded 18,043 and 19,953 new cases, respectively. The number of fresh fatalities recorded on Thursday was 335. “There are signs of improvement. But we cannot be complacent yet. A positivity rate of 24% is still very high. We still have a huge rush of patients in hospitals and most of the ICU beds are running full,” said a senior health official. Data shared by the state health department shows there are 90,629 active cases of Covid-19 in Delhi at present. Of them, 50,562 are in home isolation. Around 25,000 patients are admitted in various hospitals. There are a total of 22,057 Covid beds in the city, of which 20,274 are occupied. The total number of ICU beds is 5,569, of which 5,545 are occupied. ICU bed with ventilator support is available in only one hospital in Karo Bagh. “My friend needs an ICU bed urgently. I have been calling on all numbers and helplines. But no hospital is willing to admit. Where are the vacant beds?” Nikhil Kumar, a resident of Malviya Nagar, asked. He added that most of the beds that are available do not even have high flow oxygen and other facilities needed for critical care management. On the brighter side, the recovery rate has picked up. In the last one week, nearly 1.5 lakh people have recovered from the infection. “The lockdown has really helped reduce the spread of the disease. It should continue for a few more days to gain complete control over the disease and expand the health infrastructure to cope up with the patient rush,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/positivity-rate-continues-declining-trend-at-24/articleshow/82443341.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Pune||Thefts of valuables from DCH in Pimpri||Pune: Relatives of two patients, who died during treatment at the 800-bed dedicated covid hospital (DCH) jumbo unit in Pimpri, filed separate FIR’s with the Pimpri Chinchwad police on Wednesday, when they did not get the valuables of the patients back from the facility. Vaishnavi Khule (20) lost her uncle on May 1. “We had given him a smartphone while admitting him so that he could contact us and should not feel lonely. Unfortunately, we lost him. After his death, when we asked for his smartphone, we did not get it back,” she told TOI. Sagar Gujar (35) of Bopkhel lost his mother on April 19 at the same unit. “We had to admit my mother in a hurry, due to which we could not remove her ornaments. After her death, we asked for her gold and silver ornaments back. For the past 15 days, I have been following up at the unit but no one there is cooperating, prompting me to lodge a police complaint,” Gujar told TOI. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash had recently said that he had been receiving complaints about the thefts at the DCH and had assured of stringent action against the suspects. An officer from the Pimpri police said that the police have sought the CCTV footage from the unit. “We are investigating these incidents and those found guilty will not be spared. We strongly discourage patients or their relatives from carrying any mobile or valuables such as ornaments, especially for the patients in the ICU. If this (thefts) has happened in this medical facility, it is really unfortunate,” Sangram Kapale, director, dean, Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thefts-of-valuables-from-dch-in-pimpri/articleshow/82443330.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Nagpur||Officials make web series to push vax, tests in Melghat||Nagpur: In remote Melghat Hills of Amravati, the district administration is now trying its hand on YouTubing to convince the tribal population to get vaccinated and Covid tested. Health officials have been facing a strong resistance to vaccination and testing drives in the tribal pocket.To counter this, administration is coming up with a web series in the local Korku language to dispel the myths. The series has been posted on the YouTube, apart from being widely shared on the WhattsApp.With internet having a decent penetration even in Melghat, once infamous for malnutrition, the web series may help change people’s minds, the officials are hoping. The move was initiated by the sub divisional officer (SDO), Deepali Sethi. It is titled Corona Haritva Melghat Jituva – which translates to Corona loses and Melghat wins. “Corona Chuj Hoy” (what is Corona), starts the health counselor who is interviewing Dr Dayaram Jawarkar from the sub-divisional hospital at Dharni. He replies in the same language. Another episode in the series is planned by this Saturday.In the first video, the basics are explained. Jawarkar tells Covid spreads from one person to another but there is no need to be scared. They can get well if they reach hospital in time. All they have to do is follow the precautions.“Even people of Melghat, especially the young, have smartphones. The video has been spread on WhatsApp groups also. Though it is available on YouTube, not everyone will be watching it directly. Fowarding it will bring the message to their phones,” Jawarkar told TOI. “There are a lot of misconceptions about Covid that need to be cleared. The series needs to be circulated deeper in the villages,” he said.“The results can be already seen. Since last two three days, the locals have started voluntarily reaching the primary health centre (PHC) at our village for a test,” said Mamta Sonkar, the health department’s counsellor, who is seen interviewing the doctor in the video. The locals fear that if they test positive, they may be sent to Amravati, but we are telling them many will only need home isolation.“One out 5 to 6 who turned up was found positive. He has been isolated at home,” she said.“The video is already running at tribal department’s office. It has got over a thousand views in a short time,” said Sethi, the SDO. “There was a strong reluctance among local population to vaccination and testing. It was realized talking to them in their own language may help,” she said.Sethi said in the subsequent videos, success stories may be presented. There would be interviews of people including featuring old people who remain perfectly healthy after vaccination.“Even the local panchayats will be roped in. One of the NGOs has extracted the audio part which is being played on loudspeakers in remote villages,” said Sethi.No positive cases found in testing drive Last month, the district administration had conducted a drive to test close contacts after a number of unexplained deaths were found. The drive continues but most of contacts were found negative.“The rules don’t allow testing of bodies, so we started a drive to test the contacts. Positive cases were not found. The toll has also stabilized with no major incident reported,” said Deepali Sethi, Dharni sub-divsional officer (SDO).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/officials-make-web-series-to-push-vax-tests-in-melghat/articleshow/82443348.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Pune||Still to early to say if weather boosts Covid: Experts||PUNE: The country's leading public health experts have said that it's still too early to say if Covid-19 is seasonal as the virus that causes it is new. There are concerns that Covid may surge during the upcoming monsoon, particularly because of higher humidity levels. But Samiran Panda, head of the ICMR's epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said scientists are yet to determine if there's a clear link between weather and the virus. "So far, only endemic diseases can be connected to seasonal weather changes. Only when Covid-19 reaches an endemic stage, can it be gauged which season causes a spurt in SARS-CoV-2 infections." Panda said a virus takes on pandemic proportions when it efficiently transmits across countries - like the flu pandemic did in 1918. But the flu is no longer a pandemic; it's now endemic, he said. He added, "When an infectious disease affects a large number of people within a country or region, it is called an epidemic. Gradually, it simmers down to less extensive levels, becoming endemic to a community or country. So seasonality usually plays a role when an infectious disease becomes endemic. Covid-19 is yet to achieve that state." Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said, "So far, we have not found a distinguishable link between weather and Covid spread in India. Several countries have seen Covid waves during different seasons. Many infections do have a weather connection, but so far, that connection has not been established in case of the Covid-19 pandemic." Awate, however, said the monsoon does cause a spike in vector-borne and water-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, cholera, influenza, hepatitis, typhoid and may slightly increase the possibility of Covid co-infections. "We have geared up our surveillance system, with specific stress on improving water quality," he said. Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid-19 task force, said, "Temperature and humidity still remain an area of research in case of Covid-19. The northern hemispheric, temperate regional Covid waves in winters and the tropical Indian wave in hotter, humid environments merit scientific scrutiny. That said, we need double preparedness during the upcoming monsoon season as it is a time when monsoon-related infections surge."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/still-to-early-to-say-if-weather-boosts-covid-experts/articleshow/82443376.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Lockdown lowers WR track deaths by more than 50%||MUMBAI: Call it a silver lining to pandemic induced curbs, casualties due to track crossing have reduced by more than half on the Western Railways. Trespassing related deaths reduced from 528 in 2019-20 to 222 in 2020-21. Besides the fact that the volume of passengers has been much lower than pre-Covid times, the completion of infrastructural works on WR has also contributed towards bringing down the number of fatalities. The Goregaon to Dahisar section had the highest deaths for two consecutive years— 169 casualties in 2019-20 and 63 in the past financial year. It was followed by the Mira Road-Vaitarna section. “Stations like Borivali, Nalasopara and Virar are densely packed during peak hours and many travellers take a short-cut by hopping across the tracks. But a key reason for trespassing deaths is the presence of slum colonies adjacent to the tracks,” said GRP senior inspector Bhaskar Pawar, who has headed police chowkies in both these sections. At Dahisar, for instance, shanties have come up inside railway land. There are slum colonies at Kandivali and Goregaon. Residents frequently cross the tracks to go to work or youngsters to travel to college. In the fringes of the city, people use tracks to walk for large distances when there is no permanent road constructed by rural authorities. WR officials said 276 encroachments have been removed from the suburban section and drives will continue. “We roped in civil engineering officials to devise infrastructural solutions to prevent deaths. About 15 kms of boundary wall has been constructed in the suburban section and wherever walls couldn’t come up, strong fencing was put up as a physical barrier to deter trespassing. Gaps in 71 boundary walls were plugged in the past two years,” said Sumit Thakur, WR spokesperson. Gates, manned by private securitymen, were installed at 33 locations where existing boundary walls had to be broken for construction. Platform height was raised at 145 locations to reduce the gap between the door of the rake and the platform. Nearly 14000 people were prosecuted for trespassing in the past two years. “We want to encourage commuters to use FOBs and dissuade them from hopping across tracks and that prompted the installation of dividers between two seats of tracks at all stations. Our mission is to achieve zero deaths on the railways,” said Thakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lockdown-lowers-wr-track-deaths-by-more-than-50/articleshow/82443419.cms||Nitasha Natu

Given the limited number of vaccines available for the 18-44 age group, all 500-odd that are eligible could not be inoculated in a single session. Another session will be organised for the 300 people that are left,” said an Airports Authority of India (AAI) official. A 28-year-old ATCO, who was among the youngest lot to get the jab along with a few 27-year-old new joinees, said he was extremely relieved to now have some sort of protection against the virus. “We have all been working right through the pandemic and are frontline workers. But unlike healthcare staff, policemen, civic workers and even those who were deputed for election duty, we did not get the frontline staff status. The Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild, the umbrella organisation of ATCOs, made the appeal to AAI that organised the session,” the ATCO recounted. Around 700-odd employees and contractual staff of private airlines including ground staff and baggage handlers are yet to be enrolled in the vaccination programme. “All of us have worked through the pandemic and should not be discriminated,” said Kolkata AOC chairman Rahul Wadhwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-drive-at-airport-for-employees-in-18-44-age-group/articleshow/82441471.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The doctors resumed duty in the afternoon after they were assured of consideration of their demands by senior officers of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). The MOs at SMC-run SMIMER are currently getting Rs 60,000 per month salary. These MOs have been working with SMIMER since last one year on contract. As per state government’s recent announcement MOs recruited in government hospitals will get Rs 1.25 lakh salary. “We are demanding that we should get the salary as per government’s salary structure for MOs in government hospitals. Freshers will be getting higher salaries than those who are working since last one year,” said one of the protesting MOs. “We have submitted an application to SMC officials on Wednesday and informed them about our demands in the past as well. But they did not do anything hence we had to go on strike,” said an MO. “We are also not being allowed to apply again and terminating our existing contract. In New Civil Hospital MOs will get Rs 1.25 lakh salary,” he added. “SMC will consider the demand and take necessary steps. But going on strike is not the option and we have asked the doctors to continue working,” said a senior health department official in SMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/medical-officers-went-on-strike-demanding-salary-hike/articleshow/82440067.cms||---

We see many young patients too and this is very disturbing,” a doctor handing Covid patients told TOI. Most who are dying are severe pneumonia cases who have a bad CT score, the doctor said. “Few are getting proper treatment and adequate oxygen support as there are too many patients who are bad,” the doctor added. Another doctor said that while they can handle the pressure, the relatives often cannot cope with it. “They panic as they see their loved ones literally gasping for breath and dying. We see so many deaths continuously. Relatives are not used to it and want to do everything possible to save their loved one. We are doing all we can,” the doctor at the GMC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-docs-suffer-mental-trauma-at-high-death-rate/articleshow/82445476.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||HC on black marketing, hoarding of O2: ‘Moral fabric dismembered’||New Delhi: In the time of crisis, unfortunately everybody is not coming together and that is why there is black marketing and hoarding, Delhi High Court remarked while hearing matters related to Covid-19 resource management in the national capital. Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli further noted, “Otherwise whose conscience would allow hoarding of oxygen? Moral fabric has been dismembered. And we can see the effects of that.” Earlier, an advocate Tarun Chandiok, a Covid-19 survivor who has just recovered, joined the proceedings. “How are you doing?” the bench enquired. Chandiok, who had difficulty in breathing, responded, “I have been advised 10 days of bed rest by doctors.” “Wish you a fast recovery,” the court told him. Chandiok shared his experience of being hospitalised for nine days. “I just got discharged. As far as Remdisivir is concerned, last week the hospital did raise the requisition for us to arrange it privately. Thankfully we have resources, but everyone doesn’t have the wherewithal to pay Rs 30,000-40,000,” he said. After Chandiok reasoned with the hospital, pointing out its responsibility regarding medicines and other resources and ensuring there was no black marketing, an indent was raised. A requisition, he learnt, first goes to the hospital pharmacy and then it raises a request with the dealer on a demand-to-demand basis. “People are running from pillar to post. There are unscrupulous people procuring medicines,” the lawyer claimed. Another issue faced by Chandiok was blood plasma. When plasma was sought, 16 people were arranged, but 15 were rejected. There is also only one centre, The Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, at Vasant Kunj, in the city for plasma, he pointed out. He said citizens had fundamental rights and the state had an obligation to set up more centres. “Everybody can’t rush to Vasant Kunj from different parts of Delhi.” He said those who were hospitalised were in dire need of plasma. “After three months, antibodies are useless. There is information on volunteers circulating on social media. People are asking for Rs 80,000-90,000 to donate plasma,” he said. The lawyer suggested that donating plasma should be made mandatory for every individual who had recovered from Covid-19. “Any defiance should be penal. It is also your responsibility as a citizen. If we don’t stand together in these times, what kind of society are we? Breaching a lockdown can attract penal consequences, then why should a recovered Covid patient refuse to donate plasma?” asked Chandiok. He further pointed out that the city was at war and running out of foot soldiers. Another suggestion, which the court has been insisting upon, is the inclusion of those medical professionals who can offer their services via digital means. “A large section of doctors might not want to go in the field because of age, comorbidities… one has to respect that. Still they can render needful services through teleconferencing,” the court observed. The amicus curiae, senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, underlined that Chandiok was making some important points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-on-black-marketing-hoarding-of-o2-moral-fabric-dismembered/articleshow/82443452.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Goa||Tar balls grab eyeballs on Salcete’s coastal belt again||Colva: Tar balls have surfaced along the beach stretch in Salcete from Colva to Cavelossim. Thick skewed lines of this oily substance are seen deposited on the stretch where the high tide line reaches.  Traditional fishermen say it’s an annual phenomenon. Fishermen claim that as the monsoon approaches, churning of the currents in the sea takes place. The oil released by vessels coagulates with the agitated tidal movement and reaches the coast.  Tar balls are lumps of solidified crude oil found in or on the sea that get washed up on the shore. Experts say that tarball pollution has severe consequences not only on the beauty of the beach, but also marine life like crabs and shrimps.  Sources in the department of tourism informed that they are aware of the tar balls getting deposited in the Salcete coastal area and the cleaning process has already begun. The Salcete coastal stretch consists of villages of Betalbatim, Colva, Benaulim, Varca, Carmona and Cavelossim.  Surfacing of tar balls in the coastline is an undesirable seasonal occurrence every summer, in the weeks preceding the rains.  Tar balls have been spotted on the beaches of Goa for decades. Earlier the incidence was less, but in the past few years there is a marked increase as the gooey substance is being washed ashore in larger quantities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tar-balls-grab-eyeballs-on-salcetes-coastal-belt-again/articleshow/82443414.cms||---

The administration has formed a team to prepare the plan. The team will coordinate with the neighbouring states and assure them that the oxygen provided by them will be replenished from the next supply quota of UT. Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies in UT, said, “UT official Sorabh Kumar Arora and medical officer Dr Manjit Singh will supervise the overall supply, distribution and consumption of medical oxygen in Chandigarh and prepare a back-up plan to handle any crisis.” The order issued by Garg reads, “All the oxygen generators within Chandigarh are directed to cater to the need of health institutions within the city only. Further, they will ensure that industrial cylinders are not accepted for refilling. The cylinders which are prescribed for medical oxygen should only be used. The cylinders should be tested as per the prescribed guidelines / standards to avoid any mishap during the process of refilling and transportation.”  “The refilling of medical oxygen cylinders for each of the private healthcare institution will be decided by PCS Jagjit Singh. To check delay in supply, the requirement of cylinders should be indicated to the oxygen generators / private refilling vendors in advance daily,” the order adds. ‘Mini Covid centres to make their own O2 arrangements’ Considering acute shortage of medical oxygen for patients admitted to government hospitals, the UT in its order said the mini Covid care centres will make their own arrangements for oxygen either through cylinders or oxygen concentrators. “Till proper oxygen arrangements are made, they may cater to only those patients who do not require oxygen,” states the order.  Request to Punjab govt The UT has written to the Punjab government that the remaining medical oxygen quota of the UT be allowed to be filled in cylinders at Ms Jalan Gases, Rajpura, Patiala. In the letter, it has been requested that M/s Chandigarh Gases, Industrial Area, Phase 1, be permitted to get the cylinders refilled at M/s Jalan Gases before transporting them back to the government and private hospitals in Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-prepares-back-up-plan-to-get-o2-from-pb-and-hry/articleshow/82441472.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Nagpur||Vax for 45-plus resumes after 5 days, 12k take jab in city||Nagpur: Hit badly for five days, Covid-19 vaccination of 45-plus age group resumed in city on Thursday after Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) received fresh vaccine stock a day ago. Despite availability of Covaxin doses, two centres at GMCH had to shut twice. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on Thursday wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray asking NMC be allowed to procure vaccine directly from manufacturers. He also urged all legislators of the city to give funds for it. Accordingly, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and MLC Pravin Datke handed over letters committing Rs 1 crore each from legislators’ fund. With 20,000 doses of Covishield received on Wednesday evening, NMC resumed vaccination for 45-plus age group at 87 centres in government-run hospitals and its primary health centres, satellite centres on Thursday. People in large numbers, especially senior citizens, thronged the centres from 9am. But the centres started inoculation only around 12noon when team from centres brought doses from NMC store house. 8,698 people from 45-plus age group took first and second dose. Many centres closed before normal schedule as they exhausted stock allotted to them. Some centres distributed tokens to people for Friday. A few healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW) waiting for second dose of Covishield also happened to complete their vaccination on Thursday. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said vaccination for 45-plus age group will continue on Friday. “Priority will be given for people due for second dose. NMC is not having sufficient doses,” they said. NMC was left with around 10,000 doses of Covishield that will likely be used up on Friday. Vaccination will again take a hit on Saturday in case fresh stock is not received. Vaccination of Covaxin for 45-plus continued normally at NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre. Two centres at GMCH shut down in morning after administering second dose to around 100 people. For the first time since roll out of vaccine, GMCH’s centres were shut for want of doses. Dr Chilkar arranged 300 doses from Mahal Diagnostic Centre for them allowing them to resume inoculation. They were again shut well before closure timing of 10pm as those 300 doses were exhausted. Dr Chilkar said, “NMC requested and got 3,000 doses of Covaxin from Bhandara last week. It helped in uninterrupted vaccination at three centres. We are trying our best to get doses from other districts or government.” NMC received 6,000 doses of Covaxin from the state government on Wednesday. But the doses are meant for only 18-44 years age group. After allowing this age group, the central government had revised guidelines of vaccination. Centre will provide doses for HCW, FLW and 45-plus age group. State will facilitate for 18-44 years age group. Doses provided by Centre cannot be used for 18-44 years and stock of 18-44 years for 45-plus. Hence, the civic body was unable to provide doses to GMCH despite having it with it. The same is likely to continue on Friday. With arrival of 6,000 doses of Covaxin for 18-44 years age group, NMC has increased their centres to six. 1,638 people from this age group took the jab on Thursday. Thus, NMC conducted vaccination at 96 centres on Thursday. None of 45 private hospitals procured vaccine from manufacturers and remained closed for sixth consecutive day. Vaccination increased to 11,906 on Thursday from just 1,688 on Wednesday. On April 30, in all 10,725 had taken the jab. Since then, the number fell down for want of doses. 4,960 got the jab on May 1 followed by 2,408 on May 2. It was 1,741 on May 3 and 1,647 on May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-for-45-plus-resumes-after-5-days-12k-take-jab-in-city/articleshow/82443105.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Aurangabad||School bag, uniform producers turn to body bag biz||Aurangabad: With educational institutions shut since the coronavirus pandemic began, manufacturers of school bags and uniforms in Marathwada have turned their focus to body bags, PPE kits and masks. The exodus of migrant workers from places like Mumbai is benefiting the industry in the region, as local producers have started getting bulk orders from hospitals and NGOs from the bigger cities. Prince Chordiya, a manufacturer of school bags, says he would never have imagined that he would be re-directing his trade to making body bags for Covid victims. He has a unit in Pandharpur on the outskirts of Aurangabad city. Chordiya, who supplies body bags to major hospitals, including GMCH here, told TOI, “We have also got an order of one lakh body bags from an NGO in Mumbai. The orders are coming from metro cities as labourers, fearing complete lockdown, have returned to their home states.” The manufacturers from the region say their body bags are much in demand as their sale price is cheaper due to comparatively less wages being paid here than in metro cities. Several hospitals and NGOs from places like Pune, Nashik and Mumbai prefer placing orders for body bags and PPE kits with them. Manoj Khandelwal, who has a unit in Aurangabad and also outsources work to other parts of Marathwada, says that he has made slight modifications to his unit for manufacturing PPE kits. “We had produced thousands of school uniforms before March 2020 for educational institutions. However, the entire stock could not be sold due to the lockdown and restrictions. We have kept our stock in the godowns and hope that schools start soon. Since April 2020, we started manufacturing PPE kits and body bags,” he said. Khandelwal said that more manufacturers are getting into this new business, which has resulted in stiff competition and slashed profit margins. Smaller set-ups unable to compete with major players have switched over to manufacturing OT gowns and aprons. Abdul Azim Pasha, who is also into school and sports uniform manufacture, says the industry is desperately waiting for resumption of schools. “Due to lack of infrastructure, we cannot meet the demand for PPE kits and body bags in large numbers, so we have started preparing OT gowns and aprons,” he says. Pasha had closed his unit in Mumbai due to a shortage of manpower and started a unit in Aurangabad as workers are available. Pasha said he supplies body bags in smaller numbers only when major players run out of stocks and he is approached by hospitals. Ghansham Pawar, who is into manufacturing uniforms for security guards and industrial workers, says the industries are yet to completely recover from the labour exodus it faced last year. “Due to the lockdown, uniforms are not a priority for many industries. Hence, I have started making face masks and selling them to industrial labourers,” Pawar says. According to rough estimates, there are over 1,000 units across the state manufacturing body bags, PPE kits, OT gowns and masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/school-bag-uniform-producers-turn-to-body-bag-biz/articleshow/82437936.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has initiated a preliminary investigation into the serious incident. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau might take over the investigation, said a source. Early in the evening, the Beechcraft King Air C-90 air ambulance (VT-JIL), operated by Delhi-based Jet Serve Aviation, with two pilots, a doctor, a patient and a relative from Durgapur landed in Nagpur to refuel. The patient was being flown to Mumbai for a lung transplant, said an official from Jet Serve Aviation. “During takeoff from Nagpur airport around 5.50pm, a wheel of the aircraft fell off. A CISF personnel posted on ground saw that and informed the air traffic control. The pilots were informed and they radioed the Mumbai air traffic control asking for an emergency landing,” said a source. A pilot, requesting anonymity, said: “The aircraft has no warning system to alert the pilots about the missing portion of the landing gear. Had the CISF personnel not made that life-saving observation, the aircraft would have had an eventful landing in Mumbai airport and with so much fuel on board it would have turned into a major accident.” By 6pm, the Mumbai airport air traffic control and the local DGCA office were informed about the tyre-less aircraft heading towards the city airport for an emergency landing. Around 8.30pm, even as the pilots circled over Mumbai airport, burning off fuel to lighten the aircraft in preparation for a belly landing; on ground, the runway 27 was sprayed with foam to prevent a fire. “The airport’s emergency response team, including fire and rescue responders, follow-me vehicles, CISF personnel, medical team, ambulance and others were on standby to handle the emergency,” said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. With all the eyes set on it—DGCA officials posted at the Mumbai air traffic control, Mumbai airport emergency response team, officials from the charter industry among others-—the aircraft landed safely around 9.10am on its ‘belly’, that is it landed on the underside of the fuselage and came to a halt within the runway. “All passengers were evacuated safely. Flights operating in/out of Mumbai airport were not affected,” said the MIAL spokesperson. A source from the charter industry said the flight was commanded by Capt Kesri Singh, a highly experienced pilot. An official from Jet Serve Aviation said that none on board were injured, the aircraft had no damage and the patient was moved to Nanavati Hospital.

We are seeing unprecedented flow of patients struggling with black fungus invading their nose, sinuses, eyes, and even brain. Surgeons are working hard to debride (surgically remove) the fungus but anti-fungal medicine is its cure,” said Dr Neena Bhalodiya, head of Ear, Nose, Throat (ENT) department at Sola Civil Hospital. Dr Bhalodiya said, “It is the need of the hour to create major awareness about mucormycosis invasion in the aftermath of Covid-19 among patients and local doctors across cities and villages as early detection is key to patient’s survival.” Top sources in the state government said that an alert has been sounded about mucormycosis outbreak in Covid-19 recovered patients. “A team of specialists is being drawn up to create awareness amongst medical staff in towns and rural blocks about early signs and treatment of mucormycosis to prevent large number of people from catching the infection, which is highly morbid and has high death rate also,” said a senior health department official. He said that government is also taking stock of the availability of the anti-fungal injections to treat mucormycosis and a system will be soon put in place to ensure its availability to patients detected with the infection. ENT surgeon at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, Dr Devang Gupta, said that some 20% mucormycosis patients end up losing their eye-sight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/use-distilled-water-for-o2-ensure-meds-are-available/articleshow/82441628.cms||---

All these tenders are related to different divisions of the public health wing of the MC. Executive engineer-level officers are monitoring all the works and will be responsible for their completion after the allotment.Out of total 13 villages, which were transferred to the MC a couple of years back, tender has been advertised for 10 and in the coming days remaining would be taken up. The nominated councillors, who were asked to look into villages’ problems, were also consulted, besides the residents, before releasing the tender.MC wants to take up one work at a time at these villages, and in this initial phase only water supply tenders have been advertised as there were supply complaints. “Water supply, sewage pipelines, storm pipelines, road re-carpeting, other works will be done, but in a phased manner. The public health division is working to draft the tender of sewage-related works now, which will take some time and similarly other wings are also working to advertise tenders of their respective works,” an official said.As these villages have no municipal councillors at present, the nominated ones have been asked to look after these areas and listen to their residents’ problems. They hold regular meetings with the residents and inform the engineering department. The 13 villages, whose developmental plan has been prepared, are Behlana, Daria, Dhanas, Khuda Lahora, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Ali Sher, Kaimbwala, Mauli Jagran, Makhan Majra, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Sarangpur and Kishangarh.

These young professionals are reaching out to those in distress with the comfort of at least taking care of their nutritional needs. Agrata Datta (29), a resident of Lake Gardens and a banker working from home, is shuffling between her 9am-7pm job to cook meals for at least 7-8 persons daily for the last two weeks. “I was inspired by a social media post where a group of men in Hyderabad were serving free meals to Covid patients,” said Datta, who caters to people living in Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens and surrounding areas. Swastik Pal (29), a professional photographer who took up his second love — cooking — during the pandemic to help Covid-affected families — supplies meals in the Rajarhat-New Town-Baguiati belt. “My friends have also joined the initiative and we are serving meals for 16 people daily,” said Pal. Most of them have taken to cooking for the first time in their life. The meal includes protein-rich diet comprising chicken stew or egg with rice, dal and a vegetable. A family in Behala has taken it upon themselves to feed 11 families two times a day regularly for the last 10 days. While Tapasi Saha (54) cooks the meals at her home kitchen, her husband does the packaging. Their children Anurag (29) and Asmita (23) attend calls, verifies them and lists daily requirements. There are also seasoned chefs like Abhisayan Ghara (28) who has his own kitchen setup in Golpark from where he had been running food delivery business for the last 8 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/young-professionals-don-chefs-garb-for-cov-families/articleshow/82441478.cms||---

The teaching staff even threatened to go on a strike. The Gujarat Medical Teachers Association wrote to the chief minister two days ago and listed the demands, which are pending for more than a decade. The association urged immediate response from the authorities. But when they did not get any response, they staged a demonstration and threatened to go on a strike at all six government-run medical colleges across the state to press for their demands. The association has even threatened to go on a hunger strike, if their demands are not met. The medical teachers said that in this time of Covid-19, all the demands made by any unit of health department have been accepted after they have gone for a strike. The medical teachers, who have been silently asking for their rights, would be constrained to stage demonstration and go on a strike. The medical teachers have demanded that all ad hoc teachers in government colleges should be regularized by way of a single resolution. They have demanded benefits of the 7th Pay Commission with regard to the pay limit as adopted in the 2017 resolution by the state government. They have been demanding a stop to the appointment of medical teachers on contractual basis. They have also asked for an option of private practice for a medical teacher, once s/he has spent 10 years in service. They have also demanded that the exercise for evaluation and promotion should be regularly conducted by the GPSC and Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC). The association has demanded implementation of the Tikoo Commission’s recommendations along with other resolutions adopted by the government.

Moments after senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Deshmukh, began his submissions, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for CBI said the petition copy was served on Wednesday evening and he needed four weeks to file a reply to the quashing petition. He said that as far as interim relief was concerned, he would be ready to argue. Desai, citing urgency, said he would seek interim relief of "no coercive steps". A bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale observed that since the CBI had been served on Wednesday and had asked for time, it should be given reasonable time. The HC gave Deshmukh liberty to move the vacation bench in case of extreme urgency with 48-hour notice to the CBI. The bench passed an order stating that Singh had sought four weeks' time, which is "vehemently opposed by Desai". who submits "there is an urgency". The HC said it was inclined to grant the CBI reasonable time to file its reply but on Desai's request granted Deshmukh liberty to approach the court for any extremely urgent relief during the court vacation, but with prior notice to the CBI. Deshmukh's petition said the FIR followed a "biased, dubious" inquiry, "with ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta" against him. Deshmukh said that prior sanction was necessary to register the FIR against him as he was a minister when the offence was alleged to have occurred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deshmukh-fails-to-get-interim-relief-from-hc-in-cbis-graft-case/articleshow/82447472.cms||Swati Deshpande

AITUC secretary Suhaas Naik said that the Goa government should have put the state under complete lockdown in order to prevent Covid-19 from overwhelming the state. “It’s high time that the government must strictly adhere to the guidance and advice given by the medical and scientific experts and declare a total lockdown of 15 days,” said Naik. “Today, industrial estates have become the hotspots of coronavirus in Goa and the government has done too little to control the situation in these industrial estates.” Naik said that factory workers are being asked to work on production lines without maintaining social distancing and are allowed to assemble in canteens, changing rooms and washrooms without following Covid-19 protocols. “In the current extremely grim scenario, a mere four-day lockdown has not yielded the desired results. The number of cases is increasing every day and what is worrying is high death rates in Goa considering the size of our total population,” said Naik. AITUC has urged the government to set up healthcare facilities at industrial estates with adequate medical care and treatment facilities. AITUC has also demanded that the government should appoint a high-ranking officer to visit factories in all industrial estates to gather data of Covid infections and ensure that protocols are followed. “If required, the affected factories must be declared as micro containment areas to curb the spread of deadly coronavirus. Workers who test positive must be paid full wages while on leave,” said Naik. Goa Medical College’s internal study mentions Bicholim industrial estate, Corlim industrial estate, Usgao and Shiroda among the top Covid-19 hotspots in Goa.

The party blamed the BJP government’s lethargic attitude and indecisiveness for pushing Goa to the brink of a health disaster. “Pramod Sawant doesn’t have a clue what to do. He should be sacked immediately and someone more mature and responsible should take over,” said Rao. “The BJP government in Goa has proved to be the worst in handling the pandemic.” Mahila Congress president Beena Naik also joined Rao in condemning the BJP and said that the lack of foresight and proper planning by the BJP led to a setback in the fight against the pandemic. “The government must change their lethargic attitude. The people of Goa are facing the brunt of Covid-19 due to the indecisiveness of this government. In times to come, Goans will lose their patience if the government does not take immediate steps,” she said . She also urged the state government to put in place a clear strategy to vaccinate eligible Goans while also creating adequate awareness about the vaccine. Naik has asked the government to “curtail the exorbitant rates” being charged by private hospitals for vaccines and has suggested that a “minimum rate” should be fixed for the inoculation drive. “No proper awareness is done among the people about the importance of vaccination. Due to this lack of awareness we see a number of people dying. If the vaccination was given in time, perhaps the number of deaths would have been less,” said Naik.  Congress has also asked the government not to overburden doctors at Goa Medical College and hospital and at other government hospitals with additional responsibilities in the midst of the pandemic. It has also said that the state government could utilise the services of 150 nurses who completed a course at Ghataprabha, Karnataka if they are fit the health department’s norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-sawant-clueless-about-pandemic-should-be-sacked/articleshow/82443517.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Last year too, Chhatbir zoo was closed after lions in a US zoo tested positive. Chhatbir zoo field director Naresh Mahajan said, “As of now all the animals are safe and show no symptoms of coronavirus. All the animals are under observation and will be tested. The employees, whose samples have been taken, will be allowed to enter the enclosures only if their negative report is received.” Mahajan said the zoo management has installed CCTV cameras to monitor the animals. Earlier, the management was monitoring only newborn animals, but now every enclosure has been fitted with cameras, he added. The pandemic has not only affected the revenue generation at the zoo, but pushed it back by two years in becoming self-sustainable. 2020 was being cited as the year in which it was to become self-sustainable and the situation is not any different in 2021. The field director said the zoo had shown a revenue collection of Rs 6.5 crore in 2019-20 fiscal, and was heading smoothly towards becoming self-reliant, but Covid-19 has made it slip back by two years. He said, “Now we will have to start afresh as the lockdown period has already eaten up a major chunk of revenue. We have many continuous expenses, like feeding the animals and paying wages to caretakers. The animals consume meat, fodder, grains, fruits and vegetables of Rs 30 lakh a month. Though the Punjab government is giving the grant, collection made from visitors has become zero during lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-8-lions-test-ve-in-hyderabad-chhatbir-zoo-closed-till-may-31/articleshow/82441480.cms||---

In a late night communique, ZP CEO Ajit Kumbar said that the doctors in Ashti will resume duty on Friday as they have been assured of action against the guilty policemen.As many as 3,600 people were deprived of the vaccine due to the strike as each centre is tasked with inoculating 600 beneficiaries daily.Vishal Wanve, who is posted at the Takalsingh primary health centre in Ashti, has alleged that he was intercepted by policemen and beaten up with a baton even as he told them that he was a doctor and on duty at the Charata Phata around 7pm on Wednesday.In a similar incident earlier on Wednesday, policemen were caught on CCTV cameras while beating up youths after a deputy superintendent of police was allegedly manhandled by some people who had gathered for taking the vaccine at the civil hospital in Beed town.Beed superintendent of police R Raja, district collector Ravindra Jagtap and ZP CEO Kumbhar met the injured medical officer and assured him of action against the guilty. Later a closed door meeting of medical officers’ association, people’s representatives including MLC Suresh Dhas was held with SP Raja, Jagtap and Kumbha.

---||Kochi||Sabarimala row: CPM to move HC against K Babu||Kochi: The CPM committee in Tripunithura will approach the high court against MLA-elect K Babu alleging that he had misused the controversial Sabarimala women-entry issue to get votes in assembly polls. CPM leaders alleged that Babu violated by Election Commission’s directive not to use Sabarimala issue in poll campaign as he allegedly distorted an old speech by LDF candidate M Swaraj on women-entry and used it in his favour to attract Hindu votes in assembly polls. CPM leaders said that they were collecting details of Babu’s actions and will approach the court within a week, seeking action against him. “EC had warned parties in Kerala against using Sabarimala temple matter during campaigns, saying ‘citing or invoking’ religious propaganda on the issue is a clear violation of the model code of conduct. However, Babu and the UDF leaders in Tripunithura used edited parts of an old speech by Swaraj, distorted his statements and used it widely in campaigns including social media platforms. This was done with the malicious intention of invoking sentiments of Hindu by misguiding them and turning them into UDF votes,” claimed CN Sundaran, CPM constituency committee secretary, Tripunithura. He alleged that UDF used posters and banners against Swaraj in a way that evoked Hindutva sentiments among voters. “Some posters said ‘Ayyane Kalyanam Kazhipikan Vanna Payyane Tholpikanam’. Moreover, there were irregularities in the collection of postal votes and as a result 1,071 postal votes became invalid. We will seek the recounting of these votes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sabarimala-row-cpm-to-move-hc-against-k-babu/articleshow/82416346.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Mete for statewide rallies to press for SEBC quota||Aurangabad: Vinayak Mete, the BJP-backed MLC from Beed and Shiv Sangram leader, on Thursday announced that the Maratha community would take out rallies in different parts of the state to press for SEBC quota once the Covid-related curbs are relaxed from May 16. Mete, who held a meeting with some of the community leaders in Beed — against the backdrop of the Supreme Court striking down the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act — has said that his hometown would hold the maiden rally. After the meeting, Mete told the local media that on Friday, he would submit a memorandum to the state government in support of the reservation to Maratha community and issue an ultimatum about the statewide rallies from May 16. Earlier, he had demanded the resignation of Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan, who headed the sub-committee for Maratha reservation. “People from the Maratha community who care about their future generations should join our agitation against the state government in whatever capacity they find suitable. We will fight for our rights in a democratic manner and by following all Covid prevention norms,” Mete said. Maratha Kranti Morcha distances itself from Mete’s agitation However, the Maratha Kranti Morcha, the outfit which was at the forefront of organising more than 50 such rallies to press for the Maratha reservation — including the first rally held in Aurangabad on August 9, 2016 — has distanced itself from Mete’s stand. Ravindra Kale, the state convener of Maratha Kranti Morcha, on Thursday said Mete was a political figure who has allegedly not been actively associated with the movement in the past five years. “Currently, we are discussing rulings of the apex court with legal experts. Our immediate stand will be to seek immediate available legal remedy. Later, we will decide on whether to take to the streets or protest in front of houses of public representatives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mete-for-statewide-rallies-to-press-for-sebc-quota/articleshow/82438053.cms||---

Sector 46 resident Sunil Jand said his 90-year-old father was first admitted to Sector 45 dispensary, from where he was referred to GMCH-32 on May 3. “One day, I saw oxygen masks of many patients in Covid ward were not on their faces. On one hand, the patients were suffering and on the other, precious oxygen was getting wasted. I had to fix my father’s oxygen mask. This needs to be inquired,” he complained.  He added that ward attendants, too, were not working properly. “Besides, doctors neither gave heart medications to my father for two days nor allowed me to enter and give him medicines,” he said. While seeking an inquiry, he has requested to shift his father to PGI.  Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of Covid management in GMCH-32, said, “The matter is in my notice. The patient has been shifted to a separate ward. A new arrangement has been made wherein ward attendants will not go to store and take care of patients only.

---||Mumbai||ED chargesheet names GVK, MIAL for laundering Rs 500 crore||MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) last week submitted its first chargesheet in the special court against GVK group of companies, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) and its managing director Sanjay Reddy along with others for laundering Rs 500 crore through fictitious transactions to carry out further development of Mumbai’s international airport terminus (T-2). ED alleged that the group controlled-MIAL had awarded a fake contract of civil work to companies with forged documents. The contacts were never executed but MIAL released the agreed payment. ED alleged that the contractors then transferred the money to GVK group companies or firms associated with its promoters and they laundered the money. ED named over 21 accused in the case, including MIAL, GVK Airport Development Authority and GVK Energy along with other office-bearers of the firm involved in money-laundering. ED sources stated they will continue their investigation. GVK group declined to comment. Earlier, the government entity, Airport Authority of India (AAI) managed the city airport and entered into an agreement with the group, allowing them to operate, manage and develop Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (T-2). They formed a joint venture in 2006—MIAL--- in which the group-led consortium holds 74% shared and AAI 26%. According to the agreement, MIAL was told to manage T-2 operations and share 38.7 % earnings with AAI first, and keep the rest with the company for modernization-extension of the airport. AAI allegedly gave a 200-acre plot near the airport to MIAL for development and revenue generation. But MIAL allegedly entered into a bogus contract in 2017 with Aishwaryagiri Construction, Kotia Enterprises, SBK Trade & Infrastructure, Subhash Infra, Aqua Tech Solutions, MV Omni Projects, Richa Industries, Nice Projects and Aditi Infrabuild for real estate development. MIAL allegedly transferred over Rs 310 crore to these companies but the contracts were not executed. In another instance, it was alleged the accused forged a board meeting resolution of MIAL to use Rs 395 crore surplus funds in the company to create a fixed deposit in Bank of India’s Hyderabad branch. GVK group had allegedly raised loans against the FD for their group companies. Last July, ED had registered the money-laundering case against the accused and searched premises of GVK group companies, its promoters in Mumbai and Hyderabad. ED’s probe under PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) is based on an FIR registered by CBI on June 27 last year against 13 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-chargesheet-names-gvk-mial-for-laundering-rs-500cr/articleshow/82443638.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Requests for sanitisation drives rise but limited resources hit execution||JAIPUR: The requests for sanitisation in wards have been rising since the last three weeks as the number of cases started soaring in the city. According to the chairman of fire committee of Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater Paras Jain, around 400–500 calls every day are being received from the councillors and the citizens for sanitisation and the limited resources are making it difficult to implement it. Hence, an application has been sent to JMC-Greater commissioner to provide at least two knapsack machines in every ward. Thousands of cases are being reported in the state and people are getting panicked. Hundreds of complaints are being received for sanitisation. Sometimes from people whose family member or a neighbour was found positive and sometimes from people who just want to sanitise for prevention. However, only 56 knapsack machines are available at JMC-Greater for manual sanitising and rest is done by fire department. Jain has written to commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh asking for knapsack machines in every ward. “I am getting continuous calls. There are some wards where sanitisation has been done two or three times and some places not even once. If one or two knapsack machines are provided, every councillor can use it. Fire tenders cannot go in every lane and sometimes, requests come at odd timings when vehicles are busy,” said Jain. A senior JMC-Greater official, on condition of anonymity, said that purchasing machines immediately is not possible and after the Covid is over, they will become useless. Hence, authorities are avoiding it. Rashmi Kankariya, health DC said, “We got the application from Paras Jain and have forwarded it to higher authorities. We are trying our best to take care of the all the requests we receive. I look into the knapsack machines and on JMC-Greater helpline, we are receiving 90 requests daily regarding that. Our priority is always to sanitise the areas where Covid patients are found, but sometimes we take into consideration the neighbours as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/requests-for-sanitisation-drives-rise-but-limited-resources-hit-execution/articleshow/82441490.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Chaos surrounds vaccination drive against Covid-19||Aurangabad: Chaos reigned supreme at the already-limited vaccination sites within the municipal limits of Aurangabad with centres not having sufficient stock despite official announcement. Moreover, many beneficiaries aged above 45 said that they had to return home without getting vaccinated due to lack of awareness about mandatory online registration as direct walk-ins were no more allowed. Vinod Bhalerao, a 50-year-old who was planning to take the second dose of vaccine, said that he went to Nakshatrawadi and IMA-run vaccination sites at Garkheda in the morning only to find no immunization drive. “I finally reached Bansilal Nagar where a large queue was already present. I was told that only around 190 vaccines were available for the day and that the stock was less compared to beneficiaries gathered,” he said. Kaveri Yedke, a middle-aged home-maker, said that the earlier practice of allowing walk-ins for vaccination should be continued for those above 45 years of age. “The young generation is well versed with online procedures but not middle-aged people like me. The online registration is a tedious process and may prevent many like me from getting vaccinated,” she said. Former corporators from the city, who were invited for online meeting by the civic administration, also raised the issue of chaos at vaccination sites and suggested steps to streamline vaccination to avoid crowding and inconvenience to citizens. When contacted, AMC health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said that a few of the identified 21 vaccination sites started their operations a bit late due to transportation delays involving vaccine doses. “We found that many citizens queue up at vaccination centres since around 7 am. It is good to see the growing response for the vaccination, but citizens should also know the basics of immunization programme, including registration formalities,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/chaos-surrounds-vaccination-drive-against-covid-19/articleshow/82441516.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||GST officials seize SUV; it’s pure dacoity, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday likened the Goods & Service Tax (GST) officials’ seizure of a Rajkot businessman’s private vehicle to dacoity. Later, the state government agreed to release the vehicle. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice R M Chhaya made oral observations about the functioning of the state GST flying squad. This was with regard to a petition filed by one Rakesh Sarasvadiya from Morbi, whose truck with goods was detained on February 16. He was summoned to GST office in Ahmedabad, where he was detained for two days. GST officials seized his SUV, seven mobile phones, and three diaries before raiding his premises in Rajkot and Morbi. Sarasvadiya approached the high court for release of his SUV and mobile phones. His truck was released after he paid the due amount levied by the department. When the judges came to know that the seizure was made by assistant commissioner, an officer below the rank of joint commissioner and who is not authorized by the GST Act to make seizure, they questioned the state government what the court should do with the officer. After a brief discussion, the CJ commented, “This is dacoity.” The judges kept their audio channel on while they were discussing the issue among themselves. Later the CJ told the government lawyer, “We want you to hear what we were talking. This is pure dacoity.” Justice Chhaya also passed some remarks about the seizure proceedings and said, “…My Lord is absolutely right in using this word dacoity.” The chief justice also criticized the seizure and questioned the procedure adopted in this case, “The question is who can make a raid and who can make a seizure? If somebody is not authorized to carry out the raid and seizure enters my house, then it is trespassing. That is robbery. It is dacoity, if more than five people are there or it is a robbery.” The state government said that it was ready to release the SUV. The HC asked it to do it within a week because the court was informed that the officer involved in the seizure is down with Covid-19. The court has sought reply from the department in two weeks and posted hearing after the summer vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gst-officials-seize-suv-its-pure-dacoity-says-hc/articleshow/82441519.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh asks Centre to hike oxygen quota from 20MT to 35MT||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has written to the Centre, asking it to increase their quota of liquid oxygen from 20MT to 35MT. In the letter written to Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, health and family welfare, UT adviser Manoj Parida has submitted that the Centre has allotted 20MT of liquid oxygen, which they are already supplying to three government hospitals, including GMH-16, GMCH-32 and Sector 48 Covid hospital, and to many NGOs that have set up Covid care centres in Chandigarh. The administration has demanded that to meet the rising demand of oxygen in the city, the Centre should increase its quota to 35MT. UT suggested that the additional quota allocation could be made from the Inox plant in Barotiwala, Baddi. Meanwhile, on the request of the UT health department, the UT director general of police (DGP) has provided escort facility to tankers carrying medical oxygen from Inox plant to Chandigarh and deployed DSP Dalip Ratan as the nodal officer for it. On Wednesday, UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta had written to the DGP, stating that the nodal officer for oxygen supplies in UT, Yashpal Garg, had highlighted the need to provide police escort to tankers carrying liquid medical oxygen from the plant to various destinations in Chandigarh to reduce the travel time and avoid any untoward incident. The UT administration has already deployed two of its officials at the Baddi plant for better coordination. Besides, the UT administration has already roped in three vendors for refilling cylinders to be used by health institutions of the city. Garg said, “The ministry of health and family welfare has fixed the daily quota of 20MT of medical oxygen for UT from Inox. This medical oxygen is being utilised for GMH-16, GMCH-32 and the Covid hospital in Sector 48. Recently, three oxygen generation plants were also commissioned at these three hospitals.” However, there is an additional requirement at these three government hospitals. The private healthcare institutions also need medical oxygen and PGIMER’s requirement is met from a separate quota. After meeting the daily requirements of GMCH-32, GMH-16 and the Sector 48 Covid hospital, the remaining oxygen from the 20MT quota is provided to the private refilling vendors to cater to the needs of the other government and private hospitals of the city. Garg said they have been monitoring supply to private institutions too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-asks-centre-to-hike-o2-quota-from-20mt-to-35mt/articleshow/82441527.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This is the first quarter’s installment out of Rs 502 crore. Of the released Rs 127 crore, Rs 2 crore have been given to the Swachh Bharat Mission works and the remaining Rs 125 crore are for other expenditures of the civic body.It is up to the MC to divide the amount and spend it as per its requirements. Though the payments will be released to the departments by the accounts office of the MC, sources said this would be done after the approval of the senior officers. “Committed liabilities are the main segment of the expenditure for the civic body. Developmental works that were under way and in need of funds will also get an allocation. As road re-carpeting works are on full swing, the contractors are also asking for their payments. The money needs to be spent judiciously and on priority. Every single penny will be allocated after orders from the senior officers,” sources added.A senior officer said since this was grant of the first quarter of the fiscal, the MC would also have to keep in mind that the next installment would come after three months, so it should be used prudently.The MC general house had earlier this year prepared and passed a Rs 1,627-crore budget for the current financial year, but the UT had given Rs 502-crore grant-in-aid.

He has been admitted to the ICU of the MG Hospital against his and his devotees' wish to be admitted to AIIMS. He has been put on ventilator and his condition is stated to be stable according to the sources. Though, the sources from Jodhpur Central Jail said that his sample had been taken along with other jail inmates following health complications and he had later found to be positive two days back and treatment had been started accordingly. “On Wednesday night, his condition deteriorated as he complained of fever and short-breath. We rushed him to the MG Hospital in the night itself,” said a jail official. TOI talked to the principal of SN Medical College about his condition and report. But refusing to talk over the issue, he advised to talk to the superintendent of the MG Hospital Raj Shree Behra, who also did not respond to the repeated calls. It may be noted that Asaram has been suffering from many ailments given a number of affidavits about his health in the court and citing his health condition and as a strong ground for bail, though in vain. Meanwhile, his supporters and followers also assembled at the MG Hospital in large numbers as soon as the news of his hospitalization spread around. Some of the devotees also demanded him to be admitted in the AIIMS but hospital administration said to have begun his treatment and said that there was no such need to take him to AIIMS. Devotees assembled at the hospital have also demanded the hospital administration and police to share the health details of Asaram with them. Meanwhile, they tried to sneak into the hospital in order to get a glimpse of Asaram but vigilant police foiled their bid. Later some devotees were detained by the police for constantly trying to give the police the slip and were taken to the police station. Police also seized some of the vehicles of devotees but still they have been trying to hide themselves from the police awaiting any opportunity to sneak into the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/asaram-admitted-to-hosp-with-breathing-problems/articleshow/82441509.cms||---

However, locals have now complained that fish vehicles coming to the market from other states offload their fish stocks outside the wholesale fish market, thereby resulting in a rush for buying of fish by both wholesale fish sellers and retail customers. Locals have complained that fishermen are occupying spaces along the sides of the Western bypass in the vicinity of the SGPDA market to sell their stock, resulting in people crowding on the road, leading to traffic congestion. “The very purpose of closing down the wholesale fish market is defeated if traders continue selling fish outside the wholesale fish market and along the roadsides. It’s puzzling why the police have failed to rein in these violators,” a resident from the locality said. Another resident pointed out that fish trucks were being parked along both sides of the roads for most part of the day and fish sold without ensuring social distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviour by the fish buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-market-closed-traders-offload-fish-on-roadside/articleshow/82443617.cms||---

The major hospitals of Mohali have 100% occupancy of Covid specialized beds and the district is left with just a handful of L2 beds at some of the government hospitals. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said around 200 beds would be set up at Chandigarh University, subject to the availability of doctors and paramedics. Bed capacity at the civil hospital was increased from 60 to 120, and now the hospital has 124 patients in the isolation ward. Moreover, the Army is setting up a Covid specialty ward at the civil hospital on the third floor and will soon make 50 beds operational. Manpower shortage is staring the Mohali administration in the face at a time when the recovery rate is falling to the all-time low of the year at 79.5%. However, Dayalan said, “All the Covid beds in private hospitals are now occupied and we are relying on the Army to set up a 100-bed facility at the government hospital. We already have Chandigarh University with 200 beds’ capacity that can be upgraded to 1,000 as per requirement. We have enough facilities to cater to the increasing cases and recoveries are also leading to vacant beds. We have sufficient doctors, healthcare workers and paramedics and have asked the Punjab government to provide us with an ample stock of vaccine.” Recently, Mohali got five ventilators that are yet to be made functional at the civil hospital. Western Command, after accepting the appeal made by the Punjab chief minister for help, had agreed to set up 100 beds’ ward at the civil hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bed-shortage-at-mohali-civil-hosp-isolation-ward/articleshow/82441538.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 46 held for procession to ‘eradicate Covid-19’||AHMEDABAD: Gandhinagar Police arrested 46 people for taking out a religious procession of Lord Baliyadev at a village in Gandhinagar district to “eradicate coronavirus,” an official said on Thursday. The incident of holding the religious procession took place in Dabhi Faliyu in Raipur village in Gandhinagar on Wednesday and the complaint was lodged late on Wednesday night after a video of the event went viral, said an officer of Gandhinagar police. Deputy superintendent of police, M K Rana, said that all Covid-19 prevention norms were allegedly violated during the latest procession taken out in Raipur village on Wednesday and a complaint was filed with Dabhoda police in the matter. In a video that went viral on social media platforms, around 100 men and women, most of them without masks, were seen participating in a procession in the village. While women were carrying water pots on their heads, several men were leading the procession while beating drums. “After being alerted about the incident, we have arrested 46 men involved in taking out the procession,” Rana said. A section of people from the village believed coronavirus could be eradicated by pouring water on the idol of their deity in a local temple, he said. All the 46 accused were booked for violating police notification regarding gatherings under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, Rana said. On May 3, a similar incident had taken place at Navapura village in Ahmedabad where a large number of women carrying water pots on their heads took out a procession to a local temple, believing that pouring water on the idol would eradicate Covid-19. Police booked as many as 23 persons including a village sarpanch for violating norms in four villages of Ahmedabad district. The Gujarat government has already imposed a ban on all kinds of gatherings in the state in the wake of a surge in coronavirus cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/46-held-for-procession-to-eradicate-covid-19/articleshow/82441563.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Bodies of Covid dead not being burnt properly, dogs taking away remains’||Dehradun: Residents of Ambadi village in Vikasnagar, on the outskirts of Dehradun, have alleged that the newly-built crematorium dedicated for Covid-19 patients is posing a health risk for them. They alleged that the bodies are not being burnt properly and stray dogs are picking on the remains leading to an extremely unhygienic situation in the area. “The authorities must provide adequate quantity of wood for cremation and ensure that the bodies burn completely,” said a resident. The locals have also alleged that the people who bring the bodies to the crematorium often dump their PPE kits in the area. The crematorium has a crop field around it and the farmers are not able to work there because of the burning of the bodies. The local administration had established a dedicated crematorium for Covid-19 patients to reduce the burden on existing facilities.  “We have written to senior officials including the Vikasnagar MLA but nothing has been done so far. Our village doesn’t have any Covid-positive patients yet but the current situation may result in an outbreak,” said Kishan Lala, a local resident.  Sub-divisional magistrate Vikasnagar, Saurav Aswal, said the matter has been taken up on priority. “We have instructed our teams to ensure proper cleanliness and sanitisation around the place and also at the cremation facility,” said Aswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bodies-of-covid-dead-not-being-burnt-properly-dogs-taking-away-remains/articleshow/82440280.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Business||Biological E set for Covid vaccine rollout by August||Hyderabad: As the country grapples with the second wave of Covid-19, vaccine maker Biological E is gearing up to churn out 75 to 80 million doses per month of its recombinant protein vaccine candidate from August this year. The company also says it will be one of the most affordable vaccines in the country. Biological E’s managing director Mahima Datla indicated as much in an exclusive interview to TOI when she said: “I am not at liberty to share it (pricing) yet because we are still working on it, but I can assure you it will be among the most affordable Covid-19 vaccines that you can get a hold of.” She added that the company certainly won’t take advantage of the situation. “We’re third generation in this business,” she said. “Covid did not make us enter into this business and we pride ourselves on having made vaccines accessible in pre-pandemic times to countries that needed it the most.” Dr Maria Elena Bottazi, associate dean, National School of Tropical Medicine (NSTM) at Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine, which is collaborating with Biological E for the vaccine, has been quoted as saying that the subunit vaccine, which is modelled after the hepatitis B vaccine, uses traditional technology and is cheap to produce at only about $1.5 (Rs 110 approx) per dose. Datla’s assurance on affordable pricing comes at a time when vaccine pricing has become a political issue. After being criticised, the central government had to ask both Serum Institute of India (Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) to cut their prices for state governments. On being able to churn out 75-80 million doses per month right from the start, Datla said: “It’s a significant capacity and we have already scaled up. We have confidence in our manufacturing capabilities to be able to deliver that number from August onwards.” “We are well-resourced in terms of capacities, both for fill-finish and bulk antigen. We are focusing on hunkering down and getting our vaccines through to the finish line and making sure that we're able to deliver capacities...” she added. Bio E’s vaccine rollout could help substantially ease the vaccine crunch that is currently hampering the country’s vaccination drive. Apart from Covaxin and Covishield, Russian vaccine Sputnik V, which is priced at $10 globally, has received emergency use authorisation but India would initially have to rely on imports as local manufacturing of the vaccine is slated to begin only in the July-September quarter. Currently, Biological E is busy with preparations for phase III trials of the two-dose vaccine on 1,268 healthy volunteers in the 18-80 years age group at 15 centres across the country as part of a larger global study. Apart from the two-dose recombinant protein vaccine Bio E also has a tie-up with Johnson & Johnson for making 600 million doses of the latter’s single shot Covid-19 vaccine -- Ad26.COV2.S — in India. The company has been promised funding from the US International Development Finance Corporation to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 under the Quad initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/biological-e-set-for-covid-vaccine-rollout-by-august/articleshow/82445644.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

A rescue operation was initiated by the administration, but no breakthrough has been achieved till late night. The boy has been identified as Anil, son of one Nagaram Dewasi. A camera was dropped by the rescue team in the borewell which traced his location at a depth of 90 feet. “Oxygen has been provided in the borewell so that the child could not suffocate. Some snacks have also been dropped for the child,” SHO (Sanchore) Praveen Acharya said adding that a constant communication to keep the child awake was being exercised. He said that the teams of NDRF and SDRF have initiated a rescue operation but no success has been achieved. According to the information, a new borewell had been dug at the farm of Nagaram Dewasi in village Lachhri a couple of days back. “It was covered as complete work was yet to be done. Meanwhile, Anil went close to the borewell while playing and tried to remove the cover,” Acharya said. In this attempt, he slipped into the borewell. People around raised an alarm and informed the administration. Administrative officials along with the police rushed to the spot and cordoned the area to keep the curious villagers away from the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-yr-old-falls-into-borewell-in-jalore-rescue-efforts-on/articleshow/82441535.cms||---

AMC health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said the state government has asked all the districts to utilise the available stock of Covaxin only for the 18-44 years age group till further orders. “We have received 6,000 doses of Covaxin, of which, 500 have been handed over to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). The civic administration is operating three vaccination centres where Covaxin is being administered to only one target group with prior online registration,” she said. Elaborating on the supply of Covaxin and its use, assistant director of health, Pune circle, Sanjay Deshmukh said the vaccines procured from the Centre are used for the 45+ age group while those which have been procured by the state government directly from the manufacturers will be strictly used only for the 18-44 age group. For those needing the second dose of Covaxin, Padalkar said the state-level health authorities were expected to come out with another set of directives soon. “Ideally, a gap of around four to six weeks is expected between the first and the second Covaxin doses. The state-level authorities are expected to make available sufficient supply of Covaxin for those needing the second dose,” she said. The civic administration does not have off-hand information regarding the break-up of inoculation using Covishield and Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-covaxin-for-45-from-state-procured-quota-for-now/articleshow/82441536.cms||---

Tope said he held a meeting with state health officials and asked them to grant necessary approval and clearances from their end to make every district self-sufficient in oxygen, medicines and other medical equipment before the third wave. “The (Centre’s) department of pharmaceuticals is not giving speedy approval for various essential items that we have ordered from abroad,” he said. The state is expecting around 3.5 lakh vials of remdesivir, the key anti-viral drug, from abroad in a couple of days. Recently, the state had floated a global tender to purchase items such as oxygen tanks and generators, and has received many proposals.“We cannot sit on the proposals for five-eight days,” he said.

---||Gurgaon||10 days after directive on 900 beds, Gurugram fails to add any||GURUGRAM: On April 26, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had outlined a plan to add around 900 oxygen beds for Covid patients in the city. These hospitals were to come up in vacant flats of an M3M condominium in Sector 67 condominium (400 beds) in collaboration with Medanta, at the HSVP auditorium in Sector 43 (100 beds) and SGT hospital (400 beds). In the ten days between then and Thursday, the city has averaged in excess of 3,000 new infections every day. But so far, none of those 900 beds has been activated for patients at a time when Covid beds in the city are full and people are travelling to other districts or even states for treatment. The main challenge, officials say, is medical oxygen. Adding oxygen beds will drive up demand and almost inevitably lead to a flurry of SOS calls from various hospitals. The oxygen supply lines have relatively stabilised this week after a tense fortnight for hospitals and the Gurugram administration that saw a daily scramble to deliver oxygen to hospitals on time. At two private hospitals – Kriti and Kathuria – 10 patients died, allegedly after the facilities ran out of oxygen. The other reason officials cite is an inadequate number of skilled professionals like nurses, ICU specialists and medical officers. The number of active Covid-19 cases in the city is now around 40,000 and the list of people waiting to get a hospital bed is getting longer. ICU and ventilator beds are not immediately available. All 2,459 beds allotted for Covid patients are full. According to a senior government official, 250 beds have been arranged at the Sector 67 condominium and more than 60 beds have been set up at the HSVP auditorium. But they haven’t been activated because there isn’t enough oxygen supply. Efforts are on to procure more oxygen cylinders and concentrators to get these facilities up and running. “We will start operations at these places only after all arrangements are made. When these beds become functional, more health workers and doctors will be needed too, but the health department and private hospitals are already facing a shortage of professionals,” the official added. SGT hospital’s capacity expansion to 500 beds is likely to take another fortnight, at least. The hospital does not have an oxygen storage tank, which needs to be built before it can accommodate more Covid patients. According to the health department, SGT hospital has only 50 oxygen beds now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/10-days-after-directive-on-900-beds-gurgaon-fails-to-add-any/articleshow/82443699.cms||Shahnawaz Alam

The child rights department and the state adoption and resource agency has cautioned the public to remain aware of malicious messages spreading these days on social media regarding appeals to adopt children orphaned after death of their parents due to Covid. “In one of the WhatsApp groups, a message was shared wherein a woman appealed for adoption of two babies, one of them three-day-old and the other one six-month-old. The number was fake as no one received the calls but only was used for sending messages,” Kamlesh Sharma, a social activist said. “Every second or third day, similar messages are seen floating in groups, requesting help for orphaned children or looking for potential foster parents for their care,” Sangya Joshi, an advocate said. Manan Chaturvedi, former president of Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said that people should come ahead to adopt kids who have been rendered homeless or orphaned due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/be-cautious-of-fake-msg-on-child-adoption/articleshow/82441572.cms||---

At the same time, All India Congress Committee (AICC) has decided to send its leaders to study the reasons for the party’s defeat and find suitable options to replace the current KPCC president and also the opposition leader. Senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge will be arriving here for the key meeting with state leaders. However, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran firmly said that he was not ready to take responsibility for the severe poll drubbing and added that it is the collective failure of the party. He has communicated the same to the AICC and said that he alone should not be made the culprit as there were several decision makers who selected candidates and looked after campaigning. It is learnt that he has told the party high command that he was being victimised by group managers for the poll defeat since he was not ready to accept their demands. Ramachandran informed senior leaders in the party that he was ready to quit but will not take up the sole responsibility for the party’s defeat. KPCC political affairs committee is all set to become a stormy affair as the party leadership will come under fire from senior leaders. There are also unconfirmed reports that both Mullappally Ramachandran and Ramesh Chennithala will be declaring their decisions at this meeting. After the election results were declared, the KPCC president faced the worst criticism from various quarters. There were also reports that the AICC also wanted the KPCC president to resign on his own, but he was not ready for it. However, senior leaders in the party are of the view that a sudden change in leadership is not going to do any good for the party and hence there needs to be a comprehensive revamp from the top to the bottom. All these things will be discussed in detail at the political affairs committee meeting on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kpcc-political-affairs-panel-set-to-be-a-stormy-affair/articleshow/82440348.cms||---

Filed on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, the PIL also lists several other demands including basic Covid-19 medical facilities at the hospital. The PIL pointed out the shortage of beds, oxygen, and long waiting hours for 108 EMRI ambulances. Petitioner Gokulbhai Varu, in the plea filed through advocate Nabil Bloch, mentioned that the practice of postmortem has not been banned by the law, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The petition, however, did not elaborate much on the reason for seeking a postmortem examination.  The lawyer mentioned the petition before a bench headed by the chief justice on Thursday and sought hearing on the issue. The judges said the plea would be heard on May 11 along with the suo motu PIL on Covid-19. The PIL has also urged the HC to direct authorities to make ventilators, oxygen and beds available in adequate number for people who are suffering from Covid-19 in Jamnagar. The petitioner has also complained of shortage of remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pil-seeks-directions-for-postmortem-of-covid-victims/articleshow/82441582.cms||---

It is used in cancer treatment and in aeronautics, an official said. The case began in mid-February when the ATS received a tip-off that a Thane resident, Jigar Jayesh Pandya (27), was trying to sell pieces of a uranium substance. The ATS sent a dummy customer who bought some for over Rs 1 lakh and then sent it to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay for analysis. Meanwhile, Pandya was detained and questioned. He said he got it from Abu Tahir Choudhary (31), who the ATS apprehended from the scrap market and seized from him 7.1kg uranium. “Choudhary said he wanted to sell it for Rs 5 crore,” said an ATS officer. On Wednesday, the BARC report confirmed it was uranium. “The report stated that the substance is natural uranium, highly radioactive and dangerous to human life,” said an ATS officer. Investigators are trying to find out where it was procured from. Following the report, Arjun Panda, regional director, Atomic Minerals Directorate of Exploration and Research at Nagpur, lodged an FIR and the duo was arrested. They were booked under sections of the Atomic Energy Act, 1962. An NIA court later remanded them in police custody till May 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-scrap-dealer-aide-held-for-bid-to-sell-7kg-uranium/articleshow/82445645.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Some of the districts are showing a sudden spike in cases over last the two weeks, but Satara and Solapur districts have reported a steady rise. Meanwhile, 11 districts from Maharashtra are reporting a consistent decline in Covid cases for the last two weeks.On Wednesday, Satara reported 2,372 Covid cases and 58 deaths. For the past few days, the cases are hovering above 2,000. The district has 21,000 active patients. Strict lockdown has been imposed for the last few days in Satara as the citizens were hardly following the Covid restrictions imposed by the state government.  Ramchandra Shinde, acting district collector of Satara, said, “Every day we conduct around 7,000 tests. Currently, the positivity rate is 35%. We are reporting nearly 2,500 cases daily and therefore to stop the spread, we have imposed strict lockdown.”In Solapur district, the rural parts are worst affected as they have recorded 1,830 cases and 34 deaths. Solapur rural has around 16,500 active cases. Pandharpur tehsil, a part of Pandharpur-Mangalwedha assembly constituency, which recently witnessed the bypoll, is also badly affected. Of the daily 1,800 cases, around 350 are from Pandharpur tehsil. Earlier, the officials had said the large number of cases is due to many people coming into contact while campaigning last month.Solapur city is currently reporting fewer cases (around 150) as compared to cases last week, which is mainly due to the strict lockdown enforced by civic chief P Siva Sankar. Meanwhile, Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil is furious after the Centre stopped the supply of 50 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen from Bellary based plant.

IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal said after the meeting that the party will conduct a detailed review of the election results, go for an introspection and take steps for moving ahead and strengthening the UDF. Thangal said that a panel will be constituted to look into the defeat suffered by the party in some seats. The meeting, which was also attended by the newly-elected MLA designates, also elected IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty as the parliamentary party leader and M K Muneer as the deputy leader. K P A Majeed is the parliamentary party secretary. IUML national organizing secretary, E T Mohammed Basheer said that some persons are making farfetched and unrealistic assessments that the party suffered defeat without seeing the reality. “The party put up a good performance in our strongholds. Our winning margins increased in seven constituencies in Malappuram and also in the two constituencies in Kasaragod. The party was also able to wrest Koduvally seat. The party has lost some seats by thin margins only,” he said. He said that the attempts to target some leaders on social media were part of a planned attempt by some to negate the gains made by the party. Basheer said that IUML was able to make significant contributions in closing the account of BJP in state; it ensured that the party didn’t win at Manjeswaram and Palakkad seats. Though the party was able to retain its 11 seats in Malappuram, the total seat count of the party has decreased from 18 in 2016 to 15 despite the party contesting in 27 seats (its highest). The party had lost its sitting seats of Azhikode, Kalamassery, Kozhikode South and Kuttiady though it managed to wrest Koduvally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/could-secure-strongholds-in-adverse-times-iuml/articleshow/82440389.cms||---

Though several bureaucrats are already included in various committees, the government might depute IAS officers to coordinate with the seven hospitals, managing the bulk of Covid- 19 cases. Apart from Covid nodal centre Gandhi Hospital, the officers would keep tabs on six other health facilities, including Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), District Hospital, King Koti, Government Fever Hospital, Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital and Government TB & Chest Hospital. “The officers will coordinate with the hospital authorities for better management of the situation and attend to their needs,” a top government source told TOI. The directives might be released in a day or two. Also, collectors would monitor the situation at major district hospitals. Till now, the district collectors were working closely with civic and health department officials, but now they would directly interact with hospital authorities. Sources say at the district level, there were other changes in the offing. A coordination committee on Covid-19 would be constituted with district panchayat officer and others to manage the situation. In some districts, the government has already deployed district employment officers (DEOs) to look into vaccination stock and drive. Sources said there could be changes within the health department too after exit of Eatala Rajender. “The idea is to ease burden on officials and give them specific tasks so that there is more clarity in work” the sources said.

Looking at the increasing demand for oxygen, a youth Mukesh Sharma has been offering free refills of oxygen cylinders at doorsteps. Anyone calling on his number can avail help by giving the empty cylinder which Sharma would return completely filled. The Brahman Samaj in Udaipur is delivering food packets to home isolated Covid patients. Narendra Paliwal, president Vipra Foundation, said a team of 15 volunteers is working relentlessly to provide food packets to people at their homes and also to needy patients in hospitals. Sikh samaj has ordered for oxygen concentrator machines which are expected to arrive soon. “Once the Machines are available, needy persons can take them from Gurdwara,” said spokesperson Ravindra Pal Singh Kappu. Zahiruddin Sakka of Life Progressive Society said many people are unemployed due to the pandemic and to ensure that no one suffers or starves, ration kits are being supplied at calls. Narayan Seva Sansthan is providing a free kit to those who have tested positive. “Ours is a medicine kit which has pre-prescribed medicines.

It will have the capacity to supply 24x7 oxygen to 30 beds. Panchkula chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, “The plant has started generating oxygen. We have sent a sample of oxygen to a Gurugram laboratory. If the report matches the standards, we will start supplying 24x7 oxygen to 30 beds at the hospital. If it is a success, we will build another plant with three times its capacity.” Amit, a technical expert at the plant, said, “The plant can store 4,000 litre of oxygen at one time and produce 300 litre of oxygen per minute.” On how they are tackling the issue of oxygen shortage, the CMO said they were getting the supply from Roorkee and have cylinders in reserve as a backup. Two days ago, the civil hospital faced oxygen shortage at midnight and a tanker was called from Mohali for patients. Haryana food and drugs department on April 24 had directed Air Liquide, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, to provide Panchkula with 5.5 TPD (tonnes per day) of liquid medical oxygen. The DC was asked to make sure the oxygen quota was lifted from the filling station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-hospital-installs-its-own-oxygen-plant/articleshow/82441611.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

During the second wave, the infection has hit the rural areas hard and several villages in Kota, Bundi, Jhalawar and Baran districts are under self-imposed zero mobility. In Shahabad area of Baran district, most villages with majority of tribal population are under zero mobility as there are many infected persons undergoing treatment in home isolation in the villages. Muhal, Dikwani, Shahabad, Kelwada, Samraniya, Gadreta, Devri, Kasbathana villages in Shahabad of Baran district are under zero mobility. The reports of daily Covid deaths in almost every village have forced the locals to stay indoors as they are now aware of the fact that hospitals have run out of medical facilities and if they fall prey of infection, nobody is going to take care of them, said an ASHA supervisor at a community health centre in Bundi. Panic and fear prevails everywhere here in the village after two brothers in a family died on Monday and Wednesday this week in Jawahar Nagar village of Amli panchyat samiti of Bundi while another person died Saturday last week, she said, adding that people suffering from cold and cough can be found in almost every house in the village. Covid medicine kits containing 6-7 drugs are being distributed to such people after the survey, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/villages-wear-deserted-look-as-people-stay-indoors/articleshow/82441615.cms||---

IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal said after the meeting that the party will conduct a detailed review of the election results, go for an introspection and take steps for moving ahead and strengthening the UDF. Thangal said that a panel will be constituted to look into the defeat suffered by the party in some seats. The meeting, which was also attended by the newly-elected MLA designates, also elected IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty as the parliamentary party leader and M K Muneer as the deputy leader. K P A Majeed is the parliamentary party secretary. IUML national organizing secretary, E T Mohammed Basheer said that some persons are making farfetched and unrealistic assessments that the party suffered defeat without seeing the reality. “The party put up a good performance in our strongholds. Our winning margins increased in seven constituencies in Malappuram and also in the two constituencies in Kasaragod. The party was also able to wrest Koduvally seat. The party has lost some seats by thin margins only,” he said. He said that the attempts to target some leaders on social media were part of a planned attempt by some to negate the gains made by the party. Basheer said that IUML was able to make significant contributions in closing the account of BJP in state; it ensured that the party didn’t win at Manjeswaram and Palakkad seats. Though the party was able to retain its 11 seats in Malappuram, the total seat count of the party has decreased from 18 in 2016 to 15 despite the party contesting in 27 seats (its highest). The party had lost its sitting seats of Azhikode, Kalamassery, Kozhikode South and Kuttiady though it managed to wrest Koduvally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/could-secure-strongholds-in-adverse-times-iuml/articleshow/82447992.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Draft plan to tackle river pollution ready||Kolhapur: Developing sluice gates at barrages along the Panchaganga river, making sure service centres have in-house effluent treatment plant, setting up separate washing centres for clothes and cattle are some of the measures suggested by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in its draft report prepared on the directions of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The CM after taking cognizance of the complaints about fish deaths in the Panchaganga river had asked the board to come up with a concrete plan to tackle the pollution of the river. District guardian minister Satej Patil and several other public representatives from the district have approved the draft, which will be given to Thackeray soon. Currently, most of the sewage from Kolhapur city is treated while around 45 million litre from Ichalkaranji is discharged into the river without any treatment, which is the major source of pollution. The expert members associated with the drafting of the report said the major focus of the plan is to develop infrastructure such as treatment plants for Ichalkaranji and villages along the banks of the river. Uday Gaikwad, an environmentalist and expert member said, “We have suggested measures to be taken at the micro-level. For instance, we expect the effluent from the household textile units from Ichalkaranji to be diverted to a single point and then treat it effectively. We have proposed sluice gates for the barrages to flush out the solid waste and sediment waste from the river so that the river water remains diluted.” Kolhapur city was once a major polluter of the river. Currently, around 95% of the sewage generated in the city is treated. Gaikwad said they have suggested mandatory setting up of the effluent treatment plants by the servicing centres. “The servicing centres generate a huge amount of wastewater every day. Such units come under the industrial category and by law they should have their own effluent treatment plants,” said Gaikwad. The plan also includes the diversion of 91 million litre of treated wastewater from Kolhapur city for irrigation . He said the work requires over Rs 25 crore, however, the funds can be recovered by charging fees from farmers for using the treated wastewater. Patil has asked officials to estimate the funds required to implement the measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/draft-plan-to-tackle-river-pollution-ready/articleshow/82438247.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Many live with guilt of infecting, causing death of loved ones||HYDERABAD: A 27-year-old doctor who had contracted Covid-19 and had lost his sister to the infection, is now on medication for anxiety and depression. He feels he was responsible for her death. “I knew that my family was at risk and although I isolated myself when I reached home after work, I could have moved out of the house instead,” said Sayeed, who continues to experience sleep disturbances and nightmares even two months after the death because of the guilt. Live updates: CoronavirusKalyan P’s father died of Covid-19. “Initially, my wife and I tested positive for Covid-19. We immediately went into isolation, but, within three days my parents tested positive. My father’s oxygen level went down drastically, but we couldn’t even get a bed in hospital. We somehow managed to get an oxygen cylinder and started his treatment at home, but he died in the last week of April,” said Kalyan adding that it was because of him his father died as he kept on postponing getting them vaccinated due to office work. There are many such people who feel that their infection led to the death of a loved one. They are carrying this heavy burden on their shoulders despite having recovered from Covid-19. Unable to come out of the guilt, they have sought help from psychologists. Guilt, psychologists say, is part of grief. But when it continues for too long, it can become dangerous to the point where a patient contemplates suicide. Read AlsoAnxiety and agony adding to Covid woes in DelhiAmit Sengupta, a marketing professional, made a list of people two weeks ago. His friends and uncle had just tested positive for Covid-19, and he thought he would regularly call the listed infected people to keep their morale high. “The list has become longer in the last few days with many other“Grief starts with denial, then anger, then depression, then the brain starts reconstructing and finally the stage of acceptance. But not everyone can go through these stages successfully and that’s is when cognitive therapy is useful,” said Dr Virinchi Sharma, consultant psychiatrist and director of Manasa Hospital. One of the patients Dr Sharma is treating had contemplated suicide. “He worked in a pharmacy and was the sole breadwinner in the family. After he contracted the virus, almost everyone in his family was infected. His mother having multiple comorbidities did not survive and he clearly blamed himself for her death,” he added. Coronavirus: Complete coverageUsually in such cases, patients keep brooding over what happened in the countdown to the incident. “The first person who tested positive suffers from a higher level of guilt and keeps thinking that it was his or her mistake or negligence which led to the loss. The person feels one or two things done differently would have not led to death,” said Dr Anitha Are, clinical psychologist, who has seen over 10 such cases recently. She added that people with a spiritual bent were found to cope better.

The government has prohibited sales of tobacco products to prevent gatherings at such shops and help curb the spread of Covid-19. The complaints were from Satellite and Chandlodia areas of the city. In his FIR with Satellite police on Wednesday, a paan shop owner, Mukesh Parmar, 41, said that three men who were his regular customers had come to his house and asked for paan masala. When Parmar expressed his inability, given the government mandate and the fact that he had kept his shop closed, the trio began to abuse him. The trio dragged him onto the road, when Parmar objected to their behaviour. Then one of them then began beating Parmar with a stick because he had dared to refuse to sell paan masala when they had asked. Satellite police registered a complaint against the trio under charges of causing hurt, uttering of abusive words and criminal intimidation. In another complaint filed with Sola police, a 26-year-old man from Chandlodia area of city, Parth Patel, said that he was beaten by a paan shop owner and his two aides after Patel objected to the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products from the shop. Patel said that he had on Wednesday warned the paan shop owner Naresh Marwadi not to sell cigarettes flouting Covid-19 rules. This did not sit well with Marwadi, who with his two aides Shiva and Prince Desai came to Patel’s house on Wednesday, and beat him severely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-fights-over-sale-of-tobacco-products/articleshow/82441687.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC grants Bhave bail in Dabholkar murder case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday granted bail to Vikram Bhave, an accused in the 2013 murder case of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had arrested Bhave (37) in 2019. Bhave had filed appeals before HC after the special court in Pune rejected his bail plea last year. A terror offence has been invoked in the case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, apart from murder under the Indian Penal Code. Dabholkar was shot dead in Pune while on his morning walk. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said the material placed by the CBI “does not appear to show reasonable grounds to conclude that the accusations levelled against Bhave can be said to be prima facie true’’. Bhave was named by an alleged shooter during the probe. He is alleged to have shown the shooters the “way to escape on a motorcycle after committing the crime’’. His counsel Subhash Jha and Ghanshyam Upadhyay said the rejection of the bail was “erroneous’’ and the material brought on record by the CBI against him was “far-fetched’’. CBI counsel Sandesh Patil said Bhave had filed two successive bail pleas and both were rightly rejected by the Pune court as under UAPA, the court while deciding a bail plea cannot analyse the prosecution’s case in detail but only see if prima facie a case is made out. The HC said CBI may not be justified in wholly relying on the confession of the co-accused, Sharad Kalaskar, made under the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act in a case pending against him in Karnataka where Bhave is not an aaccused. Kalaskar’s confession in the Karnataka case “cannot be of significance’’ in the Dabholkar case. The HC also found some “obvious discrepancy’’ in the case records over reconstruction of the crime scene and Bhave’s role.  The HC directed Bhave’s release on bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and two sureties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-grants-bhave-bail-in-dabholkar-murder-case/articleshow/82441718.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: New government likely to sworn in on May 20||KOCHI: The swearing-in ceremony of the second Pinarayi Vijayan-led government is likely to be held on May 20. The tentative date was decided at a CPM-CPI bilateral meeting held on Thursday. The CPM leadership has requested the CPI leaders to reduce the number of the party’s cabinet berths to three from the last time’s four. “But the CPI leaders were adamant on the stand that their party should get four ministers,” a CPM leader said. The CPM is holding one-to-one meetings with each constituent of the LDF to finalize the cabinet berths and other perks to be given to them. There is a plan for cutting down the number of CPM and CPI ministers in the next cabinet so that new entrants in the front and single-MLA parties can be accommodated in the cabinet. There had been 13 members, including the chief minister, for the CPM in the outgoing cabinet. While CPI had four ministers, Janata Dal (S), NCP and Congress (S) had one representative each in the cabinet. This time, Kerala Congress (M) and Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), the new constituents in the LDF, have also demanded cabinet berth. The CPM is mooting a plan that the single-MLA parties can be given a cabinet berth if they merge and become a single party. “In the coming days, discussions with the constituent parties will continue. It is expected that the discussions with the major constituents can be completed by May 12. After that, CPM will have to take a decision on whether the party is to forgo one or two cabinet berths for accommodating other constituents,” sources with CPM said. The CPM state secretariat which held a couple of days ago had decided to complete all the meetings and procedures for the formation of the government by May 18. The LDF meeting to be held on May 17 and the CPM state secretariat scheduled for May 18 will take a final decision on the date for the swearing-in ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-govt-likely-to-sworn-in-on-may-20/articleshow/82440441.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: No bail for lab owner booked for fake RT-PCR reports||AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Thursday denied bail to Nilesh Vaghela, 33, who was arrested for allegedly issuing fake Covid-19 test reports to people from his laboratory, though it was not authorized to conduct RT-PCR tests for Covid-19. Vaghela was arrested and his Gayatri Laboratory in Vatva was sealed by police on April 13. He was booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Medical Practitioner Act because he was issuing Covid reports even though he was not a qualified doctor. He was remanded in police custody for five days. When Vaghela filed a bail plea claiming innocence, public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt opposed it vehemently and argued that Vaghela issued reports in the name of Sterling Accurist Wellness Pvt Co Ltd. He allegedly illegally prepared a seal and forged letterhead of the company. He has been accused of forging the signature of Dr M D Patel. Action was taken after it was verified with this company that the RT-PCR test reports issued were fake. After hearing the arguments, additional sessions judge V V Parmar observed, “This court cannot lose sight of the fact that cases of Covid-19 are on a surge and the situation has become uncontrollable. This act of the applicant in the present situation cannot be viewed lightly and no leniency needs to be shown towards the present applicant.” The court also took into consideration the submissions made by the prosecution that the probe is under way and granting bail to the accused could have an impact on the investigation and that he may not be available for the trial in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-bail-for-lab-owner-booked-for-fake-rt-pcr-reports/articleshow/82441712.cms||---

Around 22 tonnes of medical waste were generated every week. Earlier, it used to be around eight tonnes per week which translates into a whopping 300% rise. There is, however, a demand for increasing the medical waste treatment facilities in the state as well. There are eight functioning facilities and seven more are being proposed, the requirement of which is being felt during Covid times. Currently, majority of the waste being generated from hospitals is related to Covid which his being collected by the vehicles and dumped at the facility established for the medical waste. The quantity of waste generated is lower than last year when more than 28 tonne of garbage was being generated every week. A senior official of State Pollution Control Board said that strict guidelines are being followed while disposing of the medical waste. “We have made the guidelines available to all the department and waste is being disposed of on that basis. We have already proposed seven medical waste disposal plants some are ready to be started and some are yet to be approved. With the pandemic, we are hopeful that we will get the permission sooner.” Medical waste is disposed of in an incinerator where waste is burnt out in a few minutes without eliminating pollutants in the environment. Either this or waste is buried deep in pits but medical incinerator is the standardize procedure with less pollution. With eight facilities, many districts are dumping their medical waste at one place. Like Jaipur gets medical waste of Duasa, Sikar, Churu. Whereas Alwar takes care of medical waste of Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/corona-treatment-300-spike-in-med-waste-over-3-weeks/articleshow/82441713.cms||---

---||Nagpur||HC permits 29-year-old rape survivor to terminate pregnancy||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court allowed a 29-year-old rape survivor to terminate her 16 weeks old fetus under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971. She knocked the judiciary’s doors after lodging a police complaint against boyfriend, who allegedly exploited her under the pretext of providing a job. He also allegedly spiked her drink when he called her at his home and took her obscene photographs and videos. He then also married her secretly at the Arya Samaj, but after realising that she was pregnant, he severed all relations with her. She later came to know that the boyfriend was already married and was having kids. The survivor then filed FIR for rape against the man at Ranapratap Nagar police station and then filed a plea in HC for pregnancy termination last week. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote asked the HC Legal Service Committee to provide her a lawyer to plead the case. Accordingly, Sweety Bhatia was appointed to plead her case, based on her vast experiences of successfully pleading many such similar cases of MTP Act. In first hearing on April 27, the bench directed the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) dean to constitute a medical board as per government resolution (GR) of August 14, 2017 to examine her. The board submitted its report on April 30. Union ministry for health and family welfare through counsel Mugdha Chandurkar and State Public Health Department through lawyer NR Patil were made respondents along with GMCH dean. “The report shows that there is a unanimous opinion of all members that it would be in the patient’s interest to undergo MTP with due informed risk and obtaining consent. She would also be taking optimum necessary precautions at the time of operation.” The judges added that they need to go by the experts’ opinion and permit the premature MTP in spite of the fact that it was 16 weeks and two days old. “Accordingly, we permit her MTP as per the conditions mentioned in the experts’ report.” The survivor however informed that she doesn’t want to undergo MTP at GMCH due to the threat of Covid-19 from hundreds of patients admitted there and she should be allowed to approach a private hospital. The bench then asked her to approach the District Level Committee (DCC) as per Section 4 of the MTP Act seeking necessary approval. “We partly allow the petition by granting permission to the petitioner, to undergo the MTP procedure at a place which would be approved by DCC. We grant liberty to her to file an application before the DCC which should be decided in accordance with the law,” the justices said before disposing of the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-permits-29-year-old-rape-survivor-to-terminate-pregnancy/articleshow/82441717.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Jaipur||CMIE: Joblessness rate at record 28% in April||JAIPUR: Unemployment rate in Rajasthan shot up to 28% in April, the second highest among the states after Haryana, according to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). After a dip in March to 19.7% from 25% in February this year, the April figures reflect a trend of high unemployment witnessed in the state over the past two years. In fact, the CMIE data base shows that the double digit rates started from October 2018 and has been only increasing since then barring in couple of months when it fell to single digit. Explaining the reasons for high unemployment rates in Rajasthan, Alka Batra, promoter of an oldest recruiting agency, said, “In the past 3 years, very few new investments have come in the state. Existing companies are also not expanding. MSMEs, which generate bulk of the employment are not in the fine fettle.” Batra said that the bad situation became worse after the outbreak of the pandemic. “I think the situation is worse than the CMIE data projects. For this, the pandemic is reason. But in any way, we have not been able to attract enough investments to Rajasthan,” added Batra. When asked about the high unemployment rates in the state, labour secretary Neeraj K Pawan said that CMIE is a private agency and he does not know how it collects data. Since 2016, the unemployment rate remained below 10% till mid of 2018. Haryana is another state where the unemployment rate has remained higher for a longer time than Rajasthan. In the past two years, whatever new investments have come or been proposed are in the renewable energy sector which does not create enough jobs, as per experts. Suresh Agarwal, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry, said, “MSMEs in the state are not in the pink of health. Somehow they are managing. They cannot expand capacity because in Rajasthan everything is expensive, be it price of land, electricity or water.” Agarwal said unless the state government changes strategy, entrepreneurs won’t put in money in Rajasthan. “Investments are key to generate employment. For investments, the state needs to reduce the cost of setting up a business,” added Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cmie-joblessness-rate-at-record-28-in-april/articleshow/82441686.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government to give free wood for the cremation of Covid-19 patients||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand government, which has been recording an average of 100 Covid-19 deaths per day for the past one week, has decided to provide free fuelwood from Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation (UAFDC) for the cremation of the deceased patients. The state has witnessed 3,293 deaths due to Covid since the pandemic broke out last year in March. Almost 85% of cremations of Covid patients are taking place in the plain districts of Dehradun, Haridwar, US Nagar and Nainital. And the remaining 15% are being conducted in the hill districts. It is estimated that on an average more than 1,200 tons of wood is being used daily at various cremation grounds in Uttarakhand. “In such testing times, when the lockdown is in place and many loved ones of the deceased cannot even go for the last rites, this is the least that we can do for our people. The state government will pay for all the last rites done during Covid-19 in Uttarakhand under the CM Rrelief Fund,” said Harak Singh Rawat, state forest minister. He added that in many cases of Covid deaths, the last rites are being done by people who are not family members.“These are Good Samaritans, volunteers or the state-appointed workers. Such people are serving humanity, and we have to amplify their efforts,” said Rawat, adding that the order has been extended for the cremation of any unclaimed body found anywhere in the state. Meanwhile, newly-appointed managing director of UAFDC, D J K Sharma, said that the auction of fuelwood for cremation has been stopped till May 31and transportation of the wood from the Kumaon region to Garhwal has been prioritised to meet the rising demand. Uttarakhand has almost 24,303.04 sq km of forest cover, which makes up 45.44% of its geographical area, according to the Forest Survey of India. It has 12 major timber depots. Notably, a few neighbouring states had also approached the UAFDC to provide wood for cremation but the state is unable to facilitate the demand. “Right now, we have just enough wood for cremations for the next ten days. Therefore, we don’t want to supply wood to other states," said Rawat. He added that he has directed the officials to fell trees to meet requirements. “I have asked for dry as well as rotten trees to be felled so that they can be used for cremation by the needy,” added Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-government-to-give-free-wood-for-the-cremation-of-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82440447.cms||Shivani Azad

The police said Keshwani had hired 10 residents from Sant Nyaneshwar Nagar to insert a lakh such sticks — two in each packet — for Rs 20 for 1,000 packets. The police got hold of Keshwani late at night and were investigating how and from where he had obtained the large stock of sticks and to whom he was supposed to supply the finished product.The FDA team that jointly investigated the case along with the police found that Keshwani was using the name ‘BioSwab’, a foreign company involved in manufacturing swab sticks, on the pack. The FDA and the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation instructed all labs and doctors not to use sticks in packets bearing the name of the company.The FDA found that on the packet there was no mention of the manufacturing date, expiry date and batch number, which is compulsory.The officials sealed Keshwani’s office in Khemani.“The police team and we will try to find out where Keshwani has hidden stocks which he picked up from residents after the video had gone viral and before our team reached the houses for raid,” an FDA official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-supplier-detained-and-office-sealed-in-swab-stick-case/articleshow/82443786.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Hyderabad||Telangana turns to Karnataka, TN for test kits, abroad for oxygen equipment||Hyderabad: Facing demand for more antigen kits and need for uninterrupted supply of oxygen, the Telangana government has now turned its eyes towards two southern neighbours and abroad. Now, antigen kits will be sourced from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, while Telangana will import all oxygen supply-related equipment from foreign countries, as local companies are supplying to large number of states facing similar crisis. “We are trying not to depend on one area for more supplies, and are looking at different states to get the kits. Now we are trying to source more from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, as it is easy getting from there,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary (industries and commerce). “But we will not stop sourcing from the distributors around Delhi as well,” he added. The state at one point struggled to get kits as many of the antigen kit suppliers were based around Delhi, which is facing a huge outbreak of Covid-19 cases. “We procure anywhere around six to seven lakh kits every week but now the supply will be improved further,” Ranjan added. With the increasing demand all over the states for more kits, suppliers are giving limited kits everywhere. The Telangana government at one point of time even wrote to the Centre asking for more kits to boost oxygen supply. “We are trying to source oxygen-related equipment from other countries wherever possible as the medical cargo with flights is still permitted, despite commercial flight banned to India by some countries,” one official said. Officials denied that tests have been less due to shortage of kits. “We are only focusing on symptomatic people to break the virus spread chain and give them treatment immediately. Those who need testing are getting it done, and there is no concern in that area,” Jayesh Ranjan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-turns-to-karnataka-tn-for-test-kits-abroad-for-oxygen-equipment/articleshow/82442799.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The state saw 17,532 new cases on the day. Some 16,044 people were discharged from hospitals from across the state. However, 161 people lost their lives with the toll in Jaipur crossing the 1,000 mark.

We have already intimated the government,” said a spokesman of a private hospital. Meanwhile, health minister Raghu Sharma intervened and promised oxygen supply to these hospitals. At least 10 private hospitals had put up notices saying they will not take new admissions due to the non-availability of oxygen cylinders.

Singh alleged the government was fudging figures. “People are dying due to unavailability of beds, oxygen, ICU beds, ventilators and required medicine in Telangana. There is also no speedy testing done for Covid-19 patients,” he said. Singh said that the chief secretary’s claims that the Covid-19 situation was under control under the guidance of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao were baffling. “KCR is busy in a political slugfest with his former health minister Eatala Rajender. When the situation has become unmanageable, ousting the health minister and health secretary is unfortunate. The government’s credibility is at stake,” he said and added that remarks of the chief secretary were a “laughing stock” The former DG urged the Telangana government to learn from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka on combating the virus. “Fudging the numbers and under-reporting of positive cases do not lead to controlling Covid-19,” he said. Singh said that instead of making false statements, the TRS government should first save lives. “I do not endorse the charges of opposition parties. The current government is neither worse nor good than previous regimes. Health infrastructure has been neglected for 60 years,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-underplaying-covid-situation-alleges-former-dg/articleshow/82442914.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Old City gold losing glitter as workers head home||HYDERABAD: Reeling under the second wave of Covid-19 infections, Hyderabad’s famous gold ornaments industry in Old City has been badly hit with thousands of goldsmiths leaving the city for their native places. The near Rs 1,000 crore business is down by almost half with most marriages and ceremonies postponed as a result of the pandemic. The workforce of goldsmiths, comprising largely of migrant workers from Bengal, Odisha, and Bihar, are now taking the first available train out of town. Mounting financial distress and a fear of contracting the virus has led to a halt in operations of around 500 big and mid-sized shops dotted across the by-lanes of Ghansi Bazaar, Gulzar Houz, and Chellapura. “I used to work at a leading jewellery store. I have seen several of my friends succumb to the virus and some did not even get oxygen supply. Under such conditions, I feel scared and hence I am leaving for home,” said Srimon Surdas, a goldsmith from Odisha. “From what I know, around 1,500 to 2,000 workers if not more, have already the city,” he says. Another goldsmith, Sumanthu Dhara, counted and said that 11 of his friends working at multi-storied jewellery factory have already returned home while the remaining were packing and preparing to leave on May 17. He said the business was down and there simply is no work left. “The dull business doesn’t allow us to bear expenses in Hyderabad. My wife and kids are calling me every day as they are worried about the situation,” said Dhara, who will soon leave for his hometown in West Bengal. A lack of medical facilities and the unavailability of vaccine in the city has exacerbated the woes of workers of the gold industry which is divided in to around 500 to 600 shops and several hundred production units which also serve as homes for those involved in the city’s gold business. A Razzaq Malik, a jewellery shop owner explained that his business took a sudden hit after showing small signs of recovery from the impact of the first wave of the pandemic last year. “I had around 23 boys with me, dealing in design and making attractive jewellery. All of sudden everything has changed and they have gone home as the market is seeing tough days,’’ Malik said. Suman Aura and Lucky Das, both goldsmiths, fear they will contract the virus if they stay in the city any longer. “Over 75 per cent of goldsmiths have left Old City. “The remaining waiting anxiously to get the vaccine and continue to work but they fear that if a lockdown was imposed, they will face a challenge to survive,” said a spokesman from the local jewellery association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-gold-losing-glitter-as-workers-head-home/articleshow/82442976.cms||---

Moments after senior counsel for Deshmukh, Amit Desai, began his submissions, additional SG Anil Singh for the CBI said the petition copy was served on Wednesday and he needed four weeks. He said that as far as interim relief was concerned, he would be ready to argue. Desai, citing urgency, said he would seek interim relief of “no coercive steps”. A bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale observed that since the CBI had been served on Wednesday and had asked for time, it should be given reasonable time. The high court then gave Deshmukh liberty to move the vacation bench in case of extreme urgency with 48-hour notice to the CBI. The bench passed an order stating that Singh had sought four weeks, which is “vehemently opposed by Desai” who submits “there is an urgency”. The high court said it was inclined to grant the CBI reasonable time to file its reply, but on Desai’s request, granted Deshmukh liberty to approach the court for any extremely urgent relief during the court vacation, but with prior notice to the CBI. Deshmukh’s petition said the FIR followed a “biased, dubious” inquiry, “with ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta” against him. Calling the first information report (FIR) against him “false”, Deshmukh said that prior sanction was necessary to register the FIR against him as he was a minister when the offence was alleged to have occurred. He said the FIR made “bald and vague allegations” and no case of allegations of “illegal gratification” under Section 7 of the PCA or criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The FIR is to have him “arrested, with an ulterior motive”, said the former minister. The petition said the high directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry and to take further steps “in accordance with law”. He said since the state had last year withdrawn its general consent to the CBI for investigation of offences occurring here, barring a direct order by the high court or the Supreme Court, which was lacking in the case, the agency could not lodge an FIR and investigate it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-bombay-hc-relief-for-deshmukh-in-graft-case/articleshow/82445932.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Hospitals, hotels join hands for isolation facilities, beds||AHMEDABAD: When availability of hospital beds in Ahmedabad is at a low, a few private hospitals have collaborated with hotels in the city to set up isolation facilities and oxygen beds for patients. For a charge, these hotels provide residents with isolation facilities, meals and medical attention from the hospital’s doctors. Many also have oxygen cylinders on standby, so patients’ medical needs can be addressed. “We have collaborated with Medilink and Shalby Hospital to help treat Covid patients. Some 45 rooms at the hotel have been dedicated to patients with mild to moderate Covid. They are provided meals and the supervision of doctors. The treatment is managed by the hospitals with daily visits by paramedics or doctors to monitor patients’ health,” said Atul Buddhraja, general manager, Ramada Hotel, which has reserved at least 50% of its room inventory for Covid care. The hotel also offers isolation facilities. Hotels are offering these services in collaboration with hospitals at prices ranging upwards of Rs 10,000 per day. Some have also made oxygen cylinders available. Pride Hotel in Ahmedabad is another such case. Koustuv Mukherjee, group head, Gujarat, Pride Group of Hotels, said, “Patients with oxygen saturation levels of more than 94% can get admitted to our hotel. We’ve earmarked two floors with 50 rooms which are available on single or double occupancy basis. The hotel provides patients meals and tea. If the patient needs to consult a doctor or oxygen support, these are available and will be charged accordingly.” A couple of other hotels on Ashram Road have also converted their properties into Covid care facilitys where patients who are asymptomatic or those with mild symptoms can be isolated.The Grand Bhagwati on SG Road has also dedicated eight rooms for doctors who deployed on 104 ambulances. Hoteliers say the initiative does not generate much revenue but provides a cushion at a time when the industry is reeling for a revenue shortage. “Hoteliers who have converted their properties into isolation centres are getting some revenue to meet their cost of operations. The hospitality sector has been going through a bad phase for a year and the lockdown-like restrictions have only worsened it,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hospitals-hotels-join-hands-for-isolation-facilities-beds/articleshow/82441740.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Home care packages focus on hobbies to aid recovery||HYDERABAD: Doctors treating patients under home quarantine have stressed on the importance of motivation and engagement in order to aid recovery. Several corporate hospitals have started offering home isolation packages once again, after briefly halting them towards the end of the first wave of Covid-19 infections in the state. While most home care packages offer medical guidance and monitoring, medical experts explained that it is engagement in therapeutic hobbies such as singing and painting have shown good results in reducing panic among patients and helping them cope better during the course of their treatment. Virtual consultations with doctors, lung rehabilitation through tele-physios, nutrition, dietary advice, apart from engagement activities are increasingly becoming part of home care packages of hospitals. “Our motivation and engagement experts are working on various elements like body scan and mindfulness, mindful eating, brain games and puzzles, storytelling using props, hobby development such as poetry, mimicry , singing , dancing , painting and quarantine diaries. These sessions have diverted the mindsets of Covid-19 patients from fear to positivity and has certainly helped in rapid recovery of cases,” said Dr Mahesh Joshi, chief executive officer Apollo Home Healthcare Limited. As compared to 10,000 enrolments during the entire first wave, the home care package by Apollo Hospitals has seen 10,000 enrolments in the six weeks of the second wave alone, Dr Mahesh Joshi said. In the current wave of infections, many symptoms such as cough, running nose, fever, loss of taste and smell are similar to those in the first wave but it is the novel symptoms such as persistent high-grade fever with chills, and gastrointestinal issues which tend to make patients more anxious. “More than 70 per cent of patients with these symptoms who visited the hospital were advised home quarantine with proper instructions on how to monitor their health at home and when to come to the hospital. It is seen that anxiety unnecessarily worsens their situation, making them more sick,” according to director of home care services at Medicover Group of Hospitals, Dr Satheesh Kumar Kailasam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/home-care-packages-focus-on-hobbies-to-aid-recovery/articleshow/82442881.cms||Amrita Didyala

The express, which started from Hapa in Gujarat, passed through Madar, Kishangarh, Phulera, Ringas, Srimadhopur and Rewari stations of North Western Railway’s Jaipur Division before reaching the national capital. A green corridor was also built for this train in which three oxygen tankers were loaded. The crew was replaced at Phulera station. Special monitoring and escorting is being done by the Railway Protection Force while transporting oxygen cylinders to railway hospitals in all the four divisions of North Western Railway. According to Lt Shashi Kiran, deputy general manager (General) and chief public relations officer, North Western Railway, during the first wave, migrant special trains were also operated by NWR and at that time the Railway Protection Force had escorted 781 worker special trains.

---||Business||Natco rolls out Baricitinib ahead of approval for patent waiver||HYDERABAD: Even as it has filed for a compulsory licence for Covid-19 drug Baricitinib in India, Natco Pharma has already begun rolling out its generic version of the rheumatoid arthritis drug under the Barinat brand. Natco launched its 4mg tablets at Rs 30 a piece on Thursday and stocks of the drug are already in the market, sources with know of the matter told TOI. The 4mg dosage tablet accounts for nearly 95% of the market for this drug for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, they added. Barinat is priced at less than 1% or nearly one-hundredth the price of the innovator drug Olumiant, which is pegged at around Rs 3,230 per tablet. According to analysts, by going ahead with a drug rollout without waiting for the CL, Natco runs the risk of being sued for infringement by the patent holder. While the patent for Olumiant is held by Incyte Holdings, the drug is marketed by giant Eli Lilly. But Eli Lilly, which also got restricted emergency use approval for Baricitinib 2mg and 4mg from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Monday, said that it is “working with local Indian pharma companies to execute royalty-free voluntary licensing agreements to accelerate manufacturing and distribution of the medicine in India during the pandemic”. In a press communique issued earlier this week, Lilly also said it will be donating Baricitinib tablets to the Indian government, including an immediate initial donation of 4 lakh tablets for eligible hospitalised Covid-19 patients. The Barinat 1mg and 2mg tablets, to be priced at Rs 15 and Rs 20 a piece, respectively, will be rolled out shortly, sources added. The Barinat launch comes less than a week after Natco received emergency use approval from the CDSCO for the Covid-19 drug. Baricitinib, approved by USFDA for use with Remdesivir in November 2020, prevents a cytokine storm that Covid-19 triggers. In its CL application, filed under Section 92 of the Patents Act, Natco had cited unmet medical needs due to lack of supply and affordability in light of the grave and life-threatening national public health emergency as the main grounds for seeking the CL. Natco’s application said Olumiant is not manufactured in India and less than 9,000 tablets were imported in 2019 and 2020, which were enough to meet the needs of only around 600 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/natco-rolls-out-baricitinib-ahead-of-approval-for-patent-waiver/articleshow/82442841.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 3 held for peddling Remdesivir in Warangal||WARANGAL: Local police on Thursday seized 29 vials of Remdesivir and arrested three persons who were indulging in illegal sale of the drug in Warangal town. According to police commissioner Dr Taruna Joshi, the arrested persons included a pharmacist and two pharmacy assistants. The commissioner said the accused had formed a group and were hoarding Remdesivir vials which is being widely used for treating Covid-19 patients. Task force sleuths and Subedari police arrested Kumaraswamy, the pharmacist and two pharmacy assistants — Bagaji Manohar and Ayita Ashol. Police seized Rs 20,000 cash from the accused. During interrogation, the accused confessed while the pharmacist said the two assitants devised the plan seeing the spike in demand for Remdesivir injections. The two assistants, police said, work at a medical counter of a private hospital, had sketched out a plan to hoard the vials of Remdesivir and sell them outside at a higher price. As part of their plan, the duo raised an order for vials of Remdesivir with Hetero, the pharmaceutical manufacturing the drug under the name of their medical store. Upon receiving the shipment of the vials, the accused started selling the drug, charging anywhere between Rs 35,000 and Rs Rs 45,000 for each injection as against the company price of Rs 2,800. Pharmacies are allowed to sell the drug for Rs 3,490 per injection. In view of the current situation where many Covid-19 patients are being treated using Remdesivir, the accused had devised the plan to sell the drug through the black market. Acting on a tip-off, task force sleuths and Subedari police raided the pharmacy, seized vials of the drug along with Rs 20,000 in cash. The arrested have been sent in judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-held-for-peddling-remdesivir-in-warangal/articleshow/82442925.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

Reason? There are no doctors at the Cottage Hospital in Lunawada to operate these. The ventilators have been procured during and after the first wave of Covid-19. Sources said that three of these ventilators were procured by the district administration while the remaining five were provided by the government. The difficulty, however, is that the hospital does not have a physician, anaesthetist, intensivist or pulmonologist. While there is a desperate need to put them to use, but there is none to put a patient on the machine and then monitor it. Mahisagar district collector R B Barad said that the hospital even did not have a physician and a private practitioner was roped in temporarily. “Ventilators need round-the-clock experts. We have raised a demand for a physician with the state government,” he said. Sources added that the re-elected representatives of the district had also raised the issue with the state government. Till a doctor is appointed at the hospital, the precious equipment may not be of much use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sans-doctors-8-ventilators-lie-idle-in-lunawada-hospital/articleshow/82439310.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Goa||Even after multiple fines, Margao municipality continues to burn waste||Margao: Prashant Maurya has written to the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) over the failure of authorities in eliminating the hazards posed by roadside burning of waste. Over the last 10 years, Maurya has innumerable letters to the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) and the GSPCB urging them to take steps to end the menace of roadside burning of waste which poses environmental and health hazards. Acting on his letters, the board fined the MMC Rs 25,000 each time for violation of pollution control laws. However, the punitive action hasn’t translated into any change in the ground situation so far. “The roadside waste is still being burnt with impunity. The Margao municipality has still not mended its ways. The fact remains that the real issue has still not been addressed. Neither MMC has stopped doing it, nor has it taken any steps to influence shopkeepers and general public to curb this malpractice,” Maurya told TOI. Painting a sordid picture of how MMC garbage collection workers resort to burning of waste, Maurya in his letter to the pollution control board said, “Every second day, women in green sarees can still be seen burning the piles. They have been given a bamboo basket, just to accumulate waste of few places at one point and then set it on fire. Just about 70m from Victor hospital, there is a MMC waste storage station, which is a permanent burning centre, in fact. Any time of night and day there are instances of burning piles. Just imagine what the patients are being subjected to there.” Pointing out that burning plastic, thermocol and other packaging material adds to the toxicity of the air, Maurya wrote to the board, “This has caused numerous respiratory diseases to citizens, reducing their immunity, causing cancer and other chronic diseases and higher mortality rate due to Covid-19.?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/even-after-multiple-fines-margao-municipality-continues-to-burn-waste/articleshow/82443879.cms||---
---||Delhi||Not just Covid hosps, other facilities reeling under O2 shortage too||New Delhi: It is not just the Covid hospitals that are reeling due to the oxygen scarcity, other medical facilities too are in a predicament. Care Newborn and Child Hospital in Vivek Vihar, a non-Covid hospital, was in a spot on Wednesday evening with oxygen enough for only around two hours. While the authorities gave the hospital the oxygen to survive a few hours more, a bigger crisis looms: the supplier has halted replenishments because the hospital’s name has been removed from the list of allottees. Orchid Hospital in Janakpuri, also a non-Covid facility, similarly languishes with inadequate supplies. Care Newborn and Child Hospital has so far averted a disaster and managed its daily operations. Speaking to TOI, Dr Navin Khichi, owner, said, “We sent an SOS on Wednesday evening, but managed cylinder through our various centres and through the help of some do-gooders. At Vivek Vihar, we had four babies on ventilators. We are avoiding taking in any infants requiring ventilator support and high flow of oxygen. After we approached the authorities on Thursday, our supplier was directed to refill 20 cylinders for us, but we got only 10.” Care Newborn’s three other centres Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden and Gurgaon have around 20 babies admitted in each. Recently, the hospital had to refuse a newborn who required a ventilator because the administration wasn’t assured of consistent oxygen supply. The Vivek Vihar facility requires at least 20 cylinders every day for a smooth existence. Janakpuri’s 45-bedded Orchid Hospital, a non-Covid facility, has been managing oxygen on a day-to-day basis. The hospital authorities revealed that earlier the vendor would send stocks to the institution, but now the hospital had to send its vehicles to the supplier every day. “Sometimes it takes seven hours or more to get the cylinders refilled,” claimed Dr Hari Om Gupta, owner of the hospital. “The administrators are trying their best and are even working overtime to make sure there are no glitches. We are admitting patients who are critical. Pregnant women in labour are also coming to us for deliveries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-just-covid-hosps-other-facilities-reeling-under-o2-shortage-too/articleshow/82443798.cms||---

One of them, Dushyant Tyagi (52) from Rajha village, died on the day of the results on Tuesday without even knowing that he had won the polls. He was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Moradabad after his condition deteriorated. The other candidate, Amrish Kumar (45) from Mathna village, died in hospital a day after being elected on Wednesday. Sources said both candidates were involved in intense campaigning in villages during the polls. Tyagi’s family members said he was taken ill a few days before declaration of the results. He was admitted to a private hospital in Moradabad, where he was tested positive for Covid-19. Then, his condition began to deteriorate, and he succumbed on Tuesday evening. Tyagi never lived to learn that he had won by 45 votes and was elected as the pradhan of Rajha of Asmoli block in Sambhal. Amrish Kumar, who contested from Mathna village, was admitted to a private hospital 10 days before voting after he complained of difficulty in breathing. He, too, tested positive later and succumbed to the infection on Wednesday afternoon, a day after the election results were declared. He won by 86 votes.According to health department officials in Sambhal, as many as 7,780 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the district since the second wave of the pandemic hit the state in March-end. At present, there are 2,002 active cases of Covid-19 across the district while 67 people have so far succumbed to the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-gram-pradhans-in-ups-sambhal-win-polls-but-lose-battle-to-covid/articleshow/82440551.cms||Maria Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi hospitals breathe easier, but erratic supply still a headache||NEW DELHI: Finally, after a fortnight of living desperately, Delhi’s hospitals breathed just a wee bit easily on Thursday, though most of the medical centres still felt the oxygen situation remained unpredictable. “We can’t say the crisis is over,” said Dr P K Bhardwaj, chief executive director and head of surgery, Saroj Hospital. “The uncertainty about supplies and reduced quotas are matters of concern. It is an ongoing fight.” Refilling of empty oxygen cylinders is a time-consuming exercise and keeps ambulances and manpower needlessly preoccupied. Like many other small medical facilities, Saroj Hospital also faces a shortage of medicines such as antiviral drug Remdesivir and Tocilizumab and is cautious about admitting new patients. At Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj, which has been living dangerously these past few days, Dr K Preetham, medical superintendent, said, “We still have to send our vehicles to different locations to get our cylinders refilled. We are indeed getting the liquid oxygen supplies, but only around 2 metric tonnes of the 5 the hospital requires every day.” After managing to get some oxygen cylinders refilled, the hospital was optimistic of “surviving till Friday morning”. Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka has been in a better state in the past 36 hours, but is monitoring the situation every 12 hours. Dr Aashish Chaudhry, managing director, said, “There is always a reason to worry about at least once in a day. But, over all there is a slight improvement in the oxygen situation for our hospital. We require around 6 MT, but have been getting only 3 MT. Our vendor is only supplying half of what we were getting earlier due to changes made in the allotment by the government. We have been trying to manage by getting our own cylinders and refilling them, but that is a problem too in terms of time and hospital resources involved. We hope the situation gets better now.” Most hospital authorities also complained that the amount of oxygen filled in the cylinders appeared to be less than what the vessels could hold. “We have been noticing for some days that some of the refilled cylinders last for 20 minutes or half an hour while others get depleted in just 15 minutes — which is a clear indication that a cylinder hasn’t been filled to its full capacity,” said a doctor in an outer Delhi hospital. “Also, we realise that government hospitals are given priority over private hospitals.” Bhardwaj of Saroj Hospital highlighted the shortage of critical drugs, such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. “Some patients require it and we haven’t been able to source the drug from our supplier for two days apparently because it’s out of stock,” he said. On Wednesday, Shanti Mukund Hospital had similarly alleged a scarcity of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-breathe-easier-but-erratic-supply-still-a-headache/articleshow/82443854.cms||---
---||Kolkata||9 out of 10 patients in Kolkata hospitals are on oxygen support||KOLKATA: With almost nine out of 10 patients in hospitals now requiring oxygen support, the demand for medical oxygen has more than doubled in the past few weeks. While hospitals had to refill their oxygen tanks once in two days earlier, some of them are now requiring a refill two times a day. “Our daily oxygen consumption has doubled from about 3,000kl to 6,000kl. Out of the 270 Covid patients admitted at RN Tagore Hospital, around 80% require oxygen support. Luckily, our LMO tank can hold 11,000kl. But now we are getting it refilled every day so that we are prepared,” said R Venkatesh zonal director (East), Narayana Health. At Ruby General Hospital, the LMO tank with a capacity of 3,000 litres is being refilled twice daily. More than half of the 170 Covid patients in ICU and HDU need high oxygen flow support while many in the wards also require oxygen therapy. “Even till March-end, we would require refilling only on alternate days. Now the consumption has hit the roof. Most patients coming to the hospital now require oxygen support,” said Subhasish Datta, general manager, operations at Ruby General Hospitals. On Thursday, the city recorded 3,887 fresh cases, taking the active cases count to 26,269. Many are waiting at home till they find a hospital bed. By the time they reach a hospital, some of them already have dangerously low oxygen saturation that makes them require to be put on devices like HNFC consuming 50 to 60 litres of oxygen per minute. “We have 220 Covid patients and almost everyone is needing some level of oxygen or the other. While we are getting our LMO tank refilled everyday we have also kept 110 cylinders as back up. But we cant rely on these cylinders for the patients who require high oxygen therapy,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. During the first wave Bengal never faced any oxygen crisis while many other states complained of its shortage. “Under normal condition the oxygen consumption would be around 1,500 cubic meters a day. Now with 170 Covid patients, the consumption has doubled up. So far the supply is uninterrupted, despite the rising demand,” said Sudipta Mitra CEO Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/9-out-of-10-patients-in-kolkata-hosps-are-on-oxygen-support/articleshow/82441825.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

It has been alleged that these actions were in reaction to the quashing of the Maratha reservation. NCP and Congress leaders claim the stone pelters and those who burnt the dung cakes belong to the BJP and are not related to any Maratha outfit. Police deployment outside Desai’s home, NCP and Congress offices have now been increased. Shashikant Shinde, NCP’s member of legislative council and leader from Satara said, “We have appealed to the police to nab those who pelted stones within 24 hours. I believe that the Maratha youth will not resort to such violence. It is the BJP’s ploy to create social tensions by making false accusations.” Shinde said the BJP had passed Maratha reservation law despite knowing that it would not stand legal scrutiny after the 102 Constitutional Amendment that cancelled the right of the state legislature to grant reservations. No one from BJP or any Maratha outfit has taken the responsibility for the stone pelting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ministers-home-cong-ncp-offices-targeted/articleshow/82438496.cms||---

---||Nashik||Fuel prices go up in Nashik for third consecutive day||Nashik: Fuel prices in Nashik city continued to increase for the third consecutive day with petrol and diesel being sold at Rs 97.84 and Rs 87.63 respectively on Thursday.Prices of petrol and diesel were stable since April 15, but has started increasing marginally from Tuesday. While price of petrol increased by 66 paise, diesel got dearer by 81 paise in the last three days. The price of premium petrol has also increased by 68 paise to Rs 100.69 in the last three days. There has been continuous rise in fuel prices since November and the prices have increased several times. Vijay Thakre, vice-president of Federation of All Maharashtra Petrol Dealers’ Association (FAMPEDA), said main reason for rise in price of petrol and diesel depends on price of international crude oil, dollar exchange rates, various taxes of state and central government and adoption of daily rate change method adopted by the central government.According to office-bearers of petrol dealers association in Nashik, the state and central government should reduce taxes to bring down fuel prices.According to farmers, agricultural activities, undertaken with the help of tractors, have become costlier. “Farming activities are carried through tractor-mounted equipment. The charges for ploughing and other activities have increased by 30-35% during eight months due to continuous rise in fuel prices,” Nivrutti Nyaharkar, an onion farmer, said.“This will increase the cost of production for farmers, but farmers are getting less returns compared to the cost of production. The government should provide diesel to farmers at subsidized rates,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fuel-prices-go-up-in-nashik-for-third-consecutive-day/articleshow/82438542.cms||Tushar Pawar

More than 300 patients are currently undergoing treatment at the state’s nodal hospital for Covid-19. A single mistake could have led to anything untoward, especially for those patients on high oxygen need. “We did two things to repair the existing vaporiser and install a new one to share the load, during which the centralised pipe had to be shut,” said Asis Manna, medical superintendent and vice principal at ID&BG. A vaporiser converts the LMO from the tank to gas before it is supplied to patients through the pipeline. While the team of engineers operated from the site of the LMO tank the medical team led by doctors Sayantan Banerjee, Yogiraj Ray and Debojyoti Majumder were in the hospital ward for the switchover. The synchronisation was done over conference call. The health department had deputed additional doctors and nurses from other hospitals to tackle the situation in case anything went wrong. The supply from the LMO tank resumed after about 35 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/35-minute-oxygen-tension-at-id-hosp/articleshow/82441884.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The girl was rushed to the district hospital in Moradabad, but given her critical condition, she was referred to a higher medical facility. As the video of the incident — captured by a CCTV camera on Tuesday — triggered widespread public outrage on social media, police, who had initially registered a non-cognisable report in this connection, booked the accused — also a minor and resident of the girl’s locality — under various IPC sections, including 376 (punishment for rape) and 354A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) on the complaint of the girl’s father. The boy was detained, said police. In the purported video, which is doing rounds on social media, a youth could be seen mercilessly beating a girl and when the girl fell unconscious, the youth left the scene on a motorcycle. Speaking to TOI, station house officer (SHO) of Majhola police station, Moradabad, Mukesh Shukla said, “The girl was rushed to the district hospital, where doctors declared her critical and referred to a higher facility. Based on the family’s complaint, an FIR was registered against the accused under sections 376 (punishment for rape), 354A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 354B (assault or use of criminal force), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offenses punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code and appropriate sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.” “The girl will be undergoing medical examination. The accused had been detained and further investigation is underway,” added the SHO.

The HC has ordered that in case the cop has been picked up without his involvement in any criminal case, he should be immediately released. Justice H S Madaan passed these orders while taking suo motu cognisance of an email received on April 30 from a person claiming to be the son of ASI. Treating the email as habeas corpus petition, the HC has sought response from the officials of the Punjab Police regarding the alleged incident. The email stated: “My father Devi Lal Asi has been forcibly taken away from outside the office of DIG by police of Cantonment police station today at 5 pm. We have apprehension of his false implication in any case as he was going to retire tomorrow.” Another email was received claiming, “Police have taken my father to Bathinda for implicating him in some case as proclaimed by police.” The third stated: “My father Devi Lal ASI who was working with STF Ferozepur had been forcefully apprehended by STF Bathinda before retirement and has been falsely roped in some cases by STF Bathinda and booked at STF Mohali police station. They have raided our residential house and proclaimed that my father Devi Lal will be implicated in other cases as they have directions from senior police officials and as such apprehend false implication of my father in other cases. Our entire family is in fear that they can also harm us. Kindly intervene into this matter.” After receiving the mail, the HC administration placed the matter on the judicial side for action. After hearing the matter, Justice Madaan on Thursday ordered, “The senior superintendent of police, Bathinda and senior superintendent of police, Mohali, are directed to give a written response to such emails by the next date of hearing. They are directed to ensure that the alleged detenue is set at liberty unless his involvement in some criminal case registered at police stations within their jurisdiction is there”.

We cannot just increase the fares when there is no (good) service,” he added. The fares were last revised in 2014, following which, rising fuel prices forced the department to propose a revision of existing fares. The Goa consumer action network (Goacan) had recently written to Satardekar asking an extension of time by ten days for the feedback, saying that the May 6 deadline was too short to offer suggestions. “The proposed revision of existing taxi fare rates is a very important subject that requires to reach not only the taxi operators and commuters but also other stakeholders in the tourism sector as well as the elected representatives from the Goa legislative assembly, zilla panchayats, municipal councils and village panchayats,” Goacan coordinator, Roland Martins had said.

The shortage of antiviral drugs like favipiravir has also hit the city pharmacies. Doxycycline started witnessing the shortage since last month. Drug manufacturers have already voiced their concerns to the central government over the increase in prices of active pharmaceutical ingredients or raw materials of certain key Covid drugs. They had also apprehended a shortage of certain drugs including doxycycline in the next few months. “We are seeing a sudden spike in demand for doxycycline and it is going off the shelf overnight,” said Sajal Ganguly, general secretary of the Bengal Chemist and Druggists’ Association (BCDA). “Our members are not getting adequate supply of certain drugs including doxycycline,” he added.  “Many of the doctors are prescribing doxycycline for Covid-19 patients in the home isolation,” said Subir Sen, north Kolkata district secretary of the BCDA. Sanjay Mukim a wholesaler at the Mehta Building said that shortage of doxycycline is continuing over the past few weeks. Meanwhile, the shortage is witnessed in certain other drugs like favipiravir that have lesser usage in Covid management. The antiviral medicine, approved by the Drugs Controller General of India for treating mild to moderate Covid-19 patients, however, is not being prescribed much as compared to last year. The trouble with the multivitamin, vitamin C and zinc tablets started after people began stocking up medicines again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shortage-of-drugs-for-cov-treatment-hits-pharmacies/articleshow/82441919.cms||Rohit Khanna

The crop residue burning cases in the ongoing wheat harvest season have registered a sharp increase compared to the last two years. Even though stubble after wheat harvesting is not as high as compared to crop residue burning after paddy harvest yet the cases have seen a sharp rise this year. A total of 203 stubble burning cases were reported on May 6, taking the total cases in the ongoing season to 3,267. Against it, only 243 crop residue burning cases were reported till May 6 in 2020. In 2019, 888 stubble burning cases were recorded till May 6. Earlier, 733 stubble burning cases were recorded on May 5, the highest so far in the ongoing season, as per data collected from Punjab Remote Sensing Centre. Before that, 594 cases were recorded four days ago on May 2. The first stubble burning cases were reported on April 17 when two cases had come to the fore. Sangrur district witnessed the most stubble burning cases so far at 552, followed by 293 in Patiala, 283 in Bathinda, 247 Ferozepur, 237 Barnala, 231 Moga, and 227 in Mansa.

The two plants will together be able to provide continuous oxygen supply to 70-80 beds, officials said. On Wednesday, a team from BEL visited the District Combined Hospital, a 100-bed L2 facility, to earmark the place for the plant. The chief medical superintendent at the hospital, Dr Sanjay Teotia, said: “The company representatives have assured us that the plant will be up and running in the next 10 days. According to them, the plant will be capable of supplying oxygen to about 30 beds continuously. Once ready, it will reduce our dependence on oxygen cylinders from outside. Currently, 35-40 patients are on oxygen support on a daily basis.”An oxygen plant had been installed at the hospital five-six years ago by a Lucknow-based company. It worked for about three years and has been lying defunct since then.For the past few months, Teotia said, they have been trying to revive the facility and the firm from Lucknow had recently sent its representatives for an inspection. But it was found that the plant cannot be revived now.Dr Teotia said the new plant will cost around Rs 30 lakh and it would be installed right next to the defunct facility.MMG District Hospital, the largest government facility in Ghaziabad with over 150 beds, is a non-Covid unit. The hospital caters to patients with emergencies and critical ailments. According to officials, with the Rs 50 lakhs donated by the minister, several oxygen concentrators would be bought soon. The oxygen plant that would be installed in the next few weeks will provide oxygen supply to around 50 beds, said an official.Apart from the District Combined Hospital and MMG District Hospital, the other prominent government facility in the district is the District Womens’ Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/two-govt-hospitals-in-gzb-to-get-own-o2-plants-soon/articleshow/82445931.cms||Aditya Dev

They have also refilled and handed over 238 cylinders that came in on the first day. According to officials, the cylinders were refilled within 24 hours, although the time limit had been fixed between 36 and 48 hours. With several residents desperately looking for oxygen, the district administration, on Wednesday, launched the initiative and set up collection points where people could drop off empty cylinders so that they could be refilled and returned for use. Collection points have been set up at each of the five municipal zones across the city. Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) is executing the plan and GMC commissioner Mahendra Singh Tanwar has been appointed as the nodal officer for overseeing the oxygen supply process. On Wednesday, 238 residents had registered and received coupons and on Thursday, 176 people applied for refilling. The maximum number of registration was done in Vasundhara zone (171 residents). It was followed by City zone (88) and Mohan Nagar zone (71), respectively. Coupons were given to people after checking documents, like a patient’s Covid report and doctor’s prescription. Sandeep Tyagi, a resident of Saddik Nagar, who got a refilled cylinder within 24 hours, said the process was smooth. “We were facing a lot of problems while getting cylinders for my 35-year-old sister-in-law whose oxygen level dropped to 70. Earlier, we wasted an entire day waiting at a refilling agency in Lal Kuan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/414-o2-cylinders-land-up-for-refill-in-2-days/articleshow/82445940.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Mumbai||How Mumbai got breather: Year before 2nd wave, BMC set up oxygen team||By: P VelrasuMuch interest has been generated on the ‘Mumbai Model’ of oxygen management after recent observations by the Supreme Court. I wonder what could make a management method unique and get its own name when the ingredients at hand seem to be common among cities. The success of the Mumbai Model can be attributed to centralization of certain aspects and decentralization of the services aspect. Understanding the requirements for Mumbai and micro-planning was essential for successful oxygen management in this mega city. Efficiently doing so in a pandemic involves many aspects, including resource and inventory mapping, generating storage capacities, and proper supply chain management. The BMC started with resource mapping and inventory accounting in May 2020 following oxygen difficulties in one of our hospitals within three months of the Covid outbreak in Mumbai. Our ‘Oxygen Team’ was asked to visit every hospital and compile data on storage capacity, supply method, suppliers’ names and supply periodicity. We accounted for much increased oxygen demand during the pandemic and expected the number of ICU and oxygenated beds to go up. The next step was to increase storage capacities by installing additional cryogenic tankers in civic hospitals. The work was completed within 40 days. Underutilized during the first Covid wave, the tanks took the load during the second Covid wave very effectively. Adequate supply of liquid medical oxygen is of paramount importance. I think this is where Delhi has faced problems. The basic supply quantity has to be sufficient even if everything else is in place. On three consecutive days Mumbai too witnessed lots of SOS calls. We shifted many patients to bigger hospitals without any casualty. Excellent teamwork was put forth by the BMC. Fortunately for Mumbai, there is an oxygen team at work round the clock in Mantralaya too. There are at least five IAS officers who work round the clock to secure increased supplies of liquid medical oxygen from new sources. Once our supply inadequacy was flagged at that level, Mumbai was allotted 30 metric tonnes from a steel plant in Raigad. Also, later supplies were augmented with tankers from Jamnagar. Had these additional supplies not been ensured in time, Mumbai too would have had problems. No amount of good management can compensate for supply inadequacies — simple and straight. Again, proper supply chain management is critical to avoid any supply disruptions. Because new difficulties can emerge any time: oxygen filling stations at manufacturing plants are lined with tankers and waiting times have become longer because now the plants are supplying real-time. When in an emergency, contacting a plant and requesting for an out-of-turn filling also helps, an option we have exercised sometimes! A point to remember is that optimising the turnover time is crucial since the number of cryotankers is limited. Currently, the oxygen team is working on future-proofing Mumbai from the shocks and exigencies of oxygen supply. We will be installing self-generating oxygen plants in all BMC hospitals as augmentation measures. The new plants will be able to cater to 100% of patients in normal times and during extreme situations too. This supply system will work well without stress even during disruptions.

So far, the government has received 3,682 oxygen concentrators and cylinders, 13 oxygen generation plants, 2,403 ventilators, BiPap units and more than 2.8 lakh Remdesivir vials from various countries. All items received up to May 5 have been allocated and dispatched to states and institutions following the health ministry's standard operating procedures which are initially aimed to aid states and institutions with high caseloads. According to government data, so far, 38 institutions in 31 states and Union Territories have received the items. "We are following 100% transparency on all foreign aid. There is not a minute's delay in allocating the relief material and moving them to their destinations," Kant told TOI, rebutting criticism about delays in getting the foreign aid to states and UTs grappling with the deadly surge in Covid-19 cases. Several countries from around the world have mounted a massive relief operation to provide critical equipment and drugs to help India in its fight against the deadly virus which has claimed over 2 lakh lives. Kant said the goods were being moved through flights and container trains and were swiftly dispatched to their destinations. Control rooms have been set up by the health ministry and the Niti Aayog to track the movement. Niti Aayog has set up a portal (http://covaid.niti.gov.in) to enable private sector donors to track the movement up to the end beneficiaries. "This will help individuals and organisations to do end-to-end tracking till the ultimate beneficiary," Kant said, adding that the control room was functional 24x7 to facilitate the movement of aid material from the private sector. Several agencies such as the Indian Red Cross Society are working round the clock in coordination with the health ministry to ensure swift movement of foreign aid. Cargo clearance and deliveries are facilitated without delay in coordination with various agencies. Kant also said a press statement would be issued daily giving details about the items received and allocated to states, a measure which will add to the transparency over the entire process. On May 5, the Centre received 1,056 ventilators, BiPaP/CPAP units, 43 oxygen cylinders from Australia, 40,300 RDK, 1.56 lakh vials of Remdesivir, PPE kits and other items from the US and two liquid oxygen containers from Bahrain. The empowered group headed by Kant met on Thursday to discuss logistical issues and ensure faster distribution of the material received from foreign countries. There was a suggestion that the relief material be sent directly to southern and western states and the material could land at Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai airports. The health ministry said the distribution plans were already in place by the time it landed in India, according to an official statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/foreign-aid-allocation-100-transparent-no-delays-kant/articleshow/82447703.cms||Surojit Gupta
---||Mumbai||Let private hospitals have own oxygen plants like in Sangli: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay HC on Thursday, in light of the expected third Covid wave, batted for private hospitals in the state to have their own oxygen manufacturing plants. “Private hospitals must have their own oxygen manufacturing plant now that the third wave is likely. If it can be done at Sangli, why not it be replicated in private hospitals?” a bench asked while hearing a clutch of PILs on remdesivir injections, beds, oxygen and testing facilities. TOI had on Thursday reported on Sangli’s Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital investing in oxygen resources. The judges also exhorted all civic bodies in the state to replicate Mumbai’s success in lowering Covid cases. “Bombay model must be replicated not only by the entire country, but also by other municipal corporations and councils in the state,” said the CJ. The bench of of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said, “This is the time to reach out to people in need. If Mumbai has tided over the crisis, should we not help others now?” Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said as active cases had decreased by 50,000 to 6.4 lakh from 6.9 lakh in Maharashtra, there was reduced burden of beds with oxygen facilities. He informed the court that jumbo Covid centres are being built near oxygen-generating industries “where oxygen can be transferred and not transported” to patients. The AG said an oxygen consumption audit is done to prevent wastage, leakage and pilferage. “There should not be a single death for want of oxygen. Your authorities have to regulate oxygen in such a manner that we don’t have casualties for want of oxygen,” said the CJ. The judges then said it is “high time” private hospitals meet their own oxygen demand. They sought from the state the logistics of setting up oxygen plants for hospitals with more than 50 beds. The judges took note of the “alarming situation” in Pune, which has the highest number of cases and double that of Mumbai. “If this is the situation in Pune, why not consider a total lockdown?” asked the CJ, adding “drastic steps” are required in places where the caseload is high, including imposing a total lockdown, so that it does not have a cascading effect on peripheral centres. Advocate Rajesh Inamdar said apart from remdesivir, there is shortage of tocilizumab injections and tamiflu pills. He said dexamethasone, recommended by WHO as more effective than remdesivir, costs only Rs 10 per vial whereas doctors recommend remdesivir which costs Rs 1,000-5,000 per vial. “Why should we go for remdesivir?’’ asked the CJ. Inamdar said tocilizumab costs starts from Rs 40,000 per vial. The judges pointed out that tocilizumab is manufactured by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche and marketed by Cipla. “If there is a low price medicine, which can be used like a sanjeevani which saved Lakshman, why go for foreign medicine?” the CJ asked. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said the Centre had told the Supreme Court three drugs are better than remdesivir. The judges questioned why no advisory was put out for cheaper alternatives to tocilizumab and remdesivir injections. “It is for you, the Central government and the state government, to put your foot down. India is not a place for multinational companies to exploit Covid-19 in a situation like this,” said the CJ. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC said there is a lot of improvement in Mumbai in terms of remdesivir, oxygen and beds. The judges said if there is a shortage in nearby areas, there must be connectivity with the BMC so that what is available with the civic body can be utilised by neighbouring districts. “We do not disrespect any municipal commissioner. Let them not be bogged down by ego. If one has done good work, let it be replicated,’’ said the CJ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/let-pvt-hospitals-have-own-o2-plants-like-in-sangli-bombay-hc/articleshow/82446039.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Chandigarh||One of 3 in Patiala jailbreak arrested||Patiala: The Patiala and Kapurthala cops have caught one of the three prisoners who escaped the Patiala central jail by breaching the cell wall and scaling the high boundary a week ago. Arrested prisoner Inderjit Singh Dhyana is from a village in Kapurthala district. Fellow prisoners Sher Singh of an Amritsar village and Jaspreet Singh ‘Nupi’ of a Kiratpur Sahib village in Ropar had escaped Chowki 09, Courtina Barrack 02, with him on the night between April 27 and 28. Facing a 22-year sentence for murder, Sher Singh was deported from the UK to serve his remaining term. Inderjit Singh Dhyana was booked in 12 cases of drug peddling, theft, and snatching in Kapurthala, while Jaspreet Singh alias Nupi was booked for a murder in the Kiratpur Sahib police jurisdiction of Ropar. Twice, he had mobile phone on him inside the jail and he was also involved in a prison brawl. Sher Singh and Inderjit Singh were transferred from Bathinda to Patiala on April 3. For the escape, they were booked at Patiala’s Tripuri police station under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Public Property Act, and the Prison Act. The team of SP city Varun Sharma, SP investigation Harmeet Singh Hundal, DSP detective Krishan Kumar Pathey, DSP city-2 Saurav Jindal, DSP circle Ghanor Jaswinder Singh Tiwana, CIA inspector Rahul Kaushal, and Tripuri SHO were part of the manhunt that covered Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Chandigarh.

---||Nagpur||All industries must spend CSR funds for Covid patients: HC||Nagpur: Asking all industries to respond to “clarion call of Covid-19 patients struggling to get beds, medicines and oxygen”, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court directed them to provide corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to fight the pandemic. “We are of opinion that, at this hour of crisis, those companies under a duty to spend CSR funds because of their earning net profit, respond to clarion call of Covid patients and make CSR funds available to the best of their ability,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said, before adjourning the hearing till Friday. Quoting Section 135 of the Companies Act, the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014, and Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ (MCA) March 23, 2020 notification, the bench noted that all these sufficiently show that an onerous responsibility has been placed upon the industries to contribute their share towards social cause, including the Covid pandemic. “We find that not only is there an authorization of law for the companies to use their CSR funds for Covid cause, but also an encouragement for them to do so.” While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was amicus curiae assisted by Nidhi Dayani, the judges said sub-sections (5) and (7) of Section 135 indicate that in every financial year, the company must ensure to spend at least 2% of the average net profits during three immediate preceding financial years. “If a company defaulted, it would be liable to pay two times penalty to the fund specified in Schedule VII or the unspent CSR account or Rs1 crore, whichever is less.” Explaining the Schedule VII, the bench said it speaks of disaster management including relief, rehabilitation and construction activities for which CSR fund should be spent. “It also speaks of such social causes as eradication of hunger, poverty, malnutrition, promoting healthcare, including preventive, sanitation and disaster management. The MCA notification clarifies that funds may be spent for various activities related to Covid-19 for promotion of healthcare.” The judges said if there is any difficulty for any of the companies to spend CSR funds in a particular area, when their headquarters or registered offices are located elsewhere, such issues stand more than removed by proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 135. “It prescribes that the company shall give preference to the local areas where it operates for spending the amount earmarked under CSR funds.” Approach cos: HC to Ngp, Amt collectors The bench directed Nagpur and Amravati collectors to explore the possibility of mobilizing funds for Covid cause from CSR heads of companies in Vidarbha. The move came after intervener’s counsel M Anil Kumar submitted a list of 59 companies and Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) lawyer Jatin Kumar filed another list of firms that had spent their CSR funds in 2020-21. “We would request VIA to submit all details such as their head offices’ locations, local areas of operation, percentage of the amounts shown in relation to the net profits and other relevant details. It’s also not known whether these amounts which are shown to have been spent are by the companies under CSR or by individuals.” The judges pointed out that VIA hasn’t so far placed on record any details about the number of oxygen cylinders, liquid oxygen storage tanks and other infrastructural facilities with all its members for generation, storage and transportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-industries-must-spend-csr-funds-for-covid-patients-hc/articleshow/82442011.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: After poll rout, Makkal Needhi Maiam vice-presidents and general secretaries quit||CHENNAI: Kamal Haasan’s party Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) received a major post-election jolt on Thursday as its two vice-presidents – R Mahendran and V Ponraj – quit their posts. Mahendran has also resigned from the primary membership of the party, citing un-democratic manner in which Kamal is running the party. Rebutting Mahendran’s charges, Kamal Haasan said he was a “traitor” and added that there was a clarion call from the cadres to weed out traitors. Mahendran’s name was first on the list, he said. Kamal said Mahendran was standing in the way of the growth of several hard-working cadres. “Everyone knows the doors of the party always remain open for incompetent and dishonest persons to leave. He (Mahendran) is trying to blame others for his incompetence, dishonesty, and failure to seek sympathy,” Kamal said. He said Mahendran had quit knowing well that he would be removed from the party. “We ignore cowards, who run away on seeing failures,” he added. Four general secretaries of the party - A G Mourya, Umadevi, C K Kumaravel and M Muruganandam – have also resigned their posts. In an eight-page letter addressed to Kamal, Mahendran lashed out at the party’s consultant and a key advisor of the actor for the pathetic show of the party in the assembly elections. He said the consultant and advisor had misguided Kamal and despite repeated warnings, the actor did not go for course correction. Another development was the resignation of election strategist Suresh Iyer, against whom Mahendran had levelled charges of derailing the party. Iyer heads Sankhya Consultancy, which had handled election strategies of the MNM after Prashant Kishor’s IPAC’s contract ended. Mahendran said the consultancy firm and Kamal’s advisor had sidelined many hardworking functionaries and cadres in the party. Mahendran said none of the key members of the party was consulted on any decision when the party was preparing for the assembly polls. Even on alliance formation, none of the office bearers were consulted, he said. MNM spokesperson Murali Abbas, in a statement, said the party leader would decide on the resignations. The MNM’s vote share dipped from 3.6% in 2019 LS polls to 2.8% in the 2021 assembly polls. Kamal lost the polls to Vanathi Srinivasan of BJP in Coimbatore south and Mahendran lost in Singanallur segment. Mahendran told TOI that he had submitted a letter to Kamal citing reasons for his exit and added that if the actor chose to act upon the issues raised in the letter, it would be good for the party. However, his decision to quit the party was final, he said. Mahendran said the party core committee members wanted Kamal to contest from Velachery in Chennai as many senior leaders were also contesting in the city. Kamal’s presence in the city would have helped them, he said. But Kamal, going by the consultant’s opinion, chose to contest from Coimbatore south. “Today, I’m sad to say, there is a decline in your tenacity of purpose, which lies buried under a style of operation that reeks of a non-democratic manner of running a political party,” said Mahendran and added after three years, the situation warranted him to step down from the party posting and the primary membership of the party. In another letter to the party functionaries, Mahendran said, “Even after the massive defeat of the party and his (Kamal) own defeat (in Coimbatore South), I am not seeing any change in the leader’s approach and I am not confident that he will change,”. It may be recalled that party founder member Kameela Nazar had resigned earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/after-poll-rout-mnm-vps-and-gen-secys-quit/articleshow/82444035.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||NCC to be elective subject in colleges||CHANDIGARH: The National Cadet Corps (NCC) would now be considered a General Elective Credit Course (GECC) among the graduation courses being run in educational institutes or colleges in Haryana. A decision has been taken in this regard in response to the proposal mooted by the Directorate General National Cadet Corps, New Delhi. NCC Syllabus for ‘B’ and ‘C’ cert is designed as per choice based credit system of National Education Policy 2020, which grants 24 credit points, covering six semesters, out of which a student can accrue four credit points, covering first two semesters and 10 credits in the third and fourth semesters and 10 credits in the fifth and sixth semesters. The move is in consonance with the National Education Policy 2020, where students can select their choice of subjects rather than being confined to only those being offered by the institutions. This makes learning holistic and skill-oriented. On successful completion of the course, students are awarded points which will enable them to qualify for their respective degrees. Brig A S Berar, Group Commander, NCC Group Ambala has recommended early implementation of NCC as an elective subject in educational institutions in Haryana. The UGC has already issued an advisory to the vice-chancellors (VCs) of all universities to include NCC training as General Elective Credit Course. An NCC spokesman said the proposed implementation, which is planned from the forthcoming academic session, has evoked a positive response from the state government and is being viewed as a visionary step. “It will undoubtedly add to the appeal of the largest uniformed youth force which has contributed immensely to the role of nation building. The Rashtriya Uchha Siksha Abhiyaan (RUSH) state offices are encouraged to work with respective state governments and facilitate the implementation of NCC as elective subject”, said Brig A S Berar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ncc-to-be-elective-subject-in-colleges/articleshow/82442031.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Daya Nayak, 4 other city cops get transferred||Mumbai: Five police inspectors, including encounter specialist Daya Nayak, have been transferred out of the city before completion of their tenure. Nayak, who has been transferred to Gondia, was attached to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) and was part of the team probing the planting of explosives in an SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of the vehicle owner. In 2019, the government had held back his transfer out of the city, citing a threat to his life for gunning down more than 80 criminals in police encounters. The others who have been transferred include inspector Sudhir Dalvi attached to Malad police station to Nanvij in Daund, crime branch inspectors Nandkumar Gopale to the police training centre at Jalna, inspector Sachin Kadam to Aurangabad and inspector Kedar Pawar to Jalgaon. All these officers have been associated with probes into sensitive cases in the past. Police inspector Rajkumar Kothmire from Thane crime branch’s anti-extortion cell has been transferred to Gadchiroli. On Monday, cricket bookie Sonu Jalan had alleged former police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Sharma and Kothmire had arrested him in a false case and extorted Rs 3.4 crore in 2018. Sources in the state police headquarters maintained they have been shifted on administrative grounds and denied it was due to their closeness to additional director general Deven Bharti who now heads State Security Corporation. All, except Nayak, were among the 12 officers who were not relieved when Bharti had asked them to be posted with ATS when Bharti was heading it. The officers who had worked under Bharti had applied for transfer to ATS but former police commissioner Sanjay Barve refused to relieve them as they had bypassed him and had applied for transfers directly to the then DGP Subodh Jaiswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daya-nayak-4-other-city-cops-get-transferred/articleshow/82442033.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nagpur||Kin of Nagzira fire victims still await full govt compensation||Nagpur: Nearly a month after three van majoors were charred while fighting forest fires inside Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary in the Gondia district, the families of the victims are waiting for ex-gratia announced by the chief minister. Two NGOs have released Rs 9.75 lakh to them. Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), Mumbai, released Rs 1.50 lakh for each of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for each of two injured to the Nagzira Tiger Conservation Foundation. Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), Delhi, released Rs 1 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 25,000 each to the injured. “We deposited the money directly in the bank account of the victims’ kin,” said Prafulla Bhamburkar, WTI adviser, Maharashtra. On April 9, three forest labourers - Rakesh Madavi (25), Thadezari, Rekhchand Rane (45), Dhanori, and Sachin Shrirange (22), Kosamtondi— died after fire-blowers they were carrying exploded. The injured, Vijay Maraskolhe (40), Thadezari, and Raju Sayam (30), Bolunda, are still undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city. The chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray on April 10 had announced Rs 5 lakh compensation for next of kin of deceased from Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Till now only Rs 1 lakh each has been released. Gondia resident deputy collector Jairam Deshpande said, “We have still not received post-mortem and police report and detailed report from the forest department. Once these papers are received, we will release the money as soon as possible.” Another reason for the delay is that the administration is busy tackling Covid spread. Besides, funds crunch is also an issue, Deshpande said. NNTR field director M Ramanujam said, “We will submit papers to the district administration soon. Due to Covid, our office is working with restricted staff strength.” He confirmed NGOs WCT and WTI have released the money as promised. However, the kin of the three victims were promised a package of Rs 10 lakh each. This included Rs 5 lakh from CM Relief Fund and another Rs 5 lakh was to come from the contribution by NGOs, local MLA, and forest unions and associations. Till now only Rs 3.50 lakh each has been mopped up. The two injured van majoors are undergoing treatment in Nagpur and the NNTR foundation has spent Rs 15 lakh on them. The cost of treatment will be borne by the state government and the money will be later refunded to the foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kin-of-nagzira-fire-victims-still-await-full-govt-compensation/articleshow/82442091.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The association said that app-based taxis provide good services at cheaper rates as against that of the existing taxi operators. “The industry is of the opinion that lopsided trade practices are detrimental to progress and discourage tourism in the state,” the HRAWI stated, adding that the local taxi operators’ demands are “unreasonable and uncompetitive when viable and transparent app-based options are available”. They pointed out that app-based cab operators including Ola, Uber, and GoaMiles, among others offer tourists the choice of their ride. “These operators provide decent services at reasonable fares to the local commuters as well as tourists, and hence should be allowed to operate. App-based cab operators are operating in almost every state in the country except Goa which is a huge inconvenience for both the domestic as well as international tourists.” they wrote. Welcoming the state government’s decision to install digital meters, the association president Sherry Bhatia said that it “will bring transparency, and offer convenient and reliable taxi services” in Goa. “We therefore request the state government to ensure that GoaMiles continue its operations along with other app-based taxi services that could also be allowed to operate in the state,” said committee member of HRAWI Menino Proenca. “The government’s intervention on this matter will go a long way in aiding and enabling tourism in the state as the local transport system is known to be the key driving factor in the promotion of tourism.” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/let-app-based-taxis-operate-in-state-hotels-body-to-govt/articleshow/82444121.cms||---

Two members — Jyoti Jani and Jolly Shukla — have filed a petition in the HC stating that they are advocates and have given up their practice of law and working as full-time members of the consumer commission. They have been paid salary of Rs 20,000, whereas a judicial member, who is a retired judge, is paid Rs 1.8 lakh on basis of pay minus pension formula. These two petitioners have cited a 2018 Supreme Court order issuing directions to the Uttar Pradesh administration to rationalize the salary structure of members of consumer courts. They have argued that they sit on the same bench with the judicial members, they put in equal efforts to resolve disputes of complainants, but there is a vast difference in salary structure. In their petition, they have demanded pay revision in line with the payment being made to a judicial member and also sought the difference in payment since 2013. They has also urged the HC to direct the state government to frame rules for the salary structure on basis of the model rules framed by the central government.

Chandrapur honorary district wildlife warden Vivek Karambelkar, who visited the sanctuary on Wednesday along with members of NGO Nature Environment & Wildlife (NEW) and villagers, said, “We recorded at least 80 stumps inside the sanctuary but according to the villagers, the number of trees maybe even more and the smuggling racket must be going on for long with the involvement of the forest staff.” Bramhapuri deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Dipesh Malhotra, denied felling inside the sanctuary. “In separate raids in the area, we have seized 22 logs of teakwood valued at Rs77,000. The stumps of these trees fall in the territorial forest in Mangrul and not in the sanctuary as being alleged.” However, Mangrul villagers, who released pictures of stumps of trees felled in Huma and Mangrul forest area, on May 4, submitted a memorandum to the deputy conservator demanding action against forest staff and teak smugglers who are hand in glove otherwise such felling inside a sanctuary is not possible. Mangrul sarpanch Vaibhav Nikhure said, “We have demanded action against the forest staff and those involved. It is possible that the forest fires last month must have been ignited to destroy evidence of tree felling in and around Ghodazari sanctuary.” The villagers have also demanded a probe into fake financial claims of crop damage from the forest department, especially when there is no crop in the agriculture fields. The role of forest staff in the illicit felling cannot be ruled out. Malhotra said, “Acting on a tip-off about illicit tree felling, we conducted the first raid on April 26, on a farm owned by Madhukar Satpaise, a resident of Mangrul, and seized seven big logs of teak hidden under haystacks.” “We are verifying call details records (CDRs) and have registered five preliminary offence reports (PORs) against unidentified persons. After forest staff being named, an in-charge lady beat guard has been shifted. Further investigation is going on and action will be taken if more staff is found involved,” said Malhotra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-80-teak-trees-felled-in-ghodazari-sanctuary/articleshow/82442145.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

NEET-MDS was held in December and results were out the same month but counselling rounds for postgraduate medical and dental courses happen simultaneously. Now that NEET-PG has been postponed by four months, aspirants for PG dental courses want government to delink admissions and conduct it soon. Around 30,000 BDS (dental) graduates appeared for NEET-MDS for admissions to over 6,500 seats. While results were out in December, aspirants have been waiting for over four months. An aspirant said the course is neglected by government. “Since we had a separate exam, why not conduct an independent counselling round for MDS? Once admissions are done and we are absorbed into the system, government will have additional manpower too,” said the aspirant. Medical Counselling Committee of Directorate General of Health Services conducts counselling rounds for medical and dental PG courses every March. This year, NEET-PG was scheduled on April 18, but was postponed.

---||Chandigarh||After harvest, farmers head back to protest sites: SKM||BATHINDA: After completion of the wheat harvesting season, farmers have started returning to protest sites on Delhi borders. A number of farmers reached Singhu border in tractor trollies on Thursday. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said more farmers would join the protest on Delhi borders in the days to come. Morcha leaders alleged that the social media accounts covering farmers’ movement were constantly under attack. Earlier, the Facebook and Instagram pages of Kisan Ekta Morcha, the official social media platform of SKM, were temporarily suspended. Thereafter, other independent pages related to the movement were suspended. The government also banned internet at protest sites and now, Twitter handles of supporters, who had been sharing information related to the farmers’ movement, have been suspended. They alleged that the Facebook account of Ravi Singh, CEO of Khalsa Aid, which has been continuously helping the farmers’ movement and helping citizens during the Covid pandemic, has also been suspended. Demanding reactivation of these accounts, SKM leaders said the act was akin to government’s attack on independent journalism and social workers. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Thursday also condoled the demise of farmer leader and former agriculture minister Chaudhary Ajit Singh. The morcha hailed as Ajit Singh as someone who followed in the footsteps of his father, former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and openly supported the farmers’ movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-harvest-farmers-head-back-to-protest-sites-skm/articleshow/82442096.cms||---

This is the third human kill by Gajraj. The pachyderm had earlier fled from its camp and killed a woman and injured one other in Yavatmal district in October 2018 when it was involved in capture of problem tigress Avni. On November 15, 2019, the elephant had turned aggressive under musth and killed its caretaker at Moharli gate when he was trying to feed the jumbo. Musth is a periodic condition in bull (male) elephants characterized by highly aggressive behaviour due to rise in testosterones (reproductive hormones) level.  The elephant was moved into deep forest in Botezari in Kolsa range of TATR after the incident. On Thursday evening, Ramgaonkar said, Gajraj turned aggressive and caretakers tried to rein it in. “ACF Ravindra Kulkarni and chief accountant of field director office of TATR, Pramod Gaurkar, were patrolling in the same area. At around 6pm, their vehicle got stuck in the mud. Suddenly, Gajraj charged at the duo sitting in the vehicle,” said Ramgaonkar. “Both the officers left their vehicle and ran for the safety but the elephant attacked the duo. Gaurkar was killed on the spot, while ACF Kulkarni had a close shave,” he said. Ramgaonkar maintained that the elephant was not in ‘musth’. “Its musth was over recently. It turned aggressive for uncertain reasons,” he said. The field director informed that rapid response teams from Tadoba and Chandrapur along with a veterinary doctor and the commandos of Special Tiger Protection Force have been called for rescue operation. Efforts to tranquilise and capture Gajraj were underway till filing of this report. Ramgaonkar claimed that rescue workers are facing problem in tranquilizing the animal due to darkness, but was confident of capturing the jumbo by morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/elephant-gajraj-kills-forester-in-tadoba/articleshow/82442173.cms||Mazhar Ali

Sources in Baghpat claimed that Haryana’s Panipat-based farmers attacked the UP farmers with sharp-edged weapons and even mowed down a farmer with a tractor. His condition is stated to be serious. Additional DM Amit Kumar said, “An investigation is underway and efforts are on to establish contact with authorities on the other side of the border also. We will resolve this matter soon.” This is not the first time that such a clash has taken place in the region. Every year, mainly due to the changing course of the river Yamuna, post-monsoon, territorial disputes emerge among farmers often leading to heated arguments and clashes. In April this year, a clash near Nagla Behlolpur village in Baghpat claimed the life of a farmer in UP and left several injured. In November, a fierce clash occurred over claim to agricultural fields of Niwada village on the UP-Haryana border. In October last year, 14 residents of Tanda village had staged a protest at the DM’s office demanding action against farmers of Haryana who had allegedly destroyed sugarcane plantations in the area. Also, farmers in Sonepat district of Haryana were attacked, allegedly by UP farmers, in which almost 12 farmers of Jajal village were hurt. Six districts of western Uttar Pradesh – Shamli, Saharanpur, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh – witness frequent clashes between farmers of the two states over ownership of farm fields at the inter-state border. At present, 132 villages of five districts of UP and 102 villages of six districts of Haryana are located on the border and witness frequent clashes over land disputes. In the backdrop of these clashes, the two state governments had agreed to cooperate in resolving half a century old issue and on January 8 last year, a meeting was held under the chairpersonship of then divisional commissioner of Meerut, Anita Meshram, but things went on the backburner due to the Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/six-injured-as-haryana-up-farmers-clash-over-land/articleshow/82440754.cms||Sandeep Rai

We did this on an experimental basis when there was a shortage of oxygen. It could provide oxygen to a patient from five hours to two days depending on the patient’s lung condition but it helps buy time to arrange a ventilator.” According to doctors, requires 50 litre oxygen per minute while this Bain Circuit requires nearly 12-15 litres. However, a patient can’t be left alone when this Bain circuit is used and it requires an expert to handle this equipment. Doctors in Ahmedabad, Surat and Bhavnagar also experimented with Bain Circuits during the ventilator shortage.Dr Rahesh Mishra, an intensive care specialist in Ahmedabad, said, “Using Bain Circuit can help save many lives, but it requires trained people to handle the equipment, lest it leads to catastrophic cardiac arrest.” The technique is being regularly used in Ahmedabad-based SVP Hospital too, sources confirmed to TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bain-circuit-saves-50-lives-in-rajkot-civil-hospital/articleshow/82440803.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: In pandemic year, SEZs see 19% dip in exports||AHMEDABAD: There has been a 19% decline in exports from operational special economic zones in Gujarat during 2020-21, due to disruptions in demand and supply caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The cumulative exports — both merchandise and services — from functional SEZs in Gujarat plummeted from Rs 1.57 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in fiscal 2020-21. This shows a dip of about Rs 30,000 crore during the year as per the data compiled by the Export Promotion Council for EoUs & SEZs (EPCES), a council set up by the union ministry of commerce and industry to service the promotional needs of export-oriented units (EoUs) and SEZs in the country. According to zone-wise data collected by EPCES, Gujarat zone saw export of manufacturing-related products decrease from Rs 1.56 lakh crore in fiscal 2020 to Rs 1.25 lakh crore in fiscal 2021. The exports from services and trading stood at Rs 2,121 crore as against Rs 1,404 crore, the data further shows. All the 21 operational SEZs in Gujarat fall under the jurisdiction of Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ) development commissioner. The overall decline in SEZ exports from Gujarat is largely attributed to the fall in export of petroleum products. Reduction in price of petroleum products, mainly crude oil, impacted SEZ exports of petroleum products in 2020, said people in the know. The export of petroleum products in terms of value dipped to Rs 77,374 crore during the financial year 2020-21 as compared to Rs 1,14,192 crore in 2019-20, according to EPCES data. Petroleum products exports account for about 70% of the total SEZ exports from Gujarat. Export from most SEZs in the state was hit during the initial months of lockdown imposed last year, causing subsequent disruption in demand and supply. However, many SEZs saw recovery later on. “SEZs in Kandla, Dahej, and Surat have seen growth in exports in fiscal 2021 despite the challenges posed by the pandemic,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-pandemic-year-sezs-see-19-dip-in-exports/articleshow/82442192.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The survivor was among the convict’s 11 children from three wives. Born to his second wife, the girl has been putting up with her father’s sexual assault since 2017 when she was 15 years old. He continuously raped her by threatening to kill her mother if she revealed it to anyone. However, the woman came to know about it in 2019 and threatened him with dire consequences. He decided to get rid of her after she started preventing his further advances towards the girl. He murdered the woman in December 2019 at an isolated place. Police arrested him and it was during inquiry that they came to know about his sexual assault on his own daughter. Judge R Sathya convicted the man under four sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) (amendment) Act, 2019. Besides death sentence, she also awarded him a life sentence, nine years of rigorous imprisonment and fines adding up to Rs 3 lakh. This is the third case of rape of a minor in the past six months in which the judge has awarded death sentence. In December 2020, a 25-year-old man who murdered a seven-year-old girl after raping her in June that year was awarded death sentence, rigorous life imprisonment and fine. In February this year, the judge awarded triple death sentence to a 34-year-old native of Gujarat for sodomising a 17-year-old boy with learning disabilities who later died in hospital due to internal injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/daughter-17-raped-and-wife-murdered-tn-man-gets-death/articleshow/82444149.cms||Sampath Kumar

Mismanagement of Covid has further added to their woes. Insensitive BJP governments are putting more and more burden on the common man when they are already under mental and physical distress,” Kamat said. He further said that after the “failed” nationwide lockdown was announced last year by prime minister Narendra Modi, the economy crashed which resulted in total collapse of household budgets. “Marginalised sectors including small occupationists were hit badly. Today, when lockdown is actually needed, it's free for all in Goa,” Kamat said. He added, “It was the duty of the government at the Centre as well as the state to announce measures and give financial help and relief to the people after the nationwide lockdown was over. But, the BJP government is all out to push citizens into bankruptcy as well as the death trap of Covid.” He also accused the BJP of being insensitive to the plight of the people. “The opportunistic politics of BJP needs to be understood by the people. Their government is here to empty the treasury. They have no concerns for the poor. What they promise during elections, BJP forgets it at the next minute,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bring-an-end-to-consistent-hike-in-fuel-prices-kamat-to-govt/articleshow/82444208.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra No. 1 by fully vaccinating 28.7L, but coverage only 3.2%||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has raced ahead of Gujarat to boast of the highest number of fully vaccinated people in the country. As on Thursday morning, the state has finished complete vaccination of 28.7lakh people, while Gujarat has given both doses to 28.5lakh. West Bengal with 27.4lakh complete vaccinations is in the third position. In terms of coverage though, this achievement is a drop in the ocean — only 3.2% of the 9crore adult population has been covered. About 15% (1.7crore) have received one dose. Nearly four months after the vaccination drive started on January 16, 90% healthcare workers in the state have taken the first dose, and 65% both doses. Among 13lakh-odd frontline workers, complete vaccination has been achieved for a little over 61% after they were included in the drive from February 13. In the 18-44 years group, 1.5lakh have got the vaccine since May 1. This third phase is moving at a snail’s pace due to vaccine shortage. Mumbai, for instance, is merely vaccinating 1,000-1,200 daily in the five public and two private centres. Principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said not only was Maharashtra leading with the highest doses administered, and also had a wastage rate of less than 1%. Dr Dilip Patil, the state’s immunisation officer, said it was important that at least 29% of the 3.9crore 45-plus people have received at least one dose. That age group remains the most vulnerable, accounting for over 70% of Covid deaths. A closer look reveals deep disparity between districts, both in the rate of vaccination and coverage. For instance, Kolhapur is at the top having administered at least one shot to 60% of the population above 45 years, while Hingoli is at the bottom with merely 11% having got one dose. The coverage in at least 23 districts is less than the state average. As many as 11 districts, including health minister Rajesh Tope’s home district Jalna, have achieved less than 20% coverage. In absolute numbers, Mumbai has vaccinated the highest (25.9lakh) followed by Pune (23.7lakh) and Thane (13.4lakh). In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Palghar district is among the slow performers with a first dose coverage of 14%. A local senior official said just when awareness was being created, the district began to face a shortage of vaccine. A health official from Chandrapur, where coverage has been around 25%, blamed the erratic supply and even questioned the distribution formula. “We often don’t get the quantities we need. Yet, our neighbouring districts are allocated more stocks. Gadchiroli and Bhandara have stocks for 15 and 32 days, respectively, while we have nothing,” the official said. Immunisation in-charge Patil said the state has devised a distribution policy to help underperforming districts. “We have given additional doses to at least nine districts to boost their drives. These districts include Hingoli, Jalna, Yavatmal, Washim and Beed, among others,” he said. Earlier, districts were allocated doses solely based on their coverage and active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-no-1-by-fully-vaccinating-28-7l-but-coverage-only-3-2/articleshow/82444275.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A video of the rescue has gone viral, earning accolades for the policeman who risked his life to save the woman. According to police sources, constable Kumar and another policeman posted on PVR duty were stationed on the banks of the canal in Sikhera police station area. A passerby informed Kumar that a woman sitting on the banks did not seem to be normal. As Kumar walked towards her, she suddenly jumped into the canal. Acting on the spur of the moment, Kumar rushed to the police vehicle, brought out a rope, tied himself with it and jumped in after the woman. He managed to reach her before she could drown and rescued her. The woman was shifted to hospital and was handed over to her family after medical examination. Subhash Chand Gautam, SHO of Sikhera police station, said, “Further action in the matter is being taken.” He has sent a report about the incident to the police headquarters, recommending a reward for constable Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cop-rescues-woman-who-jumped-into-ganga-canal/articleshow/82440818.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Chennai||Maratha quota judgment puts focus on Tamil Nadu’s laws||By Justice K ChandruThe Supreme Court decision annulling the Maharashtra law for fixing exclusive quota to the Maratha community has once again reopened the debate on crucial issues relating to reservation, such as the ceiling on reservation and the exclusive power of the Centre to include communities in the list of backward classes. The decision has not only refused to accept exclusive caste-based quota for reservation and also emphasise the need to have an overall ceiling of 50% of all types of reservation as mandated by its earlier judgment on the Mandal commission. The decision on Maratha quota has also turned its light on reservations in states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as these two states have reservation percentage of above 50% cap fixed by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney’s case (1992). The challenge to the increased percentage of reservation in Tamil Nadu is pending before the Supreme Court. Tamil Nadu has been the torchbearer in the matter of reservation. Before Independence, the Madras government had introduced communal reservation based on castes and communities, wherein seats will be reserved for brahmins, nonbrahmins, Christians, Muslims and scheduled castes. The introduction of the Constitution of India (1950) and particularly the equality clause under Article 14 and nondiscrimination based on religion and caste under Article 15(1) and 16(1) posed a challenge to the archaic law that was in existence for three decades. The Madras high court and the Supreme Court struck down the communal order as unconstitutional (Champakam Dorairajan, 1950). This led to an agitation which made the Centre bring the first constitutional amendment introducing an enabling provision in Article 15, wherein the power to make special provision for advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) of citizens as well as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes was introduced. But various states prepared a list of SEBCs and also included different castes into the list of OBCs, many with vote banks in mind. When the Mandal commission was implemented by the V P Singh government and for the first time a reservation for OBCs in central services was facilitated that the order was put to judicial review. A larger bench of nine judges in Indra Sawhney’s case (1992) upheld the introduction of reservation for OBCs, but nevertheless put a cap of total reservation at 50%. Knowing that some advanced communities within the backward class may corner the benefit of reservation, it also introduced the concept of "creamy layer", by which the affluent among the OBCs should be denied the benefit of reservation. The indiscriminate inclusion of any communities into the SEBC list also had another problem — several communities which are most backward within the list of SEBCs were seeking for internal reservation, so that a few communities which are politically dominant were able to corner all the benefits of reservation. Therefore, TN while fixing the reservation for backward communities at 50% created a niche for Most Backward Communities (MBCs) with a separate reservation 20%. This resulted in a total reservation 69%. But the Mandal judgment was a red herring and to get over the same, it was decided to bring in a special legislation and also get it included in the IXth Schedule of the Constitution to ward off any challenge based on fundamental rights. Thus the 1994 Act providing for 69% reservation in public employment and educational institutions was passed. The law was challenged before the Supreme Court and it has been pending for 27 years. Increased lobbying and succumbing to vote bank politics, the state also started introducing internal reservation within the BC and MBC reservations. The beneficiary in TN were the backward Muslims who work 3.5% within the 30% BC reservation. Within the scheduled castes, Arunthathiyinar were given 3.5% internal reservation within the 18%. This is also a subject matter of challenge and is pending consideration by the courts since the past two decades. In 2004, the Supreme Court in a matter relating to provision for internal reservation for scheduled castes held that it is not open to the state to make internal reservation among the scheduled castes. If they found that any community within the reserved list corners all the benefits due to their historical dominance, then the only way is to exclude them from the list of scheduled castes by a constitutional amendment to the President’s list (Chinnaiah, 2004). This decision has once again opened the decisions of various states. Ahead of the recent state assembly election, the AIADMK government had introduced an internal reservation of 10.5% for the vanniyar community (which is largely represented by the PMK and 7% for the thevar community and the balance of 2.5% to be shared by as many as 49 communities. This law is yet to be implemented. It is also stated that the population census will be taken to identify the strength of each caste and the percentage in this new law will be altered accordingly. If any such decision has to be made in terms of law, it not only requires a constitutional amendment, but also will have a different perspective on the issue of reservation. Adding to the confusion, the BJP government had brought in the exclusive quota of 10% for the economically weaker sections by amending the Constitution with its 102nd amendment (2018). This had increased the total number of percentages of vertical reservation in each state. In TN it has increased the vertical reservation to 79%. With small reservations for several categories, the total reservation stands at 80%. This will only mock the equality clause provided under Article 14 and also will be in utter breach of Indra Sawhney’s case. Against this backdrop and with elections in mind, the quota for the Maratha community was introduced. The Supreme Court judgment indicates the 50% cap cannot be violated under any circumstances and by virtue of Article 342A, the states cannot make any inclusion/exclusion from the list of OBCs and it shall be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre. The decision may be opposed by the states on the ground of erosion of federal principles and may pressure the Centre to remove the cap. However, the Supreme Court should immediately undertake judicial review of all the cases relating to reservation cases pending before it and finally decide the issue of fixing a cap on reservation, the legality of the reservation for economically weaker sections, the legality of internal reservation within the list of SEBCs/ SCs and also the power of preparing a list of OBCs. Otherwise decisions by smaller benches may tend to be ignored and at times by the law’s delay the settled principles may be violated by different states.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Rs 900cr MLA hostel redevpt proposal ‘to raise eyebrows’||Mumbai: The state public works department has invited pre-qualification bids for redevelopment of MLA hostel Manora at Nariman Point at an estimated cost of Rs 900 crore. The redevelopment is likely to raise eyebrows at a time when the state is facing a financial crunch and all its resources are geared towards tackling the pandemic, according to political sources. PWD sources told TOI the cost is expected to escalate further. The electrical work alone is estimated to cost Rs 250 crore. Earlier, the government had signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Building Construction Corporation to build the towers. Due to the delay, though, it has now issued a new tender, said officials. On Thursday, BJP MLA Atul Bhatkalkar tweeted: “Rs 900 crore tender has been issued by the Thackeray government for the MLA hostel. This seems to have slipped the eyes of those advising the Prime Minister to focus on vaccination rather than the construction of the Parliament Complex. Tell the chief minister to focus on the corona pandemic. He will get his percentage there as well.” The BJP has been targeting the Maha Vikas Aghadi government ever since former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh, in a letter to the chief minister, had alleged the former home minister Anil Deshmukh had ordered assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants every month. The MLA hostel comprising two towers is expected to be completed in three years. It will comprise one 42-storey tower and another 28-storey tower. The total number of flats to be constructed are 675. Each flat will be spread over 1,000 square feet, of which 600 sq ft will be for the use of the elected representative while 400 sq ft will be for party workers who come to Mumbai for various works, said officials. Other facilities include gymnasiums on the terrace, meeting and conference halls, waiting halls for MLA visitors, a canteen, a grocery, a salon, shops, a dispensary and a theatre. The old Manora towers have been demolished and for the past 18 months the government has been paying Rs 1 lakh to each MLA per month so that they can find alternate accommodation in the same vicinity. This money is paid only to MLAs outside Mumbai and Thane districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbairs-900cr-mla-hostel-redevpt-proposal-to-raise-eyebrows/articleshow/82442223.cms||---

The Gujarat government cleared investment proposals worth over Rs 7,400 crore in April, and allocated a sizable 642 acres of land to industries to set up their units. In all, 75 investment proposals have been cleared and the government claims the investments will generate employment of over 19,000 in 12 to 18 months. Manoj Das, additional chief secretary (ACS) in chief minister’s office (CMO) and in-charge ACS industry & mines department said that despite the major impact of Covid-19 in April, the industries sector has shown encouraging progress. “The Gujarat government has allotted land to leading companies in GIDC estates of Dahej and Halol. More than 75 companies have been allotted land with a total area of 642 acres. Some of the prominent companies in these estates include Jindal Specialty Chemicals, Merino Industries, Avgol Nonwovens, Troikaa Pharmaceuticals, Coromandel International, DCM Shriram, Bharat Rasayan, Aarti Specialty Chemicals, Transpek Silox,Sumitomo Chemical among others,” the official said. “These projects have committed investments of over Rs 6,900 crore which will provide employment opportunity to over 19,000 people directly and indirectly. Besides, the state government has also approved the project by a renowned company to set up a plant for manufacturing ‘High Grade Steel Bars’ in Kutch with a total proposed investment of Rs 500 crore, providing employment to 1,000 people in the region,” Das said. The official said that 42 projects are such, where the investment by each company is in the range of Rs 10 crore to Rs 50 crore. The pledged investment by these companies is Rs 945 crore. An investment of Rs 4,366 crore has been pledged by industries who will invest more than Rs 50 crore.“As many as 11 projects have pledged an investment of over Rs 100 crore. Land has already been allocated at Dahej, Halol and Saykha (Bharuch) estates and production is expected to begin in 12 to 18 months,” Das said. “Before the end of the current month, a formal MOU (memorandum of understanding) is expected to be signed for two more projects worth around Rs 9,000 crore. The government has also directed all the district collectors to conduct monthly review meetings to resolve all kinds of issues of investors,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-7-4k-cr-investment-proposals-in-april/articleshow/82442243.cms||Kapil Dave

A few days back, BDU controller of examination S Srinivasaragavan had said teachers can collect the answer scripts at any location instead of asking students to come to college. However, on Wednesday he instructed colleges to collect the soft copies through email to prevent students from venturing out of home to submit answer scripts. He said the respective colleges can create separate email ids for different programmes and years to receive the answer scripts. He added that the evaluation, which used to be centralised before the Covid-19 outbreak, has been decentralised as colleges have been asked to carry out the evaluation to ensure results are published at the earliest. It is the responsibility of the colleges and the principals to ensure that students complete the exam on time and submit the answer scripts in-person or through email.

The directive has come in the wake of complaints from a few colleges where teachers were asked to come to college if they want a full salary.A Mekala, RJDCE, Trichy, said that she has been receiving complaints on erring colleges and has asked them to follow the directions issued by the state government. “There is no point in risking the lives of teachers when the Covid-19 spread is high,” said Mekala adding that she will take necessary steps against erring colleges after conducting an enquiry. The Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University asked colleges in March to switch over to online classes. Further, the state government also asked teachers in schools and colleges to work from home by the end of last month. However, a teacher from Jenney’s College of Education in Trichy said that relatives of some of the staff were tested positive for Covid-19, but they are coming to the college in the fear of losing salary.

He hurriedly led them towards the extreme north of the graveyard, off the beaten path, where a row of freshly dug graves were waiting. Alam asked them to choose anyone of them, and they did. A little while later, as the body was being lowered and one of the mourners was sobbing helplessly, an earthmover was busy digging more pits, nearby. As secretary of Agra’s Panchkuian Kabristan, Alam says that he has never seen such a rush of bodies. It had prompted him to ask for an earthmover from the civic body. “The number of bodies has significantly increased in the last three weeks. On an average, we used to get six bodies earlier. Now the number has increased to 20. We are digging graves in advance with an excavator provided by the municipal corporation to avoid inconvenience to the relatives of the deceased,” Alam said. He said that there are around 20 graveyards in the district. “The number of bodies reaching for burial has increased everywhere,” says Alam, who believes that the month of Ramzan saved many lives. “Most people are fasting, staying at home and praying. Had it not been the holy month, many more would have died,” he said. The situation at Agra’s another prominent graveyard is no different. Caretaker of the city's Noorjahan Karbala kabristaan, Chaudhary Aleemuddin says, “The number of bodies reaching for burial have doubled.” And about 250 km away in Meerut, caretakers of graveyards were grappling with somewhat similar situations. And they didn’t have an earthmover to help them. At the city’s largest graveyard, Mohammad Alam was busy digging graves with his team of workers. “Earlier we used to dig six to seven graves a day. Now the number has increased five times. Our problem has compounded because we have to dig six feet now due to protocol. We cannot bury a Covid-19 infected body in a four feet grave,” says Alam, the caretaker of Meerut’s Bale Miya kabristaan. The graveyard’s in-charge, Mufti Mohd Ashraf, had his share of concerns. “So many of our workers have fallen sick, but bodies are continuously coming. We will soon run out of space. We desperately need mitti (soil) which should be at least 3-foot-high to accommodate the new arrivals,” Ashraf said. At another burial ground in Meerut’s Mohanpuri area, popular as Shah Vilayat graveyard, secretary Mohammad Rashid claimed that at least 50 to 60 people are dying daily. “We cater to the Lal Kurti area and don’t get many bodies here. But, according to my estimate, the daily deaths -- among Muslims-- is nothing less than 50-60 in the entire city. But these are highly conservative estimates. Number could be higher as well.” Last week, an MLA in Meerut released Rs 25lakh to purchase extra soil for the graveyards. Meerut city MLA Rafiq Ansari had said, “The situation is really bad. There is no oxygen, no hospital beds. People are dying and graveyards are running out of space. Our religion does not allow us to burn the bodies, and they cannot be left on roads too.” But space is not the only problem at the graveyards. Like cremation, the cost of burial has gone up too. “For burials, we need three things, kafan (a sheet of white cloth), wooden planks and gravediggers. Earlier, a cloth would cost Rs 1,100 while wooden planks came at Rs 1,200. The labourers charged about Rs 700. Now, the traders do not give the cloth anything less than Rs 2,000. The wooden planks are also in high demand as they are needed in cremation too. So the cost has gone up considerably,” says Mufti Ashraf. Muzaffarnagar’s Gore Ghariba Kabristan was also getting at least 11 bodies daily, mostly of Covid-19 patients. While in Bareilly, the graveyards were facing the shortage of workers. In Prayagraj, several graveyards had hired earthmovers to cope with the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/graveyards-in-up-running-low-on-space-some-facing-shortage-of-diggers/articleshow/82452069.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Dehradun||Police arrest two men for black-marketing of oxygen flowmeters||Dehradun: Two men were held from the Patel Nagar area of Dehradun on Thursday for allegedly hoarding oxygen cylinder flowmeters and selling them at inflated prices. Police recovered six flowmeters, equipment used to regulate the flow of oxygen from the cylinder, from their possession. The accused have been identified as Prince Kamboj, 35, resident of Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, and Shivam Kumar, 23, resident of Tyagi Road in Dehradun. They were selling the flowmeters, which cost around Rs 1000, at 15 times the price. On May 5, the police team received inputs that two persons are indulging in black-marketing of oxygen flowmeters and the informer also shared the mobile number to contact the accused persons. "Posing as a relative of a Covid patient, one of the members of the police team called on the number and spoke to Prince Kamboj. He quoted Rs 15,000 as the price of the flowmeter. After negotiations, he agreed to sell it at Rs 12,500," said sub-inspector Vivek Bhandari. The accused have been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 270 (whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/police-arrest-two-men-for-black-marketing-of-oxygen-flowmeters/articleshow/82440889.cms||Gaurav Talwar

A total of 33 ministers will form part of his cabinet. First-time MLA and Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi does not figure on the list. While Duraimurugan is among 18 former ministers to be inducted into the cabinet, Palanivel Thiagarajan, son of late party heavyweight P T R Palanivel Rajan and a former investment banker with Lehman Brothers, has been allocated finance portfolio. Former Chennai Mayor Ma Subramanian is among the 15 who would be first-time ministers. Governor Banwarilal Purohit approved the recommendations of Stalin on appointing the ministers and allocating the portfolios. “M K Stalin, the chief minister-designate has sent a list of persons to be appointed as ministers of the state of Tamil Nadu along with their portfolios on Thursday,” a Raj Bhavan release said. On Wednesday, Stalin staked claim to form the government after being unanimously elected as legislature party leader by 133 MLAs, including eight MLAs who were elected on DMK’s rising sun symbol. Stalin said that he was proud to have risen through the ranks with hardwork as an asset to the decorated seat of former chief ministers CN Annadurai and M Karunanidhi. “May 7 will be etched in golden letters in the history of Tamil Nadu politics. The DMK is going to assume charge for the sixth time. The DMK’s return to power realization of the dream of Kalaignar brings happiness, but there is sadness too,” Stalin said, reminding the low-key swearing in ceremony due to Covid pandemic. Pointing to his inability to take charge in front of cadres who strove hard for the party’s victory, Stalin appealed to partymen to view the ceremony on television from home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-stalins-33-minister-dmk-cabinet-is-a-mix-of-old-new/articleshow/82444225.cms||---
---||Meerut||RLD chief Ajit Singh dies of Covid-19 at 82||MEERUT: Rashtriya Lok Dal chief and former Union minister Ajit Singh, 82, passed away at a private hospital in Gurgaon on Thursday morning, his son Jayant Chaudhary confirmed. Son of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, Ajit Singh had contracted Covid-19 last month. “Chaudhary Ajit Singh Ji was diagnosed Covid positive on April 20. He battled his condition till the very end and breathed his last today morning, the 6th of May, 2021,” Jayant tweeted. Senior party members claimed the cremation, due to the raging pandemic, was a low-key affair with only close family members in attendance. “As the nation confronts the horrific pandemic, it is our humble request to all those who wish to pay their respects, to please stay at home as far as possible. We must observe all safety protocols to keep ourselves and everyone around us healthy and safe. This would be the best way to honour Chaudhary Sahib as well as those Covid warriors who are working night and day to protect us,” Jayant said in a tweet. Born in Meerut, Singh began his political career as a Rajya Sabha MP in 1986. An IIT alumnus, he pursued his post-graduation from the Illinois Institute in Chicago and then joined IBM. He spent 16 years in the US before he reluctantly came back to India in the 80s and formally joined politics. Ajit Singh was inducted as Union minister of industry in the VP Singh government in 1989 and also served as food minister in the P V Narasimha Rao government. Seven-time member of the Lok Sabha, Singh formed Rashtriya Lok Dal and joined the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government as the agriculture minister in 2001. Known to his critics as a fair weather man, Singh switched sides on multiple occasions to stay with the party in power. He also served as civil aviation minister in Manmohan Singh’s cabinet in 2011. A stalwart from the sugarcane belt, Ajit Singh represented the family borough Baghpat with his party's stronghold spread across several districts in western Uttar Pradesh. Towards the fag end, he tasted successive defeats – first in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and later in the 2019 LS polls in Muzaffarnagar where he lost by a thin margin to BJP’s Sanjiv Balyan. Senior leaders across party lines condoled Singh’s demise. “Extremely sad at the demise of former Union minister Chaudhary Ajit Singh Ji. He was always devoted to the interests of the farmers. He efficiently discharged the responsibilities of several departments at the Centre. My condolences to his family and supporters in this hour of mourning. Om Shanti!" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet. “Saddened by the demise of Rashtriya Lok Dal chief and former Union minister Chaudhary Ajit Singh. He always raised his voice in the interest of farmers. As a public representative and a minister, he left a different mark on the politics of the country. My condolences to his family and well-wishers,” President Ram Nath Kovind tweeted in Hindi. “The news of the untimely demise of Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh is sad. My condolences to his family and loved ones,” Rahul Gandhi said. Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, said, “Got the sad news of the demise of popular leader, former Union minister and farmer-friendly leader Chaudhary Ajit Singh Ji. Chaudhary Sahab’s demise is an irreparable loss for society and politics.” She offered her deepest condolences to Ajit Singh’s son, Jayant Chaudhary. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “The news of Chaudhary Ajit Singh’s demise is very painful. In his long public life, he was always connected with the public and the land. At the same time, he also struggled for the interests of farmers, labourers and other weaker sections. My condolences to his family and supporters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rld-chief-ajit-singh-dies-of-covid-19-at-82/articleshow/82440853.cms||---

He hurriedly led them towards the extreme north of the graveyard, off the beaten path, where a row of freshly dug graves were waiting. Alam asked them to choose anyone of them, and they did. A little while later, as the body was being lowered and one of the mourners was sobbing helplessly, an earthmover was busy digging more pits, nearby. As secretary of Agra’s Panchkuian Kabristan, Alam says that he has never seen such a rush of bodies. It had prompted him to ask for an earthmover from the civic body. “The number of bodies has significantly increased in the last three weeks. On an average, we used to get six bodies earlier. Now the number has increased to 20. We are digging graves in advance with an excavator provided by the municipal corporation to avoid inconvenience to the relatives of the deceased,” Alam said.

---||Trichy||‘Last-minute’ rush, busy roads till noon in Trichy||Trichy: Commercial streets in Trichy city wore a deserted look on Thursday, the first day one of intensified restrictions to curtail public movement. However, last-minute purchases by residents saw crowding on the arterial roads. Trichy corporation officials and police personnel by around 12pm, used loudspeakers urging the shops to stop their sales.Grocery shops and vegetable shops commenced their businesses by around 6am. Similarly, tea stalls and meat stalls adhered to the restrictions by downing their shutters around 12pm. Traders said that owing to the limited hours of operation, they restricted the quantity of raw materials they usually procure when the shops were functioning till night. Tasmac shops which were opened from 8am witnessed a surge only in the closing hours. Social distancing was completely flouted in Thennur, Gandhi market and Bhima Nagar localities. A senior corporation official in Trichy said that the shops were told that a minimum penalty of Rs 5,000 will be levied if there are any deviations in the standard operating procedures. In Central bus stand, the footfall of passengers witnessed a fall by 10%. “Peak hours in the evening attracted the usual crowd but the day time saw only a few people boarding, far less than the 50% capacity allowed in buses,” a TNSTC official said. Trichy city police said that the movement of vehicles was high between 8am and 12pm. “Roads in the afternoon were deserted, only those who had genuine reasons stepped out. We are penalising the offenders,” a police officer near MGMGH said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/last-minute-rush-busy-roads-till-noon-in-trichy/articleshow/82447832.cms||---

However, as traders have firmly opposed the relocation, the authorities are yet to take a final call on the proposal.“We have started preparing the G Corner ground to accommodate both retail and wholesale vegetable traders. Retail traders can use the helipad facility,” a source with the corporation said. Soon after information about shifting the market was shared with the traders on Thursday, a section of vendors resorted to a protest against the proposal. “We shall abide by the Covid-19 restriction measures by functioning within the Gandhi market, officials can penalise if we commit violations but we cannot move out. If forced, we may suspend the vegetable sales,” H Ramachandran, a retail vegetable vendor said. Following the backlash from the traders, corporation had softened its stand. “We convened a meeting to shift the Gandhi market but the traders wanted to do business only here. We will take a call on Friday,” corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/traders-oppose-plan-to-shift-gandhi-market-to-g-corner/articleshow/82447833.cms||---

The tigress was rescued by wildlife veterinarian Dr Chetan Patond on April 21 and released on May 2. T2-C1 was first sighted in injured condition inside the sanctuary by the patrolling staff on April 18. TOI had on April 21 reported tigress T2-C1, which was one of the offspring of the second litter of park’s dominating tigress T2, was seen limping by the patrolling staff on April 18. “A wire snare was observed in her leg. The snare was not of metal but a strong rope generally used for rappelling and climbing purposes,” said DFO Subhash Puranik. Puranik said, “The rope was so tightly stuck that had it not been removed the forelimb would have to be amputated. There is a wound and swelling on the leg and the tigress was unable to stand on four legs. It was released after the wound healed. Immediately after the tigress was released it approached a waterhole and relaxed.” This is the second incident in the last two years where a tiger was entangled in a wire snare and successfully released in the wild. In May 2019, a male tiger cub was rescued and its snare was removed. The 148 sq km Tipeshwar sanctuary, 180km from Nagpur, near Pandharkawda, has an old history of snares being laid by local poachers to kill herbivores like deer, wild boar, and chitals for bushmeat. Tigers come into contact with these snares leaving them injured. There are 14 villages bordering the sanctuary. This is the fourth recorded case from Tipeshwar where a tiger was entangled in wire snares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tipeshwar-tigress-released-in-wild-after-treatment-for-snare-injury/articleshow/82442251.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao speaks to PM on vaccine and Remdesivir shortage, says no to lockdown||HYDERABAD: Following a severe shortage of vaccines, Remdesivir injections and oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients in the state, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately increase the allocations to Telangana. The CM also ruled out imposing lockdown in the state. The chief minister, who spoke to the PM over phone on Thursday evening, said the state had received only 50 lakh doses of vaccines and needs two lakh to 2.5 lakh vaccines every day. He said the state was getting only 4,900 Remdesivir vials a day, while the requirement is at least 25,000 vials a day and urged him to provide the injections immediately. He said only 440 MTs of oxygen was being supplied to the state, which should be increased to 500 MTs. He also brought to the notice of the PM that oxygen supplies allocated from Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu and Ballari in Karnataka were not transported to Telangana. “People from neighbouring states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and AP are coming down to Hyderabad for coronavirus treatment and this is putting additional burden on Telangana’s resources,” KCR told the PM. Later, following the directions of the PM, Union minister Piyush Goyal spoke to KCR and assured that the Centre would take steps to supply vaccines and medicines to Telangana. Goyal said apart from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, oxygen supplies from north-eastern states would be sent to Telangana. The CM, who held a review meeting with senior health officials, reiterated that the state government had no intention to impose lockdown in the state as it would not only destroy the livelihoods of people but also slow down the economy and hit the revenues badly. KCR said the lockdown will leave a severe impact on migrant workers, farming sector, industries and livelihood of the people. “Instead of imposing a lockdown, micro-level containment zones will be declared where the number of positive cases is more and preventive steps will be taken,” he said. The officials told the CM that of the 1.56 lakh positive cases in government and private hospitals, 1.30 lakh (85 per cent) had recovered from the infection. KCR directed the health officials to hold a press conference every day and inform the people about the Covid-19 situation in the state. Since there is a shortage of vaccines in the state, he instructed the health department to give priority to administer second doses. He also spoke with manufacturers of Remdesivir . Since the state government has decided to provide medicine kits to people testing positive for Covid-19 with mild symptoms, the CM said the kits should be provided at the doorsteps of the patients by Asha workers and ANMs. He said various reports have suggested that the second wave severity could come down after May 15. “People will have to wear masks, maintain social distancing and avoid social gatherings,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-speaks-to-pm-on-vax-remdesivir-shortage/articleshow/82442274.cms||Koride Mahesh

The parents told TOI that schools have been ordered by the state government to charge only the tuition fees, but they have found out ways of charging extra money by introducing apps in the online classes. They further said that the subscription charges of the apps are quite high, but don’t offer any special service, and the quality of online classes remains the same. “We have received several complaints, especially against mid-level private schools. We have even informed the state education department about it,” said Arif Khan, president of the parents’ body.

---||Chennai||To be a legislator, it is acumen not education that’s key||Much like the past, the state cabinet would be having ministers with a mix of educational backgrounds this time too. In the list of minister-designates are the names of doctorate holders P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan and K Ponmudy. Alongside are the names of P Moorthy and Anitha Radhakrishnan, both school dropouts, who are set to take charge as ministers for commercial taxes and fisheries.Not just the cabinet, the state assembly too would have a grand mix of legislators of varied educational backgrounds — from those who have just done their Class V to those with PhD suffixed to their names. As far as educational qualifications are concerned there seems to be very little difference between the two Dravidian parties. If the DMK has Ponmudy, the AIADMK has a doctorate MLA in Pollachi V Jayaraman. At the other end of the spectrum, the AIADMK has MLAs like former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and former minister P Thangamani who took the political plunge with only a school education.According to the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) which analysed the educational qualifications of 224 MLAs, who won the recent election, seven had completed Class V, while 18 MLAs passed Class VIII.Politicians feel it is unfair to take into account educational qualification because the Constitution does not lay down any such criteria and what matters is dedication and the urge to serve people. They cite examples ranging from K Kamaraj to the more recent Edappadi K Palaniswami who was appreciated by the Centre for his handling of Covid.In 2016, there were even more MLAs with just schooling as their educational qualification when it analysed affidavits of 204 MLAs. "At least 89 (44%) MLAs have declared their educational qualifications to be between Class V pass and Class XII pass, while 110 (54%) MLAs have declared having an educational qualification of graduate or above," the 2016 report said.Of late there is a trend among political parties to look at educational qualification of candidates too, said ADR state coordinator Joseph Victor Raj. "But it does not seem to be a key criteria. Parties are unlikely to drop someone because of his or her education,’’ he said. It’s the candidates popularity in the constituency, money and muscle power and the "winnability" that are taken into consideration.Some time ago, the Rajasthan government set a minimum educational qualification for those contesting civic polls. But that was rolled back by the next government after the rule faced stiff opposition. "I have never felt that lack of a formal higher education as an impediment. In my political career I could serve people as efficiently and even better than many MLAs,’’ says P Karthikeyan, two-time MLA of Vellore who is a school dropout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/to-be-a-legislator-it-is-acumen-not-education-thats-key/articleshow/82442250.cms||Mayilvaganan
---||Navi-mumbai||Covid-19: Total caseload in Maharashtra close to 5 million, Mumbai tally plateaus||MUMBAI: After a four-day respite, Maharashtra was back to adding over 60,000 cases on Thursday. If daily detections stay the course, total caseload in the state is likely to touch 50 lakh before the weekend. The state added 62,194 cases and 853 deaths on Thursday, taking the caseload to 49.42lakh. And with the addition of 853 deaths, total toll rose to 73,515. Covid tally and related deaths from Mumbai appear to have stabilised though. BMC’s update said 3,028 cases and 69 deaths were registered in the last 24-hour period. Since March 2020, the city's tally has climbed to 6.68 lakh cases and toll to 13,580 deaths. “Covid situation in the city is improving. Our daily test positivity rate is dropping,'' said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The update said 30,942 tests were carried out on Wednesday as against 35,377 on Tuesday. “Due to the restrictions, people are not stepping out. There are no crowds that can be tested at malls, eateries, public places as we used to do previously,” said Kakani. The focus now is on preparations for the third wave. “We are in the process of procuring ventilators for public hospitals,” added Kakani. At the state level, some districts–Nandurbar, Hingoli, Sindhudurg and Nanded–had a high death rate of between 2.3-2.9%, far higher than the state's average of 0.9%. “The high deaths are still a concern.

If daily detections stay the course, total caseload in the state is likely to touch 50 lakh before the weekend. The state added 62,194 cases and 853 deaths on Thursday, taking the caseload to 49.42lakh. And with the addition of 853 deaths, total toll rose to 73,515. Covid tally and related deaths from Mumbai appear to have stabilised though. BMC’s update said 3,028 cases and 69 deaths were registered in the last 24-hour period. Since March 2020, the city's tally has climbed to 6.68 lakh cases and toll to 13,580 deaths. “Covid situation in the city is improving. Our daily test positivity rate is dropping,'' said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The update said 30,942 tests were carried out on Wednesday as against 35,377 on Tuesday. “Due to the restrictions, people are not stepping out. There are no crowds that can be tested at malls, eateries, public places as we used to do previously,” said Kakani. The focus now is on preparations for the third wave. “We are in the process of procuring ventilators for public hospitals,” added Kakani. At the state level, some districts–Nandurbar, Hingoli, Sindhudurg and Nanded–had a high death rate of between 2.3-2.9%, far higher than the state's average of 0.9%. “The high deaths are still a concern.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Volunteers resort to crowdfunding to help Covid positive patients||HYDERABAD: With hospitals facing shortage of beds, volunteer groups had now started crowdfunding to establish isolation centres for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms. As hospitals are charging astronomical amounts for Covid-19, these groups have taken it upon themselves to set up isolation centres that are not only free but are also accessible to a larger part of the society. The Covid-19 Surge Impact Alliance has started an online crowdfunding campaign, wherein they have sought funds to start free isolation centres for patients in Hyderabad with a capacity of 30-50 beds. The centre will provide basic care under the observation of paramedical staff to people not needing hospitalisation and reduce the burden on hospitals. “Primary beneficiaries would be people who don’t need critical care. The facility will be for people from the weaker sections of the society. We intend to have 20 percent of the total capacity as oxygen beds,” said Raj Janagam, spokesperson of Covid-19 Surge Impact Alliance, which has also associated with corporates to raise funds for their initiative. The alliance has been able to raise Rs 5.51 lakh in the last few days and has a target of Rs one crore. Similarly, Feed the Needy, has started an online crowdfunding campaign to set up additional beds at Government Area Hospital, Kondapur. “We are aiming to raise $50,000 to provide the hospital with oxygen concentrators. These concentrators will help countless poor souls and their families from grave distress with the current hapless conditions. Any surplus funds that we collect will be used to help families in need,” said Pradeep Gadicherla of Feed the Needy, who initiated the campaign. They have raised about $15,000 (Rs 11.06 lakh) so far. These groups are being supported by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, resident welfare associations and corporates to establish Covid-19 isolation centres in several areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/volunteers-resort-to-crowdfunding-to-help-ve-patients/articleshow/82442347.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu dips into its emergency reserves to stave off Oxygen crisis||CHENNAI: Two weeks after Tamil Nadu started asking the Centre to enhance oxygen allocation to the state to 500 metric tonnes from 280 metric tonnes under a revised allocation plan, consumption level of oxygen at hospitals in the state crossed 450 tonnes on Thursday, forcing health authorities to send emergency message across hospitals. The state got 280 metric tonnes when the active cases count was around 70,000. Over the last three weeks, active cases soared from around 50,000 to 1.28 lakh. Almost all oxygen beds and ICUs in most hospitals are full. The state health department has been drawing oxygen from its reserves, diverting industrial oxygen from MSMEs and tapping into all possible sources to keep the gas flowing in hospitals. While senior health officials, including health secretary J Radhakrishnan, presented the crisis before the Madras high court, political leaders had sent letters to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan seeking immediate action. “We have done everything we can to keep things safe and smooth,” said a senior official. For instance, a week ago, as a contingency measure, the state diverted industrial oxygen from a private steel plant in Gummidipoondi. In the last two days, nearly 1,378 cylinders from this plant was allotted to government and private hospitals in the city. “It was meant to be a reserve; it is now an important source,” the official said. With this the requirement for medical oxygen in Tamil Nadu touched 500 metric tonnes a day – this includes oxygen requirement in ambulances and at people’s homes. But the allotment from the centre was not enhanced. While all hospitals have set up committees to ensure judicious use of oxygen, several non-government organisations are working to set up oxygen generation plants or sourcing oxygen cylinders. “None of these measures are adequate. For the number of patients to have the allocation from the centre should double,” the official added. The oxygen allocation to the state is done by the Union health ministry based on recommendations from the Centre’s empowered group of secretaries (EG-II) which coordinates medical logistics, including oxygen. On May 5, the ministry revised allotments for 13 states, Tamil Nadu was left out. States with fewer active cases have been given higher allocations. For instance, Telangan which has around 77,000 active cases is allotted 360 metric tonnes. On May 5, allocation for Madhya Pradesh, which has 89,000 active cases, increased to 643 metric tonnes. For Andhra Pradesh it was increased to 500metric tonnes from 360 metric tonnes. The state has 1.70 active cases. On April 15, based on the supply plan suggested by the EG II, Tamil Nadu was allotted 220MT of oxygen by the Union health ministry. The plan suggested that allocation would be increased to 320MT by April 25 and 465MT by April 30. On April 18, however, a revised order increased allotment to Maharashtra, UP, Delhi, Rajasthan and added fresh allocations for Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand. The ministry allotment of 280MT to Tamil Nadu will not be altered. While Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram questioned the rationale behind the allocation on Twitter, CPM MP from Madurai S Venkatesan wrote to Harsh Vardhan saying 13 patients died at the state-run medical College hospital in Chengalpet on Tuesday due to lack of oxygen. “Out of 447 admissions there for Covid, 309 required oxygen support. It is not an isolated example, and this is the situation in many parts of Tamil Nadu,” he said. “In this situation the supply plan has not done justice and ignored the state of Tamil Nadu even after repeated appeals by the government of TN for increased allocation,” he said. “I regret to state that the Government of India has to answer the people of Tamil Nadu if lives are lost due to inadequate allocation of oxygen supply. This is an urgent appeal and your intervention is sought without loss of time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/state-dips-into-its-emergency-reserves-to-stave-off-o2-crisis/articleshow/82444376.cms||---

At a meeting to review the progress of the vaccination programme in the state convened by the CM, health officials revealed that vaccine wastage had been brought to 0.5% which is negligible in a way. Insiders revealed that the wastage was in fact incidental while flaws in planning and micro-planning had been eliminated. The officials also said that so far, 68, 536 persons in the age group of 18-44 have been vaccinated. Later, health officials urged people to come forward to take Covid-19 vaccine as it was the other important pillar of Covid-19 containment besides prevention. UP to get 1cr doses of vaccine next week: Health officials claimed that to ensure the availability of adequate doses of the vaccine in Uttar Pradesh, the state government has ordered to procure 50-50 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin each, from the manufacturing companies. Stating that the consignment was expected for delivery next week, officials assured that there was no dearth of the stocks even today. Earlier, the Yogi government had floated a short term global tender for 40 million doses of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccination-drive-for-18-44-age-group-in-11-more-up-dists/articleshow/82444371.cms||---

From a slow start to the job drive and a shift in remote hiring, many companies are now coming forward with offers in emerging technologies as they augment projects in areas of artificial intelligence, data sciences, blockchain and internet of things. Digitization of operations by companies has led to an increase in campus recruitments, especially by IT services and product companies. “Since there is a rise in digital banking, e-retailing and e-commerce, more service based companies have come forward to recruit freshers in newer projects. During the first wave, we were skeptical that companies may reduce their intake and delay placements. But this time, the second wave has instead boosted the placements,” said K Kishore, director, training and placements at Vasavi College of Engineering. There is a rise in demand for trained and certified students as colleges have observed an uptick in the number of offers from product-based companies and start-ups. “There is a huge demand for students who are trained and certified in resources such as Full Stack, JAVA, Salesforce, front-end engineering etc. Due to rise in good offers, the average salary in our institution has increased from Rs 4.90 lakh to Rs 6 lakh this year,” said Vijaya Mair, head campus and corporate relations of CVR College of Engineering, adding that core civil and mechanical companies are offering more number of designing roles. There is also a marked rise in the number of high-paying offers in few institutions. “This year, we have had offers from various companies to the tune of Rs 12-33 lakhs.

The 63-year-old patient was at the centre only for three days until his death. The family also alleged that they tried their best to speak to the management, but were not given a hearing. Shashi Choran was admitted to the Nesco centre on April 24 after he took ill. He was carrying an iPhone to communicate with his family besides a personal diary, a medical file and Rs 10000 in cash. “My uncle had decided that he would give the cash to staff at the facility once he got discharged for supporting him in tough times. Unfortunately, he did not get that opportunity, Choran’s niece, Premlata Maurya, told TOI. Choran was initially in the general ward when his iPhone went “missing.” “There was no other way to communicate as relatives are prohibited from entering the facility. So the day he was moved in an ambulance from the general ward to the ICU, we gave him another handset. We spoke with him over video call around midnight on April 26. He did not mention any other belongings going missing,” said Maurya. Around 5am on April 27, the family was informed that Choran’s oxygen level had dropped and he had passed away. After his body was taken away for cremation, the family was told his belongings were not there. “We were asked to come back after two days. We waited for several hours to meet the dean but in vain,” said Mourya. Two days later, the family was given Choran’s wallet with just Rs 800 in cash inside. Both his phones, his diary, his medical file and the rest of his cash had vanished. The family then approached Vanrai police where an FIR was lodged. “We will check CCTVs at the centre and make inquiries with staff,” a police officer said. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the facility, said they would cooperate with the police investigation. She added that the family had not met her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sr-citizens-2-phones-cash-file-stolen-at-nesco-centre/articleshow/82444405.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Jain community sets up five isolation centres at city hotels||HYDERABAD: The family members of Vijay Vidhyut Gadiya heaved a sigh of relief when the MBA graduate recovered from Covid-19 after spending a week at the isolation centre at Platinum Hotel, Himayath Nagar here. Vijay’s father said that homely atmosphere at the isolation centre helped his son to recover. “Though my son was at the isolation centre, we felt that he was taking treatment at home. Such homely atmosphere at the isolation centre helped him to recover within a week,” said Vijay Sampathraj Gadiya, who is a businessman. Similarly, Hamir Singh, a resident of Bolarum was admitted at Central Court Hotel, a makeshift isolation centre at Hyderabad. “I have spent five days at the isolation centre. Never in that period I felt I was at the isolation centre. It was so good,” said Hamir Singh. Like them, about 300 Covid-19 patients, who took treatment at all the five isolation centres _ including Tourist Hotel at Koti, Hotel Lemon Tree at Banjara Hills, Central Park at Hyderguda and MetroPolis at Secunderabad, and Platinum Hotel, at Himayathnagar _ recovered quite well. All these isolation centres were set up by the Jain Relief Foundation (JRF). “Shortage of beds, oxygen cylinders and rising Covid-related deaths inspired us to do something to help people in these desperate times,” said Prashant Kocheta, one of the directors of the JRF. “First we started with the isolation centre at Platinum Hotel. Subsequently, we opened centres at four other hotels. These facilities have 250 beds, medical infrastructure, including oxygen cylinders, ventilators and a team of expert doctors,” added Prashant. Interestingly, not even one death was reported at these isolation centre and everyone recovered. “Round the clock surveillance by a team of doctors and para medical staff. Providing proper diet and medication helped the patients recover fast. Almighty had given our community this opportunity to serve the needy,” Prashant said. JRF is also planning to arrange plasma donors. “JRF has also tied up with other private hospitals to provide medical services,” Prashant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jain-community-sets-up-five-isolation-centres-at-city-hotels/articleshow/82442420.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Grocery shops shut despite exemption, consumers hit||LUCKNOW: The supply of grocery and other essential commodities has been hit in the city as despite exemption from curfew, grocers are either keeping their shops closed or opening only for a brief period in the morning or evening. Doorstep delivery is also taking 3-4 days which is adding to the people’s problems. In some areas, police is asking the owners to shut shops after finding that they are not following Covid-19 safety protocols. Residents of several localities complain about the crisis of essential commodities at home, barring milk and bread which are readily available. As the curfew period was initially of three days, many people did not keep adequate stock but since it has been extended till May 10, they are facing shortage. Vaishnavi Raj of Sector L, Aliganj, said: “We didn’t go for bulk purchase of essential items as there was no government order that grocers will also shut shops. However, no grocery store in my locality has opened for the last five days.” Prateek Srivastava of Daliganj, who had to go all the way to Gomtinagar to buy grocery, said: “I buy the stock in the first week of every month, but due to curfew since May 1, shops are closed in my area.” He said some small grocery shops were open but the items were of poor quality. “Around 11 am, cops asked the owners of these small shops to pull down shutters as they were not following Covid protocol,” he added. Similar situation prevailed in Mahanagar, Niralanagar, Nishatganj, Hazratganj and Shringarnagar where only a few shops were open. “A few shops opened in the evening but only for a few hours. By the time our turn came, we only got half the items we were looking for,” said Isha Shukla of Sringarnagar. “Online stores have put a cap of orders of minimum Rs 500 for home delivery. As a result, we have to purchase some other goods which we don’t require immediately,” said Pawan Kukreja of Niralanagar. Shailesh Kumar of Krishnanagar said if such a situation prevailed, there would be overcrowding as soon as the curfew gets over. Some shopkeepers said they closed voluntarily as many items were out of stock and they were not getting adequate supplies from wholesalers. Joint commissioner of police, law and order, Piyush Mordia said, “Only those shops which are not following Covid protocol are being asked to close down as per the directions of the state government. If any shopkeeper is forced by cops to shut without any reason, he/she may approach senior officers,” he added. TIMES VIEW If grocery stores are exempted from curfew, it’s the responsibility of traders to ensure that people get what they need and all safety protocols are followed. People too need to share responsibility with grocers in implementing preventive measures. At the same time, cops will have to see that essentials are easily accessible to people and if they find violation at any place, they should persuade them to cooperate. The city is going through a crisis, which requires each and every individual to show a sense of responsibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/grocery-shops-shut-despite-exemption-consumers-hit/articleshow/82444433.cms||Aditi Singh

Around 3,500 shops at prominent markets in the New Delhi area pay this fee every month. The decision was severely criticised by shopkeepers, who said the civic body had imposed the hike at a time when the city is reeling under the Covid pandemic. They added that the traders had already suffered huge losses in the last one year. NDMC had made a similar attempt last year too. However, the decision was rolled back after the chief minister issued directions against it at a council meeting. Generally, the health and trade licence is issued for a period of 3-5 years and the fees can be revised after two years. Baljit Singh Kohli, chairman of the Palika Bazar association, said, “Last month, we wrote to the Prime Minister, chief minister, and others for relief. Of them, CM Arvind Kejriwal and MP Meenakshi Lekhi assured to look into the matter, but there has been no relief”.

Also, despite instructions from senior district administration officers, the chief medical officer’s office was not able to make several dedicated Covid hospitals create their accounts on the online dashboard — Integrated Covid command centre - Hospital-Wise Bed Availability (https://beds.dgmhup-covid19.in/EN/covid19bedtrack) — meant for the people to track the availability of beds. Of the 72 covid facilities, 66 had uploaded their bed status by 10pm on Thursday. Akhilesh Bansal, a businessman from Daliganj, desperately searched for an oxygen supported bed for his 55-year-old sister-in-law. “I called five private hospitals between 1-3 pm and all said that they had no beds though the dashboard stated that they had some. Finally, I got a bed allotted through Integrated Covid Command Centre on the intervention of a senior district administrative officer,” he said. Special officer in-charge Covid relief in Lucknow, Roshan Jacob, found that laxity in the functioning of Rapid Response Teams (RRT). The Covid centre called 242 home quarantined patients to inquire about their well-being of whom 42 said that neither any RRT contacted them, nor they were given any medicines. She directed officers to issue show-cause notices to medical officers in-charge under whom these RRTs were working. Long queues were also seen outside most oxygen refilling stations since early morning.  “I have been standing here for six hours without food and water, but the station staff is saying that distribution to individuals will start only after supply to the hospital is over,” said Samarth Sen, a private executive, who wanted the refill for his critical ill friend. “Since all the other family members of the friend are also down with mild Covid-19 symptoms, they are not in a condition to stand in line, hence I volunteered to bail them out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dip-in-cases-springs-hope-but-its-still-dark-tunnel-for-patients/articleshow/82444473.cms||---

Universities in the UK have recommended that international students come vaccinated, but those in the US and Canada have been silent. So parents of most students with confirmed admissions, whether in the US, UK or Canada, are worked up about their wards getting both shots before leaving, especially in view of the vaccine shortage. Amid this scramble, at least one city school, the Dhirubhai Ambani international school, has reached out to its students. “Our school has emailed us to ask about our interest in getting our ward vaccinated. But we are wondering if we should take the Pfizer shot once we reach the US as our university has assured that if candidates reach without being vaccinated, they can take it on campus,” said the mother of a student. “We are asking our students to take the vaccine. The situation is evolving and we are not sure if airlines will insist on vaccination by the time it is August,” said counsellor Pratibha Jain. Students who will join universities in the fall of 2021 should ideally take the first dose in May and the second in July before leaving by early- or mid-August. “We have recommended that students and parents must take their vaccine before travelling, it will make their journey safer. If they are unable to access the vaccine in India, they must do so as soon as they land abroad. Some countries may require Covid vaccine passport, and some also may permit students to take vaccines on their campus,” said Karan Gupta, another counsellor. In US, universities have been implementing vaccination policies since late March, when Rutgers University, New Jersey, became one of the first to announce that having all returning students vaccinated will allow for an “expedited return to pre-pandemic normal”, making more in-person classes possible, as also on-campus events. Since then, Cornell, Brown, the University of Notre Dame, Syracuse University, Northeastern, and Ithaca, New York, have made similar announcements. Those who are not able to be vaccinated prior to their arrival would be required to do so after they land. The US has opened vaccination for people over 16. However, even if candidates travel vaccinated, most countries have mandated a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and some countries have insisted that students undergo quarantine in a government designated facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-bound-for-foreign-univs-join-scramble-for-vaccines/articleshow/82444513.cms||Hemali Chhapia

In a letter to the ministry of education and JNU administration, the students claimed that many of them are not in the right state of mind to attend regular classes. In their request to the administration, students stated that in light of the recent decision by various universities to suspend classes and examinations, “We have written to JNU administration to immediately suspend classes, postpone exams and convene academic council and board of studies meeting with student representatives to take any further decision regarding the evaluation processes.” The students also want an extension of the on-going semester, with a semester break, to make up for the academic loss and deal with the pandemic. Over 140 students of the school of law and others attended an online meet on Thursday and demanded that “all students be promoted to the next semester unconditionally.” The students said that DU has been expanding this provision to the students already, “so why this insensitive approach by the JNU vice-chancellor?” Despite attempts, JNU administration did not respond to queries on the issue.

The order issued on Thursday stated: “All Covid hospitals should update the bed status on the dashboard and share the number of admissions, discharge and deaths of patients by 8am and 4pm daily. .” The officer said hospitals were not discharging patients and were increasing bills by keeping them admitted or asking for tests which were not necessarily required.

---||Nagpur||Vaccine is best available protection, don’t believe myths, say doctors||NAGPUR: Two vaccines available in India are at present the best protection against Covid-19, and one should not believe any social media rumours and myths about the vaccines, said expert doctors in Nagpur. With vaccination for all above 18 years gaining pace now, new series of fake news about vaccine efficacy and Covid-19 are buzzing in social media. “Vaccination is the only way forward to tackle the pandemic effectively. Don’t hesitate. Get your shots when your turn comes,” appealed infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade. “Rather I would say this should be a priority for everyone. Paid or free vaccine, whichever is available, will definitely be cheaper than succumbing to disease,” she added. Some rarest of the rare incidents in which fully vaccinated citizens died during Covid-19 treatment are being highlighted in social media these days, with an intention to discourage youths from vaccination. Moreover, some platforms are flooded with information about new mutants and strains of Covid-19 and claims that vaccines don’t have any impact on these strains. “As per recent reports, no variant can escape vaccine immunity,” confirmed Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. “The L452R mutation is shared by both B.1.429 and B.1.617 (India) variants. These are about 20% more infectious, with higher viral loads. There are chances of some immune evasions, but cannot reduce vaccine efficacy,” he added. It’s now well known and proven fact that people who got vaccinated can also get infected, but their infection turns serious in very rare cases. Even after two weeks of complete vaccination, there are chances of infection in some people. “There’s nothing like 100% in any of the vaccines across the world. For that matter, Covid-19 vaccine has been developed on a war footing and further research will bring better vaccines for us in future. But, till then, we have no better option than getting a jab as quickly as possible,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte.

---||Dehradun||In view of Covid surge, U’khand HC directs high-powered committee to hold meeting, decide on release of prisoners||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed a high-powered committee (HPC) tasked with release of prisoners on bail or parole to hold a meeting in the next two weeks and review the cases of under-trial prisoners and those who have been convicted for offences punishable for less than seven years. The committee has been directed to make its recommendation on the release of the prisoners within two weeks of the meeting. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said that “since the coronavirus pandemic is likely to be there for the next few months amidst predictions of a third wave, the HPC should hold a meeting every month and deal with the issue accordingly.” The government meanwhile has been directed to ensure inoculation of prisoners aged above 18 years and to conduct RT-PCR test of any inmate who is released on bail or parole. The IG (Prison) was directed to ensure that sufficient hardware and software is available in the jails so as to permit the prisoners to converse with their counsel through the ‘E-Mulakaat portal. The directions came while the court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a Roorkee-based resident seeking the release of under-trial and under-investigation prisoners. The petition also sought release of juveniles lodged in correction homes. The petitioner argued that the Covid numbers are setting new records each day and all evidence shows that the second wave is more deadly. Since the medical infrastructure of the state is already under severe strain and if the virus spreads to jails, which are even by the government’s own admission running at over 200% occupancy, the consequences will be devastating, the petition said, requesting the court to step in and direct the release of prisoners who pose no threat to society. The court has now given the state government a month’s time to file its reply to the directions issued and listed the case for further hearing on June 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-view-of-covid-surge-ukhand-hc-directs-high-powered-committee-to-hold-meeting-decide-on-release-of-prisoners/articleshow/82439224.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Goa||15-day lockdown needed as corrective measure: GCCI||Panaji: As Goa’s Covid-19 caseload continues to spiral, the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) has urged the state government to impose a 15-day complete lockdown as a corrective measure to break the transmission chain. GCCI, which till a fortnight resisted the idea of a complete lockdown, said that partial lockdowns are not showing any results. GCCI has recommended that the pharmaceutical industry and agro-based food processing industries must be allowed to continue operations if a statewide lockdown is imposed. In a letter to chief minister Pramod Sawant and chief secretary Parimal Rai, GCCI said that the focus on economic revival rather than human survival is “unfortunate” as the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus has put Goa’s entire health infrastructure under tremendous pressure. “Goa is currently facing the biggest health emergency in its history. It appears that measures like partial lockdowns are not showing the desired results,” president of GCCI Manoj Caculo said. Caculo said that the experience of the first Covid wave and the countrywide lockdown proved that the best way to control the pandemic is a total lockdown. He appreciated the government’s attempts to keep the economy going while tackling the pandemic, but said that it is time for “severe corrective measures to be adopted” to prevent Goa’s healthcare system from collapsing. “We have so far been reluctant to use the tried and tested method and seem to be concentrating more on the economic revival rather than survival of the citizens,” said Caculo. With the pandemic making deeper inroads, Goa has broken all its previous records and this has put the entire health infrastructure in the state under tremendous pressure. The state faces a shortage of hospital beds, medical equipment, oxygen, vaccination doses, ventilators. Medical staff are also stretched thin and stressed out. Many village panchayats and municipalities have declared their own lockdowns, which contradict the partial lockdowns imposed by the state. “The healthcare infrastructure is already on the brink of being overwhelmed, and there is urgent need to take the extreme measure of total lockdown for at least 15 days with a view to arrest the increasing number of positive cases and fatalities and give a much-required breather to revive the healthcare systems and the health workers to rejuvenate and ramp up capacities and capabilities,” Caculo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/15-day-lockdown-needed-as-corrective-measure-gcci/articleshow/82444667.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Unregulated antibiotics use in Covid raising risk of resistant bacteria: Experts||NAGPUR: An array of the highest level of antibiotics are being used as a precaution in Covid patients, to prevent ‘hospital acquired’ or ‘secondary’ infections. However, this can lead to a greater problem through development of resistant bacteria in the community, against whom these drugs may prove impotent in future. Though antibiotics have no role to play, some doctors are heavily relying upon them to save Covid patients from secondary infections after the steroid therapy is kicked-started or immunosuppressant drugs like Tocilizumab or Itolizumab are administered. It’s also learnt that many doctors also believe using antibiotics from the initial days of admission to save Covid patients from ‘hospital acquired’ fungal or bacterial infections, without blood investigations or other evidentiary indications. Dr Meraj Shaikh, critical care physician at Care Hospital, said some are administering Meropenem right from the first day of hospitalization after coming from the community. “If highest antibiotic Meropenem is used indiscriminately on the first day, without any clinical reason, then we will not be able to use this drug later on. It would only add to the chances of the ‘opportunistic infections’ to grow and thrive later,” said Shaikh. “We are not sure whether such random use of higher antibiotic is being done for clinical requirement or economic reasons, as there is a major cost factor involved. Also, these higher antibiotics will kill friendly bacteria too along with the harmful ones, leading to many life-threatening conditions,” he said. The immediate commercial gain from such drug misuse seems to be shrouding the danger of antibiotic resistant bacteria later. Sources said a handful in the medical fraternity are spurred to prescribe these antibiotics as there is a profit margin of 300-400% or even more. Citing an example, an insider said the most commonly used antibiotic Meropenem injection is available from stockists and distributors for Rs 450-Rs 500 but is sold at maximum retail price of Rs 3,500, or with a little ‘discount’. Dr Nikhil Balankhe, intensivist at Viveka Superspecialty Hospital, said antibiotics have some role to play only after there is positive indications in the PCT (procalcitonin) test, which is a marker for bacterial infections or such other investigations, indicating its requirement. “The misuse of antibiotics likely to propagate resistant bacteria, which would be difficult to treat. This new strain would not have an antibiotic working against it,” he said. “One must use mild antibiotics under strict expert supervision,” he said. Dr Balankhe also pointed out there are antibiotics like Cefoperazone and Ceftriaxone which are in the range of Rs200-Rs 500, which can be used instead of Meropenem, which costs around Rs10,000 for a one-day dose, or Colistin, which costs Rs12,000. Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of ICU, Care Hospital, also said India is already home to resistant bacteria and doctors should not administer highest antibiotics to treat a viral disease like Covid. “Using steroids in Covid reduces immunity but only a handful pick up infections from the hospitals. Many do not even require antibiotics,” he said. “Using antibiotics so rampantly may lead to multidrug resistant bacteria, which may even kill the carrier,” he said. Jay Tekchandani, leading pharmacist, said there had been a 10 fold spike in sales of antibiotics now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unregulated-antibiotics-use-in-covid-raising-risk-of-resistant-bacteria-experts/articleshow/82441055.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 30-year-old who made & sold fake passes for outstation travel held||Mumbai: A 30-year-old man has been arrested in a fake e-pass racket. An e-pass has to be applied online on the police website for permission to travel inter-city or inter-state in an emergency. On April 25, the police received an application for 16 people to travel from Borivli to Akkalkot in Solapur. Each applicant must provide identity proof, medical fitness certificate and a document stating reason for travel. But in this case, only one of the 16 had provided an Aadhaar card and medical certificate. The police rejected the plea. On May 3, officials of Chunabhatti police station contacted Dahisar police station officials about an e-pass purportedly issued by them for 16 people. On checking the QR code, the police figured out it was a fake one. They summoned the applicant, Vaibhav Dabhekar, who had applied for it. After questioning, the police learnt that Dabhekar and his associate, Babu Mane, helped people procure e-passes. But if applications were rejected, they made fake passes. They charged Rs 500 Rs 1,000 for a person, depending on urgency or a pass. Mane is yet to be traced. Police said the accused used software to modify expired e-passes to make them appear genuine. Dabhekar has confessed to selling four fake e-passes, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-year-old-who-made-sold-fake-passes-for-outstation-travel-held/articleshow/82444629.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Drive-in vax centres at parking lots in Delhi?||NEW DELHI: Encouraged by the success of a drive-through vaccination centre opened in Mumbai, North Delhi Municipal Corporation is also planning to set up drive-through vaccination centres in its multilevel parking sites. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that a meeting was held recently to discuss the blueprint for setting up such centres. “We have written to the Delhi government to allow us to start drive-through vaccination centres where people can get vaccinated while sitting in their cars. Our multilevel parking sites and other such locations can be used for this purpose,” he added. Jai Prakash said that “Delhi has a very high vehicle density and it should adopt all good models across the country to increase the vaccination coverage.” “The feasible sites are being shortlisted. Since multilevel parkings have enough space as well as multiple floors with defined vehicle flow directions, several such units can be opened in these sites.” The mayor further said that Delhi would have to use different strategies in urban areas, villages and unauthorised areas to encourage people to come out for vaccination. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had recently started a drive-in vaccination centre at the multi-level Dadar Kohinoor parking site, which has received a good response so far. BMC has now decided to start one such vaccination centre in every civic ward. The first drive-through vaccination centre opened by BMC allows senior citizens and differently abled citizens of the city to get jabs while remaining seated in their parked vehicles. People are also allowed to spend the 30-minute mandatory observation period after getting the vaccine shot in their own vehicles. The north Delhi mayor, however, said that they were planning to open the drive-through vaccination centres for people of all categories. A senior civic official said that such vaccination centres would also help people who are delaying their visit to vaccination centres because of apprehensions about crowding and the risk of catching infection. Delhi has several multilevel parking lots in places like Hauz Khas, Munirka, New Friends Colony, Model Town, Jangpura among others. Officials state larger open parking lots can also be used for this purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drive-in-vax-centres-at-parking-lots/articleshow/82442656.cms||Paras Singh

Top brass of the state’s health department told judges that while 25 tonnes of oxygen is being diverted from Sriperumbudur to Andhra Pradesh or Telangana, the 40MT it was supposed to get in return from Palakkad in Kerala has not come. “Officials say it is a critical situation and the reserves have been used up to the extent that there may be a further day’s reserve, but there may not be oxygen supply in adequate quantity on Saturday,” said the first bench, recording the state’s precarious oxygen situation. “The Union government and the empowered committee should take immediate steps in such regard to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to the State of Tamil Nadu to meet the needs. This must be ensured by tomorrow (Friday), so that the emergency that the officials speak of of the reserves supply running out by Saturdaydoes not happen. It is critical and it requires the attention of the highest offices so that lives are not lost for want of oxygen. The Sterlite unit at Thoothukudi is unlikely to produce oxygen till next week,” the bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Thursday. During hearing, health department officials said a meeting was held on May 2, 2021, involving officials from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, central government representatives, manufacturers and others, at which a consensus was arrived at to ensure that 475MT of oxygen would be released to Tamil Nadu daily. The officials complained that notwithstanding the meeting, no allocation order had been issued for Tamil Nadu till date. They said that an allocation order was issued on May 5, but it did not include Tamil Nadu. As a result, as against the daily requirement of about 450MT per day, the Central allocation remained 280MT since last week. Pointing out that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has installed oxygen generating machines in some hospitals elsewhere at extremely short notice and at costs which are affordable, the judges said: “The state and the Union should facilitate the setting up of such units, if feasible, in this State, particularly in larger cities, including Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai.” As for availability of Remdesivir in the state, officials told the cour that at the behest of the DMK government set to assume charge on Friday, Remdesivir centres are being set up in other major cities, including Madurai and Coimbatore, for release of the drug directly to private hospitals or patients. Till April, Tamil Nadu had been allocated 1.35 lakh units of Remdesivir against the order placed of 2.5 lakh units, they said, adding that about 24,000 units had been distributed from the Kilpauk Medical College centre upon appropriate documents being produced. On the hospital beds front, the court said Tamil Nadu appeared to be doing well, though 95% of the beds having oxygen supply had been occupied. According to the officials, roughly 70% of the overall bed capacity has been occupied, but a large proportion of the available beds do not have oxygen supply. The officials have, however, indicated that measures have been initiated to augment bed capacity, including oxygenated bed capacity and that such augmented bed capacity would be available shortly. The court then directed the Centre to ensure prompt supply of vaccines so that preventive measures could be taken at the earliest to stop proliferation of cases and the possible third wave. It then adjourned further hearing on the matter to May 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/have-just-one-days-oxygen-stock-left-tn-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/82444581.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Madurai||HC seeks details on BHEL O2 plant, vax complex in TN||Madurai: The central government, which supported reopening of Sterlite plant campus for oxygen product, must explain steps it has taken to reopen oxygen plants at BHEL in Trichy, said Madras high court on Friday. It posed another query too, to the Centre. Why is the central government now procuring Covid-19 vaccines from private enterprises instead of utilising government-owned institutes that could be revived and put to effective use? A division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and B Pugalendhi raised these issues when a public interest writ petition filed by A Veronica Mary came up for hearing on Thursday. The Centre has been given time till May 19 to respond to the queries. The PIL sought production of oxygen at the BHEL in Trichy and urged the union ministry of health and family welfare to grant approval for Covid-19 vaccine production at the Integrated Vaccine Complex -- HLL Biotech Ltd -- at Chengalpet, near Chennai. The PIL said BHEL had three plants to produce 140 metric cube of oxygen per hour. Noting that the plants are lying shut down since 2003, he said the units could be revived to meet the current demand in the state. Referring to counsel’s submission that Trichy Siva MP had sent a representation to the Centre seeking to resumption of oxygen plants at BHEL, the judges asked whether BHEL had the facility as claimed by the petitioner. “If so, what are the steps taken by the Centre pursuant to the representation sent by the MP?” With regard to the vaccines, the judges observed that India is one of the pioneers of vaccine production and world's largest exporter of vaccines. “This court is not finding fault with the government's action in procuring the vaccines from private enterprises or the deliberations with regard to price. But our anguish is that when the government itself is having vaccine-manufacturing institutes, such institutes may be revived and they may be put into effective use,” observed the judges. They then sought response from the Centre and state on these following queries: Details on the number of government-owned vaccines manufacturing institutes in the country along with its period of commencement of operation, production capacity and its present status. Why vaccines are developed only at a private institute, instead of utilizing the government institutes. The case was adjourned to May 19 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-details-on-bhel-o2-plant-vax-complex-in-tn/articleshow/82441090.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Singh, who is single, is not only suffering from Covid-19 but is also grappling with financial constraints. However, thanks to an appeal issued by his niece, Pragya Yadav, help has started pouring in from various quarters for the veteran player. Pragya, who is herself pregnant but is fighting for the survival of her maternal uncle, told TOI that she exhausted all her financial resources but her uncle’s condition did not improve. “He tested Covid-19 positive on April 12 but his condition did not improve. We have to shift him to a hospital in Chowk on April 22,” she said. “Two days passed but his condition remained the same. Doctors too did not pay any heed to our concerns. I contacted his friends in the hockey association and with their help, my uncle was admitted to TS Mishra hospital on April 24,” Pragya said. “However, his condition kept worsening so we decided to admit to him to another hospital in Niralanagar on April 26. Finally, he tested negative and sent to a non-Covid ward. As I was left with no money, I took to social media and requested Indian government and sports fraternity for financial help. We approached the president of Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Narinder Batra who extended financial support to us,” she said. Pragya added that inspector general of police, Lucknow range, Laxmi Singh also contributed Rs 2 lakh for Singh. “He had a chronic spinal injury due to which it had become hard for him to play on turf. Finally, the injury forced him to quit. Later, he joined SBI from where he took premature retirement. My mamaji is single, and has an elder sister, Saraswati Devi, and an elder brother, Rajendra Pal Singh,” Pragya said. Pal, an ace dribbler, played centre half for the last Indian hockey team to win a gold medal at the Olympics in Moscow in 1980.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stung-by-virus-penury-help-pours-in-for-hockey-olympian/articleshow/82444598.cms||---

---||Surat||Glaring violation of fire safety at Covid hospitals||Surat: During inspection of Covid-designated hospitals in the city, Surat Municipal Corporation’s fire department has come across glaring lapses that pose as potential threats for major mishaps in the future. The department has issued notices to 33 hospitals in the last two days to rectify the issues. Among the major irregularities in the hospitals, fire officials came across electrical cables and oxygen lines running parallel to each other. In a few hospitals, the oxygen lines were even fitted under exposed electrical cables. The department has also suggested the hospitals to remove as many inflammable materials, which are not needed, as possible. “ICUs use curtains to divide patients, which catch fire very quickly. We have asked them to start rectifying the electrical fittings and removing the curtains,” said in-charge chief fire official B K Pareek. Taking a cue from the fire at Covid hospital in Virar, they have also asked to reduce the number of sanitizer bottles in the ICU. Surat fire officials have also found accumulation of evaporated sanitizer contents on the ceiling and in the air. “Hospitals have been asked to reduce sanitizer bottles by 50% and keep proper air ventilation in the ICUs. If windows are kept open partially, sanitizer vapours will not remain suspended in the air,” Pareek added. Installation of residual current circuit breaker (RCCB) and molded case circuit breaker (MCCB) in ICUs have also been suggested. “The air-conditioners in all hospitals are on for almost a year so we have asked them to get all these appliances serviced,” he said. Teams of firemen also found that oxygen cylinders were not chained properly due to which these may fall and cause a blast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/glaring-violation-of-fire-safety-at-covid-hospitals/articleshow/82439412.cms||---
---||Chennai||Lessons from a Gandhian’s life||Chennai: On May 4, V Kalyanam, best known as the man who served as Mahatma Gandhi’s personal secretary between 1944 and 1948, passed away in the city at 99.It was exactly 77 years ago, on another sweltering May afternoon that Kalyanam had met ‘Bapu’ for the first time in Bombay. The latter had just been released from prison and was undergoing a treatment of naturopathy in the city. But Kalyanam had soaked in the Gandhian ideology before that by working at the Sevagram Ashram for about a year and serving eight months in jail for participating in the Quit India Movement. "He was caught by the police in Delhi slipping pamphlets under doors of homes. He was fresh out of college and was doing his bit," says Kalyanam’s biographer Kumari S Neelakandan.Neelakandan spent close to three years with Kalyanam, visiting him and often staying back at his then residence in Teynampet around a decade ago, to research for his book on the nonagenarian freedom fighter titled ‘August 15’. "When Gandhi met him for the first time, Kalyanam was working in the ministry of defence as a budget assistant, a job that earned him `250 a month," says Neelakandan. On learning this, Gandhiji told him he wouldn’t be able to pay him anything more than `60 to work with him -- a proposition Kalyanam accepted without a thought.Over the next four years until Gandhi’s assassination in 1948, Kalyanam compiled letters Bapu received from across the world. He typed out letters for Gandhi, and accompanied him extensively in his travels on foot and by train. "Until very recently, he sat on his antique Remington typewriter to write letters to friends, and complaints to the corporation and the CM. He used the back of pamphlets that came with newspapers to write these letters — a frugality ritual he had picked up while working with Gandhiji," says Neelakandan.Kalyanam was among those who was by Gandhi’s side the day he was assassinated, and went on to state in several interviews thereafter that he never heard him utter the famous words, "Hey Ram", during those last moments. In Madras where he moved to in the mid-1950s, Kalyanam worked as the regional commissioner of the SC/ST commission and had a stint with Rajaji’s Swatantra Party. He donated abundantly to the Voluntary Health Services, government relief funds and medical aid for the poor. "It gave him purpose to help those in need," says Kalyanam’s daughter Nalini with whom he lived in Padur until his passing.Most of those who knew Kalyanam also reminisce about his sense of independence. "He was great with all kinds of manual work – something he picked up at the ashram. "Until the age of 97, he cooked his own meals. He also liked making tea for his visitors, and ensured they always went back with a memorable conversation," says Nalini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lessons-from-a-gandhians-life/articleshow/82432518.cms||---

Paramasami, 48, was attached with the Madurai South traffic police station. He was infected by Covid-19 in the first wave as well. Police sources said that Paramasami, a 1997-batch police constable, responded well to the treatment when he was infected the first time. At least five police personnel from Madurai district died during the first wave. Paramasami subsequently took first dose of vaccine in the month of March. He developed fever before he could take the second dose of the vaccination in April. Even after recovering from fever, he could not get vaccinated due to shortage in vaccines. Meanwhile, he got infected again with Covid-19 around 10 days ago. After undergoing medication at home for initial days, he got himself admitted to a private hospital in Thirumangalam. He died without responding to treatment on Wednesday. He is the first police staff to die in the second wave in Madurai city. He is survived by his wife and two sons.

---||Nagpur||Crowding at vax centres for 45+, many return without jab||Chandrapur: Chaotic scenes wee witnessed at the vaccination centers that were thronged by those in the 45+ age group on Thursday. Covid regulations went out of the roof as poor planning by the civic administration and little awareness forced people to flock to the vaccination centres despite the risk of catching the infection. All the seven vaccination centres where jab was scheduled for 45+ people were crowded. Even as the vaccination was to start at 9am, people, mostly elderly, queued up from 6am. “Administration has got it all wrong. They were providing on-spot vaccination till few days back and suddenly turned to online booking from Thursday without any intimation,” said Bhalerao Kimmatkar, an elderly person who was denied the jab for not scheduling his dose online. This after he waited for four hours under a blazing sun at Dr Rajendra Prasad School. Corporator Pappu Deshmukh claimed that people are confused as both who have registered online and walk-in beneficiaries are turning up at the centres at the same time. “The medical officers were giving tokens to both the lot. Insufficient supply of vaccines and lack of planning marred the process. People were losing patience and crowding up inside the centres despite risk of infection,” he said. While only 100 vaccine were given at every centre, more than 200 persons gathered there. “Elderly people were seen leaving disheartened after waiting for several hours in the sun,” said Deshmukh.

These include conducting offline 100-200 mark exams of multiple-choice-questions for all subjects combined to studying the formula given by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for internal assessment of their students. Seema Purohit, principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), said while internal marks can be used as a base for applying for admission, individual colleges too can conduct entrance examination as a special measure this year. “When I had applied for my Std XI admission, apart from the SSC marks, there was an interview to choose the candidates. Maybe this time, as a special measure, individual colleges can conduct online entrance exams and then maybe an online interview to ensure a fair and transparent process of admission. Most colleges in Pune are now well-versed with this process of conducting online exams,” Purohit said, adding that her phone has been ringing continuously as anxious parents are asking about the admission process. Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education Pune division, said one of the suggestions was for an entrance examination for FYJC admissions in the cities. “No decision has been taken. The possibility of an online entrance examination in the municipal corporation areas where the CAP is followed was discussed. In rural areas, internal marking pattern will not be an issue. Equivalency will not be a problem as we deal with it when normalising board exam marks during FYJC admissions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/edu-officials-look-at-offline-mcq-exam-cbse-pattern-for-ssc-marks/articleshow/82441119.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||43% posts vacant, state FDA working with added burden||Nagpur: The Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) is playing a key role in the state’s Covid management but with 43% posts vacant, its functioning has been crippled. Recruitments have not happened for several years while selection and related processes were clouded with controversies and litigations. Amid the second wave of Covid, FDA drug wing’s manpower shortage problem was exposed with the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court pulling it up for alleged mismanagement. It’s learnt, a team of only seven officials, including a temporary joint commissioner flown in from Mumbai a fortnight ago, are managing the production and distribution of oxygen and availability of drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in the five the districts of Vidarbha, including Nagpur. One of the senior drug inspectors, not promoted for 26 years due to technical reasons and whose post is almost like that of a district head, is functioning as assistant commissioner in Nagpur. Wardha, Chandrapur, Bhandara and Gondia do not have a similar district head or assistant commissioner (drugs). FDA has 66 posts of assistant commissioners (drugs) in the state but 35 are vacant. Except Konkan, no other division has full-time joint commissioner (drugs). Like Nagpur, they are managed by officials having additional charge for brief periods. In Nagpur, it’s been almost two years since the division had a joint commissioner in the drug wing. For the same period, there has been no regular assistant commissioner (drugs) too for Nagpur district. Apart from official posts, there is acute shortage of ministerial staff too for administrative work. “We also do not have a law officer to assist us in legal work,” said an FDA source. Of the 1,361 posts in the state, around 585 are vacant in FDA’s both drugs and food sections. Sources in Mumbai stated that the last recruitment for FDA’s drug inspectors had taken place in 2008 but they could join only in 2012 as there were tedious litigations and objections. “The recruitment is done through Maharashtra Public Service Commission. The selection criteria is tough as one should have at least three years experience in testing and manufacturing. The last full-fledged recruitment had taken place in 1996-97,” said the source. According to a source at a senior position, a list of 23 officials was put up for promotion to the post of assistant commissioners but government could not take decision due to reservation issues. “Some assistant drug inspectors were also recruited on contract basis but the process is now stuck,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/43-posts-vacant-state-fda-working-with-added-burden/articleshow/82441122.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||2 pose as women, blackmail 100 men from Pune since Jan||Pune: The cybercrime department of the Pune police has identified two men from Rajasthan, who posed as women and blackmailed at least 100 men from the city since January this year. The men have been arrested by the Rajasthan police and the city police plan to seek custody soon. The two accused would share their phone numbers after befriending the men and request them to pose nude on video calls. The duo recorded these video calls and later blackmailed the victims. A team, headed by deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake, has expedited the investigation of these cases on priority. “We will seek their custody after the investigation of the Rajasthan police is completed. They are in the custody of Khoh police station near Deeg in Rajasthan,” said senior police inspector DS Hake of the cybercrime police station. Hake further added, “We have received as many as 100 complaint applications from different parts of the city since January.” The police team tracked down the IP addresses of the electronic devices used by the suspects as well as the bank account details of suspects. “Our team visited Rajasthan last week and found out that the men had been arrested by the Rajasthan police in relation to similar cases registered there,” Hake said. According to the officer, the duo has extorted a sum ranging from Rs 3,000 to Rs 25,000 from the complainants. “All the victims, who approached the police, were fed up with the extortion and threat calls. The victims are aged between 25 and 55 years,” he said. The police officer said that, at first, the victims received a friend request on their social networking site. “The duo has prepared fake profiles on the social media site using the names of women and the victims accepted these requests. The duo then starts chatting with the victim via the messenger app. The dialogue would generally be limited to sexual topics. After chatting for a few days, the men exchanged their phone numbers and the duo called them using sound modulating software,” the officer explained. “The two men would later make video calls claiming they would pose nude, but they actually played videos of women on the calls. After this, the duo ‘compelled’ their victims to pose nude on the video calls. The accused would record the video call using a screen video recorder software,” said Hake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-pose-as-women-blackmail-100-men-from-pune-since-jan/articleshow/82441093.cms||---

Private schools, however, have expressed inability to do so as they claim that they are already running into losses as they have not hiked the fee for the last three years and maintenance cost of school building and infrastructure has also gone up. “I had to get a Wi-Fi connection and two laptops and arrange for a small reading and activity room for my children so that their overall development is not hampered due to online classes. When school libraries, electricity, internet, sports facilities and other infrastructure is not being used and parents have to shell extra to make education facilities available at home, why shouldn’t the school fee be reduced,” asked Rahul Srivastava, a parent. “We are thankful to the SC that it has paid attention to the issue. Private schools are charging hefty fee just for online classes of few hours,” he added. “Schools are not reducing fees, not paying salaries to their staff and have sacked employees in the name of Covid. They are saving and making money in every way. The government should direct all private schools to waive 50% of school fee,” another parent, Rishabh Tiwari, said. He said the schools had reduced the hours of teaching and parents were sitting with children for online classes then then there was no point in charging hefty fee. “Not a single classs was held for the entire month of April and the academic session is beginning from mid-May. Why are schools charging the fee for one and a half months when nothing is being done,” a parent, Jyotsna Singh, asked. She added that the fee shold be reduced and parents like her who had already submitted the fee should be refunded the amount. Meanwhile, the president of Unaided Private School Association Anil Agarwal said, “Schools have not increased fees for the last three years. On the contrary, schools have given concessions to the parents who were unable to pay the fees during pandemic.” He said if the government could promise the waiver of fixed electricity charges, sewage charges and water tax and was ready to bear the cost of insurance of school buses, fitness of school vehicles and salaries of drivers, the schools would reduce the fees. “Due to inflation, the maintenance cost of school buildings is going up every day. The salaries of all the employees has to be given,” said Sarvesh Goel, chairman of GD Goenka Public School. “Many schools are giving scholarships and fee concession. Schools which have cut down these expenses can reduce their fees but it is not possible for others,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parents-hail-supreme-court-view-on-fee-cut-for-online-only-classes/articleshow/82444634.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi can add 9,500 oxygen beds if supply is adequate: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that Delhi government could create 9,500 more oxygen-equipped hospital beds provided the central government ensured sufficient oxygen supply.  He also said that Delhi, for the first time, received 730 metric tonnes of oxygen on Wednesday and would require such a volume every day until the current Covid-19 wave subsided. The chief minister thanked the Centre, Supreme Court and Delhi High Court because of whose efforts the city was able to get 730 MT of oxygen. Kejriwal also sent a letter of thanks to PM Narendra Modi and requested him to ensure that Delhi did not suffer a reduction in daily supplies. Kejriwal has appealed to hospitals that were forced to reduce their bed capacities for want of oxygen to reinstate the earlier beds. “Due to the scattered oxygen supply that Delhi was getting, several hospitals reported shortages. They sent SOS message after message. We were facing a lot of difficulties. But yesterday, for the first time Delhi got its share of 730MT of oxygen from the central government,” Kejriwal said. He, however, added, “Getting 730 MT of the gas for one day will not work. Until the second wave of infections doesn’t diminish, we need 700 MT oxygen daily. Getting 700 MT one day and 300-400 MT another day will create a turmoil among the hospitals again.” Kejriwal said that many patients had died due to lack of oxygen in hospitals and some healthcare centres had, therefore, reduced the beds available. “A major hospital with 300 beds reduced the capacity to 100 beds,” the CM noted. “This led to people not getting beds, whereas our efforts should have been to increase the number of oxygen and ICU beds. If big hospitals are forced to cut down the number of beds, there will be complete mayhem. It is my request to all hospitals to reinstate their earlier beds.” Full occupation of hospital beds with oxygen had led to frantic searches for bed even as several patients died awaiting hospital admission. Many Delhiites were compelled to take their kin to hospitals in the neighbouring states. “If we receive 700 MT of oxygen every day, we can create new oxygen-equipped beds in Delhi. If we have enough oxygen, we can create 5,000 beds at Radha Soami Satsang, 2,500 beds in two sites in Burari, 1,000 beds in Commonwealth Games Village, and 1,000 in Yamuna Sports Complex. If we get 700 MT daily, I guarantee you that no person will have to die because of oxygen shortage,” asserted Kejriwal. The CM said there was great enthusiasm for vaccination after the exercise was opened to people aged above 18 years. Till now 35,74,000 vaccine doses have been administered. Saying that those who have taken the first shot number 28 lakh, and 7,76,000 people have received both the doses, Kejriwal appealed to all eligible individuals to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-can-add-9-5k-o2-beds-if-supply-is-adequate-cm/articleshow/82444671.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||Fraudster claims to be bank official, wipes out worker’s entire savings||Pune: A cybercrook siphoned Rs2.2 lakh — the entire savings — from the account of a worker in a cushion-making workshop by posing as an employee of a public sector bank. Santosh Kumar Tiwari (35) of Wakad had gone to an ATM kiosk on March 8 to withdraw Rs20,000 to send to his ailing father in Bihar. He could not withdrawn the cash, but the amount was debited from his account. When he supposedly found the customer care number on the internet, he contacted it and the cybercrook returned the call via another number. He took Tiwari’s bank details and siphoned the amount. Tiwari has filed an FIR with the Hinjewadi police. “Initially when I contacted the number, there was no response. After sometime a person contacted me via another cellphone number and introduced himself as an executive of the bank. He asked for my account number and told me that the money would be credited to me within half-an-hour,” Tiwari said. “The person then told me to share the OTP. Believing him to be a bank official, I shared three OTPs with him. I lost Rs2 lakh in the first transaction, Rs10,000 in the second and Rs7,000 in the third,” he said. Tiwari then tried to contact that person but his number was not reachable. “I went to the bank immediately. The bank officials could at least save Rs17,0000. I was told that Rs2 lakh was transferred to a bank account in Bihar,” he said. Inspector Ajay Jogdand of the Hinjewadi police said, “We have registered a case under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information and Technology Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudster-claims-to-be-bank-official-wipes-out-workers-entire-savings/articleshow/82441141.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Following challenges faced in peak summers during last lockdown, this initiative was taken by Mahavitaran to ensure that citizens are not overburdened with collective bills of a few months.Across the state, over two lakh consumers have sent their meter reading through website, mobile application and SMS. Pune got the highest readings at 49,950 followed by Kalyan with 28,916.State energy minister Nitin Raut had directed Mahavitaran to facilitate its consumers with the self-meter reading facility. “Taking into account the positive response from the consumers, Mahavitaran decided to continue this facility and also increased the number of valid time period to send the reading to four days. Also, a special facility of sending meter readings through SMS is also made available for the consumers during this pandemic,” stated a press release by the company.It added that in the last month, 1.35 lakh consumers sent their self-meter reading. “In April, there was a rise of 67,481,” the release stated.Apart from Nagpur, Akola recorded 7,180 self-meter readings, Amravati 5,662, Chandrapur 3,188 and Gondia 3,464. “Many localities are under containment zone and thus it is not possible for us to go and take readings. Last year, citizens complained as they had to pay collective electricity bills for a few months. To avoid this economic burden on the pockets of common man, self-meter readings works best,” said officials.As per the release, every month there is a fixed date for taking the photo meter reading between 1st and 25th of the month. “Every month, one day prior to this meter reading date, Mahavitaran appeals its consumers through a SMS to send their self-meter reading.Self-meter reading will help the consumers to have a regular check on the meter and its reading. Accordingly, the consumer can control their consumption. “The consumers can make immediate complain about faulty meter. If the reading rises suddenly, the consumer can find out the reason behind it,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/atmanirbhar-over-7k-send-self-meter-readings/articleshow/82441135.cms||Manka Behl

The CM asked the panel to meet every day and convey its suggestions to the health or medical education department and also send a report to him. He also asked the committee to inform the medical institutes and hospitals about Covid treatment protocols and give necessary suggestions. “This is not the time for negative discourse. We have to come together in this fight and boost the morale of front line workers involved in the fight against Covid-19. Positive stories about victory on coronavirus should be publicised prominently in print, electronic and social media,” he said. “UP has a population of 24 crore people. As compared to other states, UP should not lack in anything. Prevention is extremely important in Covid-19. As soon as symptoms appear, one should get tested. Doctors should advise patients on who needs oxygen, medicines and hospitalisation. Telemedicine facility should be used to help patients at home,” Yogi told the panel. Chairperson of the advisory panel, SGPGI director Dr RK Dhiman, said health specialists should give information about Covid treatment to people through media. “Prevention is more crucial than cure in Covid-19 and infection can be controlled through Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, gloves, sanitisation and vaccination,” he said. The panel also made a presentation before the CM on various aspects of Covid-19 prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/devise-covid-plan-keeping-in-mind-present-future-cm-to-health-panel/articleshow/82444702.cms||---

It is mandatory for citizens to obtain e-passes for travel outside Mumbai for emergency and essential services.  The authority of approval or rejection of e-passes lies exclusively with the zonal deputy commissioner of police.

---||Agra||Graveyards in UP running low on space, some facing shortage of diggers||Meerut/Agra/Bareilly: Negotiating a maze of marked and unmarked graves, a group of mourners approached Babar Alam with a body. He hurriedly led them towards the extreme north of the graveyard, off the beaten path, where a row of freshly dug graves were waiting. Alam asked them to choose anyone of them, and they did. A little while later, as the body was being lowered and one of the mourners was sobbing helplessly, an earthmover was busy digging more pits, nearby. As secretary of Agra’s Panchkuian Kabristan, Alam says that he has never seen such a rush of bodies. It had prompted him to ask for an earthmover from the civic body. “The number of bodies has significantly increased in the last three weeks. On an average, we used to get six bodies earlier. Now the number has increased to 20." " We are digging graves in advance with an excavator provided by the municipal corporation to avoid inconvenience to the relatives of the deceased,” Alam said. He said that there are around 20 graveyards in the district. “The number of bodies reaching for burial has increased everywhere,” says Alam, who believes that the month of Ramzan saved many lives. “Most people are fasting, staying at home and praying. Had it not been the holy month, many more would have died,” he said. The situation at Agra’s another prominent graveyard is no different. Caretaker of the city's Noorjahan Karbala kabristaan, Chaudhary Aleemuddin says, “The number of bodies reaching for burial have doubled.” And about 250 km away in Meerut, caretakers of graveyards were grappling with somewhat similar situations. And they didn’t have an earthmover to help them. At the city’s largest graveyard, Mohammad Alam was busy digging graves with his team of workers. “Earlier we used to dig six to seven graves a day. Now the number has increased five times. Our problem has compounded because we have to dig six feet now due to protocol. We cannot bury a Covid-19 infected body in a four feet grave,” says Alam, the caretaker of Meerut’s Bale Miya kabristaan. The graveyard’s in-charge, Mufti Mohd Ashraf, had his share of concerns. “So many of our workers have fallen sick, but bodies are continuously coming. We will soon run out of space. We desperately need mitti (soil) which should be at least 3-foot-high to accommodate the new arrivals,” Ashraf said. At another burial ground in Meerut’s Mohanpuri area, popular as Shah Vilayat graveyard, secretary Mohammad Rashid claimed that at least 50 to 60 people are dying daily. “We cater to the Lal Kurti area and don’t get many bodies here. But, according to my estimate, the daily deaths -- among Muslims-- is nothing less than 50-60 in the entire city. But these are highly conservative estimates. Number could be higher as well.” Last week, an MLA in Meerut released Rs 25lakh to purchase extra soil for the graveyards. Meerut city MLA Rafiq Ansari had said, “The situation is really bad. There is no oxygen, no hospital beds. People are dying and graveyards are running out of space. Our religion does not allow us to burn the bodies, and they cannot be left on roads too.” But space is not the only problem at the graveyards. Like cremation, the cost of burial has gone up too. “For burials, we need three things, kafan (a sheet of white cloth), wooden planks and gravediggers. Earlier, a cloth would cost Rs 1,100 while wooden planks came at Rs 1,200. The labourers charged about Rs 700. Now, the traders do not give the cloth anything less than Rs 2,000. The wooden planks are also in high demand as they are needed in cremation too. So the cost has gone up considerably,” says Mufti Ashraf. Muzaffarnagar’s Gore Ghariba Kabristan was also getting at least 11 bodies daily, mostly of Covid-19 patients. While in Bareilly, the graveyards were facing the shortage of workers. In Prayagraj, several graveyards had hired earthmovers to cope with the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/graveyards-in-up-running-low-on-space-some-facing-shortage-of-diggers/articleshow/82439367.cms||Sandeep Rai

Understanding the urgency of the situation, SIDBI has offered to sanction credit within 48 hours to such firms which can help Goa and the nation augment capabilities to fight the pandemic. SIDBI is offering 100% funding up to an amount of Rs 2 crore to a MSME unit at attractive interest rate of 4.5-6% per annum if the firms meet all the criteria. The schemes are devised under the guidance from the Centre and will provide funding for production and services related to the supply of oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, oximeters and essential drugs such as Zincovit, Limcee, Ivermectin, Paracip, Azax, Betadine, Azithromycin, Fabiflu, Remdesivir and others. While Goa has four medical and industrial oxygen suppliers, it has to depend on neighbouring states for oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, oximeters and other essential equipment. SIDBI, the principal financial institution for financing and development of MSMEs, has launched the SHWAS and AROG quick credit schemes and hopes that the term loans and working capital funds will help MSMEs speed up the production of oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, oximeters and essential drugs. The two loan products, said a SIDBI official, are being offered at a concessional rate for ramping up supply of products used in fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second wave of Covid-19, the virus has shown an massive resurgence and has crippled Goa’s health care infrastructure. Hospitals and patients who have opted for home isolation are struggling for oxygen supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/special-loans-for-msmes-to-mfg-o2-oximeters/articleshow/82444869.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Bidhuri claims no vax centre opened in 2 BJP MLA areas||New Delhi: Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Thursday alleged that the AAP government had not opened even a single vaccination centre in the areas represented by two Delhi BJP MLAs. There are also a large number of other areas where vaccination centres are yet to become functional, he added. “This is being done deliberately by the AAP government. This is sad and unfortunate. We can settle political scores at some other time, but right now the priority is to vaccinate the population whether they reside in areas represented by BJP or AAP,” Bidhuri said. The MLA said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier announced that if vaccines were made available by the Centre, he could vaccinate entire Delhi in one month and undertake door-to-door vaccination. “However, now the CM has said Delhi government can vaccinate entire Delhi in three months,” said Bidhuri. The BJP-run three municipal corporations are also being kept out of the drive while it is well-known that the civic bodies are the backbone of any vaccination initiative because of their reach at the local level, said the MLA. “Experts have repeatedly said it was only through vaccination that the battle against novel coronavirus could be won. They say a third wave can hit anytime, making it all the more important to bolster the vaccination drive.” Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta alleged that the AAP government had got some corporation-run vaccination centres closed down in the past two days and urged it to restart them. Despite repeated attempts, the AAP government didn’t respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bidhuri-claims-no-vax-centre-opened-in-2-bjp-mla-areas/articleshow/82442748.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Around March 20, both municipal corporations had recorded a 90% recovery rate which, however, dropped to 82% in the second week of April. The past four weeks have been witnessing a steady rise in daily recoveries in urban pockets on most days. Health officials said the daily caseload has dropped to 3,500-4000 this week in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and to around 2,000 in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. On two occasions last week, the daily cases in the PMC limits had dropped below 3,000 and the tally went below 2,000 once in the PCMC areas. A PMC official said they were continuing with the contact tracing and testing of people despite the drop in daily cases and increase in recoveries. “We have noticed a steady rise in discharges in the past four weeks in the city. The recovery rate has gone up again. During this one month, the city has not reported any significant drop in recoveries. We expect the recovery rate to stay on the higher side,” an official said. On May 6, the progressive positive caseload in the PMC limits had reached up to 4.36 lakh, of which 3.89 lakh patients recovered. Out of 2.21 lakh positive cases in Pimpri Chinchwad, 1.97 lakh people have recovered. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief at PMC, said, “The recovery rate in the PMC limits was over 90% in early March. If the existing trend continues for a few more days, it will go beyond 90%. We have not closed any swab collection centres, though the cases have dropped. The citizens have been appealed to get tested if they develop any symptom of Covid-19 and start treatment at the earliest to prevent complications.” The recovery rate in the district’s rural areas has, however, been low as compared to the urban pockets. On May 6, the rural areas reported an overall recovery rate of 82%. The new cases per day in the rural pockets have been on the rise as compared to the daily discharges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/recovery-rate-fights-april-dip-rises-to-89-in-pmc-pcmc/articleshow/82442750.cms||Sarang Dastane

The FIR read that her friend and his male accomplice visited Pune and asked her to meet them at a lodge in Kharadi to collect a parcel. At the lodge, the suspects allegedly forced her to consume the sweets mixed with sedatives and one of them raped her after she became unconscious. They also stole her gold chain, the complaint states. Inspector Sunil Thopte (crime) of the Chandannagar police station said, “The engineering student said that the man accused of raping her had later proposed marriage and lured her to visit him in Delhi where he raped her again. The complainant said that his women accomplices mixed sedatives in her food and took obscene photographs of her.” Thopte said, “The student was also taken to a lodge in Goa, where she was raped by the suspect. The woman later realised that she had been duped after she learned that the man was married and had a son.” “The four suspects later started blackmailing her by asking her to pay them Rs 5 lakh and threatened to make her photographs viral. But the complainant refused to meet their demand for money. The woman registered an FIR after the suspects sent her photographs to her brother and friend,” he said. “The complainant has shared names and other details of the suspects residing in Delhi. We will arrest them at the earliest,” the officer added. On the delay in lodging the FIR, deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “The woman had initially filed a complaint application against the four suspects. We conducted a preliminary inquiry and registered an FIR. Action will be taken against the suspects, as per law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/engg-student-files-kidnap-rape-complaint-4-booked/articleshow/82441124.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Most political parties opt for virtual connect with workers||Lucknow: Social distancing -- a mandatory protocol in the Covid times -- has made political parties take a virtual route to stay in touch with workers across the state. As political parties are actively involved in helping out people in distress, coordination among their grass-root workers becomes a must. It has to be a quick disposal of information to the intended group so that help can be provided on time and at the proper place. Digital media, in that case, has come handy for political leaders in maintaining a constant conversation with the workforce. BJP leaders have started holding virtual meetings with workers across the state through video conferencing. The party, which has a robust structure of office-bearers and workers, goes online daily to discuss its day-to-day activities. “It’s the work of Seva Sangathan that is going on actively at this moment. But, amidst all this we do not forget to tell our workers that it is their own safety that is of paramount importance. Thus, we motivate them to follow precautions as thoroughly as they can,” said a party functionary. From senior office-bearers of the party to party presidents at the regional, district and mandal levels, all are attending virtual meetings these days. In the Nishad Party, workers have been told to keep in touch with people in their areas through WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms. President of the party Sanjay Nishad holds live sessions on Facebook to keep workers motivated and interact with them every day. Most of these measures were adopted by political parties last year itself when the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that followed made it difficult for them to hold meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/most-political-parties-opt-for-virtual-connect-with-workers/articleshow/82444748.cms||Neha Shukla

The hospital management claims that the machines are not being used as it does it have a specialized doctor and technician to operate the machines to provide ventilator support for patients in critical condition. There are 78 beds in Covid-19 ward at the district hospital. Last year, the hospital was provided with two fully digital ventilators by the central government using PM care funds. The state-of-the-art ventilators can be used as Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for treatment of patients in critical condition. A senior doctor at the district hospital said, “Since past several months, the two ventilators are gathering dust. There is no chest physician or technician to operate these machines. We are not able to provide adequate treatment to Covid patients suffering from difficulty in breathing. Oxygen supply to the hospital is also not sufficient. Patients in need of high flow oxygen are transferred to other centres. Doctors and supporting staff are trying their best to serve the patients with the limited facilities available with us.” Superintendent in-charge of the district hospital Satish Verma said, “We had received two ventilators arranged from PM care funds. Following lack of human resources, we are not able to operate them. The oxygen supply to the hospital has improved in the past few days. We do not have an ‘in-house only’ supply infrastructure. Oxygen cylinders are used for patients having difficulty in breathing. Critical patients are referred to the SN Medical College”. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “The ventilators are vital machines in treatment of critical patients of Covid-19. I was not aware that the district hospital has two ventilators gathering dust. I will ensure they are suitably utilized. We can transfer them to some other Covid care centre if required staff is not available to operate them at the district hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-hi-tech-ventilators-sent-by-centre-gathering-dust-at-agra-district-hospital/articleshow/82439417.cms||Deepak Lavania

A magisterial court on Thursday remanded construction worker Nirmala Verma in police custody remand till May 10. Nirmala and the boy’s parents are neighbours. They reside in a labour camp at Market Yard. Senior inspector Anagha Deshpande of Market Yard police said on Thursday, “Nirmala had suspected her husband of entering into a relationship with the victim’s mother following which a dispute broke out between them around two months ago.” Deshpande said, “Around 7am on Monday, Nirmala spotted the boy and lured him to an under-construction site. She picked him up, dumped him in an elevator duct filled with 4ft water and took to heels. The victim’s body was recovered a few hours after the incident.” “We initially registered a complaint relating to accidental death. The Sassoon hospital in its post-mortem report certified the cause of the boy’s death due to drowning. We took Nirmala into custody after CCTV footage showed her entering the under-construction building with the boy and then walking out of the building without him,” she said. “Nirmala had initially told the police that she had visited the building to collect wood, but it was not seen in her hands while analysing the footage. She later admitted that she had killed the boy to take revenge against his mother for allegedly entering into a relationship with her husband,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-held-on-charge-of-killing-boy-at-market-yard/articleshow/82441161.cms||---

The incident occurred on April 28, when the 50-year-old Antop Hill resident was travelling to Pune for her son’s wedding. The woman, a casual worker, lodged a complaint with the Bund Garden on Tuesday. After verifying her statement and medical reports, the police booked the co-passenger — a woman in her mid-forties — on the charges of drugging and robbing the complainant. “The complainant’s son was travelling to Pune for her son’s wedding, set for April 30. She caught the bus from Dadar in Mumbai on the morning of April 28,” senior inspector Yashwant Gavari said. A woman was sitting next to the complainant. “Gradually, they struck up a conversation. The suspect told the woman that she had visited to a temple and offered her a pedha,” Gavari further said. “The pedha was laced with sedatives. The women got off the bus when it stopped near Pune railway station. The complainant started feeling uneasy and was shivering. The suspect offered to take her to Sassoon General Hospital for treatment,” Gavari said. They reached the hospital around 3.45pm. “After getting her admitted, the co-passenger asked the complainant to hand over her bag for safekeeping,” he said. The suspect then made her escape. “The complainant received treatment at Sassoon for a day, attended her son’s wedding and returned to Mumbai. She returned to Pune to lodge a complaint after making a full recovery,” Gavari said. The police checked CCTV footage at the hospital and at the bus terminus and noticed a woman accompanying the complainant. “We are trying to ascertain her identity,” Gavari said. TOI was unable to contact the complainant as her phone was switched off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-yr-old-drugged-on-st-bus-robbed-of-rs-2-5-lakh-valuables/articleshow/82441166.cms||---

Be it setting up of counselling centres to arranging beds, providing food to infected families, helping people in vaccination and even helping in performing last rites of Covid victims, the RSS volunteers are helping people in keeping with the 13-point strategy. To support the families which have lost their dear ones to Covid-19, RSS volunteers have put out messages on social media which read, “Yadi aapke aas paas mein koi aise vyakti ki mrityu hoti hai jisko kandha dene ya unki antyehsti karne ke liye koi log nahin hain toh humein bataye hamare paas paanch sadasya ki team taiyar hai.

---||Pune||Credai seeks four months’ extension for property registration, fine waiver||Pune: Credai Maharashtra has sought four months’ extension from the state government for registration of property documents executed in December. The state developers’ body has written to the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps regarding the same. As per section 24 of the Registration Act of 1908, all documents need to be registered within four months of the date of the signing of the agreement, failing which a fine, not exceeding 10 times the registration fee, is to be levied each month in different slabs. The developers’ body has approached the state government to be considerate towards property buyers and not charge a fine in view of the pandemic. State Credai president Sunil Furde said that while the state government has given a stamp duty waiver of 3%, which helped boost the realty sector and saw many documents being executed on or before December 31, the current Covid situation, travel restrictions and overall health scare were preventing property registrations. “The Inspector General Of Registration and Stamps (IGR) of the state is conferred the powers under section 70 of the Registration Act to remit wholly or in part the difference between any fine levied under section 25 of section 34. We request you extend it for a further period of four months,” the letter written by Credai Maharashtra stated. State IGR officials have confirmed receipt of the letter. They said it has been forwarded to the state government for consideration. Shantilal Kataria, national vice-president, Credai, said with Maharashtra reeling under the second wave of Covid, it had not been possible for many home buyers to meet the four-month deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/credai-seeks-four-months-extension-for-property-registration-fine-waiver/articleshow/82441171.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Madurai flower market has been receiving 30 tonne of the flower daily. With temples being shut and Covid restrictions limiting the numbers of guests at weddings, demand for flowers has come down drastically. On Thursday, a kilogram of jasmine was sold for Rs 100 in the morning, Rs 80 in the evening while chendu malli and sampangi sold for Rs 10 a kg each, arali for Rs 30 and all other flowers did not find buyers even for Rs 10 a kg. This year, steps were taken to allow the market to function on its own market premises where the 400 shops had to regulate crowds and adhere to Covid SoPs. But, with the government imposing stricter restrictions, traders and farmers have been affected. S Palanisamy, a farmer from Usilamapatti, said this was the festive and marriage season. “This year the flower production has been good, but as temples are closed and marriages have been asked to limit crowds, the demand has come down and we are only able to sell a kilogram of very good buds for Rs 50,” he said. Coordinator of Madurai Flower Market Associations, S Ramachandran, said the time specified for markets from 6am to 12pm is also affecting them because farmers were not able to bring the flowers by 6am to the market and there were problems in transport as a result of which the prices are falling. “It would help if we could keep the market open till at least 3pm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/jasmine-price-dips-to-rs-100/kg/articleshow/82441176.cms||---

As on May 6, about 400 patients on oxygen support in Madurai hail from other districts. Speaking to reporters after a review meeting with doctors and members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Madurai on Thursday, the collector said that the demand and supply of medical oxygen for both government and private hospitals in Madurai, were revisited during the meeting. Compared to the first wave, the consumption of oxygen had increased by 300% as 20 to 30% of the patients required oxygen in the second wave. The two local industries that were manufacturing oxygen were producing 110% of their original capacity and working round-the-clock. These companies had been asked to regulate their distribution to the hospitals with which they had tied up to ensure that other hospitals could get some cylinders when there was a need, he added. The Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) has 1,100 beds with oxygen of which 1,000 were filled up as on Thursday. The collector said that the numbers were changing by the hour with new admissions and simultaneous discharges. He said that the oxygen storage facility at the GRH had a 26kl capacity of which 20kl was being used everyday. The facility was also adequately filled as per demand. The oxygen control room under the joint director of health and Inspector of factories would monitor the movement of supply in the district and ensure that the maximum number of patients were helped, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-to-get-major-portion-of-o2-from-sterlite-plant-says-collector/articleshow/82441178.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Smaller govt hospitals get oxygen plants||Vadodara: While the Centre and state wasted its breath trading barbs over oxygen plant approvals, there were some who acted with urgency ensuring they had such plants in time and were able to breathe easy. They will soon be almost self-reliant when it comes to oxygen requirement for hospitals. Hospitals saw a major surge in the demand and, as a consequence, shortage of oxygen since last month. While many plants were approved last year and a fresh lot of plants got approved for the states only recently, hospitals started to panic in search of uninterrupted oxygen supply. As things became difficult, some, however, found a way out by making their own arrangements albeit with help from elected representatives. Like, the Cottage Hospital or the general hospital in Lunawada in Mahisagar district which has a capacity of 45 oxygen support beds of which, most are occupied. Work on the plant is nearly over and is expected to start operations anytime soon. Mahisagar district collector RB Barad said that there were no suppliers or plant of oxygen in the district. “Given this situation, we decided to have a small plant of our own. We placed an order for the plant on April 10,” said Barad. The project became possible due to funds under the Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) grants. According to Barad, the plant will produce 140 litres of oxygen per minute. “This is sufficient for the 25 to 30 patients at the hospital. We also have a backup of 70 to 80 large cylinders to ensure that there is sufficient oxygen if needed,” he said. The plant came up at a cost of Rs 25 lakh. A similar plant has been proposed in Godhra in Panchmahal district at the Godhra Civil Hospital. Like most places even this town was facing difficulties in arranging oxygen despite Panchmahal district having plants manufacturing oxygen. The plants, however, have to cater to other districts. Godhra MLA C K Raulji has proposed that a plant should come up in the civil hospital. He added that a funding of Rs 22 lakh should be made from his development grants for the project. Raulji has sought that the nod for the project should be given at the earliest. A vendor has quoted Rs 25.96 lakh for the project. Officials said that those who acted in time like the Mahisagar district administration were at an advantage as their plants were commissioned in time.

His wife, who worked as a maid, has also lost her job making it difficult for them to sustain their family of four. Kumar is not alone. Thousands of disabled persons like him are facing several financial crises during the lockdown in the state after the government stopped their monthly pension of Rs. 1,000 for the past several months. To mitigate the crisis soon, the Jharkhand Viklang Manch (JVM), an umbrella group for disabled people, headquartered in Jamshedpur, had written a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren appealing him to release the monthly pensions. The government has assured to release the pension soon. Talking to TOI, JVM president Arun Kumar Singh said, “While everyone is talking about migrants, poor people and other marginalised groups, there is none to raise the problems faced by the disabled in Jharkhand at a time when they are also reeling under the pandemic. Since September-October last year, the state government has stopped the monthly disabled pension to beneficiaries. We urge the state government to release the pension immediately.” The Centre and the state government run two disabled pension schemes simultaneously but a beneficiary is entitled to avail only one of the two schemes under which he or she will get Rs 1,000 per month. According to Singh, there are about two-lakh beneficiaries of the schemes in the state. Though the total number of persons, who are unable to get the pension couldn’t be ascertained, Singh said roughly put the number to over 50,000 people. He said the pension was stopped suddenly by the government, citing various reasons like lack of funds, delay in document verification and non-release of funds by the Centre among others. Singh added, "We appeal to the state government to release the pension immediately irrespective of the hurdles, which can be sorted out later on like the announcement of ration for those without ration cards. The disabled people must too get their pensions whether the document verification is pending or not.” The women and child development and social security minister, Joba Manjhi, who is the JMM MLA from West Singbhum, assured that funds will be released soon. “The department is aware of the problem and funds will be released very soon now,” she told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/50k-disabled-suffer-as-govt-stops-pension-amid-curbs/articleshow/82441056.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Another ward with of 128 oxygen beds was inaugurated at the Rims’ old building and a 73-bed Covid ICU facility was commissioned at the hospital’s oncology wing. The three new facilities became functional on Thursday. “I had an opportunity to visit these facilities while they were being built. The Rims management and the agencies concerned have done a great job. To set up such facilities within 12-15 days is no mean feat,” chief minister Hemant Soren said after virtually inaugurating the facilities from his home in Kanke Road. The parking lot was inaugurated in late 2019, but was lying unused. With the new facilities, the total bed capacity at Rims for Covid 19 patients increased to 1,191. “The number of beds is much higher than what we had during the first wave last year. We are hopeful to add another 108 oxygen beds with the help of NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation) very soon. Our endeavor is to see that no patient is turned back because shortage of beds,” Rims director Dr Kameshwar Prasad said. Notably, Rims had 260 Covid beds during the first wave of the pandemic last year. On April 19, the number was increased to 663. “After Thursday’s inauguration, we will have around 850 oxygen beds and 250 beds equipped with ventilators,” Prasad added. Health minister Banna Gupta said the parking lot was zeroed for setting up a Covid facility as it was lying unused since its inauguration. The facility will be provided oxygen cylinders while the other two facilities will receive oxygen from the hospital’s central supply line. Jharkhand had a little over 10,000 Covid beds in the beginning of May statewide. Of them, nearly 6,000 are oxygen supported. While 220 oxygen supported beds were inaugurated by Soren in Koderma on Wednesday, another 500-bed facility at Itki Sanitorium is in the pipeline. On Wednesday, Jharkhand high court asked the state to to set up 300 oxygen supported beds at Ranchi Sadar hospital within 10 days. “We will increase beds in keeping with the growing demands,” Soren said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-sets-up-327-oxygen-beds-at-multi-level-parking-lot/articleshow/82441035.cms||Dhritiman Ray

According to Kumar, Covid tests were not conducted properly on people entering the district from neighbouring West Bengal and Odisha, at six check-posts, following which he issued the notices. The check-posts were re-started after the surge in Covid cases to isolate and put infected persons entering the district in quarantine. The district authorities said officials posted at Ghatshila, Potka, Gurabendha, Chakuliya, Baharagora and Patamda check-posts were found guilty of dereliction of duty. Meanwhile, the district authorities have appointed three magistrates at the two crematoriums in the city after relatives of deceased Covid victims thrashed the workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/notice-to-officials-of-6-checkposts-for-lapses/articleshow/82441001.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: MLAs demand free Covid treatment for all||RANCHI: At least two lawmakers from Jharkhand — Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari and Silli MLA Sudesh Mahto — on Thursday demanded free treatment for Covid-19 patients in both government and private hospitals. Notably, the Andhra Pradesh government recently decided to provide free treatment to all Covid patients in government and affiliated hospitals and also capped the rates in private hospitals. Last year, the Jharkhand government, too, had capped rates for treatment at private hospitals. However, allegations of over pricing and violations of rate-cap surfaced from time to time. While the state is currently rattled by a four-digit spike in fresh infections on a daily basis coupled with 100-plus deaths per day since the last one week, several patients across different districts continue to struggle for timely admission into hospitals due to paucity of beds or other medical resources. In Ranchi and other parts of the state, reports of ‘medical loot’— be it for Covid testing, availing ambulance and beds, among others — are also surfacing unabated through social media despite state government’s efforts to curb them. To prevent the poor and commoners from getting fleeced while seeking treatment, both the lawmakers have separately appealed to chief minister Hemant Soren to consider implementing the Andhra model for Covid treatment. Talking to TOI, Irfan, who is also a co-working president of the state Congress unit, said that he has also written a letter to Soren in the morning and have spoken to chief secretary Sukhdev Singh and health secretary Arun Kumar Singh to place his demand. “Being an MLA of the ruling coalition government, I demand that free treatment for Covid-19 be provided to all. These are unprecedented times and the government must walk an extra mile to save lives like Andhra Pradesh,” said Ansari speaking over the phone. He added that he will soon speak to the CM personally on the issue. Notably, the state government has been raising the issue of funds crunch since assuming charge in December 2019. The outbreak of Covid-19 coupled with the lockdown further dented the state’s resources due to halt in economic activities. Even as the state could steer the wheels of economic activities, the second wave of the pandemic has unleashed mayhem since March this year. Ansari’s party president and state’s finance minister Rameshwar Oraon on Wednesday said that the state’s revenues have fallen short by more than 50% in the current fiscal. Ansari, however, said that money shouldn’t be an issue to save lives of the people. He added, “Those who are influential and have money are able to get treatment in big private hospitals and command all the resources but it is the poor and commoners who are facing all kinds of problems. The state government is trying hard to increase beds and other facilities, but even the poor have the right to get treatment in private hospitals but they can’t afford it due to exorbitant rates.” Former deputy CM and Ajsu Party chief Sudesh Mahto said that the second wave of Covid-19 has become so virulent that it was infecting family members at one go, unlike the case during the first wave. “A family can think of affording treatment if one person is infected, but the way the virus has spread its wings this time in Jharkhand, entire families are getting affected. Can a poor or a middle-class person afford treatment for all at one go? The situation is such that due to the pandemic and resultant joblessness, it has become difficult for people to run their homes, forget affording treatment. Therefore, the government must announce free treatment both at private and government hospitals like it has been done in Andhra Pradesh,” said Mahto, who shot a letter separately to Soren.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mlas-demand-free-cov-treatment-for-all/articleshow/82440927.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Notably, there was heavy booking of banquet halls at the beginning of the year when Covid pandemic had slowed down. The banquet hall owners were hoping for a profit after a gap of almost a year. However, as cases shot up in the wake of second wave, many have started postponing their marriage functions. Vishwajit Paul of Hotel Palk Street said, “After the hotel business, the banquet hall trade has been badly hit due to Covid-19. All bookings of my banquet hall have been postponed. People have cancelled their bookings for various reasons. Some cited Covid as the cause while other said that they would like their function to be a grand occasion which is not possible under the current restrictions imposed by the government. Several families were facing travelling bottlenecks.” Asked about the future of the trade, Paul said that everything depends on the Covid situation. He added that, at present, the most important factor was to save oneself and one’s family members.  Notably, several other hotels including Royal Retreat also reported near total cancellation of the booking for marriages. Sudhir Chopra of Yuvraj Palace said that 80% of bookings at his banquet hall was cancelled due to Covid since April. He added that even though the government has fixed an upper limit of 50 guests for weddings, the actual number of guests being invited to marriages was even less. Chopra said, “The banquet business is in a very bad shape for the past one year not only in Ranchi but also all over the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/banquets-coffers-empty-as-many-cancel-weddings/articleshow/82440850.cms||---

DFO Abhishek Kumar said, "We will employ from the local villagers in the nursery and are expecting to generate 250 man-days. At least 150 families will get the opportunity to earn from the nursery." According to Kumar, a worker could earn Rs 300 per day from the nursery which will have 50,000 saplings of various trees like sal, arjun, karanj, teak, fruits and bamboo. He said, "Plantation in and around the sanctuary with the saplings from the nursery would commence from June when the monsoon starts. Therefore, the nursery has to be ready before June." "The plantation would commence in June with the onset of the monsoon and by then we have to make the nursery ready," Kumar said. Kumar added that pockets like Hansada, Saherbera, Somadih, Dangdum, Lailam, Koira and Dangardih among others which form part of the 192 sqkm forest area of the sanctuary will be covered under the plantation drive. According to foresters, the addition of bamboo saplings in the drive is to check incidents of wild elephants entering into human habitation. They said the drive would be conducted during the pandemic when no visitors would arrive at the sanctuary. Over and above the workers at the nursery, the work of 70 forest watchers who were employed on a daily basis since last year would be extended. "During this period when many people were losing their jobs, we decided to extend the service of the forest watchers so that they have a source of livelihood," Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dalma-sanctuary-sets-up-nursery-to-provide-livelihood-to-locals/articleshow/82441113.cms||B Sridhar

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah will take up Centre's plea on Friday. The government in its appeal contended that it is trying its best to meet the needs of various states and order passed by the HC would hamper its effort to ensure supply of oxygen to other states as per their requirements which would lead to complete collapse of the system. "It is most important to note that the entire nation is feeling the effects of the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 Coronavirus and in such a situation it is imperative that the limited resources available at the disposal of the entire nation (in this case, oxygen supply), be put to its most judicious use, keeping in mind the overall situation in the country. Thereby, passing directions in the nature and manner the HC has done, would ultimately lead to mismanagement of resources and create a further chaotic environment in an already overburdened system," the petition said. "The HC failed to consider the rationale behind allocation of certain amounts of oxygen to each state and purely on the basis of purported shortage in the city of Bangalore, passed directions which, if fulfilled, will have a cascading effect and result in the total collapse of the system in its fight against the ongoing second wave of Covid-19," the Centre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-moves-sc-against-karnataka-hc-order-on-oxygen/articleshow/82447845.cms||---

The staff of the logistics point at the central RTC bus stand here said that they received an advisory from their superiors not to book any liquids as they were leaking during transit and causing damage to other products. Essential oils, cooking oils etc were also denied a booking by the counter staff on Tuesday. B Raghu, representative of a popular hand sanitizers brand, told TOI that the counter staff were unmindful of the fact that the hand sanitizers are an essential part of the fight against Covid-19. “The second wave is very serious. We are risking our lives and striving our best to supply hand sanitizers to even the remotest part of the district through APSRTC only as no other private transporter has such a connectivity. Now if APSRTC refuses to stop transportation of hand sanitizers, there will be a huge shortage of supply of sanitizers to medical shops in rural areas of Chittoor district which may lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases,” lamented the medical representative. When APSRTC Tirupati regional manager was contacted, he said he will speak to his superiors and take a policy decision. However, RP Thakur, vice-chairman and managing director of APSRTC, said that the APSRTC had not issued any such restrictions on supply of hand sanitizers or other liquid materials and that it was committed to the supply of every single legitimate product to the rural areas across the districts of Andhra Pradesh and other states at affordable prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/apsrtc-says-no-to-transportation-of-sanitizers/articleshow/82441242.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

He said that AAI has strengthened its mission to not only ensure medical essentials are brought into the state but to also ensure that supplies to other states are cleared quickly. Malik said that aside from ensuring the quick exit of critical consignments such as covid vaccines and testing kits, the airport has also played a crucial role in facilitating the supply of Glenmark’s Fabiflu medicines to Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Indore and Nagpur. “Airports Authority of India, Goa International Airport and its frontline corona warriors have been playing an active role to combat Covid-19 by facilitating the seamless delivery of medical essentials,” said Malik. “The race is not stopped and Goa International Airport has further strengthened its mission to tackle the unprecedented situation created by covid-19 by seamless supply of medical essentials.” During the first phase of the pandemic, Goa International Airport catered to eight LifeLine Udan flights intended to transport essential medical cargo to remote parts of the country. A total inbound cargo of 2.15MT and outbound cargo of 3.96 MT was handled by AAI at Dabolim. A total of 31,955 kg of Fabiflu medicines flew from Goa airport as part of outbound cargo in the month of April. Fabiflu is used for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid infected people. The airport also handled three lots of Covid vaccines for Goa and one consignment of vaccines for Karnataka in the months of January and February this year.

He called up a paediatrician and the diagnosis left him stumped. The doctor told him that the Covid pandemic is having a totally different level of effect on babies, particularly those below two years of age. Masks are indeed a saviour from Covid-19 infection but the constant screen of parents’ and grandparents’ faces at home is adversely affecting the development of babies’ social milestones like smiling and cooing. Paediatricians across the state are unanimous about the adverse effect of face masks on the newborns’ social skills in the new normal. “The sensory stimulation among many kids below two years of age is missing. They are not able to understand the facial gestures quickly and their social milestones are also getting delayed by an average 2-3 months,” said Dr Tushar Shah, executive board member, Academy of Paediatrics Gujarat. “Since they were born and began to understand the world around, babies below two years are seeing everyone wearing face masks. They can’t see facial gestures like anger, laughter or joy when they meet anyone. Except at home, these kids see their parents too in face masks,” Shah told TOI. “Usually babies start smiling, cooing and responding to gestures after they turn three months old. But now these skills are getting delayed by a few months. I have been getting calls from worried parents over the last several months,” Shah, former secretary of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Vadodara, said. Experts said that lack of social interaction and strict home confinement is affecting their ability to integrate with the society. Doctors in Surat too have been getting calls from anxious parents having kids aged between six months and 18 months. “Every fifth day, we are getting a case wherein parents notice that their child’s interaction is problematic. Some babies are actually behaving like autistic kids,” said Dr Sanjeev Rao, a senior paediatrician in Surat. Parents noticed the delayed development of responses in their kids, said Rao, adding that masks are screening children from developing their skills in understanding or grasping facial gestures and emotions. Dr Shah further added that spending most of their time at home and hardly any interaction with outsiders have affected kids’ social and learning skills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/parents-masks-delay-babies-smiling-cooing-skills/articleshow/82439469.cms||Tushar Tere

We are waiting for the official notice,” a GMC intern told TOI. The intern added that the association of resident doctors met the dean yet again on Thursday after doctors, who are already overworked, were being posted to the new super-specialty block. “They also asked for better hours, better workconditions and security,” the intern said. The association has on several occasions raised the issue and suggested that interns be given their permanent registration and be taken on board with a bond pay package to relieve the other residents, who are being posted across Covid hospitals in Goa. “It’s not rocket science to manage a Covid ward and all departments should have been given a training module over the past few months. Instead it is the same departments that are being overworked,” a doctor said. Another said, “We are working 12-hour shifts without regard for our health. We can handle six hour shifts in PPE and can focus better, but longer the shift that much more is the exposure and risk. Last year we did only six-hour shifts. We are on the verge of breakdown.” More than 40 doctors have tested positive during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-likely-to-bring-interns-on-board-as-bond-docs-to-beat-manpower-crunch/articleshow/82443859.cms||---

The decision was taken following pressure from locals on the council, which had earlier announced a seven-day ‘mini lockdown’ during a meeting of the civic body on Wednesday. Since it was felt that the ‘mini lockdown’ was not sufficient to combat the cases, the council on Thursday decided to extend the lockdown by 8 days. VMC chairperson Shaizin Shaikh said that the lockdown which commenced from May 6 will be in force till May 20. “Essential services will be kept open for the general public between 6am and 1pm, thereafter there will be a strict lockdown,” Shaikh said. VMC also appealed to grocery stores to arrange for home deliveries. Shaikh said that the internal roads across the town will be shut and “heavy fines” will be imposed on violaters. “Our inspector will inspect the market along with police and if there are any violations, trade licences of those shops will be cancelled,” Shaikh said. Similarly, most panchayats in Sattari have opted for a lockdown. It may be recalled that after learning that several municipal councils and panchayats across the state had decided to impose for voluntarily lockdown, the Valpoi civic body and other panchayats in Sattari were being increasingly criticised by the locals for not taking any decision on the lockdown as the taluka has over 650 active Covid cases. Since Wednesday, police have been penalising those violating SOPs. Police chased away people from the Valpoi bus stand on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-local-demand-valpoi-extends-curbs-till-may-20/articleshow/82443926.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Junior doctors call off stir after government assurance||BHOPAL: Junior doctors of government run medical colleges called off their strike after government assurance to look into their demands for better treatment facilities for their colleagues who contract coronavirus infection and hike in stipend, here on Thursday. Earlier in the day, the doctors proceeded on an indefinite strike in six medical colleges, including Bhopal’s Gandhi Medical College. “We have called off our stir after assurances from MP medical education minister Vishwas Sarang,” said MP Junior Doctors Association (JUDA) president Dr Arvind Meena. Later, Sarang said the state government has urged doctors to call of their proposed stir, in view of the current Covid-19 infection surge. “I am happy they heeded us. As they respected our advice, we are obliged. We are looking into their concerns,” Sarang told reporters. Hospital services remained unaffected to a large extent during the day. Doctors who were on Covid-19 duty did not participate in the stir. “One in four junior doctors has been infected by coronavirus to date. We are demanding guarantee of bed allotment for the junior doctors who get infected,” Meena said. Besides, latest Covid -19 treatment should be made available to them as the treatment protocol keeps changing every two months due to virus mutation, he added. “Most importantly, the state government should provide treatment to junior doctors in the cashless mode. At present, we have to incur the expenditure which is reimbursed after submission of bills,” Meena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-junior-doctors-call-off-stir-after-government-assurance/articleshow/82447866.cms||---
---||Goa||Almost all who died had not taken vax: Docs||Panaji: Almost all of those who passed away due to Covid recently had not been vaccinated, despite being eligible for the shot. Only a miniscule number had taken one dose and an even smaller percentage both doses. “We have been trying to convince people for months now to get vaccinated in time for the second wave, but only few listened. Many feel that they cannot take the vaccine because they have comorbidities when, infact, they should be the ones first in line to receive it,” a senior doctor said. A vaccination officer said people out of fear of the second wave have begun rushing to vaccination centres. “Several fear death and not getting access to hospital beds and are now coming. But in villages people are still reluctant to take the vaccine. They believe the information they find on Whatsapp,” the officer said. He said religious leaders should motivate their own community to get vaccinated. “This will help get a lot more people vaccinated,” he said. Another senior doctor said a large percentage of the population hasn’t been vaccinated and continue to harbor misbeliefs about the vaccine. “They have certain ideas filled in their minds. Some fear they will get a heart attack or get paralysed after the vaccine. The senior citizens should have finished their second doses by now, but some haven’t even taken their first dose,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/almost-all-who-died-had-not-taken-vax-docs/articleshow/82444063.cms||---
---||India||Ajit Singh: An IITian who was the face of Jat politics in UP||The best and the worst about Ajit Singh, veteran politician and scion of late Charan Singh, was that he was happy in his skin. He did not crave, or value, approvals or validation. It was a quality that made him his own man, a politician who managed to keep his hold for long over the "jatland" of west UP even as he was chided as a “political chameleon”. Singh (82),who passed away owing to Covid complications in the capital on Thursday, practically retired from politics after losing two consecutive elections in 2014 and 2019 in his erstwhile patch. At one time a constant in national and UP politics, Singh was a bundle of contradictions – an IIT computer engineer of 1960s who plunged into the rough and tumble of politics, a suave Jat who presided over a rugged region and its aggressive and empowered populace, a gentleman who just could not resist being “practical”. For a man who was a Lok Sabha MP from 1989 to 2014 with just one defeat in 1998 polls, and who held elite central ministries like Commerce and Industry, Agriculture, Food Processing and Civil Aviation under prime ministers as ideologically diverse as V P Singh, Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, the CV is a testimony to political suppleness as well as a grassroots legacy. But the long career spanning is also largely a story of a legacy lost. A supporter in Baghpat once described him as “the man who shrank his mighty father Charan Singh’s legacy from six states to six districts”. Fissures in his loyal base had begun to surface over time, with fast changing age profile, aspirations and national political churn. The advent of Narendra Modi, his hard Hindutva and native appeal cleaved Singh’s longstanding Jat-Muslim combine, planting BJP in the region and sweeping aside Rashtriya Lok Dal. The post-2014 barren phase put to complete shade the farmer-OBCs politics that struck roots six decades ago. Now, Singh’s son Jayant, who has been leading the protests against the controversial farm laws over last months, faces a daunting challenge of reviving that faded appeal in an altered context. Some of the impermnance in Singh’s politics owed to the phase he was blooded in, with Lok Dal and its tendency to split. With time, he rubbed shoulders and crossed swords with satraps of the day, from Mulayam Singh Yadav to Devi Lal to R K Hegde to Deve Gowda to V P Singh. He stayed in parties, or formed them, like Lok Dal (A), JP, BKKP, RLD. Singh was a survivor, one who could on occasion acknowledge the cynicism of political choices, even as he knew that a shriveled base was good enough to make him important for any aspiring government -- until Modi ended that with a single party majority. But the slip was visible, as he gradually reduced to being a Jat leader. To stay relevant, he continued dabble in new projects to mobilise his base – like Harit Pradesh, farmers’s unity, Jat reservation. Singh goofed up in the wake of Muzaffarpur riots in 2013. With the Jats and Muslims clashing, some confidants urged him to visit the scarred region like the patron guardian. For some reason, Singh procrastinated, leaving the field open for the rising Modi campaign led by Amit Shah who was then party incharge of UP. The much delayed efforts to repair the alliance were perfunctory and, expectedly, fruitless. He never recovered from it. He lost in 2014 and 2019 polls. For some, it was to Singh’s credit that he voted against the Narasimha Rao government after the Babri mosque demolition. He, though, joined the government later. In the chequered career, a constant was with his bitter rivalry with Mulayam Singh Yadav. A rising star in the increasingly “Mandalising” political firmament of late 1980s, Yadav saw himself as Charan Singh’s political legatee but son Ajit Singh threw his hat in the ring but could never match the SP chief. Over the years, Yadav, in fits and starts, courted Singh and they managed a civil interaction that confounded observers. The heir apparents Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary revived the partnership by allying along with BSP, for 2019 LS polls, but to little gain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ajit-singh-an-iitian-who-was-the-face-of-jat-politics-in-up/articleshow/82447915.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Vijayawada||AP: Deaths in Covid wards put recovering patients on edge||AMARAVATI: A 30-year old, K Maheswari, resident of a remote village in Guntur district, was admitted to Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur for Covid-19 treatment with acute respiratory trouble. Doctors struggled for ten days to treat her. Now, Maheswari keeps fainting and cries often. Perturbed at her condition, doctors initiated several rounds of discussions among each other and patients. They found that seeing people dying next to her has had a traumatic effect on the young woman. Doctors have started counselling her and are trying to discharge her at the earliest as she keeps pleading that she wants to go home and can’t bear to see any more deaths. Maheswari’s troubles are not hers alone. Many patients are slipping into trauma while recovering from the virus attack. “Doctors are advising full rest to recover early. It is very difficult to take rest while getting treated in a common ward as people keep complaining about one issue or the other,” said C K Murthy, a young IT professional recovering in a private hospital. The environment in Covid-19 hospitals is fast becoming traumatic for the survivors as they are forced to witness death almost every day. Patients are facing acute mental stress due to the increasing number of deaths in their wards. Although familes are not allowed in Covid-19 wards, many go inside to collect bodies while shouting and crying aloud. “Even the packing and shifting of the bodies from the neighbourhood is a frightening experience,” said Dr Anil Kumar, a physician in a Covid-19 hospital. Dr G Vijayasaradhi, a psychologist, said the government should take help from psychologists to handle the situation. He said ignoring the issue might pose more troubles in recovery of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/deaths-in-covid-wards-put-recovering-patients-on-edge/articleshow/82440852.cms||Samdani MN
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Industries gasp for Oxygen, 50% units closed in Mandideep||BHOPAL: Barely five months ago, the industries had started operating normally like pre-Covid era, following months of lockdown- related restrictions. But following the Oxygen scarcity during the current pandemic surge, with O  diverted for medical use, industries are again in doldrums. With Covid lockdown clamped in most parts of the state, industrial areas are severely affected although industrial estates have been exempted from the lockdowns. “The production has been affected badly; 50 per cent industries have already shut down and remaining half have already reduced production to half,” said Rajeev Agrawal, president of All Industry Association of Mandideep Industrial area. He said, “Many industries have also shut down because the retail market is closed down and there is no point, dumping the production”. However, he went on to add that industrial sector stands firmly behind the society in these trying times. Amarjeet Singh, president of the Govindpura Industrial Area (GIA) also lamented, “More than10 per cent industries in Govindpura have shut down while hardly any production is taking place in the remaining units.” He said that food processing, pharma units and packaging industries are doing well. From December to mid -March ,the industries operated almost at normal level till the second wave struck. Many industries had started hiring mid -level and senior executives when the crisis started. again. During the current crisis, the production has been affected, but no company has so far retrenched any one, said industrialists. President of Federation of MP Chambers of Commerce and Industry Goswami said, “At this moment, we are not thinking in terms of profit, it is time to support the society.” </div><br/></div><div

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: They make the toughest calls informing death due to Covid||AHMEDABAD: Dr Gunjan Trivedi (name changed), a CMO at 1,200-bed hospital on Wednesday braced herself up yet again, as she dialled the number. She remained composed while starting her conversation with “I have a bad news for you. Be brave. Your father is no more. We tried our best to revive him, but as you know, he was critical”. “We are used to long pauses – most often, people take a long time to process the information. Then comes denial, despair and pain,” says Dr Trivedi, who is one of the four doctors who make the ‘most difficult call’ to the patients’ relatives. “The response often starts with, ‘He was well when we last talked to him’, but we have to appraise them of the health condition and listen to their side.” Hospital authorities too understand its psychological implications. A senior official told TOI that no person is given duty for more than two days at a stretch. “It’s not at all a mechanical process – they take some time between calls to regain their composure. Initial few days are most difficult as the caller experiences the entire spectrum of emotions – from complete denial and pleas to check again to resignation to fate,” said a senior official. Ahmedabad city is recording average deaths of 20 to 25 Covid patients daily for the past one month. On Thursday, the number dropped to16. Civil Hospital officials said that an SOP is already in place for the callers to avoid any medico-legal issues later. All have different mechanisms to beat the blues, said the doctors. The shifts change fast at A0 ward where the dead body management team works closely with other parts of the Covid care system. Civil Hospital officials said that an SOP is already in place for the callers to avoid any medico-legal issues later The authorities refused to divulge the number of deaths in a day, but accepted that the volume has increased compared to January-February. “I have lost two members of my extended family. I can understand the pain one feels – but kin don't deserve any delay. The initial calls were the most difficult calls I made in my life,” said another junior doctor associated with the process. Doctors on call duty say they practice some sort of yoga or wellness regime to keep themselves physically and mentally upbeat. “We also unwind by viewing comedy or dance shows. It also turns some into more extroverted persons, trying to connect with other family members more often than pre-Covid times.” The team members said that they turn more sympathetic towards the families and try to expedite the process to reduce their trauma. “In the first wave, there were a few instances where none came to claim the body out of stigma or all members of the family getting infected. But this time around, the stigma is less. We have not reported any unclaimed body so far,” said a doctor. Dr Neelam Kapadia, CMO of the Covid control room, said she has made regular calls to her family members who test Corona positive. "We make calls connecting with hundreds on a daily basis for their requirements ranging from oxygen to food. We have also seen how a video call with a family member completely lights up a patient. This taught me to connect more with my ailing relatives," said Dr Kapadia, adding that he got recuperated from the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-they-make-the-toughest-calls-informing-death-due-to-covid/articleshow/82447930.cms||Parth Shastri
---||India||Haven't got O2 as per pact, just one day's stock left: TN in HC||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has just one day's liquid medical oxygen stock left, and the issue has reached a critical point in the state, officials told Madras high court on Thursday. The state's health department brass told the court that while 25MT of oxygen is being diverted from Sriperumbudur to Andhra Pradesh or Telangana, the 40MT it was supposed to get in return from Palakkad in Kerala has not come. "Officials say it is a critical situation and the reserves have been used up to the extent that there may be a further day's reserve," said the first bench, recording the state's precarious oxygen situation. "The Union and the empowered committee should take immediate steps in such regard to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to Tamil Nadu to meet the needs. This must be ensured by tomorrow. The Sterlite unit is unlikely to produce oxygen till next week," the bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Thursday. During hearing, health department officials said a meeting was held on May 2 involving officials from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, central government representatives and manufacturers, at which a consensus was arrived that 475MT of oxygen would be released to Tamil Nadu daily. The officials complained that notwithstanding the meeting, no allocation order had been issued for Tamil Nadu till date. As against the daily requirement of about 450MT per day, the Central allocation remained 280MT since last week. As for availability of Remdesivir, officials told the court that at the behest of the DMK government set to assume charge on Friday, Remdesivir centres are being set up in other major cities, including Madurai and Coimbatore, for release of the drug directly to private hospitals or patients. Till April, Tamil Nadu had been allocated 1.35 lakh units of Remdesivir against the order placed of 2.5 lakh units, they said, adding that about 24,000 units had been distributed from the Kilpauk Medical College centre upon documents being produced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/havent-got-o2-as-per-pact-just-one-days-stock-left-tn-in-hc/articleshow/82447929.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Amaravati||AP: Criminal cases against 6 hospitals for irregularities in Covid treatment||AMARAVATI: The vigilance and enforcement department booked criminal cases against six hospitals for irregularities in handling Covid-19 treatment to patients in the state. The department also recommended cancellation of permission to one hospital for providing treatment to Covid-19 patients. KV Rajendranath Reddy, director general (vigilance and enforcement), on Thursday said flying squads set up for monitoring irregularities in treatment of Covid-19 patients continued inspection of hospitals in the last two days and found several irregularities in six hospitals. He said the teams have inspected 30 hospitals so far and booked the managements of six hospitals. “Certain hospitals among those inspected are found to be indulging in charging patients excessively beyond approved limits, denying/discouraging treatment under Arogya Sri for eligible patients and misappropriating Remdesivir injections allotted,” said Rajendrantha Reddy. He said the teams found violations in pharmacies attached to the hospitals including not maintaining prescribed registers, sale bills and invoices. He said criminal cases were registered against the management of five hospitals under relevant sections of IPC, Disaster Management Act and Drugs and Cosmetics Act and action is initiated against one hospital for revoking permission granted to treat Covid-19 patients. Permission granted to the City Care hospital in Kadapa to provide treatment to Covid-19 patients has been suspended for not issuing bills to the patients for payments made by them. Managements of Palnadu Hospital and Anjireddy Hospital in Piduguralla were booked under section 188, 420 of IPC and Section 51(a) of Disaster Management Act for charging excessively than the prescribed rates. Subhashini Hospital in Chittoor was booked under section 420 of IPC and Section 51(a) of Disaster Management Act for discouraging treatment under Arogyasri. Similarly, Vedanta Hospital in Vijayawada was booked under section 188, 420, 269 of IPC and Section 51(a) of Disaster Management Act for admitting Covid patients without permission and making patients to procure Remdesivir vials on their own. Criminal cases were booked against Suryamukhi Hospital of Srikakulam after noticing misappropriation of Remdesivir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/criminal-cases-against-6-hospitals-for-irregularities-in-covid-treatment/articleshow/82440996.cms||Samdani MN
---||Visakhapatnam||Top Vizag officials, including collector, test positive for Covid-19||VISAKHAPATNAM: Several IAS officers, including the district collector V Vinay Chand and joint collectors, have been affected by Covid-19 as Visakhapatnam district has been recording over 2000 cases everyday. Officials monitoring the Covid care system in the district are testing positive. IAS officers M Venugopal Reddy and Arun Babu are under isolation and joint collector Govinda Rao too has tested positive. It is to be noted that the district revenue officers and other higher officials in the revenue wing are recovering from Covid-19. Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) commissioner G Srijana tested positive four days ago and a few additional commissioners, besides other staff members, too tested positive. “Many of our have employees tested positive. The medical staff, who are conducting the test and also the vaccination programme, are affected. With the available staff, we have been continuing the vaccination and other works without any hindrance,” GVMC commissioner Srijana said. Joint collector Arun Babu, who is looking after Covid-19 related aspects, has reportedly tested positive for the second time. Venugopal Reddy went into isolation after one of his family members had shown symptoms of the virus.

---||Bhopal||Nothing positive in it: When worst fears came true in testing times||BHOPAL: It was April 17, Saturday (my day off from office), when my worst fear appeared to have come true — I had light fever. In the last one year, on several occasions I had felt as if I had contracted the deadly virus—due to sore throat, coughing, feeling feverish or loose motions— but the feeling or fear was not so credible as this time round. The horrible pictures of what was happening to Covid-19 patients in hospitals due to lack of requisite facilities like Oxygen cylinders or ventilators and the manner in which dead among them were being cremated or buried in hordes as seen and read in media and social media platforms started coming to my mind even as I thought what to do next. Testing was the obvious answer. Meanwhile, one of my friends, whom I had asked to find out about private facilities carrying out RT PCR tests called up to say that Bansal hospital would have been the best place but they have also stopped testing from today itself. By this time, prescription of medicines had arrived from my friend in administration. Apart from medicines like Azithromycin, Sumo 300, vitamin C and multivitamin tablets, he was recommended by his doctor friend to take Prednisolone (a steroid), 39 mg for the first three days and then 20 mg and then 10 mg in the following six days to keep the lungs intact. He wrote take Sumo when you have fever and Prednisolone, when you are coughing a lot. However, I took Azithromycin and Sumo that night besides a host of Ayurvedic and herbal preparations. Next day, in the afternoon, I called one of my friend, an officer in Mantralaya, who had contracted infection along with his wife and son and asked him to send someone for test. He said “I know someone. But, he only does Rapid Antigen test and will charge Rs 800 for that.” I said let him charge Rs1000 but ask him to come to my place. After a while someone called up on my mobile and said, “I am sending someone to do the test but we shall not be able to give you the report or receipt of the test. He will show you the result there itself.” I asked him to send over his man. Within 10 minutes, a young boy on his bike arrived, took my swab sample, did something outside even as my wife and I prayed that the test report were negative. But, it was not to be. He came inside after a few minutes and said “You are positive, sir.” He took me outside to explain how had he deduced that I was positive but I was hardly listening to him. I only knew I was “positive”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nothing-positive-in-it-when-worst-fears-came-true-in-testing-times/articleshow/82447933.cms||---

Jagan, who reviewed the pandemic situation at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday, told officials to ensure that every patient is admitted for treatment even if there are no beds. Stating that the state has created a new record in conducting Covid-19 tests, the chief minister said 50% of beds should be allotted to Arogyasri patients in temporary empanelled hospitals and non-empanelled hospitals notified by district collectors. He directed officials to empanel the notified hospitals temporarily and allot beds. “Treatment should be provided free of cost in all hospitals empanelled for Covid treatment under Arogyasri scheme,” the CM said. Explaining the process of functioning of 104 toll-free call centre, he said when a call is made, the message should be immediately sent to the district, depending on the location of the patient. “The collector and district administration should respond immediately and admit patients in the respective hospitals. Medical services should be provided completely free of cost to Covid patients,” he reiterated. Jagan said food quality, sanitation, oxygen, medical care and availability of doctors are important in Covid hospitals and instructed officials to recruit doctors on temporary basis if necessary. He also wanted them to ensure supply and storage of oxygen in all hospitals. “Teaching hospitals should have 10 kilo litres storage capacity and other hospitals should have 1kl storage capacity of oxygen,” he said. Principal secretary (health) Anil Kumar Singhal said the government is exploring all options to increase the production of oxygen. “As of now, six plants are producing around 25 tonnes of oxygen in the state. Six more plants will soon start production. All plants together can produce around 76 tonnes of gaseous oxygen in the state in the next few days,” he said. The government has been transporting around 472 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen daily, he said. “We have decided to purchase 25 cryogenic tankers to boost the transport of liquid oxygen. We are also in the process to procure 10 oxygen concentrators,” Singhal informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/increase-covid-bed-strength-in-hospitals-jagan-tells-officials/articleshow/82441043.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Vijayawada||HC suspends PCB’s closure order to battery plant in Chittoor district||Vijayawada: The high court on Thursday suspended the closure orders given by AP state pollution control board to Amararaja batteries limited (ABL), terming it arbitrary in nature as the said order was passed without adverting to the reply given by the company to rectify any irregularities found. The APSPCB had given closure orders to the battery manufacturing plant situated near Karakambadi village, under Renigunta mandal in Chittoor district, after it found the environmental pollution caused by the plant to be in excess of prescribed limits. Power supply to the company was also withdrawn following the order. ABL then moved the high court challenging the closure order through its authorised signatory Nugula Gopinatha Rao, DGM in the environmental engineering division of the company. Arguing on behalf of ABL, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao told the bench comprising Justice Joy Malya Bagchi and Justice M Ganga Rao that the plant has been following international standards as per as environmental protection is concerned. “There has been a dispute over the manner in which APSPCB arrived at the conclusion that ambient air quality is polluted. There are certain procedures to calculate ambient air quality as prescribed by the Union government which is followed by ABL,” he said, contending the method in which APSPCB conducted inspections to decide that ambient air is polluted beyond permissible limits. When it comes to workplace air quality, there are no set guidelines in India but ABL has been following American standards, Rao said, adding that ambient air quality is different from workplace air quality. He further said the closure order was given without even asking them an explanation or giving them the reports of pollution control board’s findings. Arguing on behalf of APSPCB, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy said the inspections were conducted twice and the reports were alarming. They found lead in adjacent water bodies, in wastewater effluents and even in the blood samples collected from employees and people living in nearby villages. He further said that concentration of lead in blood stream can cause serious health problems to humans as well as animals. After hearing both sides, the HC bench said the APSPCB findings are significant and need to be addressed. “At the same time, the company’s operations should also continue as people take enormous risks in setting up industries which are the driving force of our economy. As the ABL has been running its operations for a considerable period of time, there is no justification on the part of the APSPCB to give a closure order without giving it an opportunity to rectify the deficiencies raised in the show-cause notice,” said Justice Bagchi. Stating that a balance has to be achieved between environmental protection and running of industries without compromising each other, the high court suspended the closure order with the condition that ABL shall take steps to rectify the deficiencies by June 15 and the APSPCB shall conduct another inspection by duly giving prior notice. The inspection report should be submitted to the court before the next date of hearing on June 28, the bench said, and also directed the electricity department to restore power supply to the plant.

Did central teams ever come to ask about oxygen and vaccine shortage? We wish the Centre was similarly proactive when Hathras (gang-rape) happened and riots took place in Delhi or UP,” she added. Banerjee announced Rs 2 lakh as compensation for the next of kin of 16 people who died in post-poll violence, “most of them before May 3, when the model poll code of conduct was in force and law-and-order was under the Election Commission”. “I know money cannot bring back those who have died but this will provide some relief to the bereaved families,” she said. One of the dead was a Sanjukta Morcha supporter and the rest were from the BJP and the Trinamool Congress. “All next of kin, irrespective of religion, caste, community and political party, will be compensated,” she added. Banerjee then appealed to the Centre and the BJP: “Accept people’s mandate. Allow us to work on Covid now. We do not want to quarrel with you now.” “Let good sense prevail. A lot of fake videos are in circulation. Stop instigating people. A fake video was sent to me on Wednesday night showing a woman being assaulted. Later, it turned out to be a dispute over tree-felling,” she said. “All BJP CMs have been asked to speak against me,” she said in response to Assam BJP leaders’ contention that BJP workers from Bengal were taking shelter in Assam. “Coochbehar borders Assam. People from Assam come to Bengal when there are disturbances there. It is significant that the BJP has won most seats in Coochbehar,” she said. Banerjee has said most of the violence is happening in areas where the BJP has won. The CM cited the attack on senior Coochbehar leader Udayan Guha, whose hand was broken. Guha lost to BJP MP Nisith Pramanik by 57 votes, the lowest margin in the recently concluded polls. “We have mapped the black spots. There was also inefficiency (in the administration). You know the EC changed all superintendents of police and even the state director-general of police,” she said. The Bengal government replaced Coochbehar SP Debasish Dhar, who was appointed by the EC, on Wednesday itself. “Some sporadic incidents take place after every poll. This happens every time. So, immediately after our poll win, I appealed for peace, stopped all celebrations and urged party workers not to be provoked,” Banerjee added. The Bengal CM questioned the presence of central ministers in Bengal, who “were going to villages and instigating communal riots”. “Anyone coming to Bengal now must have a negative RT-PCR report or else must stay in quarantine for 14 days at their own cost. This will be applicable for people arriving by all special flights, including chartered flights. Even their safety is our concern,” she said, adding that the Bengal government had also banned political gatherings with more than 50 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/accept-mandate-let-us-do-covid-work-cm-to-centre/articleshow/82444708.cms||---
---||Kolkata||'Incoming garbage got tickets': Ex-governor Tathagata Roy slams BJP netas for Bengal rout||KOLKATA: Former Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy led a blistering attack against the “foursome” Kailash-Dilip-Shiv-Arvind (KDSA) — Bengal BJP minder Kailash Vijayvargiya, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, party leaders Shiv Prakash and Arvind Menon — the day he was summoned to Delhi for his controversial “nogorer noti” remarks against the party’s Tollywood celeb candidates. These candidates had gone on a boat trip with their political adversary, Trinamool Congress leader Madan Mitra, in the run-up to polls. Roy, who is down with Covid, is upset over BJP’s performance in the Bengal assembly polls and has blamed “KDSA” directly for the poll debacle. “They have dragged the names of our respected Prime Minister and home minister through mud and have sullied the name of the biggest political party in the world,” the BJP leader posted on his Twitter handle on Thursday. Roy, who describes himself as a swayamsevak, said the four distributed tickets to “incoming garbage” from Trinamool and added that BJP would now face an exodus of the “garbage” and also old party karyakartas let down by Bengal BJP brass. “These people have heaped the worst possible insults on ideologically driven BJP workers and devout swayamsevaks who had been relentlessly working for the party since 1980s. Now those very people are suffering the worst persecution from Trinamoolis. But KDSA won’t go to their rescue, they won’t even exhort them to fight back,” Roy said a day after the Bengal BJP president told media he was not leaving the battleground. The former governor also issued a post saying BJP brass had called him to Delhi as soon as he recovered. Roy would carry with him a detailed report on his remarks and present it to the central leadership. “Some ask why I don’t blame the central leaders. A central leadership in a country of 1.3 billion has to be briefed by the state leadership who are just clueless,” he said. Roy told TOI that he restrained himself until elections were over to air his views. “My primary loyalty is to the party. But I decided to raise my concerns after the election was over,” he said. The former governor alleged that a section of leaders “stonewalled” him from joining active politics after he returned from Shillong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tathagata-hits-out-at-kdsa-for-poll-debacle/articleshow/82443519.cms||---

The advance will be recovered from their salary in not more than 10 monthly instalments. The recovery is to be completed by August 2022. All employees retiring after November 2021 will be entitled to get the salary advance. This will also be available to teachers of aided schools and staff of urban local bodies and panchayats. Normally, the state government issues salary advance on the eve of Eid-Ul-Fitr and also before Pujas.

---||Kolkata||CID SIT to fast-track Sitalkuchi probe||KOLKATA: The CID on Thursday formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by its deputy inspector general Kalyan Mukherjee, to fast-track investigation into the April 10 poll-day firing in Sitalkuchi that had left four dead. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said she had sought a detailed CID report “on what happened that day” and would not like to comment before the probe was over. Prima facie, “some mischief was there”, she added. The Cooch Behar police superintendent was replaced by the Bengal government on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters in Nabanna, CM Banerjee said: “I will wait for the (CID) report first.” She added that “strong action” would be taken against mischief-makers. Earlier, the initial post-mortem report had indicated that in all four deaths in CISF firing that day, the victims had gunshot injuries in their upper body. The report had prompted Banerjee to refer to this incident earlier as “genocide” and “cold blooded murder”. CISF – and district police – had said they had fired in “self-defence” when a “mob tried to snatch their firearms”. The Calcutta High Court too has sought a CID report as several petitions are being heard that have demanded a judicial inquiry; one PIL has even urged an inquiry by a sitting HC judge. The HC is likely to take up the matter again after summer recess. On Thursday, SIT questioned case investigating officer (of Cooch Behar) Moloy Bose. He was summoned to Bhawani Bhawan and his statement recorded. Inspector-in-charge Biswasroy Sarkar of Mathabhanga police station, under which Sitalkuchi falls, is likely to be summoned on Monday to Bhawani Bhawan, the DIG said. The CID team has so far spoken to family members of victims and several witnesses. CID sources said polling officers will record their statements too. The state CID will then ask CISF personnel to join investigations. “It will be a time-bound probe,” Mukherjee said. CID has also spoken to independent witness Ali Rahman, who has described in detail his version of events. CID officers have told TOI that they have asked locals to share everything they know, including videos, still photographs and even shared WhatsApp images. Two FIRs have been lodged in the case, one by a victim’s relative and another by CISF. The CM said all five persons killed in Sitalkuchi that day, including four in the firing, had been given Rs 5 lakh compensation by the government earlier. Their next of kin would be given job of a home guard, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cid-sit-to-fast-track-sitalkuchi-probe/articleshow/82443557.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bengal CM writes to PM Narendra Modi, seeks central benefits to 9.8 lakh verified farmers||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to release PM-Kisan benefits to the 9.8 lakh famers whose names have been verified by the state and details uploaded on the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). These farmers are among the first lot of 14.9 lakh who had applied for PM-Kisan. Stressing immediate disbursement, Banerjee reminded Modi of his pre-poll statement in which he had asked “state officers to be ready to prepare a list of beneficiaries for the PM Kisan Nidhi programme”. PM-Kisan has been a contentious issue between the Centre and Bengal, resulting in back and forth of several letters. Bengal had said PM-Kisan aped its Krishak Bandhu scheme launched in December 2018 and the Central scheme had a long exclusion list of bargadars, sharecroppers, persons giving self-declarations, serving and retired employees, and income-tax payers. The Centre had written to Bengal that despite its opposition, 21.7 lakh people had logged on to the central portal and questioned why they should be denied their due. Referring to the 21.7 lakh applicants, the CM wrote to the PM on Thursday that among them 14.9 lakh had been uploaded and 9.8 lakh were checked and cleared as per norms. She further wrote: “I would like to impress that during your recent visit to the state, you gave repeated assurances on releasing the arrear amount of Rs 18,000 to each farmer, but till date, no fund has been received.” Urging the PM to release the amount, the CM also urged him to ask the Union agriculture ministry to share data of all 21.7 lakh applicants for verification. Banerjee also highlighted that while the Central payment was awaited, Bengal had already paid Rs 3,454 crore to all eligible under the state’s Krishak Bandhu scheme from January 2019. She further said 20,678 families, under this scheme, had also received death benefits of Rs 413.5 crore. She added that her pre-poll promise to hike Krishak Bandhu scheme benefits to Rs 10,000 would be rolled out once the Covid situation was brought under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-writes-to-pm-seeks-central-benefits-to-9-8l-verified-farmers/articleshow/82443459.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Post-poll violence in Bengal: MHA team meets officials, BJP leaders||KOLKATA: A four-member Uni-on home ministry team reached Bengal on Thursday to assess the situation amid allegations of post-poll violence. The visit came three days after a home ministry letter to the state government, enquiring about the law-and-order situation, failed to elicit any response. The team called on state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay at Nabanna to know about steps taken to control the “violence”. It then visited the Jagaddal residence of Shova Rani Mandal, who died four days ago, trying to protect her son, BJP supporter Gopal Mandal, from goons who attacked their home after the poll results. A BJP delegation, led by state unit çhief Dilip Ghosh and Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari, later met the MHA team to present its account of the situation in Bengal. BJP leaders complained that there was no let-up in the violence, particul-arly in East Burdwan’s Ketug-ram and Birbhum’s Rampurhat, even on Thursday. Jadavp-ur BJP candidate Rinku Nask-ar’s house was ransacked on Wednesday evening, they added. Bengal officials contend that the MHA has “limited jurisdiction” over day-to-day law-and-order issues that are primarily the state government’s responsibility. “The MHA can issue advisories to the state government as it has done on earlier occasions, call for reports and persuade state governments to take steps,” a senior Bengal government official said. The MHA team’s visit on Thursday was the first after a central team’s visit to Kolkata in 2020 to “aid and advise” the state government on Covid surveillance and management during the first wave of the pandemic. The team had then complained about not getting “cooperation” from the state government. This time, however, despite the situation on the ground, there was “no lack of cooperation” from the state government, bureaucrats here said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mha-team-meets-officials-bjp-netas/articleshow/82444791.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||MLAs’ launch showcases Bengal’s diversity||KOLKATA: Underscoring Bengal’s linguistic and cultural diversity, newly elected legislators took their oath in the assembly on Thursday in different languages, including Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Santhali and English. They were sworn in by pro tem speaker Subrata Mukherjee. On her way to Nabanna, chief minister Mamata Banerjee briefly attended the swearing-in, which is being held in batches in strict adherence to the Covid protocol. As many as 150 MLAs — most of them elected from seats in Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Midnapore, Howrah, Hooghly, Jhargram and Purulia — took oath on the first day. The ceremony ended with the swearing-in of BJP’s Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari. The assembly witnessed two firsts on Thursday — a couple and a father-daughter duo simultaneously taking oath as MLAs. Becharam Manna bagged Singur defeating his once mentor Rabindranath Bhattacharya while his doctor wife Karabi Manna won from Haripal, a seat incidentally vacated by Manna. A reticent Karabi said, “I have to learn. I will try to honour the faith CM Mamata Banerjee and the people of Haripal have shown in me.” Dulal Das, the new MLA of Maheshtala, watched proudly as daughter Ratna Chatterjee, who won from Behala East, joined the assembly for the first time. Ratna said: “I will do my very best to serve the chief minister, my party and the people who have given me such responsibility. I pledge to work for the people of Behala.” Speaking in public for the first time since his nail-biting victory, Adhikari said: “We will play our role as expected by the people who have elected 77 MLAs from BJP. Our role will be constructive as far as Covid-19 is concerned. Let the assembly first function in a full-fledged manner.” Referring to an alleged attack on junior external affairs minister V Muraleedharan’s convoy in West Midnapore, he added: “No one is safe in this state. The attack is on the people of a particular community by a particular community.” Ironically, journalists interviewing Adhikari were allegedly manhandled by central forces and the MLA reportedly made only a “mild attempt” to restrain the security personnel. Mediapersons, including women, accused CAPF of hitting them with gun butts and ripping off camera wires. The journalists filed a written complaint with the pro tem speaker and sought a ban on CAPF personnel on assembly premises. Earlier in the day, Birbaha Hansda — elected from Jhargram — stole the show in her ethnic attire as she took her oath in Santhali. She honoured Mukherjee with an uttariya (a traditional scarf) after being sworn in. The ceremony was star-studded with the presence of newly elected members from Tollywood, singers and sportspersons. Excited assembly staff didn’t miss selfie opportunities with actors June Maliah, Hiran Chatterjee and Soham Chakraborty, cricketer Manoj Tiwary, ex-footballer Bidesh Basu and singer Aditi Munshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mlas-launch-showcases-bengals-diversity/articleshow/82443483.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan’s vehicle was attacked at Paanchkuri in West Midnapore and the rear glass of his MUV smashed, prompting police to arrest eight persons and show-cause three district police officers who were responsible for the Union minister’s security. Trinamool Congress denied any involvement in the incident. In Dinhata, former Trinamool MLA Udyan Guha, who lost by a mere 57 votes to BJP’s Nisith Pramanik from Dinhata in the just-concluded assembly polls, was dragged out of his car and assaulted allegedly by BJP men. Guha was left with multiple fractures in his arm while his two security personnel and driver were seriously injured; one of them receiving multiple head injuries. Guha named 11 BJP workers in his FIR, seven of whom he claimed to have identified himself. Read AlsoBengal post-poll violence: MHA team meets Guv, to seek reportA four-member team of the Union home ministry, tasked with looking into reasons for the post- poll violence in West Bengal, met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Raj Bhawan on Friday.​Soon after the Midnapore incident, Union minister Muraleedharan sent out three Twitter posts, one with a 58-second video on the attack on his vehicle. “TMC goons attacked my convoy in West Midnapore, broken windows, attacked personal staff. Cutting short my trip,” he wrote. “We could not visit the house of Bengal BJP karyakarta Biswajit Mahesh, who was killed in the post-poll violence at his village Markundachak. Police advised us not to go after the attack on my convoy at Paanchkuri,” another post said. Mahesh was found murdered in Sabang (West Midnapore) on Tuesday night. His family in an FIR said the murder was a fallout of a land dispute. West Midnapore SP Dinesh Kumar later confirmed that eight persons had been arrested and three police officers show-caused. “Enquiry is on, departmental action will follow,” Kumar said. BJP West Midnapore president Soumen Tiwari alleged the police were mute spectators during the attack. Trinamool’s district president, Ajit Maiti claimed the “central minister had instigated the villagers, our party has nothing to do with it”. In Dinhata, Guha’s SUV was intercepted at Boys’ Club More. Guha was dragged out and beaten up; an X-ray later revealed he had multiple fractures in his right hand. His two personnel security officers and driver were injured trying to shield him. According to locals, the Boys’ Club was vandalized on Wednesday night. One of the club’s executive members is Ajoy Roy, a former Trinamool leader who defected to BJP just before the polls. Roy claimed Guha had slapped him first, leading to the attack. “We were standing in front of our club when Guha was passing by. On seeing me he came out of his vehicle and slapped me unprovoked. This angered the locals and Guha was assaulted. By the time people gathered, we had left the place,” Roy claimed. But Malati Rava Roy, BJP’s Cooch Behar president, claimed the assault on Guha was the result of “TMC’s internal feud and we have nothing to do with it”. Elsewhere, a 28-year-old BJP Kisan Morcha Mandal leader, Kishore Mandi, was found dead in Jhargram’s Jamboni prompting BJP to allege he was killed in political violence. The family, however, had not lodged any FIR or made any police complaint till reports last came in. Balaram Majhi, a BJP worker at Ketugram, succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday night. He was attacked by some men a few days back and was battling for his life at a hospital. Clashes between Trinamool and BJP workers also broke out in Tilai, Rampurhat. Police reached the spot and arrested four persons. The residence of BJP’s Jadavpur candidate, Rinku Naskar, was also ransacked. Naskar had defected to BJP from CPM just before the elections.

---||Kolkata||Next 15 days will be critical in Covid fight: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced a host of steps — including employing more doctors and nurses and stabilising oxygen supplies at all Covid facilities — to fight the raging second wave of the pandemic while urging everyone to be careful in the next 15 days, saying the number of cases was expected to rise in that period. “I am not trying to scare, but alerting everyone,” Banerjee said. “In the next 15 days, the number of cases can spike. I appeal everyone with my hands folded, please take care of yourselves.” The CM announced that the state would provide special incentives to MBBS pass-outs, including all postgraduate trainees and interns, to join the Covid battle, aiming to employ an additional 1,188 doctors and 3,428 nurses for the 93 state-run Covid hospitals across Bengal. Also, 1.7 lakh alternative medicine practitioners would be trained by the state health department to act as “first responders” to Covid patients in rural Bengal. “They will be called Sathya Surakha Karmi,” Banerjee said. The measures announced on Thursday were in addition to a 14-day hiatus on local train services, a mandatory negative RT-PCR report for each inbound traveller to Bengal, and a 50-person limit on gatherings — subject to prior approval — announced by her on Wednesday. Banerjee also announced a one-time approval for all private health facilities, both nursing homes and hospitals, to scale up their Covid bed capacities by a further 40%. This would be in addition to the existing sanctioned bed strength. “This is expected to add 2,000 beds in private hospitals alone,” she said. This approval was also granted to all 105 Covid facilities in the state — both state-run and private — to set up their own Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants. In order to save time, the hospitals will need no additional approval. “They will generate medical oxygen from ambient air. This has been done to cut time. They need not wait for any approval. The Diamond Harbour and Cooch Behar hospitals have already made their own plants,” she said. On the recruitment of more doctors and nurses, an order from the health department on Thursday specified that 530 medical officers would be employed for general wards, 183 in HDU/CCUs and 475 specialist doctors in general medicine, anaesthesia and respiratory medicine. Anima Haldar, principal of the Beliaghata ID Hospital, welcomed the move. “Because of the surge in the number of patients, there is always a need for additional manpower,” she said. While the medical officers will be paid a consolidated amount of Rs 40,000 per month, the specialist doctors will be paid Rs 50,000. The remuneration for nurses would be Rs 17,220 per month. Banerjee made it clear that everyone was a stakeholder in the battle against Covid. She urged industry chambers to come forth and take responsibility of one market each. She urged industrialists based in the districts to take charge of one district market. “The markets need to be sanitised and there should be a provision for adequate masks. They had helped us before, they will again,” she said. She also reminded NGOs, clubs, social organisations, Durga Puja committees and even religious bodies that they should ensure Covid protocols were maintained. “This time, across India, Covid is turning out to be fatal for people in the 30-45 age-group. The second strain is impacting more youngsters,” she said. The CM is scheduled to meet all religious heads at 3pm on Monday to urge them to join in Covid battle by encouraging people to worship from home. Banerjee also appealed to imams to help her in the Covid battle, like last year. She urged them that any gathering at any point should be less than 50 people, maintaining distancing norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-next-15-days-will-be-critical-in-covid-fight/articleshow/82444550.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops register 2 FIRs as fake ‘poll violence’ posts go viral||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police and state CID have initiated multiple probes, registered at least two FIRs, and shared a helpline number and an email ID after complaints from citizens that fake news portraying them as “victims of post-poll violence in Bengal” was being posted on social media. One such person is Abhro Banerjee, who’s in his twenties and works with one of India’s leading media groups in Delhi. After he’d been declared a “martyr” on the “West Bengal BJP” Facebook page and had started receiving frantic calls from family, friends and colleagues, he was compelled to go on Twitter to say: “I am Abhro Banerjee, living and hale and hearty and around 1,300 km away from Sitalkuchi. BJP IT Cell is now claiming I am Manik Moitra and died in Sitalkuchi. Please don’t believe these fake posts and please don’t worry. I repeat: I am (still) alive.” His tweet was accompanied by a screenshot of the post that presented him as a “martyr” from Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar. When contacted, Banerjee told TOI that he had nothing to add to his tweet. His friends said they were worried. “This factory of lies is very dangerous,” one of them said. The 5.28-minute clip that said he was dead was later taken down from the “West Bengal BJP” Facebook page but it was live on the “@BJP4India” Twitter handle till much later. This tweet too was deleted later but, before that, had been shared thousands of times. TOI spoke to BJP Bengal unit spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya on Thursday morning. “I will enquire and get back to you. Let me check the details first,” Bhattacharya said. The “BJPBengal” Twitter handle later clarified that Banerjee’s image was “erroneously included in the video”. “Mamik Moitro succumbed to his injuries in Sitalkuchi following violence by Trinamool members,” the tweet claimed. “Our cyber cell is probing the complaints we have received and we have already registered two FIRs. Complaints include fake news, false representations, threats issued over the internet and use of old clips from unrelated incidents to foment trouble,” joint commissioner of police (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said. Another senior official said charges against the alleged offenders included publishing or circulating statements or reports containing rumours or alarming news with the intent to create or promote feelings of enmity and hatred on grounds of caste and community, sedition and violation of Information Technology Act regulations. The fake posts include a video apparently tweeted by a senior BJP women’s wing social media cell functionary. The video shows a group of people dancing with their arms raised in the air, some of them holding daggers, knives and guns to the “Khela hobe” background track. “A separate FIR has been drawn up against this,” an official said. Some other posts have also been flagged as fake by websites that specialize in fact-checking. The CID’s cyber cell is in touch with both Twitter and Facebook to try and delete misinformation. “We have uploaded and cautioned people against two such fake videos in the past 24 hours,” a senior CID officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-register-2-firs-as-fake-poll-violence-posts-go-viral/articleshow/82444863.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad's Biological E set for Covid vaccine rollout by August||HYDERABAD: As the country grapples with the second wave of Covid-19, vaccine maker Biological E is gearing up to churn out 75 to 80 million doses per month of its recombinant protein vaccine candidate from August this year. The company also says it will be one of the most affordable vaccines in the country. Biological E’s managing director Mahima Datla indicated as much in an exclusive interview to TOI when she said: “I am not at liberty to share it (pricing) yet because we are still working on it, but I can assure you it will be among the most affordable Covid-19 vaccines that you can get a hold of.” She added that the company certainly won’t take advantage of the situation. “We’re third generation in this business,” she said. “Covid did not make us enter into this business and we pride ourselves on having made vaccines accessible in pre-pandemic times to countries that needed it the most.” Dr Maria Elena Bottazi, associate dean, National School of Tropical Medicine (NSTM) at Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine, which is collaborating with Biological E for the vaccine, has been quoted as saying that the subunit vaccine, which is modelled after the hepatitis B vaccine, uses traditional technology and is cheap to produce at only about $1.5 (Rs 110 approx) per dose. Datla’s assurance on affordable pricing comes at a time when vaccine pricing has become a political issue. After being criticised, the central government had to ask both Serum Institute of India (Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) to cut their prices for state governments. On being able to churn out 75-80 million doses per month right from the start, Datla said: “It’s a significant capacity and we have already scaled up. We have confidence in our manufacturing capabilities to be able to deliver that number from August onwards.” “We are well-resourced in terms of capacities, both for fill-finish and bulk antigen. We are focusing on hunkering down and getting our vaccines through to the finish line and making sure that we're able to deliver capacities...” she added. Bio E’s vaccine rollout could help substantially ease the vaccine crunch that is currently hampering the country’s vaccination drive. Apart from Covaxin and Covishield, Russian vaccine Sputnik V, which is priced at $10 globally, has received emergency use authorisation but India would initially have to rely on imports as local manufacturing of the vaccine is slated to begin only in the July-September quarter. Currently, Biological E is busy with preparations for phase III trials of the two-dose vaccine on 1,268 healthy volunteers in the 18-80 years age group at 15 centres across the country as part of a larger global study. Apart from the two-dose recombinant protein vaccine Bio E also has a tie-up with Johnson & Johnson for making 600 million doses of the latter’s single shot Covid-19 vaccine — Ad26.COV2.S — in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-biological-e-set-for-covid-vaccine-rollout-by-august/articleshow/82447958.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||India||EC versus HC: EC member wanted to resign, be punished for ‘murder’ if observations not withdrawn||NEW DELHI : Election commissioner Rajiv Kumar had insisted on a more forceful and personal submission in the Madras High Court while seeking withdrawal of its observation that EC officials be "put up for murder" for the Covid surge, and offered to take individual responsibility, resign and face punishment in case the HC refused the prayer. In a separate draft affidavit, whose contents he had wanted to be incorporated in the EC affidavit and, alternatively, have the affidavit filed in his individual capacity as election commissioner, Kumar said the HC observations had demoralised 11 lakh people involved in conduct of polls under Covid cloud. Stating that when “murderers, the description used by the Hon’ble court, head or remain part of ECI, voters in general and contesting candidates/political parties….cannot trust free, fair, transparent elections,” Kumar said: “I, as election commissioner, cannot escape individual responsibility and leave it to the judgement of Hon’ble court to punish in the manner the Hon’ble court is pleased to so decide. The institution (ECI), however, needs to be absolved of the doubts cast on it”. Kumar’s separate affidavit was never filed as the senior counsel arguing the matter opined that an affidavit could only be submitted on behalf of ECI or CEC who were made respondents in such cases. “The submissions in a court of law on behalf of ECI have to be within a legal framework and must be vetted by the senior counsel,” a senior functionary told TOI. “At the EC meeting, all the senior officials as well as legal counsel were unanimous that it is for EC to approach courts unitedly and not for an election commissioner to place submissions in his individual capacity. There is no such precedent,” an officer said adding that at the stage of filing the SLP in the Supreme Court, many paragraphs from Kumar’s affidavit were incorporated and the prayer for restraining media from reporting oral observations of the court, excluded. “The EC affidavit in Madras HC and later the SLP in Supreme Court were filed only after the election commissioner’s approval, and it was made amply clear to him that he could not make submissions in his individual capacity,” an EC functionary told TOI. Kumar had in his draft affidavit argued that EC was far ahead of the Covid curve and took nearly 30 actions for safe polls, including considering deferring of polls and merging the last few phases. However, deferring of polls would temporarily disenfranchise voters, leading to implications of elections not being completed on time and necessitating an extended term or President’s rule. This, he said, would attract sharper objections of favouring one and acting against another. Kumar’s draft affidavit said the HC’s ‘murder’ observation had caused loss of faith in EC as an institution, making it additionally difficult for it to conduct elections in the future. He also objected to EC singularly being blamed for the Covid surge when Disaster Management Act placed this responsibility on the local administration that must act as per directions of NDMA and SDMA. He also pointed out that between announcement of polls on February 26and the filing of the affidavit, no inputs were received by EC about a possible surge in Covid cases and precautions to be taken. In fact, it was only on April 25 that the Union health secretary wrote to the states and UTs suggesting intensive local containment focused on restraining intermingling of people for a period of 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-versus-hc-ec-member-wanted-to-resign-be-prosecuted-for-murder-if-observations-not-withdrawn/articleshow/82447950.cms||Bharti Jain

The cops will approach the court to have the seized machines distributed to hospitals and medical facilities during the oxygen crisis. According to DCP (south) Atul Thakur, the recoveries started from Nege & Ju bar, owned by Kalra. Kalra is a well-known businessman associated with Dayal Opticals and Khan Chacha, police said. Two other restaurateurs are also under the scanner with initial probe suggesting they were involved in funding the procurement through a firm which dealt in sim cards, a senior officer said. The cops got the first tipoff from a WhatsApp message allegedly sent by Kalra to his acquaintance detailing his account details in lieu of a concentrator. Following this, cops mounted watch at Kalra's bar in central market, Lodhi Colony. “During area patrolling, suspicious activity was noted at the outlet which was found open. When enquired, a person was found working on a laptop and handling orders of oxygen concentrator by ‘Xpect Everything online portal’. During search of the premises, 32 boxes of concentrators having capacity of 9 and 5 litres were seized,” DCP Thakur said. An FIR was registered and the bar manager Hitesh and three others — Gaurav, Satish and Vikrant — were arrested. They led the cops to Khullar Farm, Mandi Village from where 387 more units were seized. In the second operation, the west district police seized 18 concentrators and arrested two suspects, DCP Urvija Goel said. The suspects have been identified as Hemant Mehta and Hari. Inspector Narender’s team had received a tip-off that the duo was selling the machines for Rs 1.3 lakh each and conducted a raid. Mehta had imported these from China. The north Delhi Police seized nine concentrators and arrested two people in separate operations. “Five machines were seized by cops from Wazirabad police station who arrested a man named Amit Bajaj while four concentrators and nine cylinders were seized from a suspect named Harshit Gupta by the anti-auto theft squad,” DCP Anto Alphonse said. In southeast Delhi, DCP R P Meena’s team seized six concentrators and arrested a man named Avinash Gupta. SHO Lajpat Nagar Dharam Dev had received a tip-off about the suspect selling concentrators in black and sent a decoy customer. The suspect arrived with the machines and was arrested. In Govindpuri, a home care service provider was arrested for overcharging Covid-19 patients for providing oxygen concentrators. The suspect, Deep Kumar, was charging Rs 3 lakh for a single oxygen concentrator. He accepted Rs 2.1 lakh in advance in his account but the buyer complained to cops after getting to know that she was being overcharged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-concentrator-racket-busted-in-delhi-businessman-on-run/articleshow/82447962.cms||Raj Shekhar

On most of the previous days, the number hovered around the 50,000 mark. Though it was the sixth day since vaccination started in the state, many people are still clueless on slot booking. Many who had already registered are not been able to get a time slot and the vaccination site for themselves and their families. In the last six days of inoculation, a total of 2,22,063 have been vaccinated so far. The number could have gone higher but due to problems in the Co-Win and Aarogya Setu apps, many who had registered did not get slots. Many people who were roaming near the vaccination centres were told that without slot booking they can’t be entertained. “We have a slot of 100 vaccines per site in Jaipur. As soon as slots are opened, youngsters get their slots booked. This problem will improve when we will increase the vaccines and that is possible only after getting adequate supply of doses,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination. He added that vaccines have arrived for frontline and health workers and those above 45 years in the evening. “We have got 3 lakh vials for this category and hopefully this will enable us to administer the second dose to beneficiaries in this category,” he added. Out of the 39,198 shots, 8,196 got their first jab in Jaipur followed by Bharatpur (5,888), Kota (4,059), Udaipur(3,701), Jodhpur (3,096), Ajmer (2,816), Bikaner (2,788), Bhilwara (2,277), Pali (2,025), Dholpur (1,583), Sikar(1,545) and Alwar (1,215).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/rajasthan-over-39000-in-18-category-vaccinated-tally-now-2-lakh/articleshow/82447963.cms||---

These candidates had gone on a boat trip with their political adversary, Trinamool Congress leader Madan Mitra, in the run-up to polls. Roy, who is down with Covid, is upset over BJP's performance in the Bengal assembly polls and has blamed "KDSA" directly for the poll debacle. "They have dragged the names of our respected PM and home minister through mud and have sullied the name of the biggest political party in the world," the BJP leader posted on his Twitter handle on Thursday. Roy, who describes himself as a swayamsevak, said the four distributed tickets to "incoming garbage" from Trinamool and added that BJP would now face an exodus of the "garbage" and also old party karyakartas let down by Bengal BJP brass. "These people have heaped the worst possible insults on ideologically driven BJP workers and devout swayamsevaks who had been relentlessly working for the party since 1980s. Now those very people are suffering the worst persecution from Trinamoolis. But KDSA won't go to their rescue, they won't even exhort them to fight back," Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/incoming-garbage-got-bjp-tickets-in-bengal-tathagata/articleshow/82448004.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Covid management: Thiruvananthapuram corporation starts building fleet of vehicles||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : The city corporation has started rolling out an elaborate transportation plan as part of Covid management in the city. The health wing started preparing a database of available school buses in government schools. Besides plans are underway to make use of school buses owned by private educational institutions. Transportation plan and maintaining a fleet of vehicles are being done as part of various Covid-related activities undertaken by the control room being run by city corporation. The maintenance of school buses in government schools has emerged as the biggest challenge for the civic body. “We made a list of 14 schools and identified buses which could be taken over. However, when we inspected those vehicles, we found that the buses need mechanical repair and works of other kinds. All these buses have not been used for more than a year. We can’t afford time either. Our priority now is to get a few vehicles functional very soon so that they will be ready for operation,” said a health official. With a major percentage of people remaining in home care and availability of vehicles becoming a cause of concern with rise in cases, corporation plans to deploy a fleet of vehicles in each ward and the demand can be communicated via the control room. As per the order issued by local self-government department (LSGD), corporations have been directed to look for taxis with double chamber and to enter into contract with private ambulances. The officials said that there are practical difficulties in implementing the order. “Private vehicle owners are already facing the brunt of economic breakdown. Besides there is always the risk of infection as many of the drivers are below 45 years of age and are not vaccinated unlike the frontline health workers. It is not often possible to get them into a contract based on rates being pitched by civic bodies,” said a health official. LSGD has put forward options like making use of private vehicles which are not used frequently or availing vehicles from those who own more than one car. The local bodies have been directed to meet the driver and fuel expenses or explore options to sponsor fuel. The corporation officials said that they really have to work hard to explore such options and convince people into giving away their private vehicles which are not in use at present. The vehicles are mostly required for transport of patients from homes to firstline or domiciliary treatment centres and Covid hospitals. As per the directive, corporation has also been asked to ensure that drivers of taxis wear PPE kits and corporation purchase that PPE kit for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-management-thiruvananthapuram-corporation-starts-building-fleet-of-vehicles/articleshow/82448035.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Business||Govt in no rush to grant 'compulsory licences'||NEW DELHI: The government may not rush ahead and grant a series of compulsory licences to access cheaper drugs in the wake of Natco Pharma seeking patent waiver for rheumatoid arthritis drug Baricitinib that is being administered to Covid patients. While it is still early days for Natco's application, sources indicated that a blanket use of compulsory licence - a provision available in WTO's TRIPS agreement - may not be a good idea. Amid suggestions to use the tool for Remdisivir and Tocilizumab, two drugs that are being used, government sources said that it made little sense to invoke compulsory licensing provisions, given that the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is not available in the country. "It will not solve any purpose as you will need the basic chemicals too," said a government source. Under India's Patent Act, relaxations can be given under half-a-dozen situations. Natco has used among the more controversial section 92, which allows the Centre to invoke compulsory licensing provisions in case of due to a national emergency, circumstances of extreme urgency or in case of public non-commercial use. The use of the provision to waive Bayer's rights over a cancer drug almost a decade ago had generated considerable controversy with the US expressing its displeasure. Over the years, the commerce and industry ministry has resisted pressure from the health ministry to use the clause, arguing that it's to be used in the rarest of rare cases. Officials said that this is time consuming as well. Former PM Manmohan Singh had recently pointed to possible use of compulsory licence and other flexibility under the Patents Act to boost vaccine output. There are other provisions too, which are simpler. For instance, section 47 allows the government to import patented drugs for its use or for use in hospitals and dispensaries, which is seen as a non-controversial use. Similarly, under section 100 it has powers to use certain inventions either before a patent has been granted or even after the rights have been given to the inventor. Sources indicated that while the government has powers to use compulsory licence as a tool, especially when WTO members such as the European Union have supported its use, it will prefer the TRIPS waiver window, for which negotiations are expected to begin shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-in-no-rush-to-grant-compulsory-licences/articleshow/82448058.cms||Sidhartha

The survivor was among the convict’s 11 children from three wives. Born to his second wife, the girl has been putting up with her father’s sexual assault since 2017 when she was 15 years old.  He continuously raped her by threatening to kill her mother if she revealed it to anyone. However, the woman came to know about it in 2019 and threatened him with dire consequences.  He decided to get rid of her after she started preventing his further advances towards the girl. He murdered the woman in December 2019 at an isolated place. Police arrested him and it was during inquiry that they came to know about his sexual assault on his own daughter. Third rape case ending with death sentence in 6 months Judge R Sathya convicted the man under four sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) (amendment) Act, 2019. Besides death sentence, she also awarded him a life sentence, nine years of rigorous imprisonment and fines adding up to ₹3 lakh. This is the third case of rape of a minor in the past six months in which the judge has awarded death sentence. In December 2020, a 25-year-old man who murdered a seven-year-old girl after raping her in June that year was awarded death sentence, rigorous life imprisonment and fine. In February this year, the judge awarded triple death sentence to a 34-year-old native of Gujarat for sodomising a 17-year-old boy with learning disabilities who later died in hospital due to internal injuries.

Some exceptions have been made. Citizens above 45 years who are due for a second dose of Covaxin can enter without an appointment provided they carry the certificate of the first dose in either soft or hard copy. Healthcare and frontline workers due for a first or second dose of Covaxin or Covishield are also exempted but will need a certificate from their employer. “The above orders will come into force with immediate effect,” said BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. The directive has come in the wake of crowding and the absence of Covid-appropriate behaviour at vaccination points; a stampede-like situation broke out at the Bandra Kurla Complex centre on Wednesday. Those in charge of all centres—there are 147 in the cityhave been directed to ensure verification of online appointments before allowing entry into the premises. The news triggered concerns among those who struggle to book appointments or find online appointments being overlooked.Many said BMC should have arranged for assistance for senior citizens to go online. BMC may enlist NGOs to help sr citizens; more Covaxin sites set upA Mulund resident said, “I had an appointment for 12pm on Wednesday but when I reached, there were 500 people ahead of me. The centre refused to consider the appointment and asked me to wait in line… they had only 200 vaccines left,” he said. A teacher from Dahisar said getting a slot on CoWin was not easy. “Unless they have a perfectly efficient app, it will be unfair to stop walk-ins,” she said, adding that she has been trying in vain to book an appointment for the past one week. BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “Those without an appointment will have to go back unless they are in a category that’s exempted…we had no control over the crowd at the centres. People refused to listen and 90% came in through walk-ins,” he said. For assistance, he said people would be given support at ward offices. “In addition, we will look at tie-ups with NGOs willing to help senior citizens,” Kakani said. The system is permanent for now, though there could be some modifications to the rule. On Thursday, vaccination numbers picked up with 60,153 people taking the shot. Daily vaccinations were languishing in the range of 25,000-40,000 the past few weeks due to erratic supply of doses. Kakani said the city received 70,000 doses on Thursday, so vaccines will be available for the next few days. For the agegroup of 18-44, he said more centres will be added next week. Currently, only five are vaccinating this group. The state has received 5lakh Covaxin doses that will be used for this age group. Among private centres, HN Reliance vaccinated 983 while Nanavati gave doses to 470 on Thursday. Congress MLA for Bandra (East) constituency Zeeshan Siddique said with vaccine stocks being limited, it is better to take only those who have registered. “Once vaccines arrive in large numbers, walk-in should once again be allowed with adequate security arrangements,” he said. Three new centres have been added to the existing five Covaxin centres for those between 18-44 years. The new centres to start from Friday will be PWD Community Hall (Bandra East), MCGM Parking World Tower (Lower Parel) and Maasaheb Meenatai Thackeray Maternity Home (Chunabhatti).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-walk-ins-for-vaccination-in-mumbai-except-for-covaxin-2nd-shot/articleshow/82448117.cms||Richa Pinto

Alarmed by the unprecedented surge in cases, the 43-year-old is among 1,000-odd young desi doctors in America who are doing their bit by bringing donors from the US in contact with beneficiaries in India. Ever since the second wave hit India, these doctors have responded by floating not-for-profit organisations, creating bank accounts where donations can be deposited, and tying up with cargo and shipping companies to organise charitable efforts to send oxygen tanks, ventilators, oxygen meters, regulators, concentrators to India. "After I return home, I stay awake till 1am or 2am co-ordinating relief efforts in India," said Swaroop, founder-president, Unite4India and Sadanah, an international charity NGO. "We raised US$ 250,000 in five days and arranged to ship 200-odd oxygen concentrators to Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu," said Dr Karthik Ramakrishnan, who is part of Unite4India. Independent US doctors of Indian origin are also helping by sourcing oxygen vendors, hospital beds and scouting for plasma donors. "I navigate logistics, healthcare systems, acquire resources. I also recruit healthcare workers for Indian hospitals and patients in home isolation," said Dr Priya Jaisinghani, 29, an internal medicine physician. Indians working with US corporate giants, too, have joined hands. "Many warehouses in India that use compressed air systems can be optimised to produce 1 lakh litres of oxygen per hour. We have activated few regions in India and shared this schematic with other corporates," said Praveen, engineer with a food-and-beverage firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/young-desi-doctors-in-us-help-get-aid-for-india/articleshow/82448121.cms||Rohan Dua
