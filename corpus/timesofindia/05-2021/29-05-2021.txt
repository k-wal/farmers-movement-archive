The defense spending request for fiscal 2022, which was sent to Congress on Friday, invests in troop readiness, space, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative aimed at countering China's military build-up in Asia and nuclear weapons technology. The budget request would buy warships and jets, and pay for maintenance and salaries, and an additional $38 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies, bringing the national security budget to $753 billion, a 1.7% increase over the 2021 figure. There is also money to further develop and test hypersonic weapons and other "next generation" systems as the military aims to build capabilities to counter Russia and China. Presidential budget requests, including those for the military, are commonly a starting point for negotiations with Congress, which ultimately decides how funds are spent. The proposed pay raise for military and civilian Defense Department workers follows a 3% raise for the 2021 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. More than $5 billion will be spent on the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, created to counter China and focusing on competition in the Indo-Pacific with an aim to boost US preparedness in the region through funding radars, satellites and missile systems. Specifically, the Pentagon plans to increase investment in missiles like the Raytheon Technologies-made Tomahawk and Standard Missile 6 to keep China at bay. Tensions with an increasingly assertive China are on the minds of US military planners. Beijing accused the United States last week of threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait after a US warship again sailed through the sensitive waterway. To pay for this shift and things like a huge research budget, the Pentagon is seeking to divest some of its older equipment with higher maintenance costs. Divestment from the Army, Navy and Air Force will total $2.8 billion in fiscal 2022. The retirements include four Littoral Combat Ships, 42 A-10 aircraft, which provide close air support to ground troops, as well as 14 KC-10 and 18 KC-135 planes in the mid-air refueling fleets. Fewer M1 Abrams tanks made by General Dynamics will be purchased, dropping to 70 from 102 in fiscal 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bidens-defense-budget-gives-troops-2-7-raise/articleshow/83045458.cms||---

---||India||Army ready to thwart any mischief by China, while talks underway to resolve remaining 'friction points': General M M Naravane||NEW DELHI: The Army is maintaining high operational readiness to `thwart’ any `unusual activity’ by China all along the northern borders, said General M M Naravane on Friday, while rejecting concerns that India squandered its leverage by vacating the Kailash Range heights without extracting any concession on Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh. The Army chief, in an exclusive interview to TOI, asserted the Rezang La-Rechin La heights in the Kailash Range were vacated as part of the troop disengagement plan on both sides of Pangong Tso in February after “analyzing all military implications and the ground situation”. “There is no question of India having come under any pressure or having compromised,” said Gen Naravane. Diplomatic and military negotiations are in progress for resolution of the remaining face-off sites like Hot Springs, Gogra and the strategically-located Depsang Plains. “Negotiations are being conducted for resolution of other friction points in a firm but non-escalatory manner. Negotiations do take time. We will resolve them by and by,” he said. India has made its position very clear to China that “both sides should restore the status quo ante as prevailing on or before April 2020”, he added. But with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) digging in its heels to even complete the stalled disengagement at patrolling points (PPs) 15, 17 and 17A in the Hot Springs-Gogra-Kongka La area, Gen Naravane acknowledged troop de-induction and the consequent de-escalation along the frontier would take some time. The PLA also continues to block Indian patrols from going to their traditional PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12, and 13 in Depsang, which are well short of India’s perception of the Line of Actual Control in the region. “Depsang Bulge is a legacy issue where the differing perception and obstruction to patrolling has been there for some time. The issue needs to be amicably resolved at the earliest,” said Gen Naravane. The Army is maintaining a force-level of around 50,000-60,000 soldiers in forward areas to take care of all contingencies. “Our forces are ready to thwart any unusual activity on part of our neighbour. Things are stable as of now, but we cannot be complacent. We have to keep a strict watch. We are doing it,” he said. Excerpts from the interview:Q: What is the current ground situation in eastern Ladakh? A: Partial disengagement has been undertaken in the areas on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso and the Kailash Range. In these areas, the troops from either side, as per agreement, have been pulled back to their respective permanent locations in February. There has been no infringement of the pact from either side till now. The troop disengagement from the rest of the stand-off points is being deliberated by the military commanders on both sides, augmented by the diplomatic machinery. Notwithstanding the disengagement, China continues to deploy its mechanized elements (tanks and armoured vehicles) and troops in immediate depth areas. Overall, the force-levels remain the same…around 50,000-60,000 each. There has been some disengagement, but de-induction of troops and de-escalation has not happened. We are aware the PLA is also carrying out summer exercises in their traditional training areas opposite eastern Ladakh, with additional formations having come in there. We are keeping an eye out for any activity that may be interpreted as out of the ordinary. Our forces are ready to thwart any unusual activity on part of our neighbour. Q: Can the situation escalate again?A: Things are stable and under control as of now. But inadvertent incidents can happen due to over-enthusiasm of local commanders, which have to be guarded against. We, of course, cannot be complacent. We have to keep a strict watch. We are doing it. Negotiations are being conducted for resolution of other friction points in a firm but non-escalatory manner. Q: But the 11thround of corps commander-level talks on April 9 failed to achieve any breakthrough? PLA refused to complete the stalled disengagement at Gogra, Hot Springs and Demchok as well as stop blocking Indian patrols in Depsang?A: We should not expect a result from every round. The disengagement at Pangong Tso happened after 10 rounds. The next round will take place. Q: The Doklam confrontation in 2017 lasted for 73 days…A: The Sumdorong Chu face-off (in the 1980s) lasted for some years. It’s difficult to give a timeframe. Issues remain to be resolved at the friction points. Negotiations do take time. We will resolve them by-and-by. Q: There are major concerns that India should not have vacated the Chushul-Kailash Range heights without extracting concessions from China on Depsang Plains, where access of Indian patrols to hundreds of sq km of territory has been cut off? A: Vacation of Kailash Range as part of the Pangong Tso disengagement plan was undertaken after analyzing all military implications and the ground situation. There is no question of Indian side having come under any pressure or having compromised. Depsang Bulge is a legacy issue where the differing perception and obstruction to patrolling has been there for some time. The issue needs to be amicably resolved at the earliest. Q: You recently said the threat from China has `only abated’ but `not gone away altogether’. The PLA continues with force levels as before. Will de-escalation take place or will the LAC turn into another LoC (with Pakistan) with permanent deployments? A: It is true the Chinese troops who had mobilized from depth areas continue to be deployed in intermediate depth areas opposite the LAC in eastern Ladakh. Hence, the threat continues to exist. Talks during the 10th round of meeting between the senior military commanders led to a disengagement (at Pangong Tso), which has been monitored and verified by both sides. However, the discussions over the remaining areas need to be expedited to reflect the status quo ante of April 2020. Success in these discussions will create a positive and trustful environment for both countries to resolve their remaining issues peacefully. Our stance is very clear: both sides should restore “status quo ante” as prevailing on or before April 2020 and avoid reoccurrence of such incidents. Q: What about other stretches of the LAC like Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim? China is also building villages and settling civilians in border areas?A: In other stretches, the situation remains peaceful with normal deployments of the PLA. As for the villages, China is building them but they have not encroached on Indian territory. It’s part of some grand design, which is difficult to deduce…possibly to populate their areas which were earlier not occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-ready-to-thwart-any-mischief-by-china-while-talks-underway-to-resolve-remaining-friction-points-general-m-m-naravane/articleshow/83046308.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||World||Three officers face arraignment in Black man's restraint death||SEATTLE: Five weeks after ex-Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd, three Washington state officers have been charged in the death of Manuel Ellis: another Black man who pleaded for breath under an officer's knee.  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson charged Tacoma officers Christopher Burbank and Matthew Collins, who are both white, with second-degree murder Thursday after witnesses reported that they attacked Ellis without provocation.  Timothy Rankine, who is Asian, faces a charge of first-degree manslaughter. He is accused of kneeling on Ellis' back and shoulder as he died from a lack of oxygen, according to a probable cause statement filed in Pierce County Superior Court.  All three were in custody by Thursday evening and were scheduled to be arraigned Friday. Their attorneys did not respond to messages seeking comment.  Ellis, 33, died on March 3, 2020 - Tasered, handcuffed and hogtied, with his face covered by a spit hood - just weeks before George Floyd's death triggered a nationwide reckoning on race and policing.  The Pierce County medical examiner called Ellis' death a homicide due to a lack of oxygen caused by restraint, with an enlarged heart and methamphetamine intoxication as contributing factors.  The death made Ellis' name synonymous with pleas for justice at protests in the Pacific Northwest. His final words - "I can't breathe, sir!" - were captured by a home security camera, as was the retort from one of the officers: "Shut the (expletive) up, man."  "Ellis was not fighting back," the probable cause statement said, citing video recorded by three witnesses.  The case marks the first time the attorney general's office has charged police officers with unlawful use of deadly force.  Five Tacoma officers have been on paid home leave pending the charging decision, and Ferguson said the investigation is continuing.  The Tacoma Police Union called the decision "a politically motivated witch hunt."  "An unbiased jury will not allow these fine public servants to be sacrificed at the altar of public sentiment," the union said in a statement.  Burbank and Collins reported the encounter began after they saw Ellis trying to get into occupied cars at a red light. Ellis, recently back from church, had walked to a convenience store to get a late-night snack: powdered, raspberry-filled donuts.  The officers cast Ellis as the aggressor, saying he punched the window of their cruiser and attacked them as they got out, according to statements from other officers cited in the charging documents.  But two witnesses came forward with identical stories, saying the police attacked. An officer in the passenger side of a patrol car slammed his door into Ellis, knocking him down, and started beating him, they said.  The witnesses "described seeing a casual interaction between the officers and Ellis before Burbank struck Ellis with his car door - there was no sudden, random attack by Ellis as the officers described that night to others," the probable cause statement said.  Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer, who was then a detective and the spokesman for the sheriff's office, said after Ellis' death that none of the officers placed a knee on his neck or head. But witness video that later surfaced appeared to depict just that; the charging documents said Rankine knelt on the base of Ellis' neck.  The sheriff's office botched the initial investigation by failing to disclose for three months that one of its deputies had been involved in restraining Ellis; state law requires independent investigations. The Washington State Patrol took over, and the Attorney General's Office reviewed its evidence and conducted its own additional investigation.  In a statement, interim Tacoma Police Chief Mike Ake said the department would review the case for any discipline, training or policy changes that might be warranted.  "We realize we must reduce outcomes that cause pain and diminish trust within our community," he said.  Ellis had a history of mental illness and addiction. In September 2019, he was found naked after trying to rob a fast food restaurant. A sheriff's deputy subdued him with a Taser after he refused to remain down on the ground and charged toward law enforcement.  His landlords at the sober housing where he was staying told The Seattle Times he had been doing well in recent months after embracing mental health care for his schizophrenia. He had been frequently attending church, where he was a drummer in a worship band.  At a news conference Thursday, Ellis' family welcomed the charges but called for more work to overhaul the criminal justice system. The family is seeking $30 million in a lawsuit against the city.  "The criminal system needs to be made over, from the head - just take it all off," said Ellis' mother, Marcia Carter-Patterson. She added: "This is about Manuel Elijah Ellis. This is his work. So help us with it."  Ellis' death, Pierce County's botched investigation, and the national outcry for racial justice inspired Gov. Jay Inslee to convene a task force to suggest ways to guarantee independent reviews of police use of deadly force.  Last week, Inslee signed one of the nation's most ambitious packages of police accountability legislation, including outright bans on police use of chokeholds, neck restraints and no-knock warrants. The legislation also makes it easier to decertify police - and creates an independent office to review deadly force cases.  The charged officers could face up to life in prison if convicted, but the standard sentencing range is 10 to 18 years for second-degree murder with no prior criminal history, and 6.5 to 8.5 years for manslaughter.  All three previously served in the Army, the attorney general's office said, and as police officers all had taken training on crisis intervention. Collins, 38, and Burbank, 35, had each been an officer for four years by March 2020 after serving eight years in the Army. Rankine, 32, joined the department in 2018 after six years in the Army and two as a security contractor for the U.S. State Department.  Police reform activists have long bemoaned the prevalence of former soldiers in civilian departments, saying they tend to be more aggressive than called for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/three-officers-face-arraignment-in-black-mans-restraint-death/articleshow/83046857.cms||---
---||Goa||Coach Stimac gets extension till September, Medeira is interim technical director||Panaji: The All India Football Federation’s technical committee has handed national coach Igor Stimac an extension till September when the playoffs for the Asian Cup 2023 are expected to be played. The committee, however, did not extend the contract of technical director Isac Doru which ended on April 7 and has instead handed interim charge to Savio Medeira, who has held the position in the past. “The members felt that there was no need for a full-time technical director at the moment. There are no activities happening due to the pandemic and a new appointment can be made when normalcy returns. As for the chief coach, it made no sense to disturb anything so close to the tournament,” a senior member of the technical committee told TOI on Friday. Stimac’s two-year contract ended on May 15 but the Croatian coach continued with his duties after being assured by the AIFF that his job is not under immediate threat. “I am not thinking about my contract,” Stimac told reporters during an online interaction earlier in the day. “I am fully focused on the job I need to do here (in Qatar). The AIFF and technical committee will decide on the contract. I am here on a goodwill. Everyone knows in the last 12 months, we didn’t have any action. “My duty is to do my job and commit myself to AIFF. That’s what I do. The technical committee will check on our efforts, our work. The players are best witnesses to speak on the quality of our work and how much they have advanced. We didn’t have much of a chance to work together to advance our football,” said Stimac. Deputy chairman Henry Menezes chaired the meeting on Friday via video conferencing with chairman Shyam Thapa staying away due to illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coach-stimac-gets-extension-till-september-medeira-is-interim-technical-director/articleshow/83046307.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Very confident India will qualify for Asian Cup 2023: Stimac||Panaji: When India stretched Oman to the limit and held Asian champions Qatar to goalless draw in their first two Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifying games, Igor Stimac knew he had to keep his feet firmly on the ground. “I said after the first two games when everyone was excited, be patient. Don’t fly now, because if you fly too high, when you hit the ground, it will be painful,” Stimac told reporters during an online interaction on Friday. The fall has been painful. Since the draw against Qatar in Doha, India have failed to edge past lower-ranked teams like Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the group. In fact, in both the games, India had to dig deep for a point. It could have so easily got worse. Nothing is lost, still. India have three matches in hand and should they put across Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15), they will qualify for the third stage of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers, a target they had probably set for themselves at the start of the campaign. Anything less than finishing third in the group will mean complicated playoffs in September. “I am very confident that at the end of this journey, we will participate in the Asian Cup (2023), never mind which position we occupy in the group. I am convinced we will qualify from any position and then we will have enough time to work together and make everyone in India happy with the quality of our game,” said Stimac. Under Stimac, India played their best football against Oman in the opening game but ended with nothing as they conceded two goals in the last 10 minutes. Against Qatar, the team defended like their life depended on it. Neither of the results surprised the Croatian coach. “The first two games, we played against strong sides in our group. We played quality football. Everyone was excited. But the result of the quality was because we had enough time to work together. We had time to explain to the players what to expect. “After these games, we had many problems. Problems from normal footballers’ lives, like injuries to Sandesh (Jhingan) Rowllin (Borges) and Brandon (Fernandes), who we couldn’t use. These are very important players and that drastically changes the quality of our games. We suffered because of the absentees, but we are still alive with our goals,” said Stimac. India are fourth in group E with three points from five games. They are yet to win a game but will fancy their chances of a positive result against bottom-placed Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15). Stimac, though, warned it won’t be easy. “Our situation is far from pleasant when you compare to other teams (in the group). Qatar is at home and fully prepared, Bangladesh finished their league on May 10. They had certain difficulties and couldn’t go to Saudi Arabia, but they will be better prepared because the players were playing the league till May 10. Twenty three out of 28 Afghanistan players are playing either in Europe or United States. They will be fully fit. “I can promise we will give everything we have at the moment, playing these games. We will do everything here to qualify for the final stages of the Asian Cup. Then we will have enough chance to do quality work which will show great football and good results,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/very-confident-india-will-qualify-for-asian-cup-2023-stimac/articleshow/83047493.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Spain criticized for unequally priced 'equality stamps'||MADRID: Spain's postal service is feeling a backlash from its attempt to highlight racial inequality.  State-owned Correos Espana this week issued a set of four stamps in different skin-colored tones. The darker the stamp, the lower the price. The lightest color costs 1.60 euros ($1.95). The darkest one costs 0.70 euros ($0.85).  The postal service calls them "Equality Stamps" and introduced them on the anniversary of George Floyd being killed by a police officer in Minneapolis. It said the stamps "reflect an unfair and painful reality that shouldn't be allowed" and that every letter or parcel sent with them would "send a message against racial inequality."  The campaign was launched during European Diversity Month in collaboration with Spain's national SOS Racism Federation, a nonprofit group, and featured a 60-second video with Spanish hip-hop star and activist El Chojin.  But while the goal of Correos Espana was to "shine a light on racial inequality and promote diversity, inclusion and equal rights," critics are accusing the company of having a tin ear for racial issues and misreading the sentiment of Black people in Spain.  Antumi Toasije, a historian who heads the government's Council for the Elimination of Racial or Ethnic Discrimination, urged the postal service to stop selling the stamps.  "A campaign that outrages those it claims to defend is always a mistake," he tweeted.  The main thrust of the public criticism was that the darker stamps have a lower value, giving the impression that a light skin color is worth more.  Moha Gerehou, a 28-year-old Spanish author and a former president of SOS Racismo Madrid, said that was "an insurmountable contradiction."  "At the end of the day, an anti-racism campaign has put out a clearly racist message," Gerehou told the Associated Press on Friday.  He put the controversy in the context of what he sees as structural racism in Spain, which often goes unacknowledged but can be detected in such aspects as commercial advertising, the Spanish language and in access to housing. "It's all connected," he said.  Correos Espana said it would make no comment on the controversy.  The postal service's initiative has divided Spanish anti-racism activists. While the national SOS Racism Federation backed it, the organization's Madrid section poured scorn on the effort.  SOS Racismo Madrid said the campaign helps conceal the structural nature of racism and perpetuate the notion of Black inferiority.  Any racially aware person would have identified what was wrong with the campaign, it said, adding that the blunder proved the need for more racially aware people in decision-making positions at companies.  The campaign also received criticism on social media.  This isn't the first time the Spanish postal service has sought to make a statement on social issues. Last June, to coincide with LGBT Pride Month, it issued a special stamp and painted its delivery vans and mail boxes in rainbow colors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/spain-criticized-for-unequally-priced-equality-stamps/articleshow/83047624.cms||---
---||Goa||Stimac to show faith in tried and tested players||Panaji: Igor Stimac doesn’t really like the word ‘experiment’, used by many to describe his approach during the two friendlies against Oman and United Arab Emirates in Dubai. While a new-look Indian team held Oman to a 1-1 draw, the 0-6 thrashing at the hands of UAE in the next game stuck out like a sore thumb. Expectedly, the knives were soon out. “As some of you like to say, we were not ‘experimenting’ in Dubai,” Stimac told reporters during an online interaction on Friday. “Experimenting is when you field players in different positions from the one they play with their club. Experimenting is when you change the system, which you never had a chance to train or use. We didn’t use the camp to figure out the team, because more or less, the team is settled; we have 10-11 players who are first 11 choice for India. Stimac tried 10 new players during the two friendlies in Dubai in March, largely having a look at the youngsters who caught the eye in the Indian Super League (ISL). Now, as India prepare for the remaining Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers in Qatar next month, many youngsters are still around, but they are unlikely to play a significant role in the campaign. “I am not sure if one of them (young players) will be used in the game because we need experienced players. It may happen that none of them get a chance to play. They are gaining experience here. They are learning what I expect from them on the pitch,” said Stimac. From among the 28 players who are in Qatar, Glan Martins is the only new face. The FC Goa midfielder impressed during the AFC Champions League and is expected to be handed his international debut, playing alongside either Rowllin Borges or Anirudh Thapa. Martins is also among the few players who remained active till last month. With the ISL ending on March 13 and some players without a competitive game for more than three months, Stimac now has a battle on his hands to get the players ready. “We have a very limited number of players in a decent condition to play three games in 12 days. As you know, these players are from FC Goa and Bengaluru FC, teams which were training to compete in Asian competitions (like ACL and AFC Cup). “Spending 10 days here before playing three games is not enough to provide the football everyone is expecting. We are still in quarantine. We have to be patient, accept the situation and use as much time as possible in the evening (session) to have some training. It’s not easy,” said Stimac. In Doha, where the team is currently based, they cannot train in the first half of the day due to the weather. In quarantine, Stimac’s boys cannot use the gymnasium or the training hall for video sessions, while all meals are served in the room itself. “If I knew everything was like this, I would never accept,” said Stimac. “We could have also organised these qualifiers in India. We lost the possibility of playing two home games. We are not in great condition. This is far from a proper preparation for World Cup qualifiers, but it is what it is.” India will take on the might of Asian champions Qatar in their first game on June 3, before facing Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stimac-to-show-faith-in-tried-and-tested-players/articleshow/83047630.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Palestinian killed by Israeli troops in West Bank protest||JERUSALEM: A Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli troops on Friday during a protest against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, health officials said. The protest erupted over a settlement outpost near the town of Beita _ one of dozens dotting hilltops in the West Bank in what Palestinians see as an ongoing Israeli land grab. Several hundred Palestinians gathered on the hilltop. Dozens burned tires and threw stones at soldiers who fired live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a 26-year-old Palestinian man was killed by army fire and that five protesters were injured, including two by live fire. The Israeli military did not immediately issue a statement on the shooting. The clash came at a time of heightened tensions following an 11-day war between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip. More than 250 people, the vast majority Palestinians, were killed in the war which ended a week ago. During the fighting, Gaza militants fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel, while Israel bombed hundreds of targets linked to militants in Gaza.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/palestinian-killed-by-israeli-troops-in-west-bank-protest/articleshow/83047900.cms||---
---||Business||Mehul Choksi to be charged for entering Dominica 'illegally'||NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi, who was captured from Dominica on Wednesday, has been charged for entering the island nation "illegally", the local media reported on Friday. According to Antigua News Room, Choksi has been charged for his "illegal entry into Dominica". The court's decision came while it was hearing a habeas corpus plea filed by Choksi's lawyers. Choksi, who is wanted in India by the CBI and the ED for the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case, went missing from Antigua and Barbuda on Sunday, sparking a massive manhunt. He was captured in Dominica on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Choksi's lawyer in India, Vijay Agarwal, told IANS, "Upon the filing of the habeas corpus petition titled 'Mehul Choksi vs Attorney general of Commonwealth of Dominica and Chief of Police', a Dominica court has ordered a restraint on removing Choksi from the land of Dominica until further order." On Thursday night, Agarwal had said that Choksi was forced to get into a vessel from Antigua and was taken to Dominica. He also claimed that there were marks on Choksi's body, implying the use of force. "There is something fishy and I guess it was a strategy to take him to another place so that there are chances of sending him back to India. So I don't know what forces are operating. The time will tell," he had said. However, Antigua Police Commissioner Atlee Rodney has rubbished the claims of Choksi's counsel and said that they have no information on him being forcefully removed. On Wednesday, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne had said that the fugitive diamantaire "needs to return to India" where he can face the criminal charges levelled against him. Antigua News Room quoted Browne as telling journalists in Antigua and Barbuda: "We asked them not to repatriate him to Antigua. He needs to return to India where he can face the criminal charges levelled against him."

Twitter, which so far steadfastly refused to comply with the rules, proposed the name of an outside consultant, though this was summarily rejected by the government as they were not in consonance with the guidelines. The fresh move comes amidst raging debate over the new IT rules that has also seen WhatsApp move the Delhi high court over its denial to track the origins of "unlawful" messages, and Twitter accuse the government of "dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles". Friday saw a change as majority of companies came forward and expressed willingness to start complying with a section of the provisions. LinkedIn (owned by Microsoft), Telegram, Google, Facebook and WhatsApp shared details of their chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and grievance officer with the IT ministry. Having these officers is a mandate under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 which were announced on February 25 this year. Even Indian companies such as Koo (local rival to Twitter) and Sharechat have made the appointments. However, Twitter remains the only global player that is still playing hardball. The Jack Dorsey-co-founded company, which has been in the middle of a raging regulatory storm in India over a variety of issues, did respond to the government late Thursday night, sharing details of a lawyer working in a law firm in India as their nodal contact person and grievance officer, the sources said. However, the government rejected its choice. "The rules require that these designated officers of the significant social media companies (those having more than 50 lakh users) must be the employees of the company and a resident in India," the sources said, while explaining why Twitter’s nomination was rejected. Interestingly, Twitter has not yet sent the details of who would be the chief compliance officer to the government. When contacted by TOI over the development, a company spokesperson said, "Thank you for reaching out. We have no further comment to share at this time." Appointment of the officers by the majority of companies is being seen as an "encouraging step" by the government as it has faced flak over the new rules in recent times. In the face of Twitter’s criticism that it was overreaching its executive powers, the government has emphasised that "protecting free speech in India is not the prerogative of only a private, for-profit, foreign entity like Twitter". Also, it has clarified that the new IT rules only empower ordinary users of social media when they become victims of abuse and misuse. Twitter, however, has alleged that it has been forced to "withhold" (block in India) portions of "legitimate free speech" on its platform over fears around the safety of its employees and threats of financial penalties.

Usman Khan carried out the November 2019 attack during a prisoner rehabilitation event he was attending at Fishmongers' Hall. He killed two people and wounded three before he was chased onto nearby London Bridge and shot dead by police.  The inquest jury concluded there was "a lack of accountability and deficiencies in management" by police, probation and intelligence authorities overseeing Khan after his release from prison. They said authorities were blinded by Khan's "poster-boy" image as a rehabilitated prisoner, when in fact he was "manipulative and duplicitous" and remained a committed extremist.  Inquests are held in Britain to establish the facts in cases of violent or unexplained deaths. The jury concluded that the two victims, Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were unlawfully killed.  Khan stabbed the two at an event run by the prisoner rehabilitation program Learning Together. Merritt worked for the program and Jones was a volunteer.  Khan was arrested in 2010 for being part of an al-Qaida-inspired plot to set up a terrorist training camp in Pakistan. He was given an "indeterminate" sentence that specified he could only be released when he was judged not to be a danger to the public. He appealed, and the sentence was fixed at 16 years. Like many British inmates, he was released after serving half that time, in December 2018.  A prison psychologist warned at the time that he was more dangerous to the public than when he entered prison, and provided a list of warning signs for authorities to monitor.  The domestic intelligence agency MI5 passed on uncorroborated intelligence to police that Khan was preparing to return to his "old ways" and aspired to carry out an attack. MI5 and counterterrorism police launched an investigation into Khan which was underway at the time of the attack, but Khan's probation officer and the panel supervising his release were unaware of it.  He was allowed to travel alone to London to attend the Learning Together event, where he strapped knives to his hands and launched his attack.  Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of British counterterrorism policing, apologized to the victims' families for policing failures and said the authorities "must improve."  "The stark reality is that we can never guarantee that we will stop every attack, but I promise that we will do everything we can to try," he said.  The jury praised "astonishing individuals," including other former prisoners attending the event, who fought back and disarmed Khan, using items including a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk displayed in the hall. Armed police soon arrived and shot Khan, who wore a suicide belt that turned out to be fake.  In a statement, the inquest jury expressed "heartfelt condolences to the families of Saskia and Jack, and to all who love and miss these two wonderful young people. They clearly touched the lives of so many, ours included."  "The world lost two bright stars that dreadful day," the jury said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/jury-official-failures-played-part-in-fatal-london-attack/articleshow/83049338.cms||---

It stressed the need for next phase studies and also for further data and studies to reach robust conclusions," the MEA said. The follow up of WHO report and further studies deserve understanding and cooperation of all," it added. On May 28, the International Council of Jurists (ICJ) urged the Director-General of the WHO to release all scientific and medical information regarding Covid-19 in the light of reports that coronavirus had originated from a laboratory in Wuhan and not from the 'wet market' in Wuhan, hitherto believed by all countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/who-convened-study-on-covid-19-origins-an-important-step-mea/articleshow/83049586.cms||---

The CM, however, said, “I told the PM to ‘please do whatever you feel is needed’ before taking his permission to leave. But we will probably not get anything at all.” Read AlsoBJP hits out at Mamata, says she’s put arrogance over public welfareNEW DELHI: BJP leaders, including several Union ministers, hit out at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday for skipping a meeting with PM Modi on cyclone Yaas, with BJP president J P Nadda accusing her of “murder of constitutional ethos and the culture of cooperative federalism”.She added, “The PM called for a meeting (in Kalaikunda). But I had a meeting in Digha that was scheduled earlier. So I went to Kalaikunda along with the state chief secretary, met the PM and handed him a report (on the damages). I also proposed two schemes. I told him that I had flown down from Sagar because he wanted to meet me and then took his permission to leave (for Digha).” BJP and the Centre saw events in very different light. Central officials said no one from the West Bengal government received the PM and he, along with governor Jagdeep Dhankar, waited for a while. No state official was allowed to make a presentation to Modi and the soft copy remained loaded on the screen without being used while the CM breezed in and out of the meeting after giving some papers to the PM, they said. Read AlsoCentre recalls West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's chief secretary to DelhiThe Centre shifted West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Friday to New Delhi and asked him to report at the North Block by 10am on Monday. The order, which seniors in the Bengal government said was “unexpected, unprecedented and reeking of vendetta politics”, came four days after theLeader of opposition in the Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari wrote on Twitter, “Today is a dark day in Ind-ia’s long-standing ethos of cooperative federalism, a principle held sacred by PM Modi. The way Didi behaved with PM reflects her dictatorial nature and lack of respect for constitutional values.” While Modi undertook an aerial survey of cyclone Yaas-ravaged parts of East Midnapore and announced a Rs 1,000 crore package in immediate relief for three states, 50% of which would go to Odisha, and the rest divided between Bengal and Jharkhand, the political drama held centrestage. However, the meeting at Kalaikunda Air Force base — attended by ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Debasree Chaudhuri, besides Adhikari — sparked a heated political debate. Though Adhikari’s presence was not objected to specifically, BJP said he was there in his capacity as leader of opposition. Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury was also invited but could not come as he was in Delhi. The entire schedule of the PM-CM meeting was coordinated with the PMO, Nabanna officials said. It is learnt that the CM’s chopper reached Kalaikunda around five minutes after the PM flew in from Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/row-erupts-as-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-makes-brief-visit-at-pms-meet-leaves-early/articleshow/83049702.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||World||French man in 40s killed after attacking 3 police officers||PARIS: A man with severe schizophrenia who had been on a watch list for Islamic radicalism stabbed a police officer at her station Friday in western France and shot two other officers before police killed him, authorities said.  The slain suspect was a Frenchman in his 40s who had been on a watch list for Islamic radicalism because of his "rigorous" religious practices, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. The assailant had recently been released from prison and was under monitoring by psychiatric services, he said.  The three officers were wounded but none is in life-threatening condition, the minister said.  The motive for the violence in the Nantes suburb of La Chapelle-sur-Erdre was unclear, but Darmanin told reporters at the scene that the man "clearly wanted to attack police."  The attacker was born in France and did not have any past convictions for terrorism-related crimes, Darmanin said.  The assailant, who lived in La Chapelle-sur-Erdre, entered the police station Friday morning saying he had a car problem, Mayor Fabrice Roussel said.  He then stabbed the first police officer inside the station, apparently took her gun and fled, Darmanin said. The officer was wounded in the leg and hand.  French police deployed helicopters, search dogs and more than 200 officers to find the suspect, and closed nearby schools and stores. When he was located, he fired on officers trying to arrest him, Darmanin said.  The suspect was gravely wounded in an ensuing shootout, and died Friday afternoon of his injuries, according to a police official. The official, who was not authorized to be publicly named, said authorities are not searching for any accomplices.  Police and ambulances blocked roads in the normally quiet, residential area after the stabbing.  Domestic security and attacks on police are a big political issue ahead of regional elections next month and France's presidential election next year.  Two police employees have been killed in France in recent weeks. One was an administrative official stabbed to death inside her police station near Paris in what authorities are investigating as an Islamic extremist attack. The other was a drug squad officer shot to death in the southern city of Avignon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-man-in-40s-killed-after-attacking-3-police-officers/articleshow/83050078.cms||---
---||World||Senate confirms geneticist Eric Lander as Biden science adviser||WASHINGTON: The Senate has confirmed geneticist Eric Lander to be President Joe Biden's chief science adviser, one of the last unfilled Cabinet posts in the Biden administration.  Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, was approved by a voice vote Friday to serve as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position Biden has elevated to Cabinet rank. Lander, who also is a mathematician and molecular biologist, was lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome, the so-called "book of life."  His nomination was delayed for months as senators sought more information about meetings he had with the late Jeffrey Epstein, a disgraced financier who was charged with sex trafficking before his apparent suicide. Lander also was criticized for downplaying the contributions of two Nobel Prize-winning female scientists.  At his confirmation hearing last month, Lander apologized for a 2016 article he wrote that downplayed the work of the female scientists. At the hearing, he also called Epstein "an abhorrent individual.''  Lander said he "understated the importance of those key advances'' by biochemists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna. The two were later awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  "I felt terrible about it, I made a mistake. And when I make a mistake, I own it and try to do better,'' Lander said. "I should have written those paragraphs differently to make my intention crystal clear. I have enormous respect for Doctors Doudna and Charpentier and the important work they've done throughout their careers.''  He only met with Epstein twice, in 2012, Lander said, and never requested or received funds from Epstein or his foundation.  Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said at a May 20 committee meeting that she wished Biden had named a woman as science adviser, but that Lander had pledged to work to elevate women and minorities in science.  Lander said in a statement Friday that Biden's elevation of the science post "made clear that science and technology will be central to solving the nation's most urgent challenges," including health, environmental quality "and justice for all Americans.''  Lander's confirmation leaves Biden's Cabinet nearly complete. The only remaining unfilled Cabinet post is that of Office of Management and Budget director. Shalanda Young has been serving as acting OMB director after her confirmation as deputy director. Neera Tanden withdrew her nomination for OMB head after several senators said they would not vote for her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-confirms-geneticist-eric-lander-as-biden-science-adviser/articleshow/83050319.cms||---
---||India||Centre recalls West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's chief secretary to Delhi||KOLKATA: The Centre shifted West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Friday to New Delhi and asked him to report at the North Block by 10am on Monday. The order, which seniors in the Bengal government said was “unexpected, unprecedented and reeking of vendetta politics”, came four days after the Centre had approved a three-month extension for the 1987-batch officer. A letter signed by an under-secretary in the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions reached Nabanna on Friday evening asking the state government to “relieve Bandyopadhyay with immediate effect”. The chief secretary was scheduled to retire on May 31 but CM Mamata Banerjee had written to PM Narendra Modi on May 10 — five days after taking oath as CM for a third term — requesting that Bandyopadhyay be allowed to continue for three more months because of the ongoing pandemic. The Centre intimated its approval of this request on May 24, four days before the new order shifting out Bandhopadhyay reached Nabanna. Bandyopadhyay, on a tour of Bengal’s Cyclone-Yaas-ravaged coastal zone with the CM, did not react. “It is not clear how this type of ‘central deputation order’ applies to IAS officers who have not applied for any central deputation,” an officer said. CM Banerjee, too, did not react immediately but people close to her said she was “clearly unhappy”. TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray asked “how low the Modi-Shah’s BJP could stoop”. “Has this ever happened since Independence? Forced central deputation of a state CS… All because the people of Bengal chose Mamata Banerjee with an overwhelming mandate,” he added. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu, however, saw no politics in what he said was an “administrative decision”. Central government rules say an officer can be deputed to the Centre or any other state and, if there is any “disagreement”, states must obey the Centre’s decision. The Centre had last year invoked a similar clause to transfer three IPS officers but the Bengal government had refused to release them. All the officers still serve in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-recalls-west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjees-chief-secretary-to-delhi/articleshow/83051115.cms||---
---||World||Malaysia imposes near-total lockdown after virus cases soar||KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's prime minister announced on Friday a near-total coronavirus lockdown in the country, with social and economic activities to be halted for two weeks to contain a worsening outbreak.  Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the decision to implement the lockdown starting June 1 came after new infections breached 8,000 on Friday for the first time, sparking fears the disease could spiral out of control.  The government earlier this month imposed a partial lockdown until June 7, stopping short of shutting down businesses to prevent a possible economic catastrophe. But new infections have climbed since the recent Muslim Eid festival, crossing 6,000 on May 19 for the first time and soaring to 8,290 on Friday.  This raised the country's total cases to 549,514. The health ministry also reported another 61 deaths Friday, pushing the tally to 2,552 - nearly 40% recorded this month alone. Malaysia's total cases and deaths have jumped nearly five-fold compared to all of last year.  Muhyiddin said in a statement that all business activities will be shut down June 1-14 in the first phase of the full lockdown, except for essential services.  If daily cases fall, some economic sectors will be allowed to reopen in the second phase, which is expected to last four weeks, he said. After that, the country will return to current controls, with all businesses allowed to operate but not social activities.  Muhyiddin vowed that the government will bolster the healthcare system to ensure it doesn't collapse and ramp up vaccinations.  This is the country's second nationwide lockdown in over a year. A lockdown last year badly hit the economy, and the government resisted growing calls for another large-scale lockdown but caved in after the runaway increase in new cases.  Earlier Friday, Senior Minister Ismail Sabri said many ethnic Malay Muslims violated Covid-19 safety rules that banned them from visiting each other during the Eid festival.  He said 24 Eid clusters have been detected with 850 confirmed cases. Many of the positive cases involved people who were asymptomatic, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/malaysia-imposes-near-total-lockdown-after-virus-cases-soar/articleshow/83051191.cms||---

The US is the worst-affected country with 593,288 deaths, followed by Brazil with 456,674, India with 318,895, Mexico with 222,657 and Britain with 127,758. The figures are based on reports by the health authorities in each country. The WHO says up to three times more people have died directly or indirectly due to the pandemic than official figures suggest. Here are the latest developments around the world in the coronavirus crisis:Pandemic won't be over until 70% are vaccinated: WHO directorThe WHO's European director warned Friday that the Covid-19 pandemic won't end until at least 70 percent of people are vaccinated, and criticized Europe's vaccine rollout as "too slow". The World Health Organization's regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said countries and their populations must not become complacent about the pandemic. "Don't think the Covid-19 pandemic is over," Kluge told AFP in an interview, while adding that vaccination rates needed to increase. "The pandemic will be over once we reach 70 percent minimum coverage in vaccination," the regional director said. EU backs Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-oldsThe EU's drug watchdog on Friday approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus jab for 12 to 15-year-olds, the first vaccine to get the green light for children in the bloc. The vaccine was "well tolerated" in adolescents and there were no "major concerns" in terms of side effects, the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency said. Blinken says US and India united in tackling Covid-19 Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday the United States and India are united in trying to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic together and Washington wants to make sure it takes action to help India with its current coronavirus crisis. External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who has spent the past week in the United States seeking help amid a devastating second wave of infections at home, told reporters while standing with Blinken at the State Department that India is grateful to the United States for strong support and solidarity. "In the earlier days of Covid, India was there for the United States - something we will never forget," Blinken said. "And now we want to make sure that we're there for India as well." Japan extends virus emergency with safe Olympics at stakeJapan extended a coronavirus state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas for 20 more days on Friday, with infections still not slowing as it prepares to host the Olympics in just over 50 days. Cases remain high and medical systems in Osaka, the hardest-hit area in western Japan, are still overburdened, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in announcing the decision. Malaysia imposes near-total lockdown after virus cases soarMalaysia's prime minister announced on Friday a near-total coronavirus lockdown in the country, with social and economic activities to be halted for two weeks to contain a worsening outbreak.

But new infections have climbed since the recent Muslim Eid festival, crossing 6,000 on May 19 for the first time and soaring to 8,290 on Friday. US says it is considering vaccine passportThe United States said Friday it is seriously considering creating a vaccine passport for Americans traveling abroad. "We're taking a very close look at that," Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said of the idea of special documentation for vaccinated Americans who want to travel overseas, as inoculation drives allow Europe and other regions of the world to start opening up from pandemic restrictions. The administration of President Joe Biden, Mayorkas told ABC television, wants to ensure that "any passport that we provide for vaccinations is accessible to all and that no one is disenfranchised." Britain approves single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccineThe UK has authorized for use another coronavirus vaccine amid growing concerns about a rise in new infections as the variant of the virus first identified in India spreads around the country. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says the single-dose vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson has met ``the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.'' That takes the number of vaccines in the UK's armory to four following earlier approvals for the two-dose regimens developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and Moderna.

The exemption, which will be available up to August, comes with the caveat that it will be available for donation to the government or on the recommendations of a state authority to any relief body. So far, this was only available goods meant for free distribution. While Opposition-ruled states and the Centre were divided on the issue of paring rates, they agreed to stick to the compensation formula to provide for less than 14% growth in states’ GST kitty. With the compensation cess — which consumers pay to provide assured returns to states — due to expire in June 2022, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the issue will be discussed later. Revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj said the state-wise details will be worked out and the Centre will borrow Rs 1.58 lakh crore, which will be passed to states on a back-to-back basis. Sitharaman said a group of ministers will be set up to look at the tax structure on vaccines and medical goods, with the report likely to be submitted by June 8. The fitment committee comprising officers had recommended a reduction in rates for a number of items, including oxygen concentrators, ventilators and pulse oxymeters. While some of the Opposition ruled states wanted zero duty, including on vaccines, the Centre has argued against it. While nine states wanted Covid materials to be zero rated (which means the entire value chain to be exempted, while providing tax credits to manufacturers), three states pushed for 5%. The Centre, however, said it was not clear if the benefit of lower rates on vaccines or other goods will flow to the end-consumer. “The question arose whether lowering GST will benefit private hospitals (the intermediary) or the end-user, the citizen,” Bajaj said, adding that Covid-19 vaccine is being purchased by Centre and states and GST on it is coming back to them. He said a similar question was raised during the meeting on whether lower GST on ventilators will benefit the patients or only benefit private hospitals. In addition, several compliance related relaxations were announced, including a reduction in the fee for late filers, as well as easing of the compliance burden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/panel-to-look-at-gst-on-covid-items/articleshow/83051460.cms||---

Of these, about 2.2 crore doses, including wastage, have been consumed by states and UTs, leaving them with about 55.8 lakh doses, it said. In addition, private hospitals have received about 13.7 lakh doses of Covaxin. Including the 21.5 lakh doses that are to be supplied in May, the total number of doses supplied and in the pipeline till date adds up to about 3.1 crore, the ministry said. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech, which did not divulge any production details, said in a statement that the timeline for manufacturing, testing and release for a batch of Covaxin is approximately 120 days, depending on the technology framework and regulatory guidelines to be met. “There is a four-month lag time for Covaxin to translate into actual vaccination. Thus, production batches of Covaxin that were initiated during March this year will be ready for supply only during the month of June,” the company said. The PIB release said, “Vaccine being a biological product of medical importance takes time for harvesting and quality testing. This cannot be done overnight to ensure a safe product…An increase in gross production does not translate to immediate supply.” The release also said, “The claims of Bharat Biotech having 6 crore doses is an error of comprehension among some quarters reporting the said matter.” While it did not mention TOI, the reference appears to be to a report in this paper quoting from company’s statements and government affidavits in courts, including the Supreme Court, to estimate that the company had produced at least 6 crore doses, of which only 2.1 crore had been administered till 7am on Thursday, according to the CoWin portal. TOI had waited a full day for a response from Bharat Biotech before publishing the report, but there was none. Also, what today’s press releases leave unanswered is the company’s claims made in early January, before the vaccination began, that it already had a stockpile of 2 crore doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-8-crore-doses-of-covaxin-supplied-so-far-says-centre/articleshow/83052169.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi to begin unlocking from Monday, slowly & with riders||NEW DELHI: After remaining under a stringent lockdown for about six weeks, which has resulted in the rampaging Covid-19 being reined in, Delhi will begin the unlocking process on Monday with easing of restrictions on manufacturing units in industrial areas and construction activities with labourers staying on site. Though cases are declining very fast and the positivity rate is down to 1.5%, functioning of markets and non-essential activities are unlikely to be allowed in this round by a cautious administration. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has in a way made the unlocking process conditional on following Covid-appropriate behaviour which will keep the situation under check. Factory owners and industrial area associations have welcomed the announcement but the capital’s traders and market associations have expressed their disappointment over the fact that there won’t be any respite for the markets which have remained closed for so long. The unlocking process was discussed on Friday at a Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting which was attended by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and senior officials and experts. All of them agreed on a phased and slow unlocking to let economic activities pick up and open up employment and livelihood opportunities. More relaxations will be announced in the following weeks after reviewing the Covid-19 situation and only after concluding that cases are fairly under control and the declining trend is maintained. “Week after week, based on public suggestions and opinion of experts, we will continue the unlock process, provided that Covid cases do not increase any further. If we see that the Covid situation is deteriorating again, we will have to halt the unlock process,” said the chief minister in a digital address to the press. He requested everyone to strictly follow all Covid protocols. Kejriwal stressed that more economic activities can be allowed only when everyone observes Covid precautions. “If coronavirus cases increase again, we will have no option but to impose the lockdown again. We do not want to impose a lockdown and we are not in favour of a lockdown. Even you would not want a lockdown, but it is out of helplessness that we will have to impose it,” he said. The city has been under a complete lockdown since April 19. A DDMA official said only asymptomatic workers will be allowed, staggering working hours will be suggested and thermal screening, use of hand sanitisers and frequent hand washing at workplaces are to be ensured. Random Covid-19 tests will be carried out among the workers. The government may ask the district magistrates to deploy special teams for regular inspections. A DDMA order detailing the standard operating procedure for this phase of unlocking is awaited. The CM said the government has to take utmost care of those belonging to the lower sections of society like labourers, daily wage workers and migrant labourers. “Labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the neighbouring states come to Delhi to earn a livelihood. They live on daily wages and in dire conditions. Such workers are found engaged mostly in construction activities and factories. It was decided at the meeting that both activities will be opened up from Monday, and for the next one week, construction activities and factories will remain open,” the CM stated. Kejriwal said that with the cooperation of the 2 crore people of Delhi, they have been able to control the second wave within a month. “There is no longer any problem in getting beds in hospitals and even the ICU beds are empty. Oxygen beds too are vacant. Quite a few beds are now also available at the Covid care centres. It is time to slowly unlock. Along with saving people from Covid, we also need to save them from hunger. We need to maintain a balance and check Covid while making space for economic activities,” he said. This phase of the lockdown is in force in Delhi till 5am on May 31. “With great effort and great difficulty, the Covid situation has somewhat come under control. But the entire battle has not been won yet. We should not lose all the gains by opening up suddenly. Thus, it is a unanimous belief amongst the experts that we should open up slowly and steadily," said the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-begin-unlocking-from-monday-slowly-with-riders/articleshow/83052183.cms||Alok KN Mishra

It may be recalled that last year, following a whistleblower complaint, HDFC Bank had sacked six employees. The bank was accused of forcing borrowers to purchase a GPS device from a specified provider. Ashok Khanna, head of the bank’s auto loan business had stepped down in the wake of the scandal. “An examination of documents in the matter of marketing and sale of third-party non-financial products to the bank’s customers, arising from a whistleblower complaint to RBI regarding irregularities in the auto loan portfolio of the bank, revealed, inter alia, contravention of the aforesaid provisions of the Act and the regulatory directions”, RBI said in a statement announcing he fine. An HDFC Bank spokesperson said that the bank was in receipt of RBI’s letter and would abide by it.

The announcement was made after Modi undertook an aerial survey of Odisha’s Bhadrak and Balasore districts which bore the brunt of the cyclone, and Purba Medinipur in West Bengal. While Odisha would get Rs 500 crore immediately, another Rs 500 crore would be given to West Bengal and Jharkhand, which would be released on basis of damage, officials said. The PM also announced ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased and Rs 50,000 to each of the seriously injured in cyclone. He appreciated the preparedness and disaster management activities by Odisha government which has resulted in minimal loss of lives. He said disaster mitigation has been given emphasis by finance commission by provisioning funds to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee met Modi at the Kalaikunda airbase and submitted a report to him on the damages caused by cyclone in the state. She skipped the review meeting with the PM in which Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Debasree Chowdhury and Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-grants-1000-crore-yaas-relief-for-west-bengal-odisha-jharkhand/articleshow/83052800.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Implement Beed pattern, refund crop insurance premium to farmers: Rathod||Yavatmal: Former forest minister and Digras MLA Sanjay Rathod has written to the Union agriculture minister to safeguard interests of farmers in Yavatmal, and refund 80% of crop insurance premium paid by them, in line with the ‘Beed pattern’. Speaking to TOI here on Wednesday, Rathod criticised the Centre and the insurance company operating in Yavatmal for ignoring the plight of the farmers. Maharashtra is a leading state in implementing Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana since 2016. Private insurance company IFFCO Tokio has collected Rs23,180 crore premium from farmers over the last five years starting from 2016, and paid claims worth Rs15,622 crore (67.46%). Farmers in the state paid Rs5,801 crore premium in 2020-21, against which the company paid mere Rs823 crore (15.8%) as compensation. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has on May 5, 2021, written to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and requested him to consider the proposal submitted by the state government to help farmers across the state. State agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse has also written four letters to Tomar, drawing his attention to the crisis faced by farmers due to the pandemic, natural calamities and repeated pest attacks. Explaining the ‘Beed pattern’, Rathod said the insurance company is allowed to retain 20% of the premium paid by individual farmers, and refund remaining premium to farmers. He said, in case the ‘Beed pattern’ is implemented in Yavatmal, lakhs of farmers whose insurance claims were ineligible for compensation would be benefited. In Yavatmal alone, 4,67,878 farmers have paid Rs168 crore premium for crops on 3,30,012 hectares. However, the company paid only Rs47.17 crore to 61,289 farmers across the district. As a result, 4,06,589 farmers were deprived of any benefit under PMFBY, which is unjustifiable, said Rathod. The insurance company classifies the district into 101 circles and 10 farmers are chosen from each circle to calculate the average crop yields and the income thereon. As a result, a large chunk of farmers are declared ineligible based on this crop yield calculation, said Rathod, and pointed out that states like Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Jharkhand don’t have insurance scheme for their farmers. The central government should permit the state to make rules for insurance scheme for farmers, Rathod demanded. He warned that he might lead farmers to the streets, like the protest underway at Delhi borders, if the Centre fails to concede the just demand of farmers to refund 80% premium in line with the ‘Beed pattern’. Earlier, sitting Lok Sabha member from Yavatmal, Bhavana Gawali of Shiv Sena, had taken up the issue on the floor of the House. She had demanded permission to the state to finalise insurance company, premium and manner of calculating compensation, and settlement of claims etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/implement-beed-pattern-refund-crop-insurance-premium-to-farmers-rathod/articleshow/83043979.cms||---

Yet, the Covid pandemic has proved us wrong. We seem to be as helpless, as susceptible and dying in hordes due to Covid now as we did 100 years ago during the Spanish Flu.At the global level, no parameter seems to differentiate its impact on people – parameters on which we judge the development of the human race as a whole or individual country like, per capita GDP, GDP of nations, breakneck processing speed, artificial intelligence etc. So the question arises - if we are still destined to die like insects, what is this development aimed at.We as humans will never accept that we are treading the wrong path. We will justify by saying we developed vaccines to counter the virus in less than a year, it never happened so fast in human history. Yes, we did it fast, but meanwhile, the virus mutated. We are still counting the new strains, not sure on how many the vaccine will work, or for how long, when would we require boosters/ repeat doses. We are still feeling trepidation when we hear about the forthcoming wave(s). We are fond of talking about human history but won't accept that human history is minuscule as compared to nature’s history and that 70% of the diseases we suffer from are zoonotic diseases, triggered by human-led destruction of nature and natural habitat, in the name of development. The development model destroys nature, new diseases break out and then vaccines are produced, prophylactic and curative medicines are produced and sold to masses, who had no role in the destruction of nature but pay the price. Manufacturers and traders of medicine/ vaccines earn wealth and GDP increases. The traditional and natural therapy are ridiculed, looked down upon as backward practices, weaning the masses away from them, making them habitual of artificial nutrition and medicines and then the same ‘traditional and so-called backward therapy’ is repackaged and marketed as nutritional products, as nutraceuticals to the gullible masses. Unfettered development destroyed potable water, made it scarce and then it was repackaged and marketed as bottled water. The thing as abundant as atmospheric air was poisoned and now even fresh air is on sale to premium classes, letting the masses die of diseases by inhaling the poison.We shall never accept that taming nature has gone wrong and that the fury of devastating fires, unprecedented floods, drying rivers, breaking glaciers, decreasing ice cap on poles are results of the wrong developmental trajectory.Will, the heart-wrenching visuals of families after families being wiped out; corpses lying for want of four people to carry it to flames or graves; living ones waiting for treatment and dead ones waiting for pyres/ graves; crematoriums giving a sense of mass havans make the human race pause and rethink where it went wrong in the pursuit of greed and satisfaction of ego. Or once the fury of the virus subsides and the lucky ones have protected themselves we will carry on with business as usual attitude? One can only hope that this pandemic results in a pause and the human race, leaving aside the thinking of being all-powerful and capable of taming all, makes a course correction and stops ahead of the point which will signify Hara-Kiri for Homo-sapiens.

Decreasing new daily Covid-infection numbers boosted confidence for investors. On the BSE, The sensex closed 308 points up, at 51,423, just about 2% from its all-time peak of 52,517 recorded in mid-February. After trading sideways for several weeks, RIL on Friday closed 6% higher at Rs 2,095. Surprisingly of the 30 sensex stocks, a majority, 18, closed lower, indicating how skewed the market was during the session. According to Joseph Thomas of Emkay Wealth Management, the buoyancy in the market stemmed from improving pandemic related conditions — broad indications that it has actually peaked out. “This gives greater certainty about the future in terms of the likely relaxation of lockdown conditions in the major cities across the country, and also a faster return to normalcy. There is also a renewed vigour in the massive vaccination efforts, as many state governments have started inviting bids to supply vaccines to ensure universal immunization, and as the realisation that only such efforts would ultimately kill the virus is taking roots.” Going ahead, on the domestic front the RBI’s monetary policy meeting next week, the rate of rollout of vaccines in various states and also the number of new daily infections would decide the market’s direction. The outlook of the foreign fund managers relating to India would also have some impact on the market’s direction, dealers said. So far, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in the domestic stock market at about Rs 3,400 crore, marking May as the second consecutive month to witness net outflow, CDSL data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nifty-hits-record-high-of-15436-as-ril-jumps-6/articleshow/83048166.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Govt set to retire two thermal power units in Kota||Jaipur: Two aging units of the Kota Thermal Power station with a generation capacity of 110 megawatt (MW) each will ride off into sunset if the state government approves a proposal for their closure. Set up in 1983, the units have completed their useful life of 25 years as per the guidelines of the Central Electricity Act and need to be closed. A recent order of ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) says if they are kept operational beyond December 2022, they will be liable to a penalty of Rs 10-20 paisa per unit of the power. When TOI spoke to Dinesh Kumar, principal secretary, department of energy, he said, “There is a proposal from the Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RVUNL) and the government will take a decision at the appropriate level.” Built with old technology and design, the two units consume more coal to produce per unit of power. As per the industry parlance, the heat rate should not be more than 2,600 kilo calories of coal per unit of power. The two units are consuming 3,000 kilo calories to produce one unit of power which is environmentally not sustainable. As per the MoEF guidelines, the units which have heat rate of more than 2,600 kilo calorie and have completed their useful life of 25 years, need to be retired. When TOI contacted R K Sharma, chairman and managing director of RVUNL, he said, “Though thermal power cannot be wished away as it provides the base load, we are going to focus on generation of renewable power, especially solar. We have sent proposals to set up 810 MW solar power plant. Once administrative and financial approval is received, we will go ahead with the projects.” RVUNL is looking at a future of mix generation of both its traditional thermal power and renewable energy to remain economically viable. Solar being an infirm power, dependent on sunlight, it cannot be produced round-the-clock like thermal. Even if solar power is cheaper, thermal will stay as a main source of power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-set-to-retire-two-thermal-power-units-in-kota/articleshow/83047862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Referring to Covid-19 pandemic, Singh said, “It is time to provide services to people and not to indulge in politics. Every person should rise above the party lines and think for humanity. Some people, unfortunately, are indulging in cheap politics even during this pandemic.” Tejashwi has been highlighting the “poor condition” of different hospitals and primary health centres in Bihar and also telling the people to look at what the NDA government has done for medical facilities during its more than 15-year-long rule in the state. Singh said Bihar would soon win its war against the pandemic with active support of its people. “In Bihar, Nitish government has once again presented an example of service and readiness. Under the able leadership of CM Nitish Kumar, Bihar has achieved first position in the vaccination of people in the age group of 18 to 44 years,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-neta-makes-veiled-attack-on-tejashwi/articleshow/83045882.cms||---

Purnia in northeast Bihar received 212.6mm rainfall between 8.30am on Thursday to 8.30am on Friday. Gaya, on the other hand, received 120mm rainfall during the same period. Heavy rain in Gaya caused accumulation of rainwater on the campus of Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH), the dedicated Covid hospital for the people of Gaya, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Nawada, Arwal, Bhojpur and Rohtas. The rainwater accumulated near mother-child hospital block, which has been made separate ward for the Covid patients. District public relations officer Shambhu Nath Jha said the water was drained out from the wards with the help of Gaya Municipal Corporation. In Nawada, incessant rain inundated several parts of the town, including Nawada collectorate. The Yaas-triggered rain uprooted several electric poles and trees, leading to disruption in electricity supply to Nawada town and several blocks. Drinking water supply was also disrupted as most hand pumps were out of order. Bhagalpur in north Bihar also witnessed moderate rainfall. Bihar Agricultural University scientist and assistant professor in the department of agronomy, Dr Birendra Kumar, 50-52mm rainfall was recorded at the weather station of the university. “Inclement weather conditions would continue till the end of this month,” Dr Birendra added. Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen has asked the block development officials and sub-divisional officials of 16 blocks to monitor the damages caused by the cyclone and provide relief to affected people. In Madhepura, incessant rain occurred since Thursday morning. Apart from waterlogging in different parts of the town, damages to standing crops of kidney bean and maize were also reported. The rainwater flooded different parts of the town, including College Chowk, Hospital Chowk and sub-divisional office premises where a few office-bearers were seen wading through knee-deep water. In West Champaran district, incessant rain occurred along with winds blowing at a speed 40-50kmph since Thursday evening. Low-lying areas in Bagaha Nagar Parishad were waterlogged. Rain-fed rivers in Tharurat area were in rising trend. Around 100 thatched houses were damaged. Mango and lichi crops also suffered damages due to heavy rainfall amid windy conditions. Water level in rivers like the Gandak, the Masan, the Bhapsa, the Kosil, the Manor and the Pandai also surged slightly. The rain, however, stopped at most places in south and central Bihar in the afternoon.

Students’ bodies in colleges and universities have started making a list of those impacted by the cyclone so that some relief can be made available to them and their families. Some colleges had suspended online classes till the end of this week anticipating that a big section of students from the coastal districts might face problems logging in. On-campus classes had been suspended in March 2020 after the outbreak of coronavirus and professors have been taking classes and examinations online since then. “For several students in the cyclone-affected areas, it has been difficult to join online classes. Many of them might not be able to attend the daily lessons for the next few days due to absence of electricity or net connectivity issues. Many who have to submit their assignments will face issues completing them. We must think about extending their deadlines and consider having a flexible schedule in such difficult times,” said Sujay Ghosh, a professor at Ballygunge Science College of Calcutta University. An official of Jadavpur University said the university will not only help such students in their time of need but also help them with resources. “The university has provided more than 1,000 smartphones to students who were facing difficulty attending online classes. Every month, accounts of hundreds of students are recharged so that they get uninterrupted net connection for their classes. This time, too, the university will stand by its students,” the official said. The Arts Faculty Students’ Union (AFSU) is enumerating names of students from every class who have been affected by the cyclone. “The students’ body will do whatever it can, but we will also approach our university for help,” said a student. Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration had suspended online classes till May 27. “We knew that many parts of the state might get affected and students might not be able to log in for online classes. We will help them in the coming days,” said a professor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/extra-classes-deadline-extn-planned-for-students-in-storm-hit-pockets/articleshow/83045793.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Waterlogged roads hinder access to Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: Stretches of the road leading to the airport were inundated on Friday morning, slowing traffic movement. Though cars were comparatively fewer as only a handful of flights are currently in operation, the waterlogging caused by rain on Thursday evening and Friday morning has raised concerns. Multiple agencies chipped in to drain the water by afternoon. Airport authorities and Bidhannagar City Police’s traffic department blamed the waterlogging on Metro construction around the airport, alleging it choked gully pits and blocked drainage lines. “We faced a similar issue two weeks ago when it had rained heavily. But then the issue did not lead to passengers reporting late for flights,” said an airport official. Cops said they called up multiple agencies, like Kolkata Metro and Public Works Department, to arrange for submersible pumps to drain the water. “We called up the officials and both agencies provided pumps. Although traffic was a bit slow, there was no major chaos,” said an officer. TOI had reported that ground work the last stretch of New Garia-Airport Metro — between City Centre-II and the airport — had started earlier this year. The stretch is scheduled to be completed by January 2024. “The waterlogging issues are teething troubles. We take utmost care to prevent any unforeseen incident and, in case there is any accumulation of water, we take immediate measures to drain it at the earliest,” said Metro CPRO Indrani Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/waterlogged-roads-hinder-access-to-kolkata-airport/articleshow/83045813.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Rainwater entered several households, hospitals and vaccination centres, putting a question mark over the civic body’s tall claims of pre-monsoon preparedness. Waterlogged roads and overflowing drains obstructed movement of people and raise concern of severe health hazard. The city received 92mm rainfall in 24 hours. Areas of Rajendra Nagar, Patrakar Nagar, Hanuman Nagar, Shastri Nagar, AG colony and several other parts of the city are faced with severe waterlogging situation. At AG colony, transmission wires were seen dipped in clotted drains along the road. Heavy rain and waterlogging restricted public attendance at vaccination centres around the city. Additional commissioner of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) Devendra Prasad Tiwari said, “The PMC workers are continuously pumping out accumulated rainwater from different areas. Rainwater is being drained out from waterlogged areas in 2-3 hours.” Arvind Kumar, PMC city manager, said the civic body has already deployed its pumps to drain out water from flood-prone areas. “We have also installed temporary drainage pumping systems at these places,” he added. Despite the claims of officials, visuals of waterlogging and clotted drains emerged from several parts. Most streets at Shastri Nagar had knee-deep water. Major portions of the vaccination centre at Shastri Nagar’s K V Sahay School were inundated. Neelu Kumari, an auxiliary nurse midwife deputed at the vaccination centre, said, “Less than 50% of beneficiaries came to the centre on Thursday. Even staff faced difficulties in reaching the centre,” she said, adding a vaccine kit with 10 vials can only be opened when there are at least 10 people to take jabs. Sanjeev Kumar, who had come to the centre to get his wife vaccinated, said, “We waited for hours before my wife was finally vaccinated at 3.30pm.” Dheeraj Kumar, a coach at Patna Golf Club and resident of Shastri Nagar, had a tough time draining out rainwater, which gushed into her house. “We kept our two kids on the bed and cooked food on the same bed. We face similar situation every year during monsoon as drains are not cleared on time. Even slight rain results in waterlogging in the area. No PMC official visited this area to check waterlogging on Friday,” he said. At Rajiv Nagar, locals said the civic body has been more active this time as compared to last year when it comes to de-silting the main drain. “The internal roads, however, continued to face waterlogging. The interiors of Rajiv Nagar are prone to waterlogging,” said Sanjay Kumar Roy, a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rainwater-floods-localities-exposes-tall-claims-of-pmc/articleshow/83045454.cms||---

Many trees were also uprooted as heavy rainfall lashed different parts of the state. ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar told this reporter on Friday, “The movement of special passenger trains was disrupted after a huge tree fell on the rail tracks between the Majhauli and Bettiah stations in the wee hours of Thursday. Normalcy was restored at 5.05am on Friday when a track patrolling team cleared the tree.” Strong winds uprooted another tree on the tracks between the Parasnath and Nimiaghat stations under Dhanbad division of the ECR at 8.35am on Friday. Consequently, the Gaya-Asansol special train (03546) was stranded at the Parasnath station for sometime. “A tree fell on the overhead wires located between Janakpur Road and Bajpatti stations on Thursday. Traffic movement on the Hajipur-Muzaffarpur route was also suspended temporarily due to the damage caused to overhead wires,” the CPRO said and added that lighting struck the overhead lines between Narayanpur and Silaut stations under Sonepur division at 3.45am on Thursday, thereby affecting the movement of trains for several hours. Incessant rainfall also paralysed traffic movement between Bakri and Karagola stations on Thursday night as well as Muzaffarpur and Hajipur stations on Friday morning. Altogether 11 special trains were detained on the Hajipur-Muzaffarpur route. The CPRO claimed, “However, all the damaged wires were repaired or changed and trees cleared within a few hours at the affected stations under different divisions of the ECR.” Meanwhile, the railways controlled the movement of the Sitamarhi-Anand Vihar (04005), Bhagalpur-Jammu Tawi (05097), Hatia-Gorakhpur (05027), Jaynagar-Amritsar (04651), Narkatiaganj-Raxaul (05202), Darbhanga-New Delhi (02569, 02565), Saharsa-New Delhi (02553, 02563), Howrah-Kathgodam (03019), New Delhi-Darbhanga (02570, 02556) and Barmer-Guwahati (05910) specials for a few hours due to heavy rainfall. Railway staff chain empty rakes: As fear of cyclone Yaas gripped the railway employees of Malda division under the Eastern Railway (ER), they chained empty rakes at the Jamalpur station on Thursday. “The railways often adopts this safety measure to make sure that empty rakes are not blown away by strong winds during a cyclone,” an ER official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cyclone-yaas-trees-uprooted-movement-of-trains-hit/articleshow/83045731.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||Vaccination trial for children to begin at AIIMS-Patna||PATNA: Registration for the children to participate in the second phase clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccine was made open from Friday at AIIMS-Patna. Around 80 children between the age group of two to 18 years will be selected for the trial, after their registration process and followed by a health examination. The move came after the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) granted permission for the phase 2-3 clinical trial of Covaxin on children. AIIMS-Patna has been selected as one of the sites for the trial along with other institutes such as AIIMS-Delhi and Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur. AIIMS-Patna superintendent Dr CM Singh said they are targeting to include between 70 and 80 children in the trial phase that began with the registration of a 13-year-old Patna boy, on Friday. However, all those who get registered will not be vaccinated. He said hospitals will get the RT-PCR and antibody tests done and only those who are negative or have not tested positive earlier will be allowed. The nodal incharge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said after the two tests, paediatricians will check the health of children and those who deem fit will be allowed. Doctors at AIIMS-Patna urged parents to let their children participate. Those interested in registration can get it done by going to the hospital. Rs 1,000 will be given to them as a travelling allowance. “Coavaxin is already being administered and it is safe. The Sooner the trial gets completed, the better it is for everyone,” said Dr Singh. The stress on vaccine trial for children is keeping in mind the predicted third wave in which several health experts have said children might be the worst sufferers. Even in the second wave, a large number of children got infected, compared to the previous one and data from the health department stated around 4,50,00 children and adolescents were infected in two months when the Covid-19 was at its peak in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccination-trial-for-children-to-begin-at-aiims-patna/articleshow/83045706.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Doctors administered the cocktail injection through the saline lock of the patient and within half-an-hour, the patient was discharged and sent home. The antibody cocktail shot became notable after it was administered to former United States President Donald Trump last year. The therapy is said to reduce the chance of hospitalisation by 70 per cent in patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms. Doctors said the method is not recommended for patients who are hospitalised with severe Covid-19. Currently, is administered to patients who are aged above 12 and weigh above 40 kilograms. The cocktail is made of two monoclonal antibodies that are artificially created in a laboratory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-19-patient-gets-aps-first-antibody-cocktail/articleshow/83044536.cms||---

On Thursday, police arrested one Yedavalli Venkatesh, a resident of Varakavipudi village under Thotapalligudur mandal in Nellore district, for selling a home-made concoction by calling it ‘Krishnapatnam medicine’. “The accused visited Anandaiah’s place earlier and tried to find out how the herbal concoction was prepared. When authorities stopped its distribution pending checks, he posted on social media claiming to have cracked the ‘recipe’. He was charging thousands of rupees from gullible villagers by claiming it could cure Covid-19,” Thotapalligudur SI Indrasena Reddy told TOI. Venkatesh, cops said, mixed some herbs to make the concoction and called it ‘Krishnapatnam medicine’ to cash in on its popularity. “It’s dangerous to consume such medicines. Even the Krishnapatnam medicine is yet to get a green signal from the authorities. Fake ingredients and other unknown adulterants can do more harm than good,” N Praveen Kumar, a Vijayawada-based ophthalmologist, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/one-held-for-selling-fake-krishnapatnam-medicine/articleshow/83044366.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Despite a glitch in the plant, which was rectified by a team from ISRO, the company has steadied the production and has so far supplied 250MT of liquid medical oxygen to various hospitals in south and central Tamil Nadu.“We are now consistently producing 30MT of LMO from one plant and it will increase to 40MT soon. We are likely to start producing LMO from the second plant from this Sunday and it will contribute about 20-30MT per day initially. By Monday or Tuesday, we will also get the bottling system ready to fill gaseous oxygen in cylinders. From about 400 cylinders per day, we will be able to fill 3,000 cylinders per day within a few days,” Pankaj Kumar, CEO, Sterlite Copper told TOI.As Sterlite increases its oxygen production, it is also worried about the “safety” aspects, since both “men and materials” are using a single gate to enter and exit. “When we started, the local administration permitted us to open only the material gate. Now, with the increased movement of tankers and trucks, besides vehicles carrying cylinders, I am concerned about the safety as both men and material are using the same gate. In case of an emergency or an accident, an industrial unit needs a second gate to be ready for use,” Kumar pointed out. He said Sterlite has so far invested Rs 25 crore in getting the oxygen plants on production mode and another Rs 10 crore for setting up the bottling system for filling gaseous oxygen. In addition, the company will incur Rs 10 crore per month as operational costs for running the two plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sterlite-to-start-o2-production-at-second-plant-from-sunday/articleshow/83045854.cms||D Govardan

Referring to Covid-19 pandemic, Singh said, “It is time to provide services to people and not to indulge in politics. Every person should rise above the party lines and think for humanity. Some people, unfortunately, are indulging in cheap politics even during this pandemic.” Tejashwi has been highlighting the “poor condition” of different hospitals and primary health centres in Bihar and also telling the people to look at what the NDA government has done for medical facilities during its more than 15-year-long rule in the state. Singh said Bihar would soon win its war against the pandemic with active support of its people. “In Bihar, Nitish government has once again presented an example of service and readiness. Under the able leadership of CM Nitish Kumar, Bihar has achieved first position in the vaccination of people in the age group of 18 to 44 years,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-neta-makes-veiled-attack-on-tejashwi/articleshow/83045877.cms||---

Amid reports that the third wave may disproportionately affect children, the committee would assess existing infrastructure, ICU beds and medical consumables at the hospitals suitable for children. As the principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, Prof K Vijay Raghavan, has recently made it clear that a third wave is imminent and inevitable, several states are bracing for the next leg of the pandemic. Maharashtra, for example, has constituted a special task force to develop prevention and treatment methods in anticipation of the impact on children during the possible third wave. Karnataka has decided to set up paediatric Covid care centres in each district. The Karnataka government will identify centres for the 0-6 and 7-18 age groups affected by Covid-19 in each of the districts. While asymptomatic or mild cases in children will be treated at ‘Fit Facilities’ attached to Covid care centres, serious cases will be referred to the designated hospitals. Meanwhile, as the daily Covid-19 cases are stabilising in Andrha Pradesh, the ICU/oxygen bed situation has eased at the treatment facilities. The health officials are of the opinion that the state may have already reached its peak during the second wave, and the situation may improve in the next one to two weeks. As of Thursday, about 800 ICU beds and 3,550 oxygen beds remained vacant at the nearly 400 hospitals currently serving Covid-19 patients. The number of patients at the Covid care centres is also on the declining trajectory as only 17,000 are currently availing of treatment against the 19,000 at the presumed peak a few days ago. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal said that the committee would submit its reports in the next one week after completing its evaluation and assessment of the existing infrastructure. “The emerging reports and experts are stressing on augmenting infrastructure for kids for the anticipated increase in Covid-19 cases among children. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directed us to make arrangements and start procurement of the needed medical consumables in this direction,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/govt-braces-for-third-wave-of-covid-plans-panel-to-manage-its-impact/articleshow/83044314.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

However, there was a steep fall in the number of daily cases as only 1,785 new ones were reported on Friday while 5,362 people recovered in the same period. Drop in the number of cases and increased recoveries have also brought down the number of active cases in Bihar, which on Friday, stood at 24,809. This is nearly four times less than the around one lakh active cases recorded a month ago. As per data shared by the health department, the total caseload is now 7,02,682. But with a total of 6,72,868 patients cured, the recovery rate is 95.76%.

The next day, the count went up to 26. Seeing how hungry they were, I knew I had to reach out to more that were starving,” said Nivedita Dutta (40). Thereafter, she started to feed strays in five localities, including Shreenagar, and near Khudiram and Kabi Subhas Metro stations. “Now I feed 125 dogs daily,” she said, adding that though she doesn’t plan to expand, she has decided to devote more time to the cause. The homemaker starts preparing the food — rice and chicken stew — from 6am. It takes her four hours to complete cooking 15kg rice. “The daily expenditure is Rs 1,025,” Dutta told TOI. After 10am, she starts to prepare food for her family, followed by household chores. In the evening, she and her group start to make separate packets of food for dogs to take to the spots. “We distribute the food between 7pm and 8.30pm,” said Dutta who uses her daughter’s bike to commute. Others have joined Dutta to contribute to the initiative. Now, around six-seven people assist her. “People like Surojit Roy and Arpita Majumdar help me in this endeavour, which has allowed us to reach out to more canines. Even 25-30 cats share the food left at the designated spots,” she said. “Several people not involved with our initiative have offered help to buy the food. I hope my resources permit me to continue the initiative throughout the period of restrictions in the state,” Dutta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/homemaker-feeds-125-strays-daily/articleshow/83045846.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

---||Patna||Bihar: Extend tenure of panchayat members, says Jitan Ram Manjhi||PATNA: Former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi has lent his support to the demand of around 2.58 lakh panchayat representatives in the state to extend their tenure for six months. Manjhi tweeted on Friday urging CM Nitish Kumar to extend the tenure of the panchayat representatives at least for six months as panchayat polls were deferred due to Covid-19 pandemic in the state. The HAM(S) president opined that the extension was required to continue the ongoing development works in panchayats. “Panchayats have undoubtedly played an important role in curbing the fresh cases of Covid,” he added. To drive home his point, he referred to the extension of term of Lok Sabha as per Article 352 of the Constitution during emergency in the country. “Similarly, the state is reeling under intense Covid-19 wave. Under such circumstances, conducting election to three tier panchayati raj institutions doesn't seem to be feasible,” he asserted. Manjhi's support came a day after the BJP MP from Patliputra and former union minister Ram Kripal Yadav wrote to CM Nitish requesting to take a final call on the issue after consulting all stakeholders. Yadav's reactions came after the functionaries of the Bihar Rajya Mukhiya Mahasangh met him and urged him to raise the issue before the CM, who can only take a final call on the matter. Earlier, RJD leader and Leader of Opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had made a similar demand. Tejashwi had said that it would be better to extent the tenure of the outgoing representatives to continue with the ongoing development works. Sources in the panchayati raj department said that panchayat representatives have started lobbying for extension of their tenure after the department started looking for interim options. The five-year term of the elected members of panchayati raj institutions will come to an end on June 15. After the expiry of the tenure, powers may be vested with the administrators appointed by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/extend-tenure-of-panchayat-members-manjhi/articleshow/83044584.cms||Ramashankar

HDFC Bank, under its Parivartan programme, will set up and enhance medical infrastructure across the country to assist the fight against the coronavirus. The bank said it has committed Rs 100 crore as an initial amount for Covid relief in FY22. This is in addition to the Rs 120 crore the bank spent in FY21. The money will be used to set up 20 oxygen plants attached to hospitals, three 100-bed Covid-care facilities, isolation centres and provide medical equipment & supplies to over 200 hospitals across the country. The Piramal Foundation said it will invest Rs 100 crore for Covid relief in partnership with NITI Aayog. This initiative will reach over 1.2 lakh people in 4 districts of Maharashtra and 20 lakh people across the country. It will also set up 100 Covid-care centres in tribal and rural blocks across India that currently have poor access to health services. The initiative targets providing 20 lakh patients home care support for asymptomatic, mild-symptom cases to reduce pressure on the overburdened health system. Chemical company UPL also announced that it has set up oxygen plants at eight hospitals in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Delhi. The company converted four of its nitrogen production plants in Gujarat, to produce and deliver oxygen to four hospitals in Gujarat and UP. Earlier, this month, Hindustan Unilever airlifted 4,000 oxygen concentrators into India to address the acute shortage of medical oxygen. The total contribution comes to around Rs 38 crore. HUL has partnered with KVN Foundation and home health care company Portea, to promptly make the O2 concentrators available to needy patients. Under what it has termed ‘Mission HO2PE’, the oxygen concentrators have been sent to some of the worst affected cities like Delhi, Lucknow, Bangalore, among others. While Portea has access to 3,000 concentrators, which are being provided free of charge to patients. The remaining have been donated by HUL to hospitals in nearly 20 locations across India. Besides, the company is facilitating as well as covering the cost for vaccination of its outer core of around 300,000 people including those who work for suppliers, distributors as well as Shakti Ammas in rural areas. On the other hand, Delhi based, industrial conglomerate JK Group, comprising of companies such as JK Tyre, JK Paper, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Fenner, JK Agri Genetics, Umang Dairy, PSRI Hospital etc. has announced its initiative ‘JK CARES’, (Covid Assistance, Relief & Support) - a comprehensive Covid 19 relief package for the dependent family of deceased employee across the organization, in which the group will make an overall contribution of over Rs 15 crore. JK Group chairman Bharat Hari Singhania said, “Safety and wellbeing of our employees is of utmost importance for us. As part of our value of caring for people, we have been extremely mindful of the need to provide extended support to the families of our beloved employees, who have unfortunately lost their lives. In case of any casualty of any of our employees, we will support the bereaved families on three fronts – financial support for the family by way of continuance of salary, education support for children and medical insurance for the family. All these support systems will be provided to the families for a number of years.” Under this relief initiative, the aim is to provide support to the affected families, in case of any casualty(ies) of the employee(s), due to Covid between April 2020 and until March 2022, thus covering both the waves of Covid 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-steps-up-health-infra-aid/articleshow/83048052.cms||---
---||Patna||Mob attack: Locals seek transfer of Baisi SDPO||PATNA: A group of people belonging to Mahadalit community has demanded immediate transfer of the sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) of Baisi in Purnia district for his alleged partisan role in the probe into the cases related to attack on them by a mob on May 19. In a letter to CM Nitish Kumar, the members of the Mahadalit community of Nijamatpur Majhuwa village alleged that they would not get justice till SDPO Manoj Ram was posted there. They demanded immediate transfer of the officer concerned to ensure justice to them. The development came a day after a team of functionaries of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) visited the village and met the victims, who were thrashed mercilessly and their houses were set on fire by an unruly mob on the night of May 19. One of the victims Shankar Kumar Rai said, “The role of the SDPO is not fair. We have doubts that we will get justice. Hence we have sought the intervention of CM Nitish Kumar in the case and urged him to transfer the officer.” Other residents, including Ashok Kumar Rai and Ajay Kumar Rai, who were also injured in the attack, echoed similar views. “The SDPO’s role is doubtful from the beginning,” they alleged. When asked about the allegations against the SDPO Ram, Purnia SP Dayashankar said that it was a matter of investigation. “We are focused on arresting the accused. Till date, 12 people, including the main accused, have been arrested,” he told this newspaper over phone. Altogether three FIRs were lodged with the Baisi police station in connection with the incident on May 19. The incident is stated to be a fall out of a dispute over a plot of land on which the members of Mahadalit community had been living for several years. Around 450 families resided at the Mahadalit Tola. However, a section of people belonging to minority community alleged that the members of Mahadalit community had encroached upon a portion of private land and set up temporary houses. The trouble started when a minor scuffle took place between the two rival groups on April 24. Subsequently, an FIR was lodged by one Lakkhi Devi against 13 people from the minority community for burning down her house which was under construction and misbehaving with her. In the counter FIR lodged on the same day, one Md Sabbir accused 31 members of Mahadalit community of encroachment and assault among other charges. However, the situation turned for worse on May 19 when 13 houses of Mahadalit community were set on fire after being attacked with iron rods, sticks and other traditional weapons. The Purnia SP said that the SHO of Baisi police station Amit Kumar has already been put under suspension and departmental proceedings initiated against him for dereliction of duty and ‘mishandling of the situation’. In addition, a police picket has been set up at the village to instil a sense of confidence among the victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mob-attack-locals-seek-transfer-of-baisi-sdpo/articleshow/83044539.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Govt gets time from court to clear stand on quota pattern||PATNA: The Patna high court on Friday granted time to the state government for clarifying the pattern of reservation which it is giving to persons with disabilities, including blind candidates, for taking part in recruitment process of 1.25 lakh vacant posts of primary and secondary level teachers in government schools across the state. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar fixed the matter for hearing again on Monday after advocate general Lalit Kishore pleaded for time to come up with a clarification. The state government had published an advertisement for recruitment of 1.25 lakh primary and secondary teachers in government schools across Bihar in 2019. However, National Federation of the Blind moved the high court in February last year, challenging the recruitment process on the ground that there was no reservation for persons with disabilities. The federation had urged the high court to direct the authorities concerned to implement the category of overall 4% reservation for persons with disabilities against the entire vacant seats as per Section 34 of The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. It had also urged the court to direct the authorities concerned to implement 1% reservation for the blind candidates from the 4% reserved seat for persons with disabilities too in the recruitment process as per Rule 11 of the Act. The recruitment process is yet to be completed as the high court had stayed further process of recruitment on July 24 last year, observing that it should not be commenced or concluded without the court’s go ahead. Kishore, who was assisted by counsel Shilpa Singh, submitted that the state government has complied with the overall 4% reservation for persons with disabilities against the overall vacancy of 1.25 lakh posts. However, Supreme Court senior counsel S K Rungata and Sugandha Prasad submitted that the entire reservation for persons with disabilities has been made under different categories, which is unlawful. Kishore also urged the court that the state government be allowed to finalise the recruitment process and go ahead with appointments after keeping 4% seat reserved for disabled candidates against the total vacancies which would be filled up after disposal of the PIL. Disagreeing with it, Rungata submitted that the state government should first notify the vacancies as per the reservation for the disabled candidates and they be permitted to apply along with options to choose the preferable places of postings only after which final selection process should be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-gets-time-from-court-to-clear-stand-on-quota-pattern/articleshow/83044514.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The participants observed that to have inclusive growth, states need to be strengthened so that they are both accountable for delivering inclusive public services and in designing and implementing effective services and policies as necessary. Understanding why states are less effective is a critical first step, but finding solutions to strengthen states’ capabilities is also essential to generate higher rates of inclusive growth, they said. In the first session of the webinar, Drew Cameron (Yale) said there is a growing demand in Bihar to have access to municipal water systems, but the state is still not able to reach every household. Emily Pakhtigian (Penn State) observed that women and men demonstrate different sanitation preferences. “Eomen are more willing to have preference on sanitation,” Pakhtigian said. Uma Sarmistha (Florida) highlighted the positive aspect of door-to-door garbage collection and said around 50% people are willing to contribute for change in Patna. She suggested that a long-lasting sustainability can be achieved through awareness programmes at the individual, household and ward levels. In the second session, Ashmita Gupta (ADRI) highlighted the low female labour force participation in India. Clément Imbert (Warwick) pointed out that the rate of participation by women in the formal labour force is very low. “In the post- Covid 19 period (first wave), women dropped out of the workforce taking up more domestic work, while men took up informal work,” Gupta said. Deepshikha Batheja shared evidence from Bihar that it is not costly for firms to hire women, especially in male-dominated workplaces with adverse gender norms. Neelanjan Sircar (Ashoka University, Delhi) said it is important to reduce costs of transportation. “Investment in safe, cheap, efficient transport for female workers would improve the female labour force participation,” Sircar said. Harjot Kaur Bamhrah of Women Development Corporation, Bihar said the state lags behind in women’s literacy rate, where only 61% of women have ever attended a school. “Digital literacy should be prioritized for women,” she said. ADRI member secretary P P Ghosh gave a vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/states-can-play-key-role-in-economic-growth/articleshow/83044728.cms||---

With car companies taking multiple price hikes in the last 6-8 months, customers are looking at used cars to better fit tighter budgets. Already used car companies like Mahindra First Choice Wheels, Droom, OLX and others are seeing a sharp spurt in stocks as dealers build inventory. Inventory is already up 30% at dealership despite the ravages of the second wave. Enquiries have also picked up although no registrations are happening now due to local lockdowns. “The second wave of Covid-19 and fear of the third wave is anticipated to have a negative bearing on consumer sentiment so buyers are expected to be cautious about new purchase decisions and interest for used cars is expected to increase,” said HetalGandhi, Director, Crisil Research.For organized used car retailers the tell-tale signs are beginning to show up. “We have been witnessing a lot of trends proving that the financial uncertainty and decrease in disposable income have shifted the consumers towards used vehicles. For the first time, we crossed Rs 1,000 crore GMV (gross merchandise value) in March’21 and, 99% of it came from used automobiles. In April ’21, despite the second wave of Covid pandemic, we registered significant growth. The traffic on our used vehicle category has gone up by 100% in the last 6 months,” said Sandeep Aggarwal, founder-CEO, Droom.Used Retailers say dealers are already building stocks and in a supply-driven market like used cars that means the demand will follow. “The demand for used cars is likely to spike once the lockdown eases. We are working with our dealers to ramp up inventory which should be higher by 50% by end-June. Customer searches online for used cars are showing an increase,” said Ashutosh Pandey, CEO,Mahindra First Choice Wheels.With large parts of India under local lockdown, May has seen demand for skid sharply. However The prices of popular brands and models have shot up despite the dip in demand. On OLX, the average price of an used Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire is up40% while a Maruti Suzuki Swift is up 34%. “This is a temporary dip in demand and will bounce back in a couple of months because the demand for used cars continues to outpace the supply,” said Amit Kumar, CEO, OLX AutosIndia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/with-pandemic-pinching-the-wallet-used-cars-gear-up-for-sales-spurt/articleshow/83046061.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Although some states in the country are relaxing the norms, the situation remains unchanged for the industry that only last year witnessed a spurt in the demand. Sources said lockdown in major states has led to blockage of payments worth hundreds of crores. The unsold stock that have piled up during the lockdown is another worry that is giving cycle manufacturers sleepless nights, added sources.Harmohinder Singh Pahwa, a bicycle manufacturer, said “Recession has the bicycle industry in its tight grip and bicycle makers who are selling locally are the worst sufferers. Due to lockdown, business transactions have come to a complete standstill except for production, which we are forced to do so that our workforce stays back in the city. There is no scope of sales as even if in some cities there are relaxations as people are refraining from spending at the moment.”According to Pahwa, even if lockdowns end in other states, the situation is going to be difficult for at least one to two months. “Our agents and suppliers will be in complete financial crisis. Once normalcy returns, manufacturers will be under huge pressure to sell their goods to the same dealers who already owe a lot on account of unsold stock. In essence, we are investing hugely in making goods despite knowing no sales will take place.” D S Chawla, president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association, said, “Second wave has hit our industry very badly. THe micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector needs at par treatment with agricultural sector, which is given aids as grant and not as a loan. Some of the dire needs of the industry are waiver of bank interest on loans, deferring of bank instalments without charging interest, payment to the labour employed in MSME sector from Provident fund and other labour funds available with the government.”Chawla urged the government to take immediate steps to help the bicycle industry if it does not want to end up with massive unemployment and fall in amount collected as taxes.Harsimarjit Singh Lucky, secretary of UCPMA, said, “Payments worth hundreds of crores of rupees of Ludhiana bicycle industry are now stuck with dealers based in states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka and Rajasthan due to the lockdowns in their respective states. Government must understand the crisis that we are facing and bail us out by coming out with special packages, particularly for the MSME units. If not, hundreds of entrepreneurs will lose their businesses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/unsold-stock-due-to-lockdown-in-other-states-worry-ludhs-bicycle-makers/articleshow/83045738.cms||Mohit Behl

Damage to ‘boro’ paddy was also reported from some parts of the district. While makhana crop was found submerged in rainwater, harvested maize crops were lying on agricultural fields. Processed maize kept in open fields for drying purpose were found under water at several places under Korha block of the district. District agriculture officer Dinesh Kumar Dinkar said, “The district has received more than 200mm rainfall at several places till Friday afternoon. Jute crops in at least 2,500 hectares of land submerged in rainwater. Damages to the maize crops planted in 12,000 hectares of land were also reported in the district. We expect 5-10% damage to jute and other crops.” Dinkar added a survey would be conducted to assess the crop damage and on the basis of the receipt of the report from ground zero, it will be sent to the disaster management department for perusal and further action. Sweeti Kumari, weather scientist, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Katihar, said, “Cyclone Yaas is now getting weaker. We had issued an advisory to farmers on May 19-20 that heavy rain was expected on May 27 and 28. On the basis of receipt of weather forecast from IMD, we issue advisory to farmers from time to time,” she added. “Heavy precipitation causes waterlogging in farmlands of the region.

IndiGo’s Delhi-bound flight was the first that landed at Patna airport at 10.46 am after the Airports Authority of India (AAI)- Patna got the green signal for the commencement of flights following a review meeting of the regional executive director eastern region with the airport officials (including operations) and meteorological department at seven in the morning. The airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), Santosh Kumar said the flight operations were resumed at 9 am, following which no disruption in aircraft movement was seen on Friday. “As far as the rescheduling of cancelled flights is concerned, the airlines have merged few flights due to low occupancy in aircraft due to pandemic and lockdown,” he told this newspaper. The airport officials had announced the suspension of all air services on Thursday evening due to heavy rainfall, which led to the cancellation of four aircraft and the diversion of two flights. Altogether 18 flights operated at the city airport on Friday, however, no aircraft was diverted or cancelled due to inclement weather. Three flights suffered delays, including SpiceJet’s Ahmedabad- Patna aircraft, which got delayed by more than five hours while two flights of IndiGo to Bengaluru suffered minor delays. Several flyers had to face hassles owing to the rescheduling of flights and delays. Amit Ranjan, who was travelling to Ahmedabad, said the airline kept changing its scheduled time due to the climatic conditions. “Flight is getting delayed again and again citing bad weather, however, another airline’s flight for the same route was on time. In the Covid pandemic, passengers had to wait for 5 hours at the airport,” he said. Another flyer, Puneet Singh also suffered due to the flight delay, said, “After every 40 minutes, the airline rescheduled its time without informing the passengers about the actual reason behind the delay.” Both IndiGo and SpiceJet executives attributed the delays to bad weather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flights-resume-at-patna-airport-after-14-hours/articleshow/83045468.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Tata Digital acquires majority in BigBasket||MUMBAI: Tata Digital, a unit of Tata Group, said on Friday that it has acquired a majority stake in India’s largest e-grocer BigBasket, pitting the conglomerate head-to-head with rivals Reliance Industries and Amazon.  The BigBasket deal is the building block to create a large consumer digital ecosystem covering retail, travel and financial services by the Mumbai-based company. Last month, the country’s antitrust watchdog CCI gave Tata Digital the nod to purchase 64.3% of BigBasket. The deal, valued at $1.5-2 billion, involved the purchase of stakes of BigBasket’s largest shareholder, Chinese giant Alibaba (29.76%), and some others such as Actis (17%). “We just closed the largest investment by an Indian conglomerate in an Indian startup,” tweeted Mirae Asset Venture Investment CEO Ashish Dave and an investor in BigBasket. BigBasket’s founding team of five members including CEO Hari Menon will continue with the outfit to help major shareholder Tata Digital ramp up the online food and grocery business. The ongoing Covid pandemic has accelerated the growth of e-groceries as consumers seek the convenience of getting essentials delivered to their homes. The founders collectively own about 5% in BigBasket, which posted a loss of Rs 1,035 crore on a revenue of Rs 7,240 crore in fiscal 2020. Tata Sons director Saurabh Agarwal will be the chairman of BigBasket. Tata Sons established Tata Digital in August 2019 as the group lagged in consumer-internet offerings. With the BigBasket deal, Tata Group is now among the frontliners in the e-grocery space. Tata Digital had earmarked $1.6 billion for M&A and investments. At present, it is in the midst of launching a super app to bring Tata Group’s disparate consumer services under one umbrella. It is also in the final stage to purchase over 50% stake in e-pharmacy 1mg in a deal valued at $240 million even as it continues to be on the prowl to acquire more online platforms across consumer-focused services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-digital-acquires-majority-in-bigbasket/articleshow/83048096.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The Hajipur sadar hospital got submerged in knee-deep water, making even emergency services impossible. Plastic bottles could be seen floating in rainwater even at OPD and operation theatre of the hospital. Locals said waterlogging at the hospital was a routine affair during the monsoon. They blamed the civic body for the perennial problem. “Water from Sadar Hospital Road enters the hospital and nearby complexes due to poor drainage system,” they said. Hajipur civil surgeon Dr Indradev Ranjan said the emergency unit functioned from a different location at the hospital and work related to removal of water was going on. “All services are being restored at the hospital,” Dr Ranjan added. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, a Covid-dedicated facility, also had to bear the brunt of cyclone Yaas. Rainwater entered the campus of the hospital on Thursday night. The microbiology department of the hospital was badly affected. However, the rainwater was removed by Friday afternoon. At Jai Prabha Hospital, attendants of patients could be seen wading through rainwater. Rajendra Nagar locality, which has a large number of private clinics, also got waterlogged. Meanwhile, the RJD on Friday shared and re-tweeted several videos of waterlogging from across the state and problems being faced by the people.

---||India||India for more studies to trace Covid origin||NEW DELHI: In a significant statement that comes even as the border face-off with China remains unresolved, India called for further studies to determine the origin of the coronavirus causing Covid-19, days after US president Joe Biden gave his intelligence officials 90 days to probe the ‘lab-leak’ theory, much to the annoyance of Beijing. China has angrily rebutted suggestions that the Covid pathogen escaped from a Wuhan lab but the theory has refused to die down. The Indian move will not go down well with China which has been suggesting that the border tensions be seen as only a part of the overall relationship. The decision is another indication that India is not willing to consider normalising of ties as long as the border tensions in Ladakh remain unresolved. The stagnation in the de-induction at friction points is read as China looking for some “gains” or a “face-saver” after the mutual withdrawals at Pangong Tso. In a response to questions, MEA spokesperson said on Friday, ‘The WHO-convened global study on the origin of Covid-19 is an important first step. It stressed the need for next phase studies as also for further data and studies to reach robust conclusions. The follow-up of the WHO report and further studies deserve the understanding and cooperation of all.” Though he did not name China, the indication to India’s northern neighbour was obvious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-for-more-studies-to-trace-covid-origin/articleshow/83052865.cms||---
---||Goa||Euro 2020: Scotland-England clash at Wembley will be amazing, says Hutchison||Marcus.Mergulhao@timesgroup.com Panaji: In a career that spanned nine clubs and almost 20 years, Don Hutchison remembers his goal for country, rather than club, the most. It came for Scotland against England on November 17, 1999 at Wembley. Even though the goal was not enough to displace the Auld Enemy – as the Scots refer to their southern neighbours – in the playoffs and qualify for the European Championships 2000, the former Liverpool and Everton midfielder has fond memories. “We absolutely dominated England,” Hutchison told TOI in an exclusive interview on Saturday. “England had a really, really good team. They had some superstars with the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Alan Shearer, Michael Owen. Really a top side full of world class players. But we gave everything on the night and dominated in every single position.” The attacking midfielder is born in England but chose to represent Scotland, the country of his father’s birth. With his father watching from the stands, no wonder scoring the winner remains special, never mind that England progressed thanks to a brace from Scholes in the first leg at Hampden Park. “Scoring the goal was the best moment for sure. That was the first time I had ever seen my dad close to tears. I say close, because he had a little tear in his eye. I could tell he was proud. The winner easily ranks for me the most important goal I have ever scored,” said Hutchison, who won 26 caps for Scotland and retired after a stint with Luton Town in 2008. The oldest rivalry in international football will be renewed next month at the delayed 2020 European Championships. Scotland and England are in group D and will face off on June 18 for the first time since an entertaining 2-2 draw four years ago. The game saw three goals in the last six minutes. Nothing would be sweeter for the Scottish fans than turning over the Three Lions in their own back yard. “I was fortunate to get the winner at Wembley and the atmosphere was easily the best I have ever been part of. The national anthems, so much noise, the hair stood on end. Scotland players were singing the national anthem loud and proud. The England clash at Wembley will be amazing to watch,” said Hutchison, now a television pundit. Scotland have qualified for their first major tournament in 23 years and are in a group that also has England, Croatia and Czech Republic. They crashed out at the group stage during their last appearance -- World Cup 1998– but Hutchison believes it will be different this time around. “I think we will be ambitious. Scotland are in a tough group and we are underdogs to qualify. What we have got is an unbelievable team spirit. Steve Clarke has generated that over the last couple of years. “Other countries may have a bigger and better squad than Scotland, but when I look at Scotland's 11 to sort of 14 o 15 (players), Clarke will always have his best side. I am confident Scotland will give anyone a game. The England-Scotland game could be crucial (in the race for qualification). What an amazing atmosphere that will be,” said Hutchison. Scotland have 10 Premier League players in their squad. Captained by Liverpool defender Andy Robertson, they will be desperate to make a mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/euro-2020-scotland-england-clash-at-wembley-will-be-amazing-says-hutchison/articleshow/83073014.cms||---

This helpline will cater to the policemen, whose issues remain unsolved at the district or police unit level.”The officer said that the cops across hierarchy can contact the helpline number +918519324876 and may even send their queries or requests through WhatsApp, so that they are taken up at the highest possible level.The move is being welcomed by the policemen.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: LDF 2.0 soft on Centre in first policy address||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Marking a stark deviation from earlier instances, the first policy address of the newly-sworn in LDF government has gone soft on the Centre. The state government has been careful not to make any scathing remarks against central policies while suggesting alternatives. Despite the state’s repeated and stark criticism of the Centre regarding handling the Covid-19 crisis, especially the vaccine policy, the policy address by governor Arif Mohammed Khan on behalf of the LDF government made no effort to reprehend the Centre. Instead, the address focussed on the state government’s efforts to overcome the vaccine shortage. Stating that the policy of differential pricing of vaccines has put an additional burden of Rs 1,000 crore on the state exchequer, the address said that despite the fiscal constraints, the government has stepped forward to meet these commitments by floating a global tender for procuring 3 crore vaccine doses and also by placing orders with domestic manufacturers for another 1 crore doses. The state has been demanding that Centre should provide vaccines free of cost, and should also ensure that the companies should not sell the vaccines to Centre and states at different rates. On fiscal policies too, the address did not make any noteworthy criticism of the Centre. The state had been repeatedly criticizing Centre, alleging that it was trying to roughshod cooperative federalism, not allowing market borrowings beyond the set cap of 3%. The state had been demanding that the borrowing limit be increased from 3% to 5% of GDP. In the wake of the pandemic, the Centre had last year permitted the states to increase the borrowing limit, subject to conditions. The policy address said that though the conditions imposed are against the spirit of cooperative federalism, the state could achieve all the goals set by the Centre. “It is noteworthy that we have been successful in getting the entire 1.5% additional borrowing limit based on conditions relating to the power sector, public distribution system (one nation - one ration card), ease of doing business and urban sector,” the address said. Political observers and experts attribute this change to the need of the hour. “The only benefit from being in a conflicting posture with the Centre is political. The present hour does not need any such political mileage, and also there is a clear policy shift on the part of the state government. The chief minister realises and seems to be of the clear opinion that the state and Centre should not be at loggerheads especially when we are going through a crisis like Covid-19,” said G Gopakumar, political scientist and former vice-chancellor of Central University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-2-0-soft-on-centre-in-first-policy-address/articleshow/83045834.cms||KP Saikiran

Referring to the recent incident in which 200 people attended a criminal’s funeral, Walse-Patil said it should never have happened and told the police to deal with such instances with an iron fist. “People should not throng streets for any reason; such behaviour will not be tolerated. People must follow Covid-19 norms. The Pune police will take strict action against offenders,” he said. It was Walse-Patil’s first visit to the commissionerate after he took over the home department. He was received by commissioner Amitabh Gupta, joint commissioner Ravindra Shisve, and additional commissioners Ashok Morale and Jalindar Supekar. He further said he would ensure a fair and transparent transfer process, giving each policeman/policewoman an opportunity to suggest a posting of their choice. The home minister showered praise on the General Transfer Police Management System (GTPMS) launched by the Pune police, saying it would be implemented across the state. Walse-Patil reviewed the law and order situation in Pune city during his visit. He also visited the Bharosa cell — to study complaints received from women, children, and senior citizens in distress — and the crime branch to gain a better understanding of its workings. On the Maratha reservation issue, Walse-Patil said the Supreme Court ruled in the matter and said it was up to the central government now. He said the Centre will have to take a call to set up a committee to provide justice to members of the community by providing reservation in jobs and education. In a veiled dig at state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil (who called for an agitation), he urged politicians not to launch protests on the street during the pandemic to demand reservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/home-minister-tells-cops-to-strictly-enforce-norms/articleshow/83047981.cms||---

Hospital representatives said second doses for Covishield recipients in the 45+ age group were yet to fully start after the gap between two doses was increased to 12-16 weeks. The private hospitals in the city are daily inoculating an average of 3,000-4,000 citizens in the younger group since the last few days, while the number crossed 8000 on Friday, district vaccination data showed. Dr Sidram K Raut, director of Noble Hospitals, told TOI, “We are opening 300-400 slots per day. Around 40% slots are for the 45+ category. Vaccinations for them started from April. Many in this category still have some time before their second jabs. The private facilities continue to have limited doses. We recently got the first lot of 5,120 doses of Covaxin and will start inoculating people in the 18-44 category with first doses from Saturday.” Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, told TOI, “We re-started the drive on Thursday with 300 Covishield slots, which we increased to 500 on Friday.” Bharati Hospital recently received 12,000 Covishield doses and plans to open 500 vaccination slots everyday, including Sundays. “As soon as we upload sessions for the 18-44 years category, 400 appointments are booked within 15-30 seconds. This again may be due to the use of vaccine tracking programmes like scripts or bots,” he said. Vinod Sawantwadkar, CEO of Jehangir Hospital, Pune , said, “We recently started a drive to vaccinate Larsen & Toubro Infotech employees. Over 5,000 employees, including their families, will be vaccinated over the next few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-vaccination-sites-more-than-double-in-a-few-days/articleshow/83047996.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Two women abduct 55-year-old, seek Rs 4L as ransom; detained||PUNE: The police on Friday detained two women on the charge of kidnapping a 55-year-old woman from Camp on Thursday morning. The women also wrongfully confined her in a godown off Pune-Ahmednagar Road and demanded ransom worth Rs4 lakh from the victim’s brother to secure her release. Senior inspector of the Cantonment police station Ashok Kadam said, “The victim works as a receptionist at a doctor’s clinic in Koregaon Park. She was friendly with several of the doctor’s patients. She had collected Rs 5,500 and Rs 6,500 from the two women suspects and varied amounts from others on the pretext of helping them secure admission for their children at various schools but failed to deliver on her promise.” The officer added, “Around 8.30am, the two women forced the victim to get into an autorickshaw near Shivaji Market in Camp. They abused, assaulted and threatened her after confining her in the godown and calling her brother for money. The brother, however, alerted the police, who rescued the victim and detained the two women. The police are also examining the rickshaw driver’s role in the alleged crime.” Kadam pointed out that the women suspects had initially filed a complaint application against the victim with the Koregaon Park police station. “The application is pending for inquiry. The women later started making rounds of the victim’s residence and clinic demanding a refund of their money. The victim sought time to repay the money at the earliest but in vain,” he said. “On Thursday, the victim was at a grocery shop when the two women accosted her and started quarreling with her. During their argument, the suspects forced the victim into a rickshaw and drove her to Ahmednagar Road. The rickshaw driver asked the women why they were fighting but the victim allegedly did not say anything ,” said Kadam. The police are checking footage from CCTV cameras at the spot to establish the driver’s identity and question him. We have registered an FIR for kidnapping and wrongful confinement under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-women-abduct-55-yr-old-seek-rs-4l-as-ransom-detained/articleshow/83048016.cms||---

One of the deceased was a 49-year-old resident of Solan district who was admitted to IGMCH Shimla on May 22 with comorbidities of diabetes mellitus and kidney disease. The second was a 38-year-old man from Hamirpur district who was under treatment at IGMCH and also had ketoacidosis.

According to the officials, people should be vigilant about black fungus symptoms like headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, loss of vision, pain in eyes, swelling in cheeks and eyes, loosening of teeth and abnormal black discharge from the nose. They said that people with such symptoms should report immediately to the treating doctor to ensure their timely treatment and cure.

The bank was set up by Manoj Sengar, chairman of Yug Dadhichi Sansthan, at Bhairav Ghat in 2014. There are no charges and the Sansthan only gives a card to the family which bears the locker number for claiming ashes. The bank also preserves the ashes that remain unclaimed. A group of volunteers of the bank says this unusually high number of ashes are a result of a spike in the number of deaths due to Covid-19 infection, coupled with lockdown restrictions because of which people have not been able to travel to Kanpur and immerse the ashes. Dhani Rao Baudh Panther, a social worker who voluntarily performs last rituals of unclaimed bodies, told TOI that the lockers had never been so full. “As per Hindu rituals, the ashes must be immersed on the tenth day, but the kin are not turning up either due to fear of contracting the deadly disease or due to the stringent lockdown rules. The lockers at present are being occupied by 2,394 urns containing ashes. Out of which 500 urns of ashes occupied the lockers during the first wave, and nearly 1,894 urns of ashes during the second wave of Covid. At the moment we are running short of space and have started preserving ashes in the open cement almirahs outside the crematorium,” said Panther further. “Many of the kin of the deceased, who had died due to Covid, and whom we contacted and pleaded to collect and immerse the ashes of their near and dear ones, instead citing fear of contracting corona disease, requested us to complete the rituals of the dead. A few didn’t even respond to our calls,” said another volunteer of the bank. He added, “A few others pleaded helplessness and said that they are unable to come to Kanpur due to the lockdown.” Chief engineer (mechanical), Kanpur Nagar Nigam R K Pal, who is in-charge of the electric crematorium at Bhairav Ghat, told reporters, “If the family members of the dead will not turn up for long to claim ashes, ‘bhu-visarjan’ of the ashes would be done soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ashes-of-over-2k-dead-peopleawait-visarjan-in-kanpur/articleshow/83048311.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

She further said that the university is equally sensitive towards the presently enrolled students of the university and would also come up with a positive decision in terms of a situation wherein our present student has met with a similar unfortunate circumstance and lost the earning member of the family. “The student could be facing a problem of how to manage the fee for next semester or year. We would be helping such students too,” said Prof Singh. The VC further informed TOI that soon the issue would be approved through the Academic Council (AC) and the Executive Council (EC) of the open university and would be implemented. “Once this is approved by the two decision making bodies of the university, anyone who falls in the category and wants to pursue any academic course from the university can take admission, which would be free,” said the VC.

---||Pune||Pune: Jabs near home for senior citizens to start soon||PUNE: The Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres initiative for the elderly and citizens with different ablities will start in the city in the next few days. Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), told TOI on Friday that proposals on tie-ups between two groups, Oyster N Pearl with Prism Society in Aundh as well as Noble Hospital with Magarpatta Township, have been approved for community-based approach of vaccinations. As part of the plan, sessions could be conducted in non-health facility-based settings and nearer to home. “The hospitals tying up with the societies will also be responsible for ensuring availability of adequate medical infrastructure, vaccinators and other medical personnel at the site to take care of any possible adverse events following immunization,” she said, adding that the Urban Task Force (UTF) would issue necessary approval to similar tie-ups in the coming days. “Vaccine stock purchased by hospitals from manufacturers will be used to inoculate the beneficiaries. The societies will be paying the concerned private hospitals for the jabs,” said Agarwal. The “vaccine- on-wheels” drive will also be gradually extended to people aged 60 and above and also those with different abilities in housing communities, she said. Dr Amita Phadnis, director, Oyster N Pearl hospitals, told TOI, “The aim is to enable vaccinations of maximum beneficiaries closer home, as many find it difficult to travel to far off centers, or get appointments. Separate sessions for this target population will be created on Co-WIN.” Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “The tie-up will include vaccinating the target population, among others. We have our polyclinics in Magarpatta township, apart from a big community hall, where the vaccinations will be conducted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jabs-near-home-for-senior-citizens-to-start-soon/articleshow/83048070.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kochi||Lakshadweep: Kerala high court refuses to issue stay on new regulations||KOCHI: The high court on Friday refused to stay implementation of the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation 2021 (LDAR) and Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA) introduced by Lakshadweep Administration. A division bench of Justice K Vinod Chandran asked Lakshadweep Administration to respond to a petition challenging LDAR and PASA, filed by Congress leader KP Noushad Ali, within two weeks. At the hearing, the central government sought time to respond to the plea and the court allowed two weeks. Though the petitioner’s counsel sought a directive to Lakshadweep administration not to implement anything until then, the court did not agree. It is alleged by the petitioner that the Administration is illegally interfering in the social, political, and cultural realities of the island. LDAR is widely opposed by residents as it would allow the administration to remove or usurp the small holdings of the islanders, who belong to the scheduled tribe. Powers being vested upon the Lakshadweep Development Authority through LDAR would affect their right to life and livelihood. PASA gives the power to the government to detain a person up to a year. The actions of the current administration lack consideration to the people of the island with regard to their choices of food, culture, and livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-hc-refuses-to-issue-stay-on-new-regulations/articleshow/83045920.cms||---
---||Allahabad||HC seeks Uttar Pradesh government reply in plea on missing IPS officer||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the state government to file counter affidavit (reply) in response to a habeas corpus writ petition seeking production of Mani Lal Patidar, IPS officer and ex-superintendent of police, Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh. A request has also been made to initiate investigation in the matter of Patidar through Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as according to the petition he had been missing and is not traceable. It was alleged in this petition filed by advocate Dr Mukut Nath Varma, that Patidar, who is a 2014 batch IPS officer, had been conducting operations against mining mafia and in connection therewith his relations with certain sections in the administration got sour. As a result, he was falsely implicated in a few cases. It was the apprehension of the petitioner that the state respondents, who are high-ranking officials in the state administration, might have done something foul as a consequence whereof Patidar has gone missing and is not traceable. It is also stated that he was going to unravel some foul play in the administration therefore, it is possible, his life may be in danger. By expressing all these apprehensions, including that he might be in the unlawful custody of the state respondents, this habeas corpus petition has been filed. Hearing the petition, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Syed Aftab Husain Rizvi observed, “It is not in dispute that Mani Lal Patidar had been in the police force of the State of Uttar Pradesh and was a high ranking officer of the level of superintendent of police, Mahoba. Such a person having gone missing for the last few months is a serious issue. Therefore, it would be important to ascertain as to what steps were taken by the administration including the investigating agency to apprehend him, particularly, when, on the own showing of the respondents, his anticipatory bail applications were rejected.” While directing to to list this petition on June 14, 2021, for the next hearing, the court directed the investigating agency, dealing with the investigation of the cases already pending/instituted against Patidar to file an affidavit stating specifically, first as to what efforts were made by them to arrest Patidar after tracing his whereabouts, particularly when the anticipatory bail applications moved by Patidar were rejected. Secondly, whether any complaint or representation has been received at any level from the family members of Patidar of him having become untraceable, if so, what action was taken on such a complaint. Thirdly, whether the investigating agency has put on surveillance the mobile numbers known to have been used by Patidar to get in touch with his relatives, friends, counsels, if so, where his last location was found. Fourthly, whether the statements of family members of Patidar have been recorded to ascertain his whereabouts, if so, the nature of those statements shall be disclosed. Fifthly, whether any coercive steps were taken, such as under Section 82/83 Cr.P.C., to secure the arrest/presence of Patidar, if so, the same shall be disclosed. However, opposing the petition, additional advocate general (AAG), Manish Goyal submitted that since Patidar is trying to evade his arrest in cases in which he has been implicated, to malign the administration, this habeas corpus petition has been filed with an oblique purpose. He also submitted that various allegations have been made in the habeas corpus petition by the petitioner, who is an advocate, of which he has no personal knowledge, therefore no cognizance should be taken by the court of those allegations. He, however, could not tell the whereabouts of Patidar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-up-govt-reply-in-plea-on-missing-ips-officer/articleshow/83045017.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh minister writes letter to Union minister to approve Kanpur’s Ring Road project||KANPUR: Industry minister Satish Mahana has written a letter to Union minister for national highways and road transport Nitin Gadkari requesting him to approve the Kanpur’s Ring Road project at the earliest. Recently, the land acquisition committee of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) gave its consent for the construction of the 93-km long Outer Ring Road project of Kanpur Nagar. Once the project is approved by the Union transport ministry, the state government will sanction the funds. The industry minister stated in the letter that after getting approval from the Union ministry for transport, he would convene a meeting with officials of the public works department, Kanpur Development Authority (KDA), Unnao-Shuklaganj Development Authority and other departments to discuss the issue and provide no objection certificate for construction of the ring road. The Ring Road project will play a significant role in solving the city’s road jam problem. The industry minister hoped that the Union ministry would give its approval to the project by next month. “I will also discuss the issue with deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya so that all issues can be resolved in time and the land acquisition process can be initiated in time”, Mahana said. The 105-km long Ring Road project was initiated in 2012. The district administration prepared its project report last year. After physical examinations of the route by the district officials, including the divisional commissioner, the length of the project was reduced to 13 km in order to curtail its cost. The Ring Road will be constructed on 560 hectare of land. A sum of Rs 2609.06 crore will be spent on land acquisition and Rs 2573.31 on road construction. Thus, the total cost of the project will be Rs 5182.3 crore. According to sources, when the length of the proposed Ring Road project was 105 km, its estimated cost was Rs 6,080 crore. Efforts would be made to complete it within the stipulated time frame so as to save the extra cost, the sources added. Divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar will soon convene a virtual meeting with Amit Ghosh, joint secretary, NHAL, department of road transport and other departments in this regard. Sources revealed that the land acquisition committee recently approved the project. A detailed project report is expected in a couple of months so that notification for land acquisition could be issued in October or November, the sources further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/up-min-writes-letter-to-union-minister-to-approve-kanpurs-ring-road-project/articleshow/83048213.cms||---
---||Pune||Probe against school for LC over fees dues||Pune: The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Thursday wrote to the office of the deputy director of education, Pune seeking an investigation into a matter where a private school sent students a Leaving Certificate (LC) for non-payment of fees, and to submit an action-taken-report within 20 days. Since classes are happening online, the schools must deduct non-tuition fee expenses like the library fee, laboratory fee etc and take only the tuition fee, they said. However, private school managements are of the opinion that since they do not get any aid from the government, their entire system stands on the fee received from students without which they cannot pay salaries to the staff and also cannot pay back the loans taken to construct additional infrastructure. A parent said, “When the lockdown was announced last year. We told the school to give a bifurcation of fees so that we would know what we were paying for. The school refused. We sought an option to pay the fees in four instalments which the school did not respond to. We complained against the school to the education officer and there were enquiries. The school did not allow my children to attend online classes. We never said we won’t pay the fees. We just asked for bifurcation which is our right to know.” A month ago, the school sent the leaving certificate for both his children. “I had complained to all authorities and since March, was following up with the NCPCR. We got a letter yesterday from them which directs the deputy director to probe the case,” the parent added. The letter says the identity of the child or the complainant must not be revealed. Audumbar Ukirde, deputy director of the Pune division, said the letter must have reached the collector’s office but he is yet to receive the mail. “Once I receive the email, I will be investigating the matter. The issue regarding fees is not in my hands. It is in the purview of the District Fee Regulatory Committee. It can take cognisance of such complaints and take action. The three-year term of the previous committee is already over and there no new committee has been constituted by the education department,” Ukirde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/probe-against-school-for-lc-over-fees-dues/articleshow/83048109.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Rising Recovery Impact: Around 85% beds in Covid-dedicated hospitals vacant in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: With the recovery rate steadily nearing 98% in Sangam City, around 85% beds in the district Covid hospitals are vacant. Officials of the health department claimed that there was only 15% occupancy in L-1, L- 2 and L-3 hospitals till May 28. After witnessing a fall in the number of patients, district health authorities have now listed six out of 20 Covid-dedicated hospitals in non-Covid categories. The city now has one Covid Level-1, 12 Level-2 and and one Level-3 hospitals. Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer Dr Rishi Sahai told TOI, “After a notable fall in the number of Covid patients, we have a capacity of around 2,000 beds in 14 Covid-dedicated hospitals in the district, including four government and 10 private hospitals.” He added, “We have a total of 1,440 beds with oxygen facility and the average occupancy of these beds was 22% till last week. Similarly, we have as many as 425 ICU beds, and their average occupany was 18% till last week. Besides, there are several normal beds dedicated to Covid patients.” Since there has been a significant decline in the number of Covid patients and the recovery rate is inching to 98%, the availability of beds in the district Covid hospitals touched 85% for the first time during the second wave on Friday. Dr Sahai, meanwhile, said, “We prepared a list of Covid patients from all 20 Covid-dedicated hospitals. Of these, six hospitals, which only had one or two Covid patients, have been shifted to the non-Covid category. The Covid patients in these six hospitals will now be shifted to major Covid hospitals.” As per statistics, neighbouring districts like Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi have 260, 325 and 152 beds with oxygen facility respectively, and their occupancy stood at 22%, 8% and 11% respectively. On April 17, Prayagraj district recorded the highest 2,456 Covid cases in a single day. However, on May 28, the number dipped to less than 50, which led to the recovery rate nearing 98% in a month. This offered a major respite to the administration, health officials, doctors and paramedics. Besides, for the past three consecutive days, the district has been recording less than 50 cases—49 on May 27, 46 on May 26 and 48 on May 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rising-recovery-impact-around-85-beds-in-covid-dedicated-hospitals-vacant/articleshow/83045066.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Covid-19 brings air traffic to the ground, fall in flight ops in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country has harmed the overall economy, the restrictions and the fall in the number of air passengers have adversely affected the flight operations at the civil enclave of the city, located at Bamrauli. There has been a decline of over 17,000 passengers between April-May (till 27). The adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on air travel from Sangam city could be gauzed by the fact that a total of 31,230 passengers used the airport (including both arrival and departure) in April, whereas this number declined to 13,920 till May 27. According to data provided by the authorities of the Airport Authority of India (AAI), the civil enclave witnessed hectic activities in the first fortnight of the last month as the airport catered to a total of 17,038 passengers in the first fortnight of April out of which 8,636 passengers were from the very first week itself. This was the period when the Covid positive cases were slowly picking up in the city. Likewise, the numbers of flights, that operated for different cities in the two months also decreased. While 486 flights operated (including both which landed or took-off) in April, in the present month of May, just 284 flights operated from this civil enclave. Last month, there were around 16-18 flights that operated daily and on April 18, 23 and 25, there were 22 flights that were operated by the AAI. As compared to this, on May 17 and 26, just 4 flights operated from the civil enclave as all the other flights were cancelled by the service operators. This means that flights from just two destinations arrived and left from Prayagraj. There is direct air connectivity for different cities of the country including Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata, Raipur, Indore, Bhopal, Dehradun, Bhubaneshwar etc. The fall in the number of passengers can also be understood by the fact that last month (till April 25) there was either more or close to 1,000 passengers daily. On April 4, the airport catered to 1,500 passengers, which is the highest since April 1 till date. The pandemic affected the flights from Mumbai and Delhi the most. The worst affected days, in terms of fall in the number of air passengers, were May 1 (441), May 17 (260), May 19 (365) and May 26 (293). On May 27, a total of 503 passengers used the airport and 14 flights operated between seven cities while the rest were cancelled. “The flights have been badly affected during the pandemic but at the same time the civil enclave also witnessed history in making when we started operating direct air connectivity for Dehradun,” said regional director of AAI, Achal Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-19-brings-air-traffic-to-the-ground-fall-in-flight-ops-in-city/articleshow/83044989.cms||---

The situation should change. Industries and commercial establishments should be able to place a board in front of their premises declaring that all employees are vaccinated when the lockdown is lifted.”The BJP leader also refuted reports that the Centre is supplying a lesser number of vaccines to the state. “A central committee is distributing vaccines based on factors including the way the vaccines are handled and how many people are benefited. The state has received about 78 lakh doses for people aged above 45 years. On May 18 alone, we received 13 lakh doses. But they are not reaching beneficiaries on time. Only 650 people were vaccinated a day 10 days ago. From this week, the number of people getting vaccine in a day has crossed 10,000.”Vanathi said she is ready to speak to the central government if the number of vaccines falls short. “DMK cadres distributing tokens to avail vaccines are being partial. The chief minister should intervene and ensure that the tokens are distributed by government officials,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vanathi-demands-more-vaccines-for-district/articleshow/83048134.cms||---

Parvathiammal is also sick and undergoing treatment in a hospital.A rebellious youth turned devout Gandhian, Kaliannan has served as an MLA, MLC as well as a member of the Constituent Assembly. He was only 27 years old when elected to the Constituent Assembly.His grandson P V Senthil says Kaliannan was the last surviving member of the Constituent Assembly.Kaliannan fell sick a few days back and was admitted to a private hospital in Tiruchengode where he died on Friday morning.His remains were cremated with state honours.“I was saddened by the news of his demise. The death of Kaliannan, who had unabashed belief in democracy and spent all his life serving people was a loss to Madras presidency, Tamil Nadu and the whole of India,” chief minister M K Stalin said in his condolence message.“Though he was known as Kasthuripatti zamindar, he was a reformist who supported the abolition of zamidari system,’’ Stalin said.T M Kaliannan was born on January 10, 1921, at Akkaraipatti in Namakkal district and completed schooling in Tiruchengode. He was barely 21 and was studying English literature at Loyola College in Chennai when he joined the revolution against the British. His actions invited the wrath of the British authorities manning the college and he was sent away. It was during this period that he visited Sabarmati Ashram and met Gandhi who asked him to stay there for 10 days.Those few days mellowed down Kaliannan.Influenced by the ideals of Gandhi he participated in the Quit India movement in 1942 and subsequently joined Congress.He came back to Tiruchengode and joined the Gandhi Ashram. When he was 27 years old, Congress stalwart K Kamaraj proposed his name for the constituent assembly and he was unanimously elected to become the youngest member.In the first general election after independence, Kaliannan contested in the Rasipuram segment and won with a thumping margin. He went on to win two more elections as MLA before going on to hold other posts.“He was the only surviving former member of the constituent assembly,” said his grandson P V Senthil. Senthil, a businessman, recalls that when the zamindari system was abolished, Kaliannan gave away more than 1,000 acres of his inherited property.“He served as Tamil Nadu Congress committee’s vice-president and treasurer. All through his life, even as he held multiple positions, he worked for the growth of the Congress party. He was simplicity personified. At the same time, he would express his views with honesty and courage,’’ TNCC chief K S Alagiri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/freedom-fighter-congress-veteran-kaliannan-dies-at-101/articleshow/83048142.cms||---

While Tirupur logged 1,823 cases on Friday, Coimbatore recorded 3,937 cases and Chennai 2,762 on the day.

With 12 deaths registered in the state bulletin, the toll in the district has surged to 425. According to a senior official from the health department, the recent spike in the number of fresh cases is because of the inclusion of all the pending cases in the bulletin. “We have been taking all the necessary steps to contain the spread of the pandemic. We have noticed a decline in the fresh cases reported in the district since Friday. We hope the cases will start to reduce from now on.” He said they have been testing about 4,500 samples a day on an average in the district and the positivity rate remains between 25% and 27%. Since Thursday, the health department has stopped allowing asymptomatic patients to remain in home isolation. Instead, they will be lodged at the interim Covid care centres (ICCCs). Based on the outcome of the RT-PCR results, they will be moved to the Covid care centre (ICC) or hospitals. The district has 18 ICCCs - five in the corporation limit and 13 in rural areas - and 10 CCCs with more than 100 beds. According to the state media bulletin, the district has only 131 vacant beds – just six oxygen beds and 125 normal beds – in its hospital and no ICU beds are available. The total number of beds in the district is 943 oxygen beds, 764 normal beds and 214 ICU beds. Similarly, of the 1,067 beds in CCCs, 625 beds are currently occupied.

The facility, which was set up with the help of NGOs on the hospital premises about 10 days ago, has about 20 beds and 10 oxygen concentrators. It was set up to temporarily accommodate the patients till the time of admission. Officials refuse the allegations and claim that only one patient is allotted per bed and they have sufficient infrastructure to accommodate the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tirupur-retains-3rd-spot-in-caseload/articleshow/83048116.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, who is the Reviewing Officer for the Passing Out Parade of NDA’s 140th course, performed a set of push ups with cadets during a visit to his parent squadron, ‘Hunter’. Joining Singh was NDA Commandant Lieutenant General Asit Mistry. “The Navy chief visited his parent squadron ‘Hunter’ today at the academy. During his interaction with cadets there, he asked them ‘how do you celebrate victory call of the squadron?’, ‘By doing push-ups’, was the answer from assembled cadets. Singh then said, ‘let’s do the push-ups’,” Mistry said, “It was a completely impromptu suggestion and so, we did a set of push-ups in our ceremonial uniforms.” Mistry said the cadets would be inspired by this rare moment. “The cadets are full of ‘josh’ and enthusiasm to remain fit through their military career. Even at this age, we are fit. They can also remain fit,” Mistry added. In pictures which went on viral on social media, other military officers, who were present at the squadron, also joined the senior officers. Singh (61) belongs to the 56th course of the NDA and passed out from the academy in 1979.

To overcome such a crisis, the city would need 944 metric tonnes of oxygen daily to be shared between hospitals and refillers, mentioned the report filed in Delhi high court on Friday. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked Delhi government to file a chart within four weeks indicating the timeline within which several steps could be implemented based on the recommendations. The court identified one of the findings of the report as crucial that apart from decentralised plants, oxygen generation units could be set up by the government at various locations and hospitals. Coronavirus live updates  “We are dealing with a once-in-a-century pandemic... To go by historical evidence, the last pandemic was in 1920. Setting up of an oxygen manufacturing plant would go a long way. You should consider it as paramount. That will take care of so many things — storage, movement, evaporation,” the bench observed. Titled “IITD Review and Recommendations for Management of Oxygen during Covid-19 Crisis for GNCTD”, the report draws three scenarios in case of a third wave. The first scenario takes the base of number of infections, hospital admissions and oxygen supply volume witnessed during the second wave, the other two scenarios raise the categories by 30% and 60%, respectively.   A 60% surge in peak patient load from the second wave would be the worst-case scenario when the government must tackle substantial increase in the demand of medical oxygen and prevent delay and disruption in the supply by manufacturers. During the hearing, professor Sanjay Dhir from IIT-Delhi took the judges through the findings. Based on the data provided by the AAP government, Dhir listed some of the challenges for the state to improve the oxygen infrastructure of Delhi. He said ramping up of storage capacity, improving supply lines from outside Delhi, more Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants and removing shortage of cryogenic oxygen tankers were measures that must be taken immediately for efficient management of oxygen demand-supply keeping in view the high likelihood of a more severe third wave. Dhir told the high court that most of the liquid medical oxygen was allocated to 51 big hospitals. These could be made more self-dependent by maintaining a buffer stock of oxygen. He added that the approximate amount of storage to be maintained by Delhi government in the worst-case scenario was in the range of 200-370 metric tonnes. The storage capacity to be maintained at the 51 hospitals was approximately 250-450 metric tonnes. The report recommended increasing the number of refillers for oxygen, while hospitals could also consider setting up a local refilling station. On the crisis of tankers, the report wants Delhi government to procure 20-25 cryogenic oxygen tankers with a capacity of 20-100 tonnes to streamline distribution. It cautioned that the size of the tankers would need to be chosen carefully to ensure that they were compatible with various transportation modes.

According to an independent analysis released by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), districts, like Howrah, Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas and East and West Midnapore, are hotspots for cyclones, which have increased five-fold in the state between 1970 and 2019. CEEW uses data, integrated analysis and strategic outreach to explain and change the use, reuse, and misuse of resources. According to the study, storm surges have increased by the same rate during this period. Extreme flood events have risen seven-fold and affect more than 7 million people in Bengal each year, especially in Birbhum, Cooch Behar, Hooghly, Malda, and Nadia. The combined effect of micro-climatic shifts occurring in various parts of India’s east coast has triggered more cyclonic disturbances in the Bay of Bengal, leading to storm surges, incessant rainfall, and floods. “Two cyclones, Tauktae and Yaas, have struck India in quick succession in the middle of a pandemic. Given the increase in frequency and intensity of such extreme climate events, India needs to build climate resilience at multiple levels,” said CEEW CEO Arunabha Ghosh. He pointed out that first, it should create a national climate risk commission comprising stakeholders with statutory authority and publish periodic climate risk assessments. Secondly, it needed decentralised capacity and effective public information campaigns at the regional and local levels to sharpen response to extreme weather events. “In Bengal, the mangrove forests of the Sunderbans delta have acted as shock absorbers against previous cyclones and are the perfect examples of nature-based solutions of climate resilience. Preserving them should remain a top priority for the state and central governments,” he added. According to CEEW analysis, after 2005, the yearly average of Indian districts affected by cyclones tripled and the cyclone frequency doubled. In the last decade alone, 258 districts were affected. The last 50 years also recorded a 12-fold surge in the number of associated cyclonic events, such as extreme rainfall, floods, sea-level rise, and thunderstorms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyclones-have-gone-up-5-fold-in-5-decades-report/articleshow/83045925.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

Islanders posed with placards to protest against the new legislation of the administration and shared images of the same on social media as there were limitations on public protests due to the lockdown. Videos of residents complaining about the actions of the administration were shared on social media as part of the protests. “The collector told the media on mainland that there were no protests. There is no media here and if anyone protests publicly, they would be arrested citing Covid protocol. So, residents are protesting by writing placards and posting images on social media. Also, many islanders are sharing short videos that are being circulated online,” said Congress worker Ali Akbar. Akbar said 12 Youth Congress activists, who were arrested for burning the effigy of the collector at Kiltan after he referred to the island while talking about the alleged ‘drug problem’, were arrested. Akbar said that the arrested activists were observing a fast to protest against the arrests. Meanwhile, Twitterati, who played a key role in getting national attention for the issue, launched a campaign under hashtag, Lakshadweepam. Supporters posted images of lights in support of the islanders. Over 60,000 tweets were made under the hashtag by 8pm on Friday. In Kochi, political outfits staged demonstrations outside properties of Lakshadweep administration. Nationalist Youth Congress activists organised a dharna outside the administration’s office in Kochi. NCP state president PC Chacko said protests will continue until the administrator is called back. Chacko said he would oppose moves to sell Lakshadweep to private agencies. IUML leader ET Muhammed Basheer said the administrator was challenging democracy by anti-people and unconstitutional acts. IUML handed a memorandum to administration officials, urging them to withdraw draft laws proposed in the islands. Congress also submitted similar memorandums. INTUC, Janadhipathya Samrakshana Vedi also organized protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/residents-protest-on-social-media/articleshow/83045960.cms||---

There was an effective curb on movement of people for non-essential purposes. All this showed in the decline in the tehsil’s positivity rate,” the tehsil health officer Dr Manoj Khomne said. “Now, we are conducting rapid antigen tests in villages where 10 or more cases have been reported earlier, to see if there are any individuals with symptoms and we are then conducting more tests (RT-PCR) and treating them,” he said. The tehsil administration had conducted door-to-door survey in 25 hotspot villages, which had 10 or more active cases. “Apart from that we had identified 25 high alert villages, which had over 30 active Covid cases and were reporting cases daily. We conducted tests, surveys and could identify Covid-19 patients at an early stage and contain the virue spread in these villages,” he added. Dadasaheb Kamble, the sub-divisional officer of Baramati, said, “Our endeavour is to improve the situation further. Around 30 to 40 ventilator beds and over 200 oxygen beds are vacant. This would help us improve the recovery and fatality rate too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-positivity-rate-dips-below-18-in-baramati/articleshow/83048225.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||Delhi: Varsities do their bit with Covid care on campuses||NEW DELHI: IP University is all set to start a Covid-care hospital at its campus with the varsity looking for a likely return of its administrative staff members soon. Netaji Subhas University of Technology, too, has planned a Covid Care Centre on its campus with 12 ICU beds, and is also loaning out oxygen concentrators to alumni, students and staff. IP University announced that as part of their efforts to help the society, they had established a “welfare group” in April, during the raging second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic in the country. “The teaching and the non-teaching staff voluntarily contributed funds to the welfare group as the first step to finance activities required to support the cause. These funds were utilised to obtain oxygen cylinders and concentrators, PPE kits for the volunteers, arranging tele-consultation with doctors for its employees and families and making immediate payments required at the time of hospitalisation in critical cases,” the varsity said in a statement. With cases now dipping, the university and its “Covid-19 task force” are preparing to respond and create a better health infrastructure at the campus. IP University is looking to set up a 10-bed Covid-care hospital with oxygen beds and organising regular RT-PCR testing and vaccination camps. The university also plans to set up an oxygen plant that would not only cater to the needs of the university, but also support the general public. Meanwhile, NSUT, too, had similar plans in April when they decided to create a Covid Care Centre at their hostel. However, lack of expertise and medical staff meant that the plans were kept on hold. “Instead, what we have done is that we are loaning out oxygen concentrators to our staff members and the students and alumni, while also planning to set up a 12-bed Covid centre at one of our campus buildings as the ‘Unlock’ procedures begin in the city. This is all being done with the assistance of our alumni group,” said Vijayant Agarwal, president-cum-chairperson of NSUT Alumni Affairs. Agarwal said the varsity was also planning to set up an oxygen plant on campus to cater to the staff and for the public. On the other hand, to counter unforeseen circumstance for its employees, Jamia Hamdard has set up a 50-bed Covid Care Centre exclusively for its employees, and for officers of Delhi Police and their family members. The centre will also provide patients with required medicines and meals. Equipped with ECG machines, cardiac monitors, it will also have five AYUSH doctors, three MBBS doctors and ten nurses to take care of the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/varsities-do-their-bit-with-covid-care-on-campuses/articleshow/83073267.cms||---

Citizens get a sense of safety at home and the demand for home-based collection of sample for Covid-19 or other pre-existing conditions like diabetes, among others was rising since lockdown was imposed in 2020, laboratory experts said. Shrinivas Gokhale, who runs Nucleus pathology lab in Kothrud and is president of Indian Association of Practising Pathologists’ Pune chapter, said, “Most laboratories have maintained the same charges as three-four years ago.” Sanjay Ingale, zonal technical head (West) and consultant pathologist, Apollo Diagnostics, Pune, said, “There is a 50% increase in cases of patients opting for home collection of samples.” Manish Karekar, chief of lab services, Metropolis Healthcare Limited, said, “Patients suffering from chronic illnesses like cancer, among others, who need regular monitoring through lab tests, are apprehensive of stepping out into high-risk settings. With competent phlebotomists from NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories), home visits can be done 24/7 with minimal hassles,” On their part, the pathology labs have equipped their existing staffers to cope with this shift in operations. They also hired new staffers only for RT-PCR sample collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sharp-increase-in-home-based-sample-collection-for-regular-ailments-tests/articleshow/83048208.cms||---

The CID has also put up two fake post alerts, denying the link and warned legal action. Police have categorically stated that the purported video shared on social media had no link with Bengal. CID sources said the initial investigations revealed the person, who shared the video, was connected to a right wing organization. “It appears the person operated on his own. Like in recent past, we will write to Facebook and Twitter and ask for leads. We will also ask them to remove the contents,” said a senior officer. According to police, the link of the gang rape accused to Bengal was checked at all levels and found to be untrue. “The entire narrative has no link to truth, except the incident on which it is based,” said an officer. The CID, along with Kolkata Police, said its fake news alerts were part of its continued efforts to flag down fake posts, an exercise that cops began from May 3. Among the videos and posts flagged down were old images of violence from Odisha’s Bhadrak, Raniganj in Bengal and even one which was a land duel in Bangladesh. So far, dozens of FIRs have been registered across Bengal against fake news and multiple arrests carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rohingya-link-post-fake-cid/articleshow/83045998.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

If no proper connection is established, then we will not process further. We will check the shortlisted proposals through appropriate government channels,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects) who is heading the BMC’s vaccine procurement plan. A joint statement issued by RDIF and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories stated Dr Reddy’s has sole distribution rights for the first 250 million doses of the vaccine in India. With Pfizer stating it would supply its Covid vaccine only to central governments and that it had not authorised anyone to import or market the vaccine in India, the BMC is faced with the tough task of verifying and authenticating the offers of the bidders, since many of them are foreign entities. The BMC had on Tuesday received eight bids for supplying one crore vaccine doses.

The forest officials had kept a watch on the two eight-day-old cubs that were found in the field on Wednesday and one of the cubs was taken away by the mother in the wee hours of Thursday. According to forest officials, the leopard took only one cub with her at a time as the shelter must have been far from the farm where the cubs were found. By the time she would have reached, the sun would have already come up. “As the leopard took only one of the two cubs in the wee hours on Thursday, we left the second cub at the same place and were confident that the mother will return to take it back.

We don’t think that this order is against any community. The court has studied, observed and passed the verdict very judiciously,” KCBC deputy general secretary Fr Jacob Palackappilly said. He said that the government formed a minority department and minority commission against the backdrop of Sachar committee report and the Paloli Mohammed Kutty committee report. “Subsequently, various welfare schemes and scholarships were implemented for the minorities. HC has observed as a fault on the government’s side that schemes were formulated considering one particular community alone,” said Fr Palackappilly. KCBC said that the HC has reminded the government that when projects are formulated as minority welfare schemes, all religious minorities notified by the Union government and envisaged by the constitution of India, have to be included in them. The Kerala Council of Churches (KCC) said that the verdict has proven that the fight put up by them and other Christian organizations was right. KCC president Bishop Oommen George and general secretary Prakash P Thomas said that the verdict has revealed the biased stand of the government. Not even a single member of the state assembly protested when the Christian community was denied a member in the minority commission through an amendment made in 2017, they said. In the minority finance and development corporation which had eight members, only two were Christians. In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram Samithi for the minority welfare activities, only seven of the 39 members were Christians. The Christian community is not getting representation in the centres for preparing the minority community students for competitive exams, they added. Verdict exposed appeasement: BJPBJP state president K Surendran said the court intervention has exposed the fact that successive governments in Kerala were trying to appease a particular minority community. “It’s a known fact that Christian community is not getting their due benefits because of the Muslim appeasement policy followed by the LDF and UDF governments. I hope at least the court intervention would prompt the government to see all minority communities as equals,” he said. Meanwhile, Christian church heads in the capital preferred not to make any public comment on the issue. “We are not against the Muslim community getting their due. Our only concern is the denial of scholarship to Christian students,” said a senior priest belonging to Latin archdiocese in Thiruvananthapuram. Meanwhile, top CPM leaders declined to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-heads-bjp-welcome-hc-verdict/articleshow/83046060.cms||---

However, when the food did not come after three hours, they suspected that they have been duped and contacted cops. Prima facie, said cops, the app used might have been fake and a Jharkhand based gang night be involved. The victim, claimed sources, followed the steps in the app and later a customer care executive. During this process he received a one time password (OTP). The delivery executive then asked him to enter the OTP in the app saying that doing so would get all his food on time. In simple words, on entering the OTP his money would be refunded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-food-app-dupes-tripura-officials-of-rs-75k/articleshow/83046075.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC eases weekend lockdown, state curbs extended by 15 days||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Friday announced relaxation from weekend lockdown, paving the way for grocery, vegetables, dairy and other food stores to operate from 7am to 11am from this Saturday. The announcement came after a meeting of the PMC officials and the elected members with state health minister Rajesh Tope. Shops engaged in monsoon works and agriculture would also be allowed to operate in the PMC limits. The PMC had earlier allowed only milk and medical stores to operate during the weekend lockdown (Friday 6pm to Monday 7am). According to the new guidelines, opticians’ shops as well as meat and egg shops can function over the weekends. Shops offering services to pets also can operate. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh issued similar guidelines regarding weekend lockdown relaxation in rural areas. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation is likely to decide on relaxation in the weekend lockdown on Saturday. After Pune district’s Covid review meeting, Tope on Friday said the weekend lockdown relaxation for essential shops in the Pune civic limits was a unanimous decision of all elected representatives following the decline in cases. Tope said though the district’s weekly positivity rate had declined to 11.9%, it was still above the state average. “The positivity rate will continue to fluctuate,” he said. Tope said the lockdown-like restrictions across the state would be extended for 15 days and the chief minister would assess the situation of each district before any relaxations. “The final decision would be taken by CM Uddhav Thackeray in consultation with the local authorities in the coming two-three days and things would be finalised ahead of June 1,” he said. However, experts from the medical fraternity recommended that the state shouldn’t allow any super-spreader events such as political, social or religious gatherings for a couple of months. Some even asked the state to “take things slow till December”. Tope said it was a relief that Pune district’s curve was dipping. “The daily cases have reduced to around 2,200 now,” he said. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said they were yet to take a decision on relaxing the weekend curbs. “We might take a decision on Saturday,” he said. In previous directives in April and May, the PMC had allowed online and on-call home delivery of food till 11pm. All online food delivery apps were permitted. The PMC had allowed domestic helps, cooks, caregivers and drivers to travel from 7 am to 10pm. All these relaxations would continue. Although there is a demand from all quarters to reduce the restrictions given the decline in cases, medical experts have cautioned against it, said state officials. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical adviser to the state government, said the state has to go slow up to December. Salunkhe recommends against major opening up till 60-80% of the vulnerable population has been vaccinated. Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the Covid death audit committee, said, “There shouldn’t be any hurry in resuming normalcy, else we may see a spurt again,” he said.

---||Delhi||Vivekananda College acting principal denied extension||New Delhi: Delhi University has not granted an extension to the acting principal of Vivekananda College, Hina Nandrajog, stating that her term has ended. However, many claim that this was connected to her not giving an extension to 12 ad hoc teachers. Delhi University Teachers’ Association had recently called for her removal. A strike was also called against the removal of the 12 ad hoc teachers. DUTA president Rajib Ray earlier stated that “she (Nandrajog) had already completed 5 years of tenure and should not be allowed to continue beyond 5 years in violation of the Delhi University rules, regulations and ordinances.” Hansraj Suman of Delhi Teachers’ Association had also made similar demands. He called the decision of the university a “victory of social justice.” While speaking to TOI, Nandrajog refused to comment on the issue and only said that “the college has been following rules and will continue to follow. I am proceeding as per university rules.” When asked if she did not get an extension due to the ad hoc teachers’ issue, she said, “I have no opinion on that.” The DU administration denied that the end of Nandrajog’s tenure was related to the teachers’ protests. “It is a procedural decision and her five-year term has ended. It is now the governing body of the college, which will decide on inviting applications for the principal’s post,” said Balaram Pani, dean of colleges at DU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vivekananda-college-acting-principal-denied-extension/articleshow/83073310.cms||---
---||Pune||Bike-borne chain snatchers strike twice in Pashan||Pune: Duo on a motorcycle snatched gold chains collectively worth Rs2 lakh from two women within a matter of an hour near the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and at Sutarwadi in Pashan between 5.10pm and 6.35pm on Thursday. Based on the two victims’ description of the suspects and the bike, the police suspect the involvement of the same men in both the incidents. In the first case, a 24-year-old woman and her nephew were on way to their residence at Sutarwadi on bike. The suspects came from the rear and the man riding pillion on the bike snatched the woman’s chain worth Rs1.1 lakh around 5.10pm and sped away . A little over an hour later, the duo targeted a 40-year-old woman on her way home on bike in Pashan. The two men came from the rear, one of them snatched her gold chain worth Rs 90,000 and fled. The women registered separate FIRs related to robbery under sections 392 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure from the Chatushrungi police said on Friday, “The suspects involved in the two chain-snatching cases are the same. The women’s description about the suspects’ age group hints at it and the motorcycle used in the crimes is the same.” Waghchaure said, “The offences occurred at a distance of around 50m from the Pune-Bengaluru highway. The duo fled via the highway. We are checking CCTV cameras, conducting technical investigations and working on certain clues. We hope to arrest the suspects at the earliest.” Chain snatchers have been on the prowl in the city since the Covid-induced curbs. “They strike without any fear these days because the roads are mostly deserted because of the Covid restrictions. It seems like they snatch chains at will and flee. The police should patrol the roads more often now,” said a homemaker from Pashan, seeking more visibility of men in uniform on roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bike-borne-chain-snatchers-strike-twice-in-pashan/articleshow/83048397.cms||---
---||Delhi||Cycle of change: NGO’s lessons on menstrual health to streetkids in Delhi||NEW DELHI: On Menstrual Hygiene Day on Friday, an NGO educated girls living in slums on good hygiene while managing the menses. Sanitary pads were also distributed to girls in Shakurbasti and Valmiki camp in west Delhi. Meanwhile, a few other organisations observed the day by holding similar sessions for girls in Covid clusters in the city. After distributing menstruation kits adequate for the next three months to more than 100 girls in two west Delhi localities, Sanjay Gupta, director, Chetna, said, “Our menstrual hygiene kits aim to spread awareness about cleanliness and health related to the menses. We want girls to break their silence on the issue and provide them with sustainable access to appropriate products.” A 16-year-old girl living in a congested slum had been compelled to use pieces of old cloth every month for the past four years as taught by her mother. When she came in contact with Chetna, she became aware of the health issues around periods. Gradually, she also learnt about the taboos associated with menstrual health. Another cheerful 16-year-old girl, a Noida slum resident, was completely unaware of what her body was going through when she had her first period. She said that whenever she got her periods, her mother asked her not to do any household chores, putting superstition over biology. But when she started studying at Chetna’s education centre and learnt about the natural bodily discharge, she was eager to teach others about it and about the importance of hygiene and the need of proper consultation in case of severe stomach pain or other problems. Gupta pointed out how women had suffered for ages because of myths about menstruation, such as women shouldn’t be allowed into the kitchen or a shrine when having periods, or even touch anything. “Menstrual hygiene practices are structured by cultural norms and socio-economic pressures in slum areas,” said Gupta. “We realised that providing a sanitary pad was just one part of dealing with the issue. Creating a change in mindset is the main challenge, and through education we are empowering girls to fight the stigma related to menstruation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cycle-of-change-ngos-lessons-on-menstrual-health-to-streetkids/articleshow/83048456.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

IUML national organizing secretary and MP E T Mohammed Basheer said that the said scholarship scheme was launched on the basis of the findings of the Sachar committee, which was set up exclusively to study the social, economic and educational condition of Muslims in India and suggest steps to address backwardness among Muslim community. “The said scheme was started exclusively for students from the Muslim community on the basis of Sachar committee report, which had found that the representation of Muslim youth in premier academic institutions was less. Even now, the existing budget head for the scholarship is from the scheme to implement the recommendation of Sachar committee report,” Basheer said. He said that while there were general projects like the MSDP meant for all minorities, the said project was meant to address the backwardness of the Muslim community alone. “Muslim students were getting 100% benefit of the scholarship scheme. Later, 20% of it was earmarked for Latin Catholics and converted Christians. It was a mistake to change the heading of the project. We did not oppose it then as we did not want the issue to take a different turn,” he said. Basheer said that as an aggrieved party, IUML will consider legal remedies on the issue. Meanwhile, veteran CPM leader Paloli Mohammed Kutty, who had headed a panel set by the LDF government in 2007 to make suggestions on the Sachar committee report, told media that the scholarship scheme implemented as per Sachar committee report was meant for Muslim community alone. He said that it was the decision by the UDF government to include other minority communities in a scheme which was being implemented for one minority community, which has been scrapped by the high court. Jamaat-e-Islami Kerala Amir MI Abdul Azeez said that the HC order scrapping the 80:20 ratio in minority schemes was an injustice to the Muslim community. “The HC verdict has not considered the background and objectives of the minority welfare project. The state government should file an appeal against it,” he said. Wisdom Islamic Organization also demanded that the government should file an appeal and said that the government should issue a white paper on the backwardness of the Muslim community in the state and the benefits they were getting under various welfare scheme to put an end to the allegations. Popular Front of India state general secretary A Abdul Sathar said, “It was the decision of the government to include other communities in the scheme meant for Muslim community that has caused the current misunderstanding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-outfits-urge-govt-to-file-appeal/articleshow/83046169.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP MP warns of agitation if Maratha demands not met||Mumbai: After a meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray, BJP MP Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje said on Friday that if the state government did not fulfil demands made by him on behalf of the Maratha community by June 6, he would launch an agitation regardless of the pandemic. He demanded the state call a two-day special session of the legislature to give justice to the community and indicated he may launch a political party in support of the community. A descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Chhatrapati Sambhaji said after meeting Thackeray and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, “On behalf of the community, I met several party leaders seeking support for 70% of people in the Maratha community who are poor.” Surrounded by Maratha Kranti Morcha and Sakal Maratha Morcha activists, he said the community was angry and ready to hit the streets immediately after Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota more than three weeks ago. “However, they stayed calm after I intervened and appealed to them not to protest. But till what time will they suppress their feelings? If the demands are not accepted by the state by June 6, our protest will start from Raigad fort, regardless of the pandemic,” he said, appealing also to all leaders in the state to come together and sort out the issue. On his meetings with Thackeray and Fadnavis, the BJP MP said, “I have put forward demands. The state should file a review petition in SC on the quota and if it does not work, a curative petition should be filed. The third option is the state can submit a proposal under Article 342 (A and B) to the President via the Governor and subsequently to Parliament asking them to consider awarding the quota.” His other demands, he said, were concessions in education for Marathas along the lines of those obtained by OBCs, the strengthening of SARTHI (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute) with setting up of a dedicated committee instead of bureaucrats, with a Rs 1,000 crore fund for it to be made available for the next two years, an increase in the amount of loan given by Annasaheb Patil Economically Backward Development Corporation to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh, he said. Meanwhile, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said candidates chosen for government jobs in Maratha quota should be given appointment letters immediately, PTI reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-mp-warns-of-agitation-if-maratha-demands-not-met/articleshow/83051847.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad police file chargesheet against instant loan apps||HYDERABAD: Six months after Hyderabad police registered a criminal case against the representatives of mobile applications which offered loans at high interest rate—who allegedly harassed loan defaulters by defaming them—a few days ago, police filed a chargesheet against the accused, including the arrested Chinese national Zhu Wei alias Lambo, in Nampally criminal court. Cyber Crime sleuths said that chargesheet was filed against 23 persons of the 31 accused. As of now, except Lambo all the other accused can secure bail from the concerned criminal court. This is a preliminary chargesheet filed by the investigation agency and an official said that supplementary chargesheets will be filed after they get reports from state forensic science laboratory as several gadgets need to be analysed. Over the course of the investigation, officials found that the representatives of the loan apps defamed the defaulters who did not return the loan amount within seven days. Officials said that they found at least 211 apps which disbursed loans, whose recovery executives later harassed and defamed the customers by sending fake notices to all the members in the contact list of the victims by defaming by the victims. A total of six persons in Telangana died by suicide due to humiliation by loan app representatives. In the case, four Chinese nationals were declared accused but only the arrested Lambo was chargesheeted. The others are suspected to be living in China. Some of money earned through the loan apps has allegedly reached Shanghai. The other charges levelled by the police include—the accused charged exorbitant interest, and earned substantially more money than the loan sanctioned. Many persons who were in need of loan following the lockdown in 2020 used these apps to get loans. The apps sanctioned the loan without asking for much proof but charged high interest, which landed people in deep trouble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-police-file-chargesheet-against-instant-loan-apps/articleshow/83048498.cms||---

She alleged he had pronounced ‘talaq’ on three different occasions last year after she refused his demand to appoint him as her power of attorney in their firm. Triple talaq is banned in India.Rahat (67) also alleged that Amir had abused and humiliated her by calling a woman at their bungalow at Royal Palms in Goregaon.Aarey police said it registered the FIR under sections 3 and 4 of chapter-2 of the Muslim Women (Protection of rights on marriage) Act, which was amended in 2019, along with Indian Penal Code sections 498 (cruelty against spouse), 323 (causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 427 (mischief). Rahat said, “I am fighting for my dignity and for other women in our community who are the victims of this illegal talaq process. All problems in our 49 years of marriage started last year.” The two had got married in 1971.Amir was unavailable for comment. In 1984, Amir founded Royal Palms Pvt Ltd that owned over 240 acres land of Royal Palms in Aarey Colony, housing several residential buildings, Royal Palms Hotel, Imperial Palace hotel and a vacant land parcel.In her complaint, Rahat said she has 30% partnership in the company, her husband 25%, their sons Dilawar and Muhamed 23% and 20%, respectively. The remaining 2% is in her grandson Omar Muhamed Nensey’s name.In the FIR, Rahat alleged that in April 2020, Amir told her to appoint him as her power of attorney for her shareholding in the company, but she refused. He threatened her and stopped talking to her. Between June and August 2020, Amir again made the request on three occasions, but she refused and each time he said ‘talaq’. On the last occasion when he pronounced ‘talaq’ in August 2020, Amir told Rahat that now there was no relationship between them, she claimed.Rahat further claimed that on May 6, 2021, Amir called a woman at their bungalow, along with her family members, while she was in her room. The next day, he again called the same woman alone and spend the afternoon with her. Rahat stated in her police complaint that she found it humiliating and asked Amir not to call the woman at their jointly owned bungalow till they divide it. She alleged that Amir pushed her and threw her mobile phone in a fit of rage. After a few days, Rahat decided to approach the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-royal-palms-owner-booked-for-triple-talaq-on-wifes-plaint/articleshow/83048502.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Pune||Panchayat chairman held in hotel attack case||Pune: The local crime branch of the rural police on Friday arrested the chairman of the Khed panchayat samiti in connection with the attack on members of a rival political group in a Donje hotel at the foothills of Sinhagad fort early on Thursday morning. Police have applied charges of attempt to commit murder, assault, molestation and abduction in the case. “We arrested the chairman, Bhagwan Pokharkar, and one more suspect, Keshav Argade, from Shivajinagar in Pune on a tip-off,” senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat of the local crime branch told TOI. Three men sustained injuries in the attack after a group of 15 people stormed the hotel and assaulted them with iron rods. The complainant also claimed that one of the suspects fired a round in the air. Ghanwat said that Pokharkar was upset as the members of rival group had proposed a no-confidence motion against him. The chairman had completed his term but not relinquished his charge, which prompted a women member to file a no-confidence proceeding before the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panchayat-chairman-held-in-hotel-attack-case/articleshow/83048503.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ankle-deep water, trash spell woes for vendors||KOLKATA: Rain throughout Thursday left several community markets across Kolkata in a mess with ankle deep water and trash accumulating in many pockets. Market committees which are already trying to ensure steady supply of essentials since restrictions have been increased for two more weeks were also struggling to get the accumulated water drained out so that vendors can set up their stalls. The three-hour window to conduct business hampered the cleaning operations as people flocked to the markets as cloud cover moved and rain stopped on Friday morning. “There was ankle deep water in many pockets of College Street market on Friday so several vendors could not set up their stalls,” said Joydeep Saha, a shop owner at College Street market. In several markets the civic body is carrying out repairs and renovation for which construction material was dumped. The materials blocked the water outlets leading to accumulation of water. The supply chain of essentials was hit hard by the inundation because of heavy rain in south Bengal following the landfall of Yaas. At many places the roads connecting the haats with wholesale markets were still under water leading to the demand-supply gap. “Farmers are still reeling under distress because of the damage to the standing crops. The invasion of saline water in the land is only adding woes to their sufferings. Besides, the regular upward revision of diesel prices is hindering the transportation,”said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vendors Association. “We are not getting enough vegetables at haats. The quality has also worsened because of the flood. In the next few days, we will have to depend on our neighbouring states and north Bengal for the supply of vegetables to the city markets,” said Jehangir Khan, a wholesaler of Bankrahaat. Standalone stores in neighbourhoods have come to the people’s rescue. “Since the new restrictions came into effect, I was shutting the store at 10 am but for the past few days there are so many customers that I have to keep it open for extra couple of hours,”said Mohammad Wasim,a grocery shop owner in Beck Bagan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ankle-deep-water-trash-spell-woes-for-vendors/articleshow/83046233.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kochi||Kerala: Staff, equipment shortage for handling Covid surge in Attapadi||PALAKKAD: The Covid nodal officer of Government Tribal Specialty Hospital (GTSH) at Kottathara in Attapadi had sent an SOS to the superintendent of the hospital on shortage of manpower and equipment to deal with the surge on Covid-19-positive cases in the tribal heartland where 53 tribespeople out of the total 60 reported positive on Friday. However, the SOS letter sent on May 15 is awaiting action by GTHS superintendent. The SOS sent by Dr Rejaneesh S R, Covid nodal officer, to Dr Prabhudas, deputy district medical officer and superintendent of GTSH, on May 15 said “There is alarming shortage of staff nurses and other supportive staff at the Covid ICU. Quite often, we had to run the whole ICU with 11 patients, with just one staff nurse. This will seriously affect the quality of care given to the patients. Currently, we need a minimum of four staff nurses and a corresponding number of supportive staff on duty. When we increase ventilator beds to 10, there should be a minimum of eight staff nurses and corresponding supportive staff at a time in duty for the smooth functioning of the ICU.” The SOS letter also sought “to increase ventilator beds to 10 from the current four. Currently, we have only five multipara monitors. We need eight more urgently in order to monitor the patients more effectively. As decided earlier at the district collector’s meeting, we urgently need a liquid medical oxygen plant of one tonne capacity. The current oxygen availability is not even adequate for running 3-4 ventilators at a time in full capacity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/staff-equipment-shortage-for-handling-covid-surge/articleshow/83046229.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal using national flag as a decoration, says Union minister||NEW DELHI: Union culture minister Prahlad Patel has accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of using the national flag as a “decoration” during his televised press conferences. In a letter to Kejriwal, Patel said the flag placed behind the CM during his press briefings appeared to be in violation of the flag code. In a letter to the CM, the Union minister said, “It appears that the national flag has been used for decoration. The white portion in the centre appears to have been reduced and the green portion added to it, which is not in tune with provisions of the Indian Flag Code specified by the Ministry of Home Affairs.” Patel also said he does not expect “such an act, knowingly or unknowingly, from the honourable chief minister”. The letter, a copy of which was also dispatched to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, drew Kejriwal’s attention to Section 2(ix) of The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, which says that the national flag should not be used to decorate a speaker's stage. Section 2.2(1) states that the status of the flag should be respectful, he added. “Being a resident of India and holding the post of the chief ministe, everyone expects you to maintain the honour and dignity of the Tricolou,” Patel said in his letter. Despite attempts, TOI failed to get any response from Delhi government on this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-using-national-flag-as-a-decoration-says-union-minister/articleshow/83048508.cms||---

The dentist, who runs a clinic at Andheri West reached the station to board a train on May 25 when a man pushed her from behind and hopped into a train that was moving away from the platform. He allegedly made lewd gestures at her from the compartment following which the victim registered a complaint with the Andheri GRP. “On May 26, we spotted a commuter matching the description of the accused captured on CCTV.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Readying the war room to battle third wave||NEW DELHI: In what could prove helpful in coping with the expected third wave of Covid-19 infections, the intensity of which might be worse than the current one, Delhi’s Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC), set up on May 5 to enable data-led Covid policy analysis and response, could be modified to be more robust. IIT-Delhi has made a series of recommendations to improve its functioning when it tracks data points like distribution of Covid cases, vaccination, the status of Covid-designated health facilities, oxygen management and district-level initiatives. In a report titled “IIT-D review and recommendations for management of oxygen during COVID-19 crisis”, the researchers have warned that in the worst-case scenario, the city might have to manage 45,000 new infections and 9,000 hospital admissions every day. To handle a crisis of such dimensions, IIT-D has made eight specific recommendations and additional visualisations in ICCC, touted as Delhi’s Covid war room and operating from Palika Kendra near Connaught Place. The report has advised including additional Covid statistics in the rubric, such as active cases, recovered cases and deaths, monitored by age and district, in four time periods — month, past 30 days, week and same day. Currently, new cases, distribution, Covid tests and deaths are tracked on a daily basis. The additions, IITD says, will help decision makers analyse severity of cases, demand for resources and other trends. The researchers also recommend significant expansion of vaccination data. Besides tracking it demography-wise every day, as is being currently done, the suggestion is for the visualisation of vaccination sites, registrations, trend of doses by the earlier mentioned four time periods, adverse effects and overall vaccination coverage. The number of people remaining to be vaccinated in each district should also be monitored. The system should track the trends for Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V to allow data-backed decisions for a more efficient inoculation exercise. As for oxygen, IIT-Delhi has recommended the data monitoring of the gas allocation, plant capacity, cylinders, besides tracking real-time oxygen bed availability and eh admission discharge rate. The system should also then track the volume of oxygen remaining. These new visualisations in ICCC will enable the government to review and take corrective measures to support the smooth functioning of the healthcare system. Importantly, the researchers feel that hospitals under central government, state government and private management can be tracked for both Covid and non-Covid aspects. Above all, the technology institute has recommended a significant upgrade of oxygen management. To save lives and not let anyone die of dearth of oxygen, the related tab has to act as the dashboard for supply chain management of oxygen, the report advises. The storage and production capacities, districtwise oxygen concentrators and cylinders and those intended for home isolation cases also need to be followed. The data on supply should be checked every 30 minutes, and potential suppliers alerted to meet distress calls. The city’s map needs to locate oxygen tankers and hospitals via GPS and geotagging. A set of upgradations has also been pushed in the districts to ensure better performance at that level, simultaneously making it easier to assess the situation and movement of resources within districts. A Delhi-NCR map should be utilised to present the data on oxygen concentrators, cylinders and tankers in each district alongside data on active cases and tele-consultations. Besides the six available tabs on the current ICCC dashboard, two new tabs have been recommended, one for oxygen manufacturers/suppliers, the other to monitor SOS status of hospitals. The report says this can prove to be a one-stop solution for oxygen distress in hospitals. Many other general upgradations, such as linking ICCC with the NIC portal, boosting security aspects to prevent data theft or interference, load testing and quality checks have also been proposed so that the Covid war room can handle emergencies of various sorts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/readying-the-war-room-to-battle-third-wave/articleshow/83073352.cms||Paras Singh

As a result, tribals and Maoists taking shelter in these areas are risking not only their lives but also that of nearby villagers’ lives, police said. According to police estimates, more than 75 Maoists have been infected with the virus. On Thursday, a Maoist died while he was secretly undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Kothagudem. Police did not rule out the possibility of some more Maoists and local tribals who might have died of Covid-19 before they received the medical attention. “It was after a delay of 5-6 days when their condition turned serious, some of the Maoists were shifted to private hospitals in nearby towns or mandals for Covid-19 treatment. Till such time, they take the help of quacks,’’ Kothagudem district superintendent of police Sunil Dutt said. Kothagudem officials have already warned local villagers against venturing into Maoist-affected areas in Chhattisgarh since the spread of the virus in those pockets has been significant. “To contain the spread of virus, the local weekly shandy market was shut as a large number of villagers gather in these markets. Villagers can use the lockdown relaxation between 6 am and 10 am to buy essential items,” police officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/75-maoists-infected-with-covid-19-police/articleshow/83048568.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh girl with cleft disorder is now a speech therapist||HYDERABAD: D Padmavathi’s story is of true grit and gumption. The tribal girl from the small village of Nandavaram in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool district is a speech therapist in Hyderabad now, having beaten the odds in overcoming her rare cleft disorder. Not just that, she also took care of a 10-month-old orphan found abandoned in a Bengaluru dust bin, who was also born with a cleft defect. Padmavathi was born with a facial cleft defect. She suffered from a severe variant of cleft palate called ‘Tessier craniofacial cleft’ where not only lips and teeth but the nose was also cut into half.  After the death of her mother when she was a child, her father abandoned her. Padmavathi’s grandparents and her uncle took care of her and brought her to GSR Institute of Facial Plastic Surgery in Hyderabad. Dr Gosla Srinivas Reddy, director of the institute, promised to help her and operated on her disorder for free. Padmavathi told TOI, “After the surgery, I was in an orphanage in Hyderabad and went to a cleft school in Santhosh Nagar.” A Swiss organisation run by professor Hermann F Sailer and Dr Erika Sailer helped fund her studies. Thanks to their help, she went to one of the top boarding schools — Ross School — in New York and studied there for four years. Padmavathi visited Costa Rica and Italy as part of her curricular activities. In February this year, she joined Sweekaar Academy of Rehabilitation Sciences, Secunderabad, where she is pursuing her bachelor of audiology, speech, language, and pathology course. Applauding her, Dr Srinivas Reddy said: “I have seen two rare cases of Padmavathi and now that of orphan baby Sameeksha. When she was 15, Padmavathi underwent a second surgery for her nose correction. The smile on her face is back.” He further said, “Parents abandoned the small girl in Bengaluru. She had a similar problem of facial cleft—like Padmavathi—and her fate bought her to GSR Institute when she was just nine months old. We have done the surgery at Hyderabad Cleft Society. Sameeksha has recovered well and went back to Bengaluru. Padmavathi took care of Sameeksha during her stay in Hyderabad.” Dr Reddy has done 30,000 cleft palate surgeries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/girl-with-cleft-disorder-is-now-a-speech-therapist/articleshow/83048554.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows priest to meet Stan Swamy in hospital||Mumbai: Senior counsel Mihir Desai for 84-year-old Fr Stan Swamy informed the Bombay HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar that the priest’s attendants at Taloja prison where he is an undertrial in the Elgar Parishad case had said his “health was extremely precarious with reduced oxygen saturation and acutely fluctuating blood pressure”. Seeking his hospitalisation, Desai said the expenses would be borne by Fr Swamy. A week ago, Fr Swamy in a virtual interaction with the vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade had refused to be shifted to any hospital, saying he preferred to await his death in prison. The bench had then permitted Desai to approach the high court before June 1 if the priest agreed by then to be shifted to Holy Family Hospital. Fr Swamy filed an affidavit on Friday requesting that he be shifted to the hospital. To Singh’s submission for admission to government-run JJ Hospital, the HC said it may not be possible for him to get personal attention there due to the pandemic and influx of patients. The ASG said if he was being sent to a private hospital, no other private individual should be allowed to attend to him. The HC directed the hospital to provide him with an attendant and to allow one police constable since he is an undertrial. It also allowed Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, parish priest of St Peter’s Church in Bandra, to meet Fr Swamy at the hospital subject to its protocols. One of his lawyers said after being moved to hospital, Fr Swamy joked with the staff saying, ‘Now I know I am in good hands’. Last October, the special NIA court had rejected Fr Swamy’s plea for medical bail. He then appealed against the order before high court in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-allows-priest-to-meet-stan-swamy-in-hospital/articleshow/83048604.cms||---

Three more dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) with 267 oxygen beds have been readied.Following shortage of beds during the peak of second wave, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and deputy commissioner Milind Meshram had planned development of DCHCs at recreation centre of Symbiosis University, abandoned hall at Supreme Towers in Gittikhadan and Mulak Ayurvedic College.Meshram told TOI, “All works of DCHCs have been completed at these three locations. The DCHC at Mulak Ayurvedic College is of 105 beds, 100 beds at recreation centre of Symbiosis and 62 beds at Supreme Towers,” he said.The number of beds at DCHCs at Mulak Ayurvedic College and Symbiosis can be extended to 150 each, if necessary.It was a big challenge for NMC to develop the DCHC at recreation centre of Symbiosis and the hall at Supreme Towers as these are not existing hospitals.The civic body is planning to engage NGOs to run these three DCHCs if the district happens to face the projected third wave.Already, the NMC is running six Covid Hospitals with capacity of 542 beds. At present, 474 beds are in operation and can be increased as per necessity. Developed in May 2020, the NMC has brought these Covid hospitals into use in the second wave. These are Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR) and Isolation on its own, KT Nagar with the help of Shree Ramesh Fuke (Patil) Charitable Trust, Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital in association with Asra Foundation, Sadar with the help of Railways, and Pachpaoli Police Quarters along with an NGO.Thus, the number of beds in Covid hospitals has increased to 7,521 in the city.As per NMC’s data, there were 1,514 beds in September last year when the district had witnessed the peak of first wave. Beds were increased to 3,913 by December last year, 4,682 by March 31 this year, 5,553 by April 12 and 6,387 by April 18.As per directives of guardian minister Nitin Raut, NMC is also pursuing for opening of a Covid hospital at ESIC Hospital and Haj House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-readies-3-more-covid-hosps-for-projected-3rd-wave/articleshow/83044627.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

He also asked for tax relief for Covid-related medical supplies, a five-year extension to the GST compensation period and a share of cess collected by the Centre, especially from petrol and diesel to be distributed to the states. Pawar said the Centre was to give Maharashtra GST compensation worth Rs 46,000 crore for 2020-21, but the the state had received only Rs 22,000 crore so far. “Considering the financial position of the state in the pandemic, the balance compensation may be given immediately,” he said. He also asked for a five-year extension to the period of GST compensation cess given to the states. The compensation period had begun in 2017. “The economic impact of the pandemic cannot be nullified in one or two years. The period of revenue protection and compensation for loss should be extended for another five years from 2022-23 to 2026-27,” Pawar said. Pawar further asked for the GST compensation figure for Maharashtra for 2021-22 to be increased. “The assumptions for calculating compensation appear to be over-optimistic,” said Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-settle-pending-rs-24k-cr-gst-compensation/articleshow/83051969.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rotting crops, transport cost push up vegetable rates||KOLKATA: The impact of Yaas can be felt across the retail markets with a significant jump in the prices of some vegetables. Worse, the prices, traders said, will rise further with production suddenly nosediving. The crops are still rotting in the inundated fields while the transportation of produce has become a bigger challenge. The prices of some vegetables like parwal (pointed gourd), brinjal, green chillies, cucumber, bitter gourds and ridged gourds rose significantly across retail markets. “All these vegetables are grown in the places, where the aftermath of Yaas wreaked havoc. Farmers were growing bumper crops this year, keeping the prices low. But now the supply is dwindling,” said Kamal Dey, a member of the state government’s market task force. The demand-supply gap pushed the prices up. The parwal (pointed gourd), which was priced at Rs 25-30 on May 24, is being sold at Rs 50 in markets. Similarly, the price of brinjal has increased to Rs 60 a kg from Rs 30 on May 24. Apart from the lower production, higher transportation costs are also contributing to the soaring prices of the vegetables, said Shankar Dolui, a retailer at Kidderpore market. Apart from the rising diesel prices, e-pass remains an issue. Though cops have assured there will be no problem over e-passes, vendors on their way back are being harassed, said Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Koley market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rotting-crops-transport-cost-push-up-veggie-rates/articleshow/83046339.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Pithani had been on the run for eight months. Pithani, a creative content manager, has been charged under sections 20B, 28, 29, 27A and 8(c) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic substance (NDPS) Act for offences like dealing in drugs, financing its trade and conspiracy, and remanded in judicial custody till June 1. Officials said Pithani is the 34th person to be arrested in the case in which Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik were held. Despite three summons since October last year, Pithani did not join the investigation. “NCB Mumbai gathered intelligence of his presence in Hyderabad. A team was sent, he was apprehended and produced before a local court for transit remand to Mumbai. He was facilitating drugs in the case,” said NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Bureau officials claimed Pithani procured and distributed drugs, and even consumed them. Investigations have revealed Rajput was depressed and suffering from bipolar disorder and had been advised by the psychiatrist treating him to stay away from drugs, but a few “friends” helped him get it. The NCB in March filed a 12,000-page chargesheet against 33 persons, hinting at a Bollywood-drug dealers nexus. The CBI and Mumbai police have already questioned Pithani, one of the four persons present in Rajput’s house when he was found hanging in his room on June 14 last year, as he was a key member of Rajput’s team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sushant-singh-rajput-drugs-case-flatmate-arrested-in-hyderabad/articleshow/83050483.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nagpur||Man spots leopard coming out of bathroom in Gayatri Nagar||Nagpur: Panic gripped Gayatri Nagar opposite Visvesvaraya National Institute of Techniology (VNIT) on South Ambazari Road when a leopard strayed into one of the houses in the locality. Assistant conservator of forests (ACF) Surendra Kale said the animal was spotted by the house owner, Narendra Chakole, when he entered the bathroom at around 9.30am. The house is located in a densely populated area behind National Power Training Institute (NPTI), opposite VNIT. It is suspected the big cat entered the residential area from nearby Ambazari Biodiversity Park. It might have entered the area unseen as there is sparse traffic on roads due to Covid curbs. There have been several records in the region about wildlife roaming freely in areas adjoining forests but never well inside the city.“I was shocked to see the leopard coming out of the bathroom in the backyard. The leopard swiped at me, causing a slight injury to my leg. I shouted for help but before anybody could react the leopard climbed up the bathroom roof and jumped into my neighbour Kishore Jagtap’s house. The animal then growled and jumped into the sprawling NPTI premises adjacent to the house,” said Chakole in his statement to the forest department. “Barring Jagtap and Chakole, no one sighted the leopard. We saw unclear pugmark on the bathroom roof and also some scrape marks. The area falls under the Hingna forest range and teams from Hingna and Transit Treatment Centre (TTC), Seminary Hills, also reached the spot. Both the teams scanned the entire residential area and NPTI, but the leopard was not found,” said Kale.Deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Dr Bharatsinh Hada said residents and security personnel at NPTI have been alerted. “We have also deployed six camera traps on the premises to track the animal. Besides, the roadside CCTV footage will also be cross-checked to find out from where the leopard entered the area. Our team will keep a continuous watch till the leopard is driven out,” he said.Ajinkya Bhatkar, district honorary wildlife warden, said, “We have appealed to people not to panic but remain alert all the time. The leopard is a shy animal and will not harm humans until we block its way. It must have lost its way and will leave the place on its own during the night. The forest rescue team is well equipped to deal with the situation.”On December 5, 2019, a leopard from the Gorewada reserve forest on Katol Road was sighted in Ambazari Biodiversity Park by a forest labourer. The leopard was there in Ambazari for three days and was caught in camera while hunting a wild boar. On April 15, 2018, a leopard had entered a house in a densely populated area near CRPF Camp opposite Lata Mangeshkar Hospital, Digdoh.WHAT TO DO IN SUCH SCENARIOS* Be in groups and don’t move alone * Take care of small kids, do not leave them alone outside* Put loud music on your phone when you go out at night * Don’t try to shoo away when a leopard is spotted* Inform forest officials or police in an emergency* Illuminate areas outside houses and don’t move in the dark* Do not block leopard’s way or do not crowd||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-spots-leopard-coming-out-of-bathroom-in-gayatri-nagar/articleshow/83048635.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Markets see distress sales of ‘washed away’ prawns||KOLKATA: “Washed away prawns” from fisheries in East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas flooded city markets on Friday. Sold at prices that were much lower than usual, shoppers lapped up the shrimps and prawns. The fisheries department officials said the distress sale will be shortly followed by a slump in production as prawn fisheries, washed away by the rising tide water, will take time to rebuild the entire chain of production. “Prawn fisheries were the worst-hit. The loss is estimated to be Rs 1,000 crore,” said fisheries minister, Akhil Giri. “The sudden influx of huge quantities of “washed away” prawns led to steady dips in prices, with supply exceeding demand. While the permanent stalls sold prawns at least Rs 150 below normal price, those, who sat with temporary dalas, sold them at Rs 200-250 less than usual price,” said Arup Pal, a fish-wholesaler at Maniktala market. Fish sellers said that truckloads of prawns had entered the market since Thursday night from Digha and many other places where prawn is bred because incessant rains had led to a flooding. These prawns have been netted by breeders who transported them to the city market. Such distress sale has resulted in a drastic price drop. Writer Amar Mitra felt sad that all sizes of prawns were available at the Belgachhia market but he could not buy any because of his allergy towards it. “This is a common phenomenon every time when there is flooding,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/markets-see-distress-sales-of-washed-away-prawns/articleshow/83046344.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra adds 5k more deaths through ‘data reconciliation’||Mumbai: In a span of 12 days, Maharashtra has added 5,000 more deaths to its official Covid toll over and above the daily casualties, in what is being described as a “data reconciliation” exercise. Between May 17 and May 28, 11,712 deaths were added to the state's cumulative list of Covid fatalities. Of these, 6,622 were recorded in the daily updates while the remaining 5,090 were included through a data-updating exercise. Most of the additions have come from Pune, Aurangabad, Satara, Solapur, Bhandara, Ahmednagar and Wardha. The reasons cited by officials for this delayed revision in death statistics ranges from technical glitches to overworked staff missing deadlines to new formats for updating data. Till the first week of May, when over 800 deaths were added to the state toll daily, even those that had occurred over a week back were included in the figure. However, an official said deaths that are over a week old are now classified into a separate sub-group that does not reflect in the daily toll. “These old deaths only show up in the cumulative data,” he said. A health official from Ratnagiri said all or most deaths are reported on time, but feeding the data into the central government's portal is a task because of manpower crunch. “Hospitals are burdened with high volumes of cases, forcing data updation to take the backseat," he said. Moreover, some districts faced erratic power and internet connectivity due to the cyclone last entire week, further affecting daily reporting. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology department of the state government's public health department, said, “There are many reasons contributing to the need for reconciliation of data. Deaths happen in different hospitals, with each hospital needing to send the data to the district authorities. But in many hospitals, including those in the private sector, most of the available staff are busy in treatment of Covid patients and (only) one or two members are given the task of managing data.” In June 2020, BMC was forced to carry out a similar reconciliation exercise after it emerged that many private hospitals sent death data after long intervals. In a single day, the toll in Mumbai then went up by 451. However, the city has never data reconciliation problem since then. “Mumbai has a separate IT cell to handle its portal, but this is not possible for many districts,” said an official. Dr Awate said the state health department is in regular touch with the staff in 36 districts and 27 corporations seeking updates. On days, the state update contains reconciled data from 26 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-adds-5k-more-deaths-through-data-reconciliation/articleshow/83048847.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Delhi||Delhi govt readies for free ration to those without cards||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has started preparations for providing free ration to needy people without ration cards. Food & civil supplies minister Imran Hussain held a meeting on Friday to review distribution of free ration to the 72 lakh card holders as well as those without ration cards in view of the Covid-19 lockdown. Hussain said Delhi government would distribute 4kg wheat and 1kg rice per person for free to non-PDS (public distribution system) beneficiaries, who didn’t possess any ration card. He said the foodgrains would be distributed from one school in each of the 280 wards of the capital and directed officials to regularly visit the shortlisted schools for effective coordination. The non-PDS ration will be distributed from these designated schools from 10am to 4pm on all days except Sunday. Each identified school will be provided a login ID and password for entering the stock received in the system for proper record keeping and for the purpose of registration at the site and distribution, a government statement said. It stated that the government was taking this relief initiative for needy people without ration cards, including unorganised and migrant workers, construction labourers and domestic workers etc. The benefit of ration under this initiative will be provided initially to a maximum of two lakh beneficiaries and later as per demand and need assessment from the field, up to a maximum of 20 lakh beneficiaries, it added. Welcoming the provisions of walk-in registration and self-certification, Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA), which has been raising the issue of people without ration cards, wrote in a letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal that they were concerned when the distribution of ration would start. “There has already been an inordinate delay in the announcement of the scheme and the issuance of these guidelines and it is imperative that the distribution begins immediately to prevent hunger and starvation deaths among the economically vulnerable who have lost their livelihoods on account of the lockdown,” the letter stated. It also said that providing ration to maximum 20 lakh beneficiaries was inadequate. “Last year, following the orders of Delhi High Court in the DRRAA case, 69.6 lakh people who did not possess ration cards registered under the e-coupon scheme and were provided rations,” the letter stated. DRRAA also said that last year, an essential kit consisting of cooking oil, pulses, sugar, salt and masalas was also provided along with rice and wheat and a similar kit should be provided this time too. Delhi government didn’t respond to a query sent on the issues raised by DRRAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-readies-for-free-ration-to-those-without-cards/articleshow/83046371.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This is part of a pan-India move by IMA, demanding action against Ramdev. “In its action committee meeting last evening, IMA decided that every state unit will lodge complaint at local police stations against Ramdev. He has not only ridiculed modern medicine but also tried to mislead people on vaccination,” said IMA state secretary Santanu Sen, who is also IMA’s former national president. This FIR comes three days after the doctors’ body shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to take appropriate action against Ramdev. “Ramdev has said that Covid patients are suffering and dying more due to modern medicine that cannot treat coronavirus. He has also said that more than 10,000 doctors have died even after taking both the doses of the vaccine, which is absolutely false,” said the West Bengal IMA’s complaint registered with Sinthi police station’s officer-in-charge Animesh Howaldar . “By spreading such misleading and false information, he is creating confusion during this pandemic, which is a serious offence,” said the complaint. “We have no issues with the ayurveda branch of medicine. But don’t try to mix ayurveda with allopathy. Ramdev is not even a qualified ayurveda doctor. But since he has his own set of followers, his loose comments could cause vaccine hesitancy among some people whereas IMA from day one has been trying to promote vaccination as a strong weapon against the pandemic,” said Sen, who himself is a doctor and also a Rajya Sabha MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ima-files-fir-against-ramdev/articleshow/83046354.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Delhi: Water-stressed areas most vulnerable to dengue too||NEW DELHI: The north and south municipal corporations have prepared a list of 175 areas vulnerable to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.  A large number of these localities overlap with water-stressed regions where jerry cans and drums are used to store water, municipal officials say. These containers become breeding sites for both Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes. An analysis of mosquito breeding data from three civic bodies shows that at 38%, peri-domestic containers — vases, flower, money plant and bird pots, tins, tyres, fountains etc — account for the largest chunk of mosquito breeding sites. The report also reveals that domestic storage containers — drums, bucket, jerry cans etc — come second at 33%. Desert coolers — which find significant usage in Delhi in the summer — and overhead tanks come third and fourth. A senior official of the public health department said the contribution of each category kept on varying all through the year with domestic water storage containers and desert coolers being the largest contributors in the summer. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said a list of dengue-vulnerable areas in all six zones had been prepared to chalk out the strategy for anti-mosquito measures. “Domestic breeding checkers will visit all houses in these areas to check water containers for mosquito breeding and use temphos and larvicides in water coolers,” he said, adding that out of the 123 locations, 80% are in unauthorised colonies with poor water supply. Similarly, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has prepared a list of 52 locations, mostly in unauthorised colonies. “People here either procure water from private suppliers or water tankers. The drums used to store water become a hotspot for mosquito breeding,” an official said. Under the City Sadar-Paharganj zone, the vulnerable areas include Ballimaran, Ram Nagar, Qureshi Nagar, Sitaram Bazar and Anand Parvat while in Karol Bagh zone, the locations are in Dev Nagar, East Patel Nagar, Ranjit Nagar, Karmpura, Moti Nagar, Inderpuri and Naraina. The vulnerable areas identified by the south corporation include Nizamuddin Basti, Sarai Kale Khan, Nangli Razapur, Abul Fazal Enclave, Sangam Vihar, Govindpuri, Zakir Nagar, Shaheen Bagh, Madanpur Khadar, Arjun Nagar, Gautam Nagar, Hauz Rani and Ambedkar Basti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-stressed-areas-most-vulnerable-to-dengue-too/articleshow/83048809.cms||Paras Singh

The administration has published vacancies for 13 doctors including ENT specialist, physicians, intensivist, among others along with 40 nurses and other allied staff. The salaries for the doctors are in the range of Rs 2.5 lakhs per month while experts and surgeons will be paid Rs 15000 for every case handled. The hospital is presently admitting mucor cases that is handled by a team of around 10 including inhouse experts and allied staff, said officials. “We are setting up a dedicated ward with ten beds and an independent operation theatre for handling all mucormycosis-related cases at the Kalwa CSM hospital. There is an existing team which will see an upgrade with experts being invited to join and tackle all cases more effectively,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner at the Thane corporation. ENT specialist Dr Ashish Bhumkar who is a crucial member of the task force formed to tackle the new challenge said the issue of adding more experts was discussed with guardian minister Eknath Shinde. The cases are much in control, but Dr Bhumkar said he is working towards controlling the mucor situation in the next 100 days. "The cases of infection were likely to be more in heavy uncontrolled diabetic patients and complications bound to aggravate when affected during Covid. As the symptoms of the infection could easily go unnoticed, we are looking at setting up a testing facility as well at the CSM hospital," said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-thane-builds-up-team-to-fight-fungus/articleshow/83050330.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh, umbrella organization of traders from the district, has issued a written memorandum to the district collector pointing out the financial distress that the traders are facing due to lockdown and also highlighted the issue of government failing to give any relief package. Organisation’s president Jagannath Kale said, “Traders are being forced to pay rent, power bills, employees’ salaries, bank instalments from their savings. The consecutive lockdowns and restrictions have already robbed off the traders of their savings.” He said that it is high time traders are allowed to open shops from at least 7 am to 4 pm so that traders not only are able to comfortably cater to the customers, but also the customers avoid making rush due to smaller window periods. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel has issued a statement supporting the demand to open the markets and went on to state that irrespective of the number of offences the administration, civic body or police register against the traders, they will go ahead with opening of the markets. Jaleel, as well as the traders, have been citing the falling number of Covid-19 cases in the district as the reason to allow the markets to open. Already the businesses have suffered tremendous loss as barring few, all of them were restricted during the festive seasons. Traders have also expressed concerns about most traders defaulting on payment of commercial taxes on their businesses, especially for the last two months.

DCPCR has been conducting several rounds of surveys to evaluate the distribution through anganwadis under Integrated Child Development Scheme. “Combating malnutrition is the key to children’s cognitive, social and emotional growth. Anganwadis can play the most crucial role in it. I am glad that our latest survey found that beneficiaries are receiving their nutritional supplements,” said DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu. “I compliment the anganwadi workers who despite such difficult circumstances have ensured that the rights of children and pregnant women are respected,” he added. Last year, during the lockdown, the scheme was initiated by Delhi government’s women and child development department under which lactating mothers and children below 6 years receive nutritional supplements from anganwadi centres. As per the scheme, 1,300gm dalia, 260gm black channa, 130gm jaggery and 130gm roasted black gram are given to each child. For a pregnant woman, 1,690gm dalia, 260gm black channa, 130gm jaggery and 130gm roasted black gram are earmarked. During a surprise door-to-door inspection last June, minister Rajendra Pal Gautam had found several irregularities. He had ordered suspension of two anganwadi workers and a supervisor and an audit of all distribution centres. Since last year, DCPCR has found, there has been a consistent-yet-significant improvement in the reach. The beneficiaries have reported that they have now been receiving the right quantity of ration at the designated time. Gautam has been conducting another round of surprise inspection this year too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/91-of-children-pregnant-women-beneficiaries-are-getting-nutritional-items/articleshow/83046378.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

One of the conditions for use is the patient should not have developed natural antibodies. “We had to do the antibody test to ascertain their status before starting the infusion little before 11pm,” added Surana. Although the drug can be give as an outpatient shot, these patients with fever have been kept in hospital for observation. The monoclonal antibodies have emerged as a replacement for plasma therapy. “I would give plasma to my immune-compromised patients. After it was struck off, the antibody cocktail is an option,” said Nagvekar, who believes patients with organ failure would benefit most. A public hospital doctor said the treatment is expensive and would not be reimbursed by insurance firms as it is an OPD procedure. “Patients have to be given the IV infusion over an hour and can go home. There is a question of raising over half a lakh which may not be easy for the elderly and middle class families,” he said. Also, UK studies have shown the cocktail isn’t always effective against new variants.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Report calls for self-audit of oxygen use by hospitals||New Delhi: A report by IIT- Delhi on Covid management and preparation for the future wave has put forward a proposal for self-audit of oxygen by the hospitals, which can be validated and verified by independent experts to improve the efficiency of its utilisation. With BJP demanding an independent audit of oxygen utilisation and Delhi government arguing for a study of allocation of oxygen by the Centre, the issue has been a cause of disagreement between the parties. The report — IITD Review and Recommendations for Management of Oxygen during Covid-19 Crisis for GNCTD — drew three scenarios in case of a third wave and made nine broad recommendations to overcome the challenges. “First, hospitals can conduct self-audit to determine the efficiency of oxygen usage and submit the report to Delhi government. Second, the audit reports submitted by the hospitals can be validated and verified by independent experts,” the report stated and listed hospitals, Delhi government and the independent experts as stakeholders for this process. Increasing the oxygen utilisation efficiency would help address the need to build an infrastructure for captive oxygen generation and a storage capacity, which would become crucial in preparing for the peak patient load expected during the third wave, it added. Last month, Delhi faced a massive oxygen crisis when many hospitals ran out of oxygen forcing administrators to make SOS calls on social media platforms. In some cases, several deaths of patients due to lack of oxygen supply at the hospitals were also reported. On May 6, the central government had pushed a plea in the Supreme Court seeking oxygen utilisation in the capital, while Delhi government had opposed the move requesting the court to order an audit of what it said was “the Centre’s arbitrary allocation of oxygen and mismanagement of transportation to Delhi and other states.” On May 8, the apex court had set up a panel comprising director Randeep Guleria, Max Hospital’s Sandeep Budhiraja and an IAS officer each from the Centre and Delhi government to carry out an audit of supply, distribution and utilisation of oxygen supply in Delhi. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had argued that Delhi’s demand of 700MT liquor medical oxygen was way beyond its requirement, which could be met with 500-600 MT. NEW DELHI:Representing Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra had accused the Centre of indulging in witch-hunt against the AAP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/report-calls-for-self-audit-of-o2-use-by-hospitals/articleshow/83073477.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nashik police to inquire into graft allegation against Parab||Nashik/Pune: Nashik City police commissioner Deepak Pandey has set up a three-member panel of officers of the rank of deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to inquire into the allegations of corruption and bribery levelled by a suspended motor vehicle (MV) inspector from Nashik RTO against state transport minister Anil Parab, transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne and five other senior department officials. Parab and Dhakne have termed the allegations baseless, motivated and aimed at “maligning” the department’s image and demoralising the staff. Gajendra T Patil, the MV inspector who was placed under suspension on January 20 over alleged corruption charges, emailed his complaint application against Parab, Dhakne and the five others to Panchavati police on May 16, with copies to the Nashik police chief, DG of the state anti-corruption bureau, central probe agencies like CBI and ED, and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar seeking registration of an FIR. Patil has prima facie accused a senior official from Wardha RTO of being the “kingpin behind a syndicate operating in the transport department”. He alleged that there was “rampant corruption” in transfers and postings “with crores of rupees collected and distributed among a chain of individuals from top to bottom”. Further, he alleged corruption in the functioning of border checkposts, settlement of cases against transport owners and illegal registration of BS-4 vehicles even after the March 31, 2020, cut-off date set by the Supreme Court. Taking prima facie cognizance of the complaint, Pandey ordered setting up the inquiry panel under DCP (crime) Sanjay Barkhud with DCPs Amol Tambe and Vijay Kharat. “I have asked the panel to submit its report to me within five days, but more time will be given if required,” Pandey told TOI . He said Patil was called to the police station on May 27, but he did not come. Patil told TOI, “I have said whatever I wanted to in my complaint application...I have nothing further to say on the issue at this juncture.” When contacted, Parab told TOI, “The allegations stem from a political vendetta against me to tarnish my image. Patil has been suspended since there were several charges against him. Just like in the case of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, there is an attempt to somehow demand a CBI investigation against me. The police asked Patil to come to the police station and record his statement, but he did not turn up. He was asked for evidence by the police, but he has failed to provide the same.” Dhakne said, “I took charge as transport commissioner in the last week of August last year. So far, no one has ever accused me of wrongdoing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-nashik-police-to-inquire-into-graft-allegation-against-parab/articleshow/83050432.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||150 students of private school urge PM Modi to cancel Class XII Boards||NEW DELHI: With the Centre yet to take a decision on the Class XII Board examinations, 150 students of a private school in the city have signed a letter addressed to the Prime Minister seeking cancellation of the exams. They are facing anxiety and many are also battling grief and loss due to Covid-19, and aren’t in a state to appear for the exams, the students wrote. Most state governments are known to have written in favour of an offline examination and the Centre will take a decision on June 1. Riya Mukherjee, a student of Delhi Public School, initiated the move and also circulated a Google form among students/parents to know their opinion. Close to 88% of the respondents said they were not in favour of any offline exam; the rest said they would prefer an online examination. “I have got acceptance from a foreign university and have to submit my final high school transcript by August. Otherwise, my admission will be cancelled,” Mukherjee told TOI. “Because of this, I have been facing severe anxiety. A lot of my friends are grieving loss of grandparents, relatives. How are we to give the exam?” According to the letter, mailed to the PM and his office, “Under this challenging scenario... any decision on offline exams at this stage and delay in results will further worsen the situation through mental stress and depression.” The letter continues, “It may be disastrous to move for offline examinations. Social distancing during entry and exit, using washrooms without proper sanitisation, using masks continuously for several hours during summer may be hazardous for the health.” The students have said either of the CBSE options is not viable. Mukherjee said, “My best friend’s mother had also got Covid. She is a single mother, so my friend only had to manage everything.” In the worst-case scenario, students have suggested, results be based on the internal assessments of mid-term and pre-Boards or an online examination through multiple-choice questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/150-students-of-private-school-urge-pm-to-cancel-class-xii-boards/articleshow/83046413.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||HC tells principal secy to track progress of Dwarka hosp project||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday ordered weekly monitoring of progress in completion of a 1,200-bedded super specialty hospital in Dwarka, which was supposed to come up in 2019. Taking stock of the status of Indira Gandhi Hospital, which is supposed to be a Covid- 19 dedicated hospital and is currently running with 250 beds, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed the principal secretary (home) of Delhi government to monitor the progress. It also instructed the officer to fix accountability for the delay in the project and take appropriate disciplinary action against those found guilty of any lapse or negligence, since the hospital was to be initially ready by February 2017 itself. The bed capacity was later increased from 700 to 1,241 and the revised completion date was fixed as September 2019, but it is still not fully functional. The court underlined that it wants to get the hospital up and running since at this stage, the focus is to find Covid beds, including those equipped with ICU and ventilators. It also asked the AAP government to file another affidavit giving details on the specialised departments, along with the number of ICU beds and ICU beds with ventilators, which will be available once the institution becomes fully functional. The court has been constantly nudging the government to complete the project. It had recently asked the government to fix timelines and give reasons for the delay. Delhi government said due to the lockdown, the pace had been tardy but it would now have a timeline with an eye on the third wave of coronavirus. Advocate YP Singh, representing petitioner Dwarka Court Bar Association, maintained that the government had not come with clean hands on the issue of delay in constructing the facilities. He had earlier informed the court that even in the 250-bedded facility, there are no ICU or ventilator beds and only patients with mild bout of the disease can be admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-tells-principal-secy-to-track-progress-of-dwarka-hosp-project/articleshow/83046456.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Thane||Mumbai reports 924 Covid cases, lowest daily count in 87 days||MUMBAI: While Mumbai on Friday recorded its lowest number of Covid-19 cases in 87 days, Maharashtra is staring at another grim milestone: the highest ever monthly toll for any Indian state due to Covid-19. Covid deaths for the month of May are likely to touch 25,000 on Saturday, making the month the deadliest so far since the outbreak of the pandemic. Maharashtra has recorded 24,385 deaths in May so far, just 615 short of the 25,000 mark. The entire pandemic toll of the capital Delhi, one of the worst-hit regions in the second wave, is around 23,000 so far. Although Maharashtra has added 19,295 deaths as part of its daily addition, over 5,090 additional deaths have been added to the cumulative toll in the span of 12 days as part of a reconciliation exercise. The highest deaths earlier—13,835—were reported in the month of April 2021. Mumbai’s Covid case graph dipped below 1,000 on Friday after March 2, when 849 cases were detected. On Friday, the city health authorities added 924 cases and 30 deaths, taking the cumulative tally since March 2020 to 7.02 lakh cases and toll to 14,750. More deaths in 2nd Covid wave, but CFR lower, says govt expertThe city on Friday recorded its lowest number of Covid-19 cases in 87 days. Mumbai also recorded one of its lowest test positivity rates—3.1%—with 29,573 tests conducted in a 24-hour period. The city’s positivity rate has been below 5% since March 24. “The Covid-19 situation in Mumbai has improved. Beds in every category, be it regular, oxygen-support or ICU, are available in most public as well as private hospitals,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital, who is the coordinator of private hospitals with the BMC. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell in the state government’s public health department, said, “Many more people were affected in the second wave than during the first. Hence the deaths are likely to be higher as well.” The second wave has affected double the number of people than the first in Maharashtra. However, Dr Awate said despite the higher number of deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) is lower during the second wave. “CFR was over 2.5 in September last year, but it is around 1.5 these days,” he said. The state reported 20,740 cases on Friday, taking the total caseload to 56.9 lakh, and 424 fatalities were reported and 549 old deaths added, taking the total death toll to 93,198. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said though daily positivity rate of the state was in single digits and it was steadily on the decline, “we have directed all districts to ensure that they are not randomly testing people to report a drop in positivity. Tests have to be conducted on targeted population – highand low-risk contacts of a positive patient.” He also said that for better management of Covid patients and to reduce fatalities, especially in rural areas, districts have been asked to ensure home quarantine is discouraged. On a positive note, active cases in the state dropped below 3 lakh and were fewer than the highest active cases reported in the first wave. The state had reported 3.01 lakh active cases in September 2020. On Friday, it had 2.8 lakh active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-more-deaths-in-2nd-covid-wave-but-cfr-lower-says-govt-expert/articleshow/83054425.cms||Malathy Iyer

This is the third pharmaceutical company in Vidarbha after Wardha’s Genetek Lifesciences and Unijules at Hingna MIDC.Arco, which manufactures Covid drug Heparin sodium, Dexamethasone sodium phosphate and also Vitamin C injections, has a capacity to produce 10,000 vials of Amphotericin B Emulsion per day. The latter is considered lesser nephrotoxic than deoxycholate version of Amphotericin B, and has lesser side effects on the kidney, say doctors. Though Genetek could kick-start it’s Amphotericin B Emulsion production, whose first batch would be ready by early next week, the paucity of raw materials may delay the production at Unijules and also Arco. Sources from Unijules claimed they had already started placebo trials at their laboratory and will immediately start the process once the raw material is received from their Gujarat-based agents. Unijules also has sought permission to prepare two other Covid drugs, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone.Apart from Amphotericin B, Arco already has permission to manufacture anti-coagulant Enoxaparin injections and may start ampule production by next month, said director Narendra Agrawal. “We are dependent on the availability of raw material for Amphotericin B. It would take at least a month for us to be ready with the product,” said Agrawal. Their Heparin Sodium injection is sold in Gujarat too while Dexamethasone sodium phosphate has market in Telangana. Agrawal also said he has sought permission to manufacture more Covid drugs like methylprednisolone and also Defense Research and Development Organization’s (DRDO) latest release glucose analogue 2DG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-co-arco-gets-permission-to-manufacture-ampho-b/articleshow/83044806.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||Two, including teenager, held for cheating kin of Covid-19 patients in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Two people, including an 18-year-old woman, have been arrested for allegedly cheating the kin of Covid-19 patients on the pretext of providing them medicines like Amphotericin B and remdesivir. In the first case, a man named Ayush Singh (26) was arrested for duping people in the name of selling medicine for the treatment of black fungus. Singh, a BCom graduate, allegedly duped around two dozen people to the tune of Rs 10 lakh, said DCP Santosh Meena. The victims belong to Dwarka, Mayur Vihar, Gurgaon and Noida in Delhi-NCR, apart from other states. The complainants said they were duped on the promise of being provided liposomal Amphotericin B injections after they called a number provided on social media. The man asked for advance payment of Rs 25,000 from each victim. After the money was deposited, the accused blocked them. “Two high-end Android phones, two ATM cards and Rs 17,500 in cash were seized from him and Rs 96,000 was frozen in his bank account,” said Meena. In the second case reported from south Delhi, the 18-year-old woman duped people of Rs 2.25 lakh by claiming to be a seller of the remdesivir injection. The accused woman is a resident of Madhya Pradesh. Two mobile phones, passbook, cheque books, four ATM cards and Rs 32,400 in cash were seized from her and Rs 1.33 lakh was found stashed in a bank. The suspect was tracked after police receiving a complaint from a Defence Colony resident, who contacted the woman after getting her number on social media. The victim was asked to pay Rs 32,400 for five vials of the injection. “The amount was transferred by the complainant through netbanking. However, the woman then stopped responding to his phone calls. Subsequently, an FIR was registered and investigation taken up,” said DCP Atul Thakur. The transactions were tracked and the accused, Vartika, was arrested. During interrogation, she disclosed that she saw an opportunity during the pandemic to earn money by cheating people as her father owns a medicine shop. She is a student of psychology and quite active on social media, which she used to pick up SOS leads, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-including-teenager-held-for-cheating-kin-of-covid-19-patients/articleshow/83048986.cms||---

However, neither a pathologist nor a member of Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) was included in the panel has already kicked up a row. Maharashtra Association of Practicing Pathologists and Microbiologists (MAPPM), a state-level organization of pathologists, has written to the additional chief secretary of public health, Maharashtra, and raised objection over this committee. “All the non-governmental members appointed in this committee are technicians and they are not medical doctors. Neither of them is a pathologist. As per existing laws as well as several decisions of high court, qualified pathologists are only authorized to run a clinical lab. We appeal to dissolve this committee,” reads the letter issued by Dr Sandeep Yadav, president of MAPPM.The non-governmental members in this committee have qualifications like MSc in microbiology and biochemistry. Dr Ajay Soni from Nagpur is the only PhD holder in this committee. He said microbiologists and biochemists are the backbones of any laboratory and deserve the representation. “None of the members applied or recommended for membership but we have been appointed by the state government based on the work we have been doing since the last many years. I have been writing to the central government during the process of amendment of Clinical Establishments Rules,” said Dr Soni.According to him, biochemists and microbiologists are the backbones of clinical diagnosis and their appointments on the committee should be welcomed.“The government has taken a major decision to curb the activities of illegal and bogus medical laboratories. We will formulate guidelines, suggest concrete measures to control the functioning of illegal and bogus laboratories, and recommend measures to cap the rates charged by them,” he added.Labs in limbo State has formed 10-member panel to regulate path labs 5 in the panel are govt officials, 5 are non-govt members Non-govt members are microbiologists and biochemists, not doctors Patholgists (MD-Path) want their representation on the committeeNo need of technicians on it, dissolve the committee, demand MAPPM||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-pathologist-in-state-panel-to-regulate-clinical-labs/articleshow/83044827.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

No one was harmed in Friday's incident, as the leopard was seen quietly walking in the car parking area around 5am when the milkman happened to spot it. He immediately retracted his steps and later informed the watchmen of Green View Society. The society has had a previous leopard sighting in November 2017. Wildlife activist of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) Pawan Sharma, who closely works along with forest officials to save and rescue wildlife species, said: ‘“Aarey Colony is well known for having leopards around. They usually come out of SGNP into Aarey Colony while searching for food.” —Vijay Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/milkman-spots-leopard-on-a-walk-in-bldg-at-goregaon-e-in-mumbai/articleshow/83050489.cms||---

In letters sent from his personal email on May 25, the BMC chief said to avoid the severity of Covid infection and effectively handle a probable third wave, vaccination is very important. Mumbai is currently in the grip of a second wave that has proved far more intense than the earlier one. Citing expert opinion, he said a third wave may be expected in Mumbai from July- August onwards. “Being a Sister City of Mumbai, may I humbly request your good self to help and provide access to vaccine for Mumbai City? We are ready to pay the necessary charges well in advance. Please let us know the availability of vaccine along with its cost and bank details for depositing the requisite money. Mumbai, as a Sister City, will surely acknowledge your favour,” he added. Mumbai is connected to less than a dozen international cities through the Sister City International (SCI) concept. This non-profit citizen diplomacy network creates partnerships between communities and enables local bodies to seek global cooperation at the municipal level. Chahal mentioned that Mumbai has a population of 16 million, of whom about nine million are above 18 and thus eligible. So Mumbai needs at least 18 million doses of two-shot vaccines. The vaccination drive that started in the city since January 16 has delivered three million doses till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chahal-writes-to-sister-city-mayors-for-vaccine-help/articleshow/83049036.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Delhi districts fare well on Covid measures, lax on violations||NEW DELHI: An analysis of Covid-19 management done by the 11 districts of Delhi has shown them to be faring well on all parameters, except enforcement. Their performance was measured on various aspects, which included positivity rate, enforcing Covid-19 guidelines, taking action against lockdown violations, creating containment zones and tracing contacts of infected people to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The positivity rate was the highest in North district at 4.2% and the lowest in North East district at 0.3% on May 25. However, the positivity rate in all districts was below 5%. South district had the second highest rate at 3.7%, followed by South West at 3.6%, New Delhi 3.2%, South East 2.5% and Shahdara at 1%. During the peak of the second Covid wave, a few districts had positivity rate of over 50% with up to 3,800 cases being reported in a single day. District magistrate (North) Isha Khosla said they had increased surveillance, enforcement and containment, along with testing. “We have opened special vaccination sites for the specially abled and people without ID cards. Inoculation is being done for those aged above 45 at 27 schools,” she added. More than 50% of active cases in all districts are within containment zones. Efficient Covid-19 management parameters include keeping a minimum of 50% of the active cases inside containment zones so that residents can be monitoring properly. South district leads in this category by keeping 99.3% of active cases inside red zones, while North East district is at the lowest position with 67.5% cases. In Central district, 79.7% active cases are inside containment zones, East 69.3%, New Delhi 91.4%, North 75.8, South West 68.9%, North West 75.7%, Shahdara 86.7%, South East 81% and South West 68.9%. Enforcement has been far lower than the target of 1,000 violations per day. An official report released on May 24 showed that the Central district had taken action on 688 violations, East 243, New Delhi 232, North 348, North East 302, North West 156, Shahdara 771, South 304, South East 224, South West 325 and West 240. An official said enforcement action was below the target because the movement of individuals was restricted during the lockdown. With Delhi government increasing the number of tests being conducted daily, a few districts are also focusing on rural areas. A health department official said that tests had been enhanced over the past few days and would continue to be increased. “The tests are being conducted among a diverse group of people, which includes residents of slums and planned colonies and societies,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/districts-fare-well-on-covid-measures-lax-on-violations/articleshow/83046585.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students going abroad allowed walk-in for jabs||MUMBAI: BMC on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have received confirmation of admission in universities abroad and require to be vaccinated to travel. Students can visit three dedicated centres at Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli, Rajawadi in Ghatkopar and Cooper Hospital in Juhu to get the shots. The circular issued by BMC chief IS Chahal also stated that persons above 45 years would be allowed walk-ins for the first and second dose of Covishield. Frontline and healthcare workers would be allowed walk-in for second doses of Covishield as well as Covaxin. The differently abled would be given preference. On vaccination for lactating mothers, the BMC said women who have delivered in the past 12 months can take the jab. The birth certificate of the child would need to be produced. Tweeting on the relaxation for students, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said the BMC has arranged free, walk-in vaccination on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (May 31, June1, June2) at three civic centres. “Students need to carry I-20 or DS-160 form/ verified confirmation letter to foreign universities, along with personal identification documents,” he said, adding there could be around 2,000 students who are foreign-bound in the coming months. BMC said relaxation has been made for the 45-plus age category as nine lakh of the 19 lakh persons eligible in this age group are awaiting the first dose, while 78% in the 60-plus age category have got at least one dose. Meanwhile, a state official said that Maharashtra is expecting nearly 40lakh doses in June, which could boost the slacking vaccination drive. It is scheduled to receive 14,96,500 doses of Covishield and 4,51,050 doses of Covaxin in the first two weeks of June, the official said. The state is also expecting 15,95,900 doses of Covishield and 4,74,630 doses of Covaxin procured with its own funds. On Thursday, the state could vaccinate 2,80,756 citizens, taking the total number of doses administered to 2.16crore. Mumbai on Friday vaccinated 43,181 people. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city received around 20,000 doses which would suffice for Saturday. Vaccination on Saturday would continue to be strictly by appointment as has been the practice since the past two weeks. Meanwhile, BJP has planned a vaccination session for students in the 18-44 age group at Mulund’s Fortis Hospital on Saturday. There were many requests, said BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-going-abroad-allowed-walk-in-for-jabs/articleshow/83049128.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Goa||Goa government likely to extend current restrictions by at least a week||PANAJI: The state government is likely to extend the curbs imposed to control the spread of Covid-19 infections at least by a week. The current restrictions will end on May 31. “Any news that the extension of curfew has been decided is fake,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. “We may take a decision on it tomorrow (Saturday). There is a likelihood of extension of the curfew. But right now, no decision in this regard has been taken, and any news of extension is fake.” The state BJP has also called for extending the curbs at least by a week. “We’ve told the chief minister that considering the present Covid situation in the state, it is better to extend the restrictions at least by a week”, state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade told TOI. Sources said that the chief minister on Friday consulted some of his ministerial colleagues and senior bureaucrats over the extension of the curbs. When the Covid situation went out of hand, the state government announced a 15-day curfew on May 9, and on May 23, it was extended till the end of the month as cases were still high. In March-April, the government had dismissed demands for a partial lockdown even as experts warned of the second wave. The suspicion that a decision on extension of the curfew had already been taken by the Goa government was raised after Delta Corp wrote to the National Stock Exchange on Thursday indicating the same. “Please note that due to a surge in Covid-19 cases being witnessed in Goa, the government of Goa inter-alia has extended the lockdown in the state till June 15, 2021,” Delta Corp’s GM Dilip Vaidya wrote to stock exchanges. “Accordingly, the casinos operated by the company and its subsidiaries in Goa will remain closed during this period. We are unable to estimate the quantum of potential losses on account of this temporary closure and the pandemic at this time.” Intriguingly, the very next day on May 28, Delta Corp wrote to NSE stating that it had erroneously stated that the decision by the Goa government was already made (to extend the state curfew). “Further to our disclosure dated May 27, 2021, please note that the same was issued due to some confusion and error and accordingly stands withdrawn,” Vaidya said. “The lockdown in Goa continues till May 31, 2021, and we await further instructions and directions from the government of Goa...” Meanwhile, the Union ministry of home affairs has written to states, including Goa, reminding them that the number of active cases are still high at present, and that states should not be seen slacking in imposing curbs to control the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-likely-to-extend-current-restrictions-by-at-least-a-week/articleshow/83049091.cms||---

Terming the immunization as life-saving for 12–to 24-month-old children, senior child specialist, Dr OP Yadav said, “Children have low immunity and the vaccine administered to them acts as a protective shield against various diseases. If immunization is not taking place at the government centres, parents can buy the vaccine from the market and get it administered to children up to 2 years of age after consulting a doctor.” The observation is significant in the light of the World Health Organization (WHO) report which states, there is “high number of pending routine immunization sessions (1,399) since April 2021” in Agra district. In one session, around 25 children are immunized. The WHO has alerted the district health department to immediately start the immunization of the children left out. According to the health department officials, the routine immunization sessions did not take place as most of the staff at government hospitals, community and primary health centres are busy with handling the Covid-19 vaccination and other tasks related to the pandemic. Dr RC Panday, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “We have received the WHO report. Covid-19 hindered the routine immunization programme for children. A dedicated team is being constituted for immunization of the children in the age group 12 to 24 months. Special immunization camps will be organized across the district. We will ensure every child is immunized over the next one month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/35k-kids-not-immunized-against-common-diseases-due-to-covid-wave-in-agra-dist-who/articleshow/83044927.cms||---

---||Mumbai||On Bombay HC orders, Fr Stan Swamy moved to hospital||MUMBAI: Fr Stan Swamy, 84, lodged in Taloja jail in the Elgar Parishad case, was admitted to Holy Family Hospital in Bandra late Friday after the Bombay HC gave directions to shift him immediately for 15 days, reports Swati Deshpande. A vacation bench clarified it was passing the order in “peculiar facts and circumstances of this case,” after ASG Anil Singh for the NIA said sending him to a private hospital may set a “wrong precedent”. The NIA had arrested Fr Swamy from his Ranchi home last October. Senior counsel Mihir Desai with advocate Mihir Joshi for Fr Swamy had sought urgent directions, stating he “is unable to stand, eat or visit the toilet”. Desai informed the bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar that Fr Swamy’s attendants at the prison had said his “health was extremely precarious with reduced oxygen saturation and acutely fluctuating blood pressure”. He said the hospital expenses would be borne by Fr Swamy. A week ago, Fr Swamy in a virtual interaction with the vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade had refused to be shifted to any hospital, saying he preferred to await his death in prison. The bench had then permitted Desai to approach the HC before June 1 if the priest agreed by then to be shifted to Holy Family Hospital. Fr Swamy filed an affidavit on Friday requesting that he be shifted to the hospital. To Singh’s suggestion for admission to government-run JJ Hospital, the HC said it may not be possible for him to get personal attention there due to the pandemic and influx of patients. The ASG said if he was being sent to a private hospital, no other private individual should be allowed to attend to him. The HC directed the hospital to provide him with an attendant and to allow one police constable since he is an undertrial. It also allowed Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, parish priest of St Peter’s Church in Bandra, to meet Fr Swamy at the hospital subject to its protocols. One of his lawyers said after being moved to hospital, Fr Swamy joked with the staff saying, ‘Now I know I am in good hands’. Last October, the special NIA court had rejected Fr Swamy’s plea for medical bail. He then appealed against the order before HC in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/on-hc-orders-stan-swamy-moved-to-hosp/articleshow/83050645.cms||Swati Deshpande

Health minister Vishwajit Rane appealed to the people to get tested if they notice any symptoms, or if someone in their family has tested positive. “Lately, a lot of people are coming at a very late stage to get the required medical care. My first-hand experience was yesterday (Thursday), when a patient whose SpO2 fell to 80 had to immediately be shifted to GMC,” Rane said in a post on social media. On Friday, a 69-year-old male from Navelim was brought dead to hospital, and six patients died within a few of hospitalisation. A 35-year-old man from Ponda, who was youngest among the casualties of the day, had not undergone a Covid-19 test till he was brought in a critical condition to GMC on Thursday. A fourth of the 32 deaths were under 50, including a 38-year-old woman from Paroda who was hospitalised two days prior till she breathed her last.

A decision to the effect was taken during an online meeting of provosts of hostels and other varsity officials and chaired by vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor on Thursday. “A separate letter will be sent to the parents of the bonafide students who are still residing in the hostels by the provost concerned to ensure that their wards vacate and return to their respective home,” AMU authorities said, adding that this is necessary to ensure safety of students in the wake of the ongoing second wave of Covid. Meanwhile, students have objected to this decision, saying that it has been taken at a time when Covid cases are declining all over the country. They should have taken this decision earlier if it was needed. “Instead of sending them back home, the university administration should organize special camps and get all students vaccinated,” said a research scholar and former president of the AMU students union Faizul Hassan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-students-asked-to-vacate-hostels/articleshow/83044934.cms||---

Traders argue that just like factories and industries, there are thousands of daily wage workers associated with wholesale and retail markets earning their livelihoods by loading and unloading goods on a daily basis and have been denied any work for the past 40 days. Shopkeepers also stated that delay in permission for opening of markets will automatically make it difficult for them to pay salaries of their staff. “Even if the shops open, customers won’t come all of a sudden. But we can at least transport goods or supply orders to local vendors,” said Devraj Baweja of Sadar Bazar Traders Association. The Confederation of All India Traders has decided to call a meeting on Saturday and ask the government again to allow operations. CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said that as the positivity rate is about 1.5%, the markets should also have been allowed to open in a phased manner. The Chamber of Industries of Traders chairman Brijesh Goel said that all decisions regarding opening and closing of activities during lockdown are taken by the DDMA and not the government or CM. “DDMA is chaired by the LG and we will write to him to allow the opening of markets with restrictions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-unhappy-as-markets-fail-to-find-space-in-unlock-plans/articleshow/83049137.cms||Vibha Sharma

It will deal with important health related issues necessary to learn in the post-pandemic time. GSFC University’s faculty team has prepared a complete 30-hour course pack which will help the students understand epidemiology, identify the core epidemiologic functions and their application in public health practice. It will also help the students gain understanding of the relationship between the rise of infectious diseases, modern lifestyles, and interaction with the microbial world. “We will fail in our duty if we do not respond to the changing world at the right time and do not align with the emerging urgent needs of the society. ‘Read & respond dynamism’ is necessary for giving relevant and meaningful education,” said university’s provost Dr Nikhil Zaveri, adding that the more important aspect of the course is its utility in terms of learning healthy living practices. “Our students will be well-educated and skilful in the area of health and hygiene and will not only be ready to practice healthy living themselves but also will help others to follow the suit,” Zaveri said. In the basic nursing skills 2-credit course, students will learn basic treatment applications in order to prevent the initial delay in fundamental treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/engg-mgmt-students-to-be-given-lessons-in-covid-19/articleshow/83046347.cms||Prashant Rupera

One death each was reported from Darbhanga, Banka, Munger, Begusarai, Gaya, Bhojpur and Patna due to the impact of the cyclone. Besides, four persons were injured in Begusarai and one each in Banka and Gaya. As per a statement issued by the chief minister's office, the government announced an ex gratia of Rs4 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased. CM Nitish Kumar also ordered proper treatment of the injured persons. Meanwhile, with 213mm rainfall recorded between 8:30 am on Thursday and 8:30 pm on Friday, Purnia in northeast Bihar was the wettest place in the state, followed by Gaya (120mm), Nalanda (116), Patna (92mm). Other districts, which received a significant amount of rainfall, included Aurangabad Madhubani (43mm), Motihari (42mm), (42mm), Bhagalpur (32mm) and Forbesganj (25.2mm). Though wind speed remained mostly normal, widespread rainfall disrupted life across the state before the remnant of the cyclone further weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area on Friday. Large swathes of land in different districts were waterlogged due to the incessant rains on Thursday night, affecting standing crops such as maize, jute and makhana among others. The movement of several passenger trains was also affected as trees fell on railway tracks at several places and overhead wires got damaged at a few places. Also, a small portion of the approach road to Jai Prabha Setu, which connects Chhapra with Ballia in Uttar Pradesh (UP), caved in on Thursday night, leading to disruption in vehicular movement. After being suspended for 14 hours, flight operations resumed at the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport here from 9 am on Friday. Meanwhile, the Patna met office claimed that overcast and intermittent rainy conditions are likely to continue at least till Monday. Apart from the yellow-code warning for heavy rainfall at one or two places in north-east Bihar till Monday, the Patna meteorological centre has issued a forecast for thunder with rainfall at one of two places in all districts till June 1. Concerning the status of the cyclone, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its all-India bulletin issued at 7:45 pm on Friday stated that remnant of the very severe cyclonic storm Yaas has weakened as a low-pressure area and was situated over northeast Uttar Pradesh and neighbourhood. It also led to the formation of cyclonic circulation. The weather bulletin further stated that fairly widespread rainfall is expected in Bihar over the next two days, along with a warning of heavy rainfall at isolated places on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cyclone-yaas-leaves-seven-dead-in-bihar-floods-low-lying-areas/articleshow/83046336.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Dehradun||3 in 4 farm workers, daily wagers & service staff in Uttarakhand out of work for past 45 days||NAINITAL: A snap survey of agricultural labourers, daily wagers, domestic workers and hotel staff in the hills of Uttarakhand has found that 76% of them had no job for the past month and a half. Those surveyed in Tamil Nadu said they had to go without work for at least half of this period. This coincided with the second wave of Covid-19 and a strict curfew in the state. The survey was conducted by Delhi-based worker welfare organisation KISLAY Social Research Collective between May 19 and May 25, speaking to over 1,000 workers in Tehri, Rudraprayag and Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. “Almost half the workers we surveyed in Uttarakhand said they had to take loans to survive the period during the second wave. In Tamil Nadu, more than 90% had to,” Shankar Gopalakrishnan, one of the researchers associated with the survey, told TOI. “Most of them had borrowed from friends or relatives. In Dehradun, however, one in 10 took loans from other people — landlords, employers, moneylenders.” The other direct effect this extended unemployment period had was on food consumption. “Almost 83% of the participants in Dehradun, 93.67% of the participants in the hills of Uttarakhand and 96.75% of those interviewed in Tamil Nadu had had to reduce their consumption of at least one food item between April 1 and May 15 because of lack of money,” the report said. The cuts were made in what are considered supplements — fruits, milk and lentils. The report added that this “reduced intake will have tremendous impacts on nutrition, especially among children.” While they cut down on food, they do not seem to have received much assistance from the government. Among those surveyed in Uttarakhand, almost no one received free ration supplies or any other aid. Those in Tamil Nadu, however, almost every participant said they had received free ration supplies. Survey participants in Uttarakhand said access to healthcare also remained difficult. Almost a quarter of the workers surveyed in Uttarakhand said they had tried to register for the Covid-19 vaccine but had failed. What this has led to is varying degrees of dissatisfaction with governance. Half the hill workers of Uttarakhand in the survey said they were not satisfied with the state’s work and almost 40% were not happy with the Centre’s. Tamil Nadu workers, on the contrary, were happy with the state government but dissatisfied with the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-in-4-farm-workers-daily-wagers-service-staff-in-ukhand-out-of-work-for-past-45-days/articleshow/83044938.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||Delhi: From close to a lakh, active Covid-19 cases down to under 15,000 in a month||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 1,141 new Covid-19 cases on Friday from 71,853 tests with a positivity rate of 1.59%. The city recorded 139 Covid-19 fatalities in the last 24 hours and Friday was the third consecutive day when the number of fresh cases remained below the 1,500-mark, positivity rate remained below 2% and less than 150 deaths were recorded. The numbers, however, were slightly higher than the 1,072 new Covid-19 cases, a positivity rate of 1.53% and 117 fatalities recorded on Thursday. The number of tests on Thursday was also slightly lower at 70,068, including 49,348 RT-PCR tests. The new cases recorded in the last 24 hours were from 47,917 RT-PCR tests and 23,936 rapid antigen tests. Exactly a month ago, on April 28, the number of active cases stood at 99,725, an all-time high since the Covid-19 outbreak in Delhi in March 2020. On Friday, with 2,799 patients recovering from the disease, the figure stood at 14,581. In a month, the number of active cases crashed by 85.4%. The huge dip in this last one month was due to the number of Covid-19 patients recovering from the disease far outnumbering the number of fresh cases, particularly in the second half of May. Since May 13, hospitals in Delhi had also seen the number of patients getting discharged every day grow even as new admissions dipped. On Wednesday, Delhi hospitals saw 300 new Covid admissions, while the number of patients who were discharged was more than double at 644. Delhi recorded 130 Covid-19 fatalities on Wednesday, which was the first time the figure dipped below the 150-mark in seven weeks and the 117 deaths recorded on Thursday was the lowest since April 15, but the number has climbed up to 139 on Friday. This month saw the figure hovered around the 450-mark as the capital battled its deadliest wave of Covid-19 cases. The death toll was now 23,951 and a case fatality rate of 1.68%. The number of patients recuperating in home isolation as on Friday was 7,111, while 6,037 were admitted in hospitals. Out of the total 25,032 hospital beds, 18,995 were vacant, while 6,086 of the 6,332 beds in dedicated Covid care centres and 542 of the 606 beds in dedicated Covid health centres were vacant, according to the health bulletin shared by Delhi government. Out of the total 6,967 Covid ICU beds in Delhi, 3,696 were vacant at 10pm on Friday, according to Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Wednesday that the sharp dip in cases — from a high of more than 28,000 cases in a day last month — was due to the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-close-to-a-lakh-active-cases-down-to-under-15000-in-a-month/articleshow/83046634.cms||Sidharatha Roy

With this, Bengal crossed the milestone of administering 1 crore first doses. According to the Co-Win dashboard, a total of 1,01,14,162 people have received their first dose of vaccine since the drive started on January 16 and 38,51,939 got both their doses. With two more corporate hospitals in Kolkata—Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and Fortis Hospital Anandapur—resuming their vaccination drive on Friday and many others expected to re-launch the programme by next week, health officials hope the drive would gain further momentum. The state health secretary, Narayan Swaroop Nigam, also facilitated a meeting between private hospitals and Serum Institute of India on Friday so that vaccine procurement process could be accelerated. After procuring 50,000 Covishield doses on Thursday night, RTIICS resumed its inoculation drive by Friday afternoon, when it administered around 650 doses of the vaccine. “Around 90% of the first-dose recipients on the first day of the relaunch were between 18 and 44 years. Thirty of those who got their second doses were our employees. Initially, we would concentrate on on-site vaccination for a few days, but will start off-site programmes soon. We will begin the procurement process for the next lot very soon,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health. Fortis Hospital Anandapur, which has procured 40,000 doses of Covishield and17,000 Covaxin, started off its vaccination drive from its hospital as well as at camps in five housing apartments. Around 2,500 people were inoculated by them on Friday. “From Monday, we plan to open a vaccination centre at our Minto Park facility so that we can reach out to more people,” said Richa Singh Debgupta, chief of strategy and operations at Fortis Healthcare. AMRI Hospitals is also expected to get around 1 lakh Covishield doses and another consignment of Covaxin vials next week. So far, only Dhakuria and Mukundapur units have been carrying out the drive with limited Covaxin doses. “We plan an extensive vaccination drive from next week as we expect to procure a good number of vials in a couple of days. Apart from our hospital, we will be going to 120 corporates and associations. Also, we will have a community vaccination centre as the Salt Lake stadium,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. “We should get about 20,000 Covishield doses by Tuesday. We will start our drive the very next day,” said Simmerdeep Gill, COO CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. Peerless Hospital is also expecting its order by the first week of June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/inoculation-drive-gains-pace-state-crosses-1cr-1st-dose-mark/articleshow/83046596.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Goa||Expect 36,580 doses for 18-44 group next week, Goa government tells HC||PANAJI: The state government on Friday told the high court of Bombay at Goa that it is expecting 36,580 doses next week for the 18-44 age group. It also said that it was not possible to procure vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna due to storage difficulties. Although there is a stockpile of 2.5 lakh doses available for the 45+ age group, people are not coming forward to take the jab, the state told the bench. Advocate general Devidas Pangam said that people initially had doubts, but started coming forward after the second wave, when a sort of urgency is being felt. Pangam stated that the government has started special drives for the 45+ age group, which has received a good response. He added that the government is formulating a plan for vaccination and will announce it after a week. The government has identified certain frontline workers, he said. Regarding the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Pangam told the court that they require to be stored at -80 degrees C and -20 degrees Celsius, compared to Covishield and Covaxin, which can be stored at a temperature of 2-8 degrees C. The court asked the government to submit a timeline by which it would receive vaccines for the 18-44 age group. It also asked the government whether it is communicating its requirement and commitment to the Centre. At the last hearing, the court suggested that the government announce a date by which the 45+ should get vaccinated, failing which the vaccines for this category could be diverted for the 18-44 age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expect-36k-doses-for-18-44-group-next-wk-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/83049145.cms||---

Develop the present infrastructure by setting up more oxygen plants and improve logistics, set up paediatric critical care facilities and up-skilling of nursing and other medical staff to support paediatric cases through hands-on training and online sessions with experts,” Major General Dr Sabarigirish K, who is in-charge of medical health facilities of Indian Army in Uttar Bharat (UP, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh), told TOI. “The Army’s mortality rate during the first and second wave has been far lower than the national average,” he added. The main reasons Dr Sabarigirish, who is an ENT specialist and was a professor at the Armed Forces Medical College earlier, gave for the “lower mortality rate” were vaccination, Covid-appropriate behaviour, compulsory quarantine of every person returning from leaves, complete suspension of all social activities, zero-contact meetings unless important and regular health check-up.“All the troops were vaccinated without fail and Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed by everyone from top to bottom. Also we sent jawans on leaves in batches and upon returning they have to spend a compulsory 14-day quarantine period at a separate facility and their health condition is monitored. On 15th day, their Covid test is done and then only they are taken inside the camp,” said Dr Sabarigirish.When asked about the prevention steps taken for black fungus disease, he said, “There are not many authentic studies to identify the actual cause of this disease, so we are emphasising on early recognition while treating Covid patients. We screen every patient for the symptoms of black fungus disease on a daily basis. We also educate every patient about the possible symptoms of black fungus at the time of discharge from the hospital. We advise them to report immediately if they find any such symptoms, so that their treatment can be started.”When asked about the medical facilities provided to Army veterans, Dr Sabarigirish said, “Indian Army is giving equal priority to veterans as they are our integral part. We have formed ‘Atoot Bandhan Cell’ to address their health issues. Army hospitals are admitting them on priority. Counselling through voice and video calls are provided to the ones who need expert advice. We have requested our ex-officers to come early to our hospitals in case they or their family members have any medical emergency rather than delaying.”Army has set up four 50-bed hospitals with complete oxygen support besides various vaccination centres in Uttarakhand and UP. Patients are admitted at these hospitals through the command centre of civil administration. Army base workshop engineers had resurrected defunct oxygen plants in Agra, Etawah, Bulandshahr and Saharanpur districts on the request of civil administration and provided required logistic support and security for the transportation of oxygen vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/army-preparing-for-3rd-wave-with-3-pronged-strategy/articleshow/83044958.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The government has also initiated a process for global tendering to procure more vaccines. The government is set to purchase 2 lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech for age group of 18-44, of which there are approximately 6.5 lakh persons. The first batch of 32,870 Covishield doses was exhausted within a week, while a second batch 36,580 alloted for June for vaccinating the 18-44 age group is not sufficient to meet targets expeditiously, a government statement read. The state is awaiting guidelines from the Centre with regards to vaccinating persons under 18, of which there are around 4.65 lakh persons. Currently, the government’s Tika Utsav is underway for the 45+ age group that has been rather slow in getting the jab. On Friday, it was conducted at 36 centers, with 2,459 beneficiaries. As many as 5,359 people were vaccinated during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-crosses-5l-mark-for-doses-96k-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/83049175.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra decides on optional entrance exam for FYJC||PUNE: An optional entrance test for first year junior college (FYJC, Std XI) aspirants based on the SSC syllabus will decide admissions. Students attempting the exam will get preference during the admission sessions and seats that remain unfilled will be open for those who do not attempt the test, the Maharashtra State Council For Educational Research and Training said in its announcement on Friday. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said the entrance exam will be a leveller for students of all education boards. “Since students from other boards including CBSE, CICSE, IB and from other states will be assessed based on the methodology designed by their respective boards, there could be great injustice in considering the Std X assessment marks for admissions. Hence, it was decided to conduct the entrance exam,” she said. The first round of admissions will be opened for only students with CET scores. Thereafter students armed with Std X marks will be considered, Gaikwad said, adding no student will be without a seat Seats have remained vacant till the last round for many years. The minister said they expect the trend to continue this year too. “We will accommodate the students who have not given the entrance tests and want to take admission for FYJC based on their SSC marks,” she added. Institutions have been told to ensure that the graded subjects be given the required grade and entered into the state board’s computerised system. All information entered by schools in the system would be considered final.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-decides-on-optional-entrance-exam-for-fyjc/articleshow/83046598.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Agra||Hooch claims 18 in Aligarh, 15 critical||Agra: Every time a bottle of a local liquor brand was discarded, it was collected carefully, its dents beaten back into shape and then refilled — with spurious liquor — to be sold across licensed country-made liquor vends in Aligarh. On Friday, at least 18 people died and 15 others were hospitalised after consuming it. Twelve people have been booked, of whom five have been arrested, including a recently elected zila panchayat member. Police said Gangster Act and National Security Act will be used against them. Three excise officials, including the district excise officer, have been suspended. This is the sixth time this year that the state has been hit by a hooch tragedy. “Seven people who died were from Karsua village, four from Cherat and three from Andala village. Three were from other districts — Gautam Budh Nagar, Mathura, Pratapgarh — and one was from Bihar. Fifteen people are still in hospital — at Malkhan Singh District Hospital, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and a private hospital — undergoing dialysis,” Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh told TOI. All of those who died were labourers or daily wagers, seven of whom were in their 30s, four in their 50s, three in their 40s, two in their 60s and one in his 20s. The age of one of them is not known. “A magisterial inquiry has been ordered and the additional district magistrate (administration) will submit his report after the probe in 15 days," the DM added. Three FIRs have been filed against 12 individuals so far. “At Jawan, Lodha and Khair police stations, we have booked 12 people under sections 272 (adulteration of food or drink), 273 (sale of food or drink which has turned noxious), 307 (attempt to murder) and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC, and Section 60A of the UP Excise Act (mixing noxious substance with intoxicant and selling of noxious substance under the garb of intoxicant),” Aligarh SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said. The three main accused in the case are Anil Chaudhary, who won the recent panchayat elections as a zila panchayat member from Gonda block, Rishi Pal Sharma, a block panchayat member from Kastali and a person named Vipin Yadav, believed to be the procurer. Chaudhary and Sharma allegedly own more than 60 ‘benami’ (in which the identity of the owner is concealed) liquor vends, a police officer said. Yadav allegedly sold his illicit liquor stock at these vends. So far, five people have been arrested. “Chaudhary, their contractor Digpal’s son Narendra, a salesperson at one of these vends Ajay, and the licensee of Karsua and Andala liquor vends Ganga Sahai,” Agra zone ADG Rajeev Krishna said. Yadav and Sharma are absconding and police have announced a Rs 50,000-reward for information about them. “Gangster Act and National Security Act will be used against them. Their illegally gained property will be seized. Six teams have been formed to investigate this,” he added. Additional chief secretary (excise) Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, meanwhile, suspended three excise officials — district excise officer Dheeraj Sharma, Rajesh Kumar Yadav and Ashok Kumar Pradhan. Earlier in the day, Sharma had told TOI that four shops where spurious liquor was being sold have been sealed and liquor samples sent for analysis to a lab in Meerut. “Nearly 500 liquor shops, including 249 country-made liquor shops, are licensed in Aligarh. All are being temporarily shut down for the next 24 hours to collect samples,” he had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hooch-claims-18-in-aligarh-15-critical/articleshow/83044940.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 20 ICU beds at Mulund centre instead of 215, BJP seeks probe||MUMBAI: Mulund’s Richardson and Cruddas jumbo Covid centre was supposed to have 215 ICU beds, as per the work order issued by the Cidco, but only 20 ICU beds were set up when the facility was handed over to the BMC and started in July 2020. BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha has written to CM Uddhav Thackeray seeking a probe into why Oaks Management Consultancy had set up only 20 ICU beds instead of 215 ICU and 75 dialysis beds. TimesViewThere was a major shortage of ICU beds in the second Covid-19 wave. If 215 ICU beds had been set up at the Mulund jumbo centre, it would have helped during the second wave. The BMC must ensure that as it sets up more jumbo centres for the third wave, the need for ICU and oxygen beds must be calibrated with inputs from health experts. All infrastructure must be created in a way that it is optimally used.The BJP has blamed “poor planning” by the authorities for the massive shortage of ICU beds during the second wave. “This clearly shows a lack of planning on the part of the BMC and Cidco. Had all 215 beds been set up, we would not have struggled to create new ICU beds in Mulund during the second wave. This is why we have lost so many lives in this suburb. The BMC must blacklist the firm for doing a shoddy job,” Kotecha said. According to the documents reviewed by TOI, on May 19, 2020, Cidco issued a work order to Oaks Management Consultancy to build the 1,850-bed Mulund jumbo centre comprising 1,560 isolation beds, 215 ICU beds and 75 dialysis beds on rental basis. Cidco was to pay the firm over Rs 10.9 crore. Responding to TOI, Rahul Gomes, MD of Oaks Management Consultancy Pvt Ltd (OMCPL), said, “OMCPL was contracted to work only on the infrastructure, which included hangars, toilets, donning doffing areas, contactless chambers, dedicated Covid healthcare centre (DCHC) beds and covering of common areas.” He said OMCPL was asked to build seven hangars of which five were to be used for air-conditioned DCHC and two were to be used as ICU/ dialysis units, which were to be non-AC as they would need an HVAC air-conditioning system. “But a week before the handover, OMCPL was informed by Cidco that the ICU infr-astructure was to be converted into a war room and additional air-conditioned DCHC beds will have to be set up,” said Gomes. “At time of the handover, Cidco and BMC conducted a detailed audit. We were paid only as per elements on site; Cidco made deductions as per the audit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-20-icu-beds-at-mulund-centre-instead-of-215-bjp-seeks-probe/articleshow/83049206.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||No new tax in NMC’s Rs 2,796cr budget, reliance on govt grants||Nagpur: With an eye on civic body elections due next year, standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar on Friday did not propose any additional tax or licence fee while presenting a Rs 2,796.07-crore budget of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for 2021-22.For the second consecutive year, the special general body meeting convened for budget presentation was organized online due to the pandemic. Discussion on the budget will be held in a meeting convened on May 31.Bhoyar said NMC’s revenue collection declined due to the decisions taken to combat Covid-19 and provide relief to different sectors affected by it. Even property tax and water bill collection was adversely affected due to the pandemic and the consequent restrictions, he said.The total budget estimate for the 2021-22 fiscal is 7% more than the budget presented by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. He had projected NMC’s budget of Rs 2,607.6 crore for the current fiscal. So, Bhoyar too did not inflate the estimates unlike his predecessors.“There is no additional tax and charge in the budget,” he said while talking to reporters after the special general body meeting. He announced a 10% rebate in general tax for property owners if they pay tax before June 30. Similarly, those paying property tax by December end will get a 5% rebate in general tax, he said.Like past budgets, Bhoyar too lacked any plan to introduce a fresh source of revenue for the civic body. Instead, he also depended heavily on government grants.

Father of five children, Rakesh was the only earning member of his family. His wife Kamlesh Devi, 40, is also suffering health issues and is not able to take care of their five kids. Residents of JP Nagar on Mau road, the family doesn't have a ration card or an Ayushman Bharat card. Despite a letter sent by the state women’s commission member Nirmala Dixit, the district administration has not provided any help to the family in distress. “I am not able to arrange food for my children. So far we have not received any help from the authorities. I request chief minister Yogi Adityanath to provide us some relief,” Kamlesh said. The eldest daughter of the deceased, 15-year-old Rinki, said, “My father was not able to breathe. We took him to SN Medical College where he was not admitted. We were not able to get oxygen cylinder and he died at home after suffering for several hours. My mother is not well. We are somehow managing with food provided by people living nearby.” State women commission member Nirmala Dixit said, “After being informed of the poor condition of the woman and her kids, I have written a letter to the district magistrate seeking help for the family in distress. They have no source of income and need urgent help from the government. I will pursue the matter with higher authorities for a time-bound action.” Child rights activist Naresh Paras, who had informed Dixit about the family’s plight, said, “The district administration should issue a ration card to the family, a gas connection under the Ujjwala scheme and approve construction of their house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. The family needs to be provided with monetary assistance. After Rakesh succumbed to Covid-19, the health department staff have not even come for a checkup of his wife and kids. Their house has not been sanitized.” Talking to TOI, district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “I was not aware of the entire matter. Required help will be provided to the family in distress.

They said it would come to around Rs 80 crore. UP Prathmik Shikshak Sangh said it has consulted teachers and all local leaders on the issue. There are nearly four lakh teachers in the basic education department of the state. Last year, teachers had contributed Rs 76 crore towards the chief minister's relief fund by donating a day’s salary. This time, they expect the amount would be higher as 69,000 new teachers have freshly joined. Dinesh Chandra Sharma, president of the union, told TOI, “After consulting several district presidents and taking feedback from teachers through our leaders at the block level, we decided to provide support through the right channel. No individual will collect the money and it will go into the account of the basic education department. From there it will be given to the families of the deceased teachers." Sharma added: “We are expecting to collect Rs 80 crore, which will be equally distributed among the beneficiaries. It means nearly Rs 5 lakh for each family. We have received consent from most of the teachers for deducting their day's salary.” When contacted, director general of school education Vijay Kiran Anand told TOI, “We will take necessary action as per government rules.” Teachers' unions in the state have claimed that 1,621 teachers, both permanent and contractual, died after performing their duties in panchayat polls and the subsequent counting of votes. They have said all of them contracted Covid-19 and died later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-teachers-to-give-days-pay-to-dead-colleagues-kin-collect-rs-80-cr/articleshow/83044956.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The district’s BSA Vinay Kumar told TOI, “When I questioned the officials in accounts department and the staff of Kasturba Gandhi schools, it was found that the wardens were not able to mark the attendance of the students on the government portals. The payments were made for stationary and food. I am compiling the information and it will be sent to DG School Education.” Maximum Rs 96lakh were taken out from Gonda, Rs 74lakh from Bijnor and Rs 39lakh in Moradabad districts.

They have also urged the district administration to take immediate action and conduct a detailed study. A group of villagers who visited the upstream area ahead of the mouth of Rishiganga river claimed that the cracks in the glaciers are "posing a threat of an avalanche or glacier burst", which can cause a repeat of the February 7-like flash floods in the downstream areas of the Niti valley. According to the villagers, they surveyed the glaciers from the Rothi meadow situated just opposite, and have now demanded regular monitoring of the glaciers. The flash floods, believed to be triggered by a glacier burst, caused havoc in Raini village and Tapovan area of Chamoli district, killing over 80 people. More than 120 are still missing. Nand Kishore Joshi, disaster management officer of Chamoli district, told TOI, "Some locals have reported the matter to the district administration.

In the preliminary answer key released, the answer to a question was mentioned as option ‘B’, which the petitioner marked correctly. However, in the final answer key, the answer was mentioned as option ‘C’ or ‘D’. Christopher had secured 70 marks whereas the cut-off for BC category was 70.5 marks, due to which he was not called for the final interview.According to the petitioner, a few candidates had filed a petition before this court which in an order dated February 16 this year directed to award 0.5 marks to those who had approached the court. Though Christopher cited that order and sent a representation to the authorities seeking to consider his candidature, it was rejected. He challenged this in the present petition.Justice V M Velumani observed that the court had directed the authorities to give 0.5 marks and revise the selection list based on the report of the one-man committee which went into the matter. In the same order, the court had made it clear that the direction given in the said writ petition will be applicable only to the petitioners and it will not be appropriate for consideration of similarly placed people. The court had passed such an order only to give finality to the selection process. The authorities cannot consider the representation of the candidates as and when they approach them according to their whims and fancies. The candidates must be vigilant enough to get their rights as the other candidates who approached this court earlier. The judge observed that the authorities had considered the earlier order of the court in a proper perspective and rejected the representation of the petitioner. Taking into account that the selection process was over and provisional selection list published in April, the judge dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/si-recruitment-hc-dismisses-candidates-plea-for-0-5-marks/articleshow/83049208.cms||---

He sustained severe injuries and underwent surgery at a private hospital. After his recovery, Arulsamy filed a petition before Thanjavur motor accident claims tribunal seeking compensation. The tribunal held that the lorry driver was responsible for the accident and awarded a compensation of Rs 9.2 lakh. The insurance company challenged the order through the present civil miscellaneous appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2017.Justice T Krishnavalli observed that the main contention of the appellant insurance company is that at the time of accident, the lorry had no insurance coverage and hence, the company is not liable to pay the compensation. The judge said that the company had not mentioned this fact before the tribunal. The company contended that it came to know about the fact only at the time of filing the appeal before this court.“The records in respect of the accident were maintained only by the insurance company. It is their bounden duty to verify whether the offending vehicle (lorry) had insurance coverage at the time of accident. It shows their careless attitude. The claimant cannot be put to hardship for the failure on the part of the insurance company,” observed the judge.The judge further said that the claimant produced the insurance policy copy to show that at the time of accident, the lorry had insurance coverage. Hence, the tribunal correctly came to the conclusion that the company was liable to pay compensation. However, the judge said the claimant is not entitled to compensation under the head of loss of marital pleasure and future medical expenses and accordingly. Hence, the judge reduced the compensation amount from Rs 9,16,074 to Rs 6,16,074 and directed the insurance company to disburse the modified amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-rejects-insurance-co-plea-against-accident-relief/articleshow/83049199.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Adopt a tree’ to make up for green cover lost in cyclone||MUMBAI: After cyclone Tauktae caused massive loss to green cover, BMC’s K-west ward which includes parts of Juhu, Oshiwara, Lokandwala and Versova in Andheri is leaving no stone unturned to try and get back at least a part of the lost verdant patch. In a unique initiative, the civic ward will launch a campaign ‘Adopt a fallen tree pit — be a guardian of greens’ on Saturday, starting fom Juhu. To begin with a native ornamental tree — tamhan — will be planted which is also fast-growing and whose flowers are known to bloom only once a year during the peak of summer. Through the initiative, the BMC is trying to rope in locals who will be expected to adopt a sapling that the BMC will plant in place of one that crashed. A few Bollywood actors living in the neighbourhood have extended support to the initiative. Assistant municipal commissioner Vishwas Mote, whose brainchild the campaign is, said, “Our ward alone lost close to 350 trees out of the 2,000-plus which were uprooted due to the gusty winds. While people can be moved to safety in times in such times, trees bear the brunt of the havoc caused by nature’s fury. It is of utmost importance to rebuild the green cover lost due to the cyclone at the earliest. Therefore, we are seeking the support of locals through this initiative to adopt a fallen tree location and nurture the new sapling that we plan to plant in place of it.”  Mote also added that being well aware of the fact that the monsoon is fast approaching, the saplings which they plan to plant would be tall and sturdy enough to bear any strong winds that Mumbai witnesses during the rainy season. Apart from citizens, horticulturists from the garden department have also been asked to oversee all the operations of the sapling plantation so as to ensure that the replanted tree restores the lost green cover. Andheri resident Anusha Srinivasan Iyer, founder of Make Earth Green Again (MEGA) Foundation who is trying to get members of the community involved in the initiative said that trees they are planting include flowering plants like tamhan, jamun, badam and such other native species. “We have water levels that are high. Hence, the roots do not go very deep in search of water. When we look at trees that grow up to 30 feet, it is best,” said Iyer. She added that they are requesting the locals to become a tree parent and adopt the trees. “Any guidance or help they need at any point, we are there to handhold them. Our future depends on green footprints we leave behind,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-adopt-a-tree-to-make-up-for-green-cover-lost-in-cyclone/articleshow/83049243.cms||Richa Pinto

The trio was arrested in an operation by local police and the team of drug administration in Baghpat. During investigations, it came to light that the gang had already sold 32 vials of the injection in Muzaffarnagar. According to sources, the gang used to purchase remdesivir vials for Rs 10,000 each from Punjab and sold them at exponentially higher prices to families of Covid patients in hospitals. A total of 60 such vials of remdesivir were seized from them. Vaibhav Babbar, drug inspector, said, “Eight ampules that were sent for testing to a lab in Agra have been found to be fake. Now, we have sent notice to the company whose name is mentioned on the vial. It is possible that the company's name is being used and it has no role in actual manufacture. Further proceedings in the case will be worked out accordingly.” On May 20, the three members of the gang were arrested. They were identified as Bishan, a resident of Haridwar and Mukund and Manmohan from Muzaffarnagar.

The patients have been observed and the final results have been submitted by manufacturer Zydus Cadila to the DCGI for a go-ahead. The vaccine can be used on children in the 12-17 years age bracket. A total of 1,200 people were part of the clinical trial that was done in two hospitals in Kolkata and none of them has developed contraindications, it was said. Across the country, 26,800 people have been put through the trial. However, the two trial hospitals and the agency that facilitated the clinical trial here were unable to recruit a single child in the 12-17 age bracket because parents were unwilling. However, it was done in other cities. The trials started in January and were concluded in mid-March, after which the patients were under observation. This vaccine is different from the other three (Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik) because it will not be administered through a syringe but will use a needle-free injector. It is also different because it uses the DNA platform instead of the RNA messenger platform of the other three vaccines. “In the case of mRNA vaccines, the mRNA antibodies enter the body and make proteins directly. In case of Zycov-D, since the DNA platform is used, it first makes the mRNA and then it is transmitted to form proteins which inactivates the spike protein of the virus,” said Tanmoy Kumar Mandal, principal faculty of the Netaji Subhas hospital. “We are especially happy because this is the first vaccine in our country that is also taking children into consideration. The vaccine will probably help the board year students from this year itself,” said Snehendu Konar, spokesperson for CliniMed Life Sciences, the clinical agency that facilitated the trial here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clinical-trial-ends-for-fourth-covid-vaccine/articleshow/83046629.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Goa||Plea for probe into oxygen deaths politically motivated: Goa government||PANAJI: The state government on Friday strongly opposed the setting up an independent inquiry committee to look into the oxygen shortage and to explore compensation for the victims. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the high court that he has “serious objection” to the application filed by the South Goa advocates’ association, and alleged that it was “politically motivated”. He told the bench that has “serious apprehensions” about the objective and motive behind it. When the bench told him to put this on affidavit, he stated that he is challenging the maintainability of the application itself. He also questioned the timing of the application. Meanwhile, the association’s lawyer told the court that the application deals with the loss of lives, and that there was no other intention besides this. The court stated that it is not a matter to be heard during the vacation, and will be taken up by the regular bench later. The association is seeking compensation to families of Covid-19 victims and an independent inquiry led by a high court judge into the deaths caused due to the oxygen shortage. The association also asked for those responsible to be identified and criminal proceedings initiated against them. It stated that more than 100 people lost their lives due to the “negligent behaviour of the state administration”, which did not make adequate arrangements to tackle the problems related to inadequate supply of oxygen until the high court intervened. After the association’s application, the high court found that the oxygen cylinders were being delivered using agricultural tractors, which would face difficulties manoeuvring into the narrow pathway to GMC while patients gasped for air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plea-for-probe-into-oxygen-deaths-politically-motivated-govt/articleshow/83049207.cms||---

The changed colour of the stream in the past two days has come as a surprise for the local residents while also drawing the attention of environmentalists as well as scientists of the regional office of the UP Pollution Control Board. According to environmental scientists, it might have come from some side drains or stagnant sources during rainfall and will disappear with the increase in the flow of water. UPPCB officials also claimed that it would have come to Varanasi from upstream of the river, and now these algae are gradually disappearing with the flow of water. “From visual observation, it appears algal blooms formed by the algae named Microcystis, which is found in stagnant water. In Ganga it might have come from some side drains or stagnant source during rain,” said noted environment scientist and chairman of Malviya Ganga Research Centre at Banaras Hindu University Prof. BD Tripathi. According to him, it will disappear with increasing flow of water. “If the condition persists for a longer duration, it may cause fish mortality,” he said, adding that normally neurotoxin — microcystin — is produced by the algae which may be harmful to other aquatic animals.” “In my opinion, a detailed investigation may be done by UPPCB lab scientists,” he told TOI on Friday. According to a scientist of the Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, BHU, Dr. Kripa Ram, the algae grows due to increased nutrients in the water. “During the rains, these algae flow to the river from fertile lands. After getting adequate nutrients, they start the process of photosynthesis. Phosphate, sulphur and nitrate are the nutrients that help the algae grow.” Regional officer of Pollution Control Board Kalika Singh said, “There is nothing to worry, as the algae have not grown in Varanasi but have come from the upstream. We are monitoring the situation and have also examined the level of dissolved oxygen of Ganga and other parameters, which were found normal.” He added, “The algae has started moving away with the stream.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ganga-turns-green-in-varanasi-scientists-blame-it-on-algal-bloom/articleshow/83044965.cms||---
---||Meerut||In Meerut, docs fight a losing battle due to shortage of key black fungus drug||MEERUT: According to the data released by the local authorities, Meerut has witnessed 166 mucormycosis (black fungus) cases so far but the district is hit hard when it comes to the availability of Amphotericin B, the main drug used in the treatment of this disease. According to doctors at least 60 injections are required per person for the treatment but medical authorities receive a few hundred every couple of days from the state government which serves no purpose. Speaking to TOI, LLRM Medical College principal Dr Gyanender Kumar, who admitted there were more than 70 black fungus cases in the medical college itself did not have a single injection to administer, said, “We have sent a vehicle to Lucknow to procure some vials.” Relatives of patients are getting hopeless as they try alternate means to procure these injections but the rates are too huge to bear. Naveen Pradhan, a relative of a black fungus patient in Meerut, told TOI, “We tried to admit our patient to a private hospital but they refused to move him to a special ward from the Emergency because the administration said it did not have Amphotericin B injections and asked us to procure it from anywhere. Due to the fear of the administration, they did not even give us a prescription for the medicine. When we asked the quantity of the injections needed, the staff said 60 injections. Now, this quantity is not being released for a single patient even by the district authorities. Where do we go now? Black marketeers crop up under these circumstances who charge exorbitant rates with no assurance of authenticity of the injections.” Speaking with TOI, Dr Subhash Yadav, a senior surgeon at a private hospital, said, “The capacity of one vial of Amphotericin B is 50 mg whereas each individual suffering from the disease requires 5mg per kg of body weight which means one adult weighing 60kg will require six vials per day and he has to be administered the same for at least ten days. This means 60 vials for one person’s treatment and here we don't get adequate vials even for two patients in a day. If a patient gets full jabs even for four days, it is of no use if the course is not completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-meerut-docs-fight-a-losing-battle-due-to-shortage-of-key-black-fungus-drug/articleshow/83044974.cms||Sandeep Rai

On May 26 night, he followed him in death too. They went to the same school and later to the same college from where they graduated as engineers. And when they were struck by Covid-19, they spent their last moments in the same hospital ward in Meerut. Not just the family members who are heartbroken and trying to come to terms with the deaths, the residents of Shastri Nagar area where they grew up are also in a state of shock and disbelief. Their father Waquar Hussain Zaidi, a retired Nagar Nigar official, mother Tasleem Fatima and brother Murtaza Hussain Zaidi were too shattered to speak. Raza, the eldest among the three siblings, got married two years ago and is a father to a four months old daughter. He complained of fever on May 22. Raza’s condition deteriorated and he was rushed to a private hospital, where his younger brother Shuja was already admitted and recovering from Covid-19. But, within a few hours, Raza breathed his last. “Shuja was asleep then. He didn’t even know that Raza was brought in the ICU ward and died. We later took Shuja’s mobile from him,” said Abbas Haider, maternal uncle of the brothers. Shuja, a chemical engineer who used to work in a company in Delhi, was tested positive during an RT-PCR test conducted by the company he was employed with. “After Shuja tested positive in Delhi, he was asked to return to Meerut and was admitted to a private hospital. After treatment, Shuja had tested negative and doctors said he was recovering. We were planning to get him discharged in a couple of days,” the maternal uncle said. But on the evening of May 26, the condition of Shuja took a turn for the worse, soon after dinner. “He had recovered from Covid-19 but the lung infection proved fatal. Doctors tried to revive him after his heart rate shot up and oxygen level nosedived. He passed away in the night,” said Aamir Zaidi, a family friend of the brothers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-brothers-both-engineers-succumb-to-covid-19-within-4-days/articleshow/83044966.cms||Piyush Rai

The registration through chatbot is for Covid-19 vaccine shots to be administered at the KMC's urban primary health centres from Saturday. Sources in the civic health department said the Chaotbot would be shut for a few days to clear the applications and open up fresh slots. “We had no idea that the response would be so overwhelming for the first dose of Covishield vaccine among citizens in the 45+ group. We will now utilise all our manpower and infrastructure to ensure that the registered recipients get their vaccine on time. Till then, we may need to keep our registration process suspended,” Ghosh said on Friday. According to a KMC official, the demand for Covishield (first dose) was so high that it would pose an infrastructure problem for them to entertain all. “We have opened 102 centres for Covishield first dose across 144 wards. However,these centres are also being used for the priority group. So, the pressure on us will be mounting,” a KMC senior health department official said. This apart, the KMC has kept 44 vaccination centres exclusively for recipients of second dose of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-rush-forces-kmc-to-suspend-chatbot-services/articleshow/83046677.cms||Saikat Ray

There are 12 schools with 500 students affiliated to this board in the city. The students underwent the assessments altering the way students would be evaluated in two ways, one on which students do the test and a secondary device which live streams them doing the assessment. The online exams were held between May 11 and 21. President of Victorious Kidss Educares, Kharadi, Robbin Ghosh, said the board altered the way in which it would assess the students performance from home. “ The new assessment procedures were aimed at reducing stress and panic among students while providing a just evaluation,” he said. The tasks made use of media and interactive functions by including tools such as play, pause and replay video and animations, ability to plot graphs and draw lines and pictures, interaction with animations and simulation. Principal of Indus International, Sandeep Chhabra, said, “Even under normal circumstances they have online assessment so the entire programme is geared for online testing. These assessments are normally conducted in school but due to Covid-19 they were told to do an alternative task online from home which will be assessed by the board like a normal exam. It was an efficient and effective way to carry out authentic assessments. Our world is going to see many more disruptions in the future, therefore all educational programmes must find ways to conduct authentic online assessments.” At the end of each assessment, the response was automatically submitted to IB in an encrypted format for authenticity of responses. Once IB received the student responses, they were directed to the IB team of specialized examiners who evaluate the responses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/grade-x-ib-board-students-take-online-assessment/articleshow/83046660.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The parents alleged that the school management had refused to release their children and instead asked them to pay Rs 50,000 as deposit amount for each student before allowing them to go. The parents complained to the district administration of Gariaband district of Chhattisgarh from where the families hailed, after which the DMinteracted with the district administration of Haridwar which thereafter intervened with the school management. The students were subsequently handed over to their parents. The education department of Haridwar, when queried about the matter, said that the management of Acharyakulam refused to hand over the students as their parents did not have a negative RT-PCR report. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel tweeted on Friday that the students were being safely brought back. “The complaint about four children from Chhattisgarh kept hostage at Patanjali Gurukul School in Haridwar was brought to my notice. Gariaband collector and SP initiated process of their release and the children were rescued. I wish them best for their bright future,” Bagheltweeted. In their complaint, the parents said that the four children aged between 4 and 11 years were admitted in Acharyakulam in LKG, first and 5th class and Rs 2.25 lakh was deposited in the school’s account at the time of admission but when they approached the school management on May 26 to bring them home, the management refused to hand over the children to the families and instead asked them to pay Rs 50,000 per student as security money. After getting information about the incident from the Gariaband administration, DM Haridwar asked the education department to take action. Chief education officer Anand Bhardwaj told TOI, “After getting the complaint, we asked the management of Acharyakulam to release the children immediately. The school management told us that they were ready to hand over the students but their parents did not have a negative RT-PCR report. Action will be taken if parents give any further complaints against the school.” TOI tried to contact the Acharayakulam management but they could not be reached despite several attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/parents-allege-school-run-by-ramdev-refused-to-return-4-students-to-families-due-to-non-payment-of-deposit-amount-kids-later-allowed-to-go-after-district-admin-intervenes/articleshow/83044980.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Pune||Shortage of injections for mucormycosis a worry: Rajesh Tope||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said the Union government should speed up disbursement of amphotericin B injections at the earliest, as mucormycosis cases were on the rise in the state. Tope said Maharashtra currently had over 2,200 mucormycosis patients and the number of such cases in Pune district was around 500. The minister said the Maharashtra government was in regular touch with the Centre on the issue and he had also requested MPs to request early disbursement of these injections to the state. Tope said more private hospitals should be empanelled for free treatment of people affected with mucormycosis. “I have directed the charity commissioner to discuss the issue with the big private hospitals, which are not yet empanelled but are treating mucormycosis patients,” he said after the weekly Covid review meeting in the city. The Maharashtra government has allowed an “unlimited package” for the treatment of patients with mucormycosis, mainly a post-Covid fungal complication. The package covers cost of expensive anti-fungal medications, including liposomal amphotericin B injections. The government has put together various treatment components — medical as well as surgical — under the state-sponsored health scheme, Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana . Tope emphasised on the need to empanel more hospitals under the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana for ensuring free-of-cost treatment of more patients. The scheme has a cap of Rs1.5 lakh for the expenditure to treat a patient and the amount has to be borne by the government. “In cases of mucormycosis, the government has decided to make an exception. We will bear all the expenses and empanel the private hospitals, which are still not under the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana but are treating mucormycosis cases,” said Tope. On the global tender for Covid vaccines, he said the Centre should have one policy for procuring vaccines from international players. He also emphasised on favouring institutional isolation for patients who could not be quarantined at home, mostly in the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-shortage-of-injections-for-mucormycosis-a-worry/articleshow/83046687.cms||Nisha Nambiar

In a statement, the UPPTA, which claims to have three-lakh members, said the teachers employed in government primary schools across the state would contribute their one-day salary to support families of the deceased. “We are demanding compensation of Rs 1crore and jobs to kin of the deceased teachers, but the government has been delaying the matter. We took this decision as families of teachers, who died during panchayat polls, are reeling under financial crisis,” said Sanjay Singh, general secretary, UPPTA. The teachers’ body has said the BSAs will transfer the one-day salary to a relief fund. The association has asked BSAs not to exert pressure on teachers who do not wish to make the contribution. The decision, said Singh, was taken at an executive body meeting held virtually on Friday. The association has handed over a list of 1,621 teachers-employees who died due to Covid while on panchayat poll duty. “Even when the government made a CM relief fund last year to help fight the corona pandemic, there was nothing for the deceased teachers. With our fund, an equal proportion will be given to dependents of deceased teachers,” Singh said. He added last year the basic teachers alone contributed Rs 76 crore for the CM Relief Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3l-teachers-to-pool-in-rs-80cr-for-families-of-deceased-colleagues/articleshow/83049266.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Van Gujjars permitted to enter wildlife sanctuary after a month’s wait||Nainital: After spending almost a month living in open tents, around 20 families of Van Gujjars were finally given permission on Friday to enter the Govind Wildlife Sanctuary. The order signed by the deputy director of the reserve, Komal Singh, said that the Gujjars will have to show valid ID proofs at the entry gates and the entire exercise will be recorded. “Like previous years, permit-possessing genuine Van Gujjars will be allowed entry into the Govind wildlife sanctuary for grazing and picking according to the terms and time frame applicable earlier. During their entry, ID proof will be mandatory and the whole process will be photographed and recorded. The entry of cattle will also be done as per the permit,” read the order. The permission comes after stern observation and directions from the Uttarakhand high court (HC) earlier this week. The court had taken note of the plight of around 100 Van Gujjars waiting outside the sanctuary since late April after a petitioner, named Arjun Kasana, filed an application highlighting the issue. The court had then cited images of children sleeping in open tents alongside dead cattle and termed the behaviour of the deputy director of the reserve in not permitting them to enter as “dictatorial”. The division bench of the HC had directed the district magistrate Uttarkashi and the deputy director to ensure all families are tested for Covid-19 immediately and allowed in if they test negative. Meanwhile, they must be put up at a permanent settlement and provided with food and medicines, and fodder for their cattle, the court said. According to officials of the district administration, the Van Gujjars have already been tested and all of them have been found to be Covid-negative. “The tests were conducted a few days back and their reports are negative. On the directions of the HC, we have also made arrangements for their stay as well as food, medicines and fodder for their cattle,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/van-gujjars-permitted-to-enter-wildlife-sanctuary-after-a-months-wait/articleshow/83044984.cms||Prashant Jha

Dr Lakshmi Shrikhande, medical director, Shrikhande clinic, and Dr Radha Munje, president VCA, moderated the webinar.Dr Sonia Dalaal, a pulmonologist from Vadodara, said, “It is a long journey for patients who have recovered from Covid-19 and involves three stages. Long Covid is for those who experience symptoms for more than three weeks. Chronic Covid-19 can be said to come under post-Covid issues which remain beyond 12 weeks.”Dr Dalaal also spoke about pulmonary fibrosis and associated risks. A few of the risk factors are illness severity, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, smoking and chronic alcoholism. Not limiting her talk to only the pulmonary aspects, she also spoke on factors related to post-Covid radiology, neurological and neuropsychiatric complications.The second segment was taken up by Dr Rajesh Swarankar, consultant pulmonologist and director of Getwell Hospital, along with chairpersons, Dr Ashok Arbat, pulmonologist and director of KRIMS Hospital, and Dr Dipti Chand, associate professor in Medicine at GMC, Nagpur. Dr Swarankar spoke on ‘Post-Covid lung fibrosis – reality vs fear’. “Pulmonary fibrosis can be separated into two categories – first can be the result of the toxicity of the virus and second, it might develop due to dysregulation triggered by the virus. There is a lot of fear about post-Covid fibrosis but it can be treated and taken care of after discharge from the ICU, with some measures like having oxygen support at home, lung transplantation, doing a proper 6-minute walk test at home,” said Dr Swarankar.The final segment was addressed by Charu Singh, a respiratory therapist at Getwell Hospital, along with chairpersons, Dr Meenakshi Ghadge, consultant pulmonologist, and Dr Archana Deshpande, associate professor in Medicine at GMC, Nagpur.Singh discussed when and how to give physiotherapy. “Breathing exercises to strengthen the diaphragm and abdominal are effective. Chest clearance technique can be used to monitor positioning, percussion, vibrations, rib springing,” she said and also discussed in detail techniques for Covid recovered patients and special therapies for those who encountered ICU acquired weakness and mechanical ventilation.An interactive session was also held. Dr Sumer Chowdhary, associate professor of respiratory medicine at NKPSIMS, presented a vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-scare-about-post-covid-complications-than-disease-experts/articleshow/83044986.cms||Anchal Bhatia

---||Pune||Activists: Use trust hospitals’ IPF for needy patients’ care||Pune: Health activists have urged the state government to allow trust/charitable hospitals across the state to use the indigent patients’ funds (IPF) for the free treatment of needy people suffering from mucormycosis.The demand came after the joint charity commissioner’s office in Pune on Thursday allowed six big trust hospitals to utilise the funds for the indigent patients. There are 58 charitable hospitals in Pune, 74 in Mumbai, and 430 across the rest of the state. The charitable hospitals in the state have to allocate 2% of their gross billing to help indigent or economically weak patients. The hospitals are also mandated to earmark and reserve 10% of their beds for indigent patients to be treated for free, and another 10% for people from economically weaker sections.Quite a few trust hospitals are reluctant to participate in the state sponsored health scheme — Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY) — citing extensive documentation and tardy process involved in getting the treatment cost reimbursed.“In addition to the state’s MPJAY scheme, allowing trust hospitals to use the IPF for patients with mucormycosis will benefit many needy patients from the weaker section. We urge the state government to allow the trust hospitals to utilise the funds,” said health activist Abhijit More.Medical practitioner and health activist Sanjay Dabhade said, “Big trust hospitals have a lot of funds under the IPF. This can be utilised now as cases of mucormycosis are also seen in many poor Covid recovered patients. They find it extremely difficult to access the full treatment which runs into lakhs.” The charity commissioner’s office carries out the audit of every trust hospital’s IPF funds on a regular basis. “A patient needs to have a yellow ration card, income certificate, Aadhaar, and voter’s cards to avail the benefit of completely free or 50% discounted treatment (as per the yearly income) under the IPF,” said joint charity commissioner Sudhir Bukke. State charity commissioner Pramod Tarare could not be contacted for his comment despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-use-trust-hospitals-ipf-for-needy-patients-care/articleshow/83046718.cms||Umesh Isalkar

But, activities like construction of the core facility and other establishments had not been initiated. Appointment of various committees and an executive director does not seem to be helping much in the progress of construction activities. These committees have no clear authority to execute processes including finance, planning and construction, purchase and deployment of medical infrastructure. Pending approvals should be brought under a single window system and expedited. Hence, a special officer should be nominated for the purpose to expedite the works, he said.Local body representatives should be consulted in the establishment of the entry and exit points of the facility in the region. Obtaining of JICA loan and release of the construction plan should be considered an emergency and done at the earliest, he has said, adding that the government should also give a schedule on the the initiation and completion details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/speed-up-aiims-work-mla-writes-to-union-min/articleshow/83049292.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: New Covid protocol for pregnant women||KOLKATA: With an increasing number of pregnant women getting infected in the second wave, the state health department has came out with a Covid management protocol for pregnant women and newborns. “By now, there are some evidence that pregnant women are susceptible to Covid complications. When the disease is severe, it could result in stillbirth or pre-term delivery,” said gynaecologist Basab Mukherjee, vice-president of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India. The protocol issued on Friday suggests pregnant women to undergo regular antennal care check-ups and antenatal ultrasound tests. But doctors said that in most cases, pregnant women are taking to telemedicine consultation for their pregnancy. And if they are infected, they are coming to hospitals very late. “Pregnancy itself is an immune-compromised stage. Therefore, if they are infected, the chance of getting severe diseases is quite high,” said gynaecologist Sujata Datta. Pulmonologist Raja Dhar of CMRI has seen double the number of infected pregnant women in a span of three months in this second wave than what he came across during the first wave. “None of the drugs used in Covid treatment had their trial on pregnant women, who are more prone to cytokine storm. It is double whammy in cases of severe infections as we have to see the risk and benefits while giving any of those medications that will have an impact on the foetus,” said Dhar. Though transmission from mother to baby during birth has been ruled out, the health department guideline has advised a 6ft distance between the mother’s bed and the infant’s crib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-cov-protocol-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/83046721.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The BJP-led central government is trying to loot the citizens by forcing them to take vaccines from private centres at much higher prices, he alleged. In a press conference, Chadha said a family of five members would have to shell out a minimum of Rs 10,000-15,000 if they took both doses at private centres. “The central government is diverting the vaccines from the state governments to private vaccination centres. A full-scale scam appears to be running in this nation in the garb of the vaccination programme,” claimed Chadha. The MLA said the Centre should explain how many doses of vaccines had been allotted by the central government to the private hospitals. “Why is the Centre not providing adequate vaccines to states? Why is the central government creating an artificial scarcity in the government sector?” Chadha asked, urging the Centre to respond to his questions. AAP MLA Atishi in a separate press conference said that the vaccination programme was suffering due to shortage of vaccines. “A lot of vaccines are available in the international market, which have not been approved by the centre yet, but are approved by the WHO. It is clear that the Centre is trying to favour Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India to fabricate the issue of shortage of vaccines. Had the Centre approved these vaccines before, so many lives would have been saved in the second wave,” Atishi alleged. “This is when both of them do not have enough manufacturing capacity to make doses enough for the entire population of India. Even then they are not approving other vaccines in the international market. They refuse to import these vaccines in India. The Centre must answer today that what kind of a scam are they playing, why is there such unreasonable favour for these two manufacturers,” she further alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP’s allegations were unfounded as no scarcity of vaccine had been created by the central government. AAP leaders should know that SII and Bharat Biotech don’t stand to gain by scarcity because scarcity may pave the way for entry of foreign manufacturers, he added. “Arvind Kejriwal government failed to buy vaccines as it did not place order in advance while other states did it,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-trying-to-loot-people-on-vaccines-aap/articleshow/83046775.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MADC is a senior-heavy organization: RTI reply||Nagpur: Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC), the state government agency developing the ambitious Mihan project, is a senior-heavy organization, a right to information (RTI) reply has revealed. Reply to questions asked under the RTI Act by Mohan Karemore, an activist of Hindu Mahasabha, stated that there are 14 officials above the age of 60 years. Of these, five were in the age group of 70 years and above. There are four others of more than 65 years of age, stated the RTI reply. According to sources, the Nagpur office of MADC has around 48 staffers. Of these, 14 who are in higher positions are in the age of 60 years and above. Karemore, who had submitted the RTI query, said MADC has a high number of seniors who could be replaced with young blood. However, a number of key posts are being held by retired persons since years, he said. The officials have been appointed as consultants to MADC. Karemore’s RTI query also specifically asks the need to engage seniors in MADC. To this, the MADC replied, “they are urgently needed and have been recommended for an extension.” The same reply goes for all the 14 officials. MADC’s current vice-chairman-cum-managing director Deepak Kapoor said it was true that there are a number of senior citizens in the organization and a change was being considered. Already, services of two out of five officials in the age group of 70 years and above have been terminated. “Efforts will be taken to bring in young blood in the organization. However, it cannot happen in one go. Barely 15 days ago, we discontinued services of two such persons,” said Kapoor. “Although in corporations, persons up to 65 years can be kept after getting permission, those aged above 70 years certainly need to be replaced,” said Kapoor. The officials were taken in as consultants considering their experience in government departments they have worked in earlier. The consultants have worked in state’s public works and revenue departments. Seasoned professionals have also contributed to the project’s development so far, said sources. Apart from gaining from their experience, having retired officers can also keep the running cost low. Their salaries are calculated on the basis of the last drawn pay, minus the pension they get from government, said a source. This reduces the pay package considerably. Fresh recruits at the same post, on the other hand, have to be paid according to the government standards which can lead to higher outgo towards salaries, explained a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/madc-is-a-senior-heavy-organization-rti-reply/articleshow/83042789.cms||Shishir Arya

Then he increased it gradually and now has found that there was a demand for at least 300 packets per day.While he takes care of the preparation, his friend Karthik, an auto driver help in packing the food and his employees Rajkumar, and master Alagar help him in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Kumaran, another friend, takes care of the distribution. The lunch packets mostly consist of rice and a side dish such as potato masala, onion raitha or brinjal curry.People, who have now realized that food is available on the table outside the shop, have been coming there by 11am daily for the packet. “Usually, a person is given only one pack, but then there are those who request a second for a person at home and we give it,” said Kumaran.Apart from this service, they have also been supplying 70 packets of food to elderly people including those in home quarantine in and around Anupanadi. Now, their customers and friends have decided to join this initiative and Lakshmi Kanthan said that they will start supplying as many as 600 parcels from next week. “Feeding the hungry brings a lot of satisfaction,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-eatery-distributes-hundreds-of-free-food-packets-daily-to-the-needy/articleshow/83049285.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: HC pulls up Centre for blame game over ‘faulty’ ventilators||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad on Friday questioned the Centre’s lack of sensitivity and its indulgence in a “blame game” over ‘faulty’ ventilators. While responding to queries from the bench, the Centre, through additional solicitor general of India, said the 150 ventilators given to Marathwada region were “never supplied through the PM Cares Fund”. On May 25, the bench had directed the Centre to inform it of the steps it was taking against the supplier or to remedy the defects. ASG A G Talhar said the ventilators, manufactured by Jyoti CNC Automation Ltd, Rajkot, had been tested on “world class parameters”. On seeing Friday’s affidavit sworn by G K Pillai, undersecretary, ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), the HC said it has a “semblance’’ of him “virtually defending manufacturers and declaring the ventilators are in immaculate condition”. On the 113 ventilators that were put to use by hospitals and found to be defective, the Centre said the “doctors and paramedics are not properly trained” to operate such sophisticated ventilators at Aurangabad. A bench of Justices R V Ghuge and B U Debadwar, which is hearing a suo motu criminal public interest litigation (PIL) on Covid-19 measures, said, “We find such statements to be demonstrating insensitivity on the part of the Union health and family welfare ministry. Instead of expressing wholehearted support to ensure such costly instruments are put to optimum utilization in the interest of the lives of the patients, it appears that the affiant (Centre) found it advantageous to contend that there is no merit in the report of dean of the government hospital.” Chief public prosecutor D R Kale had placed a report prepared by eight doctors of GMCH, which indicated the ventilators developed snags from day one. Both district as well as private hospitals returned the ventilators. Later in the hearing, the ASG said the ministry would take “all remedial steps and ensure the ventilators and defects, if any, would be removed.” “We would have had appreciated had the affiant avoided entering into the blame game and instead shown sensitivity towards the patients, it being the paramount object of a welfare state to take care of its citizens,” the HC added, asking the Centre to inform by June 2 what remedial steps would be undertaken. The order of the high court bench said, “We would also appreciate if the MoHFW refrains from questioning the reports of medical experts and instead respects such reports in the larger interest of the society and concentrates on rectifying the said machines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-pulls-up-centre-for-blame-game-over-faulty-ventilators/articleshow/83050719.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur fourth in state to give 10L first dose of vaccine||NAGPUR: With the number of people getting the first dose of Covid vaccine crossing 10 lakh mark, Nagpur now stands fourth among 35 districts in the state after Mumbai, Pune and Thane to achieve the feat. As per state’s public health department (PHD) data, 10,01,068 people have been administered the first dose of Covishield or Covaxin in the district as on May 26. As per the state government, estimated population of the district is around 52.73 lakh. When it comes to overall population, only 18.98% people have been vaccinated in the district. The central and state governments had rolled out vaccination starting with healthcare workers (HCWs) on January 16 followed by frontline workers (FLWs) from February 5, 60-plus and people above 45 years with comorbidities from March 1, all 45-plus from April 1 and 18-44 years from May 1. Between January 16 and May 26, total 65,794 HCWs were administered the jab which is 6.57% of total inoculated people. When it comes to frontline workers (FLWs), 1,24,036 have been inoculated which comes to 12.39% of the total vaccinated population in the district. Among all the categories, highest 7,93,103 people in the 45+ group have been inoculated, which is 79.23% of total vaccinated citizens. Lowest number of vaccinated people — 18,135 — is from 18-44 age group. The state had launched vaccination for this age group with limited centres and halted it from May 12 owing to vaccine shortage. Also, 2,65,885 (26.56%) of the total 10,01,068 beneficiaries have received the second dose. Highest number to get the second dose is of HCWs. Of the total 65,794, as many as 40,334 (61.3%) have received the second dose. Of the total 1,24,036 FLWs, 37,174 (29.97%) have got their second dose. When it comes to above 45 years age group, 1,88,377 (23.75%) of total 7,93,103 beneficiaries have received the second jab. Second dose for 18-44 years age group is yet to begin. As on May 26, total 12,66,953 doses, including the first and second, have been administered in the district. The district’s performance is satisfactory as the number of beneficiaries covered under the vaccination is more than that compared to Nashik, which has more population than Nagpur. In Nashik district, 7,43,816 people have taken the first dose whereas the number of beneficiaries is 10,01,068 in Nagpur district. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI, “I would like to thank people as well as the administration for taking special efforts for vaccination. It is also the result of proper planning and execution. Vaccination is a must to control spread of the disease as well as prevention of deaths. We will ensure vaccination of remaining eligible people as soon as possible.” However, for the last two weeks, the number of inoculations is going down in the district. Total jabs administered was at 24,379 on May 15. Since then, the number of beneficiaries is on the decline with every passing day for various reasons. One of the major reasons is increase in the interval between two doses of Covishield from 6-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-fourth-in-state-to-give-10l-first-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/83044991.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Vendors with trays of eggs propped up on small boxes appeared on pavements in front of closed shops and as the availability of eggs spread like wildfire they were sold off in no time. A couple in Gomathypuram sold 10 trays of 30 eggs each in less than an hour. “An egg cost Rs 5.7, which was cheap considering the demand,’’ said K Jaiganesh, one of the first buyers.K Kannan, of Anna Nagar, said he had started making enquiries with friends who ran grocery shops to see if they had eggs. “One of them told me that a crate would cost me Rs 190. For me it was a blessing in disguise.”Similar shops appeared in many parts of the city. “I have a parent who recovered from covid and was told to give him at least one egg a day. The government should make eggs available,” said M Arunkumar of Vilangudi, who spent many hours searching for eggs on Saturday.Madurai District Wholesale Egg Dealers Association president D Selvaraj said the government should also categorise eggs as an essential commodity and allow them to open shops as eggs went a long way in immunity building. About six lakh eggs are lying unsold in the district for the last one week, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/egg-sellers-pop-up-on-madurai-streets/articleshow/83049286.cms||---
---||Delhi||US community kitchen dishes out treat to Indian hospitals||NEW DELHI: Spanish American chef and restaurateur José Andrés was inspired by DC Central Kitchen, a ‘community kitchen’ in the US that prepared meals for the homeless in Washington DC. As a young chef in a mega city, he felt helping people fight hunger was very important. In 2010, he started his own not-for-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) that provides meals to people battling natural disasters across the world. WCK has been able to deliver meals within hours of a natural disaster — be it the bushfires in Australia or the deadly chemical explosion in Beirut, Lebanon. Then even as the Covid-19 situation eased in the US, Andrés heard about the deadly wave of infections sweeping across India and immediately got down to providing meals to the frontline health workers. “We don’t decide where we reach. It is the events that decide where we go,” smiled Andrés. “From volcanoes and jungle fires to Covid infections in India, the events decided we had to be present there.” WCK has partnered with celebrated Indian chef Sanjeev Kapoor to send out meals to hospitals in 11 cities across 10 states. IHCL which has parterned with Chef Sanjeev Kapoor and WCK among other brands and individuals for its 'Meals to Smiles' initiatives has sent out 4.2 lakh meals to 32 hospitals in eight cities including Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Goa, Hyderabad, Kolkata, New Delhi and Varanasi through Taj Public Service Welfare Trust and its airline catering brand TajSATS. Over 85,000 meals have been sent to Deen Dayal, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Lady Hardinge hospitals in Delhi, some also to police check posts. Andrés was impressed by the speed of preparing meals and reaching it to people in India. WCK is also working on creation of a Community Relief Centre in India. This new relief centre will be established in Mumbai. Andrés realised that most rescue operations regard providing food to people as an afterthought when that is what people need the most. That understanding is what lead to his mission of forming a global community of chefs, restaurants and hospitality industry to feed people impacted by a calamity, Kapoor said they had to ensure quality meals were sent out, travelled well and tasted better even when consumed later. Knowing which flavours and ingredients worked in a particular region were something they had to keep in mind too. He recalled how people from across the globe extended a helping hand. “From people sitting in Los Angeles informing me that a hospital in Hyderabad needed help or that a local police station had requested meal boxes, we tried to cater to as many requests as possible,” said Kapoor. Manish Gupta, CEO, TajSATS, whose kitchens and those of Taj hotels have been churning out the meals, said that learnings from the past helped streamline the logistics. “We were able to start operations in a new city within 24 hours due to our presence and operational experience,” he claimed. The company’s knowledge about handling food allowed it also to prepare a quality meal comprising vegetable biryani, brownies, cookies and juices rather than the usual boring food packets. Kapoor added, “When we want to do things right, things do happen. We started three weeks ago and we are already serving 32 hospitals across India.” Andrés was happy at his organisation being a very flexible one that monitored and adapted to situations depending on the need. He said WCK was observing the evolving Covid scenario in India and would shift focus to smaller cities that might need more help than just the major ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/us-community-kitchen-dishes-out-treat-to-indian-hospitals/articleshow/83046807.cms||Amin Ali
---||Pune||PMC prod for use of HL7 software for sharing data on available beds||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has asked Covid hospitals to increase the connectivity among themselves for faster sharing of data about bed availability. Currently, healthcare units have software that is not compatible with each other. This has led to islands of data that are not shareable. Therefore, the civic administration has stressed that the hospitals use the medical management tool called HL7, or Health Level 7 across all hospitals for real-time tracking and sharing of data among themselves. The PMC's move came after the Bombay High Court slammed it over its claim of efficient services relating to bed management for Covid-19 recently. “Covid hospitals in the city need to increase connectivity among themselves so that patients' as well as bed availability data are tracked in real-time and there remains no lag. We have suggested hospitals use the HL7 framework," said Manisha Naik, PMC's nodal officer for Covid bed management. HL7 is essentially a set of standards (messaging formats) for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications being used by healthcare providers. Hospitals do not need to change their software to use HL7. They (hospitals) just need to add this feature, which is already available in the public domain for free, medical informatics experts said. Incidentally, the National Digital Health Blueprint of India, released in November 2019, had recommended HL7 as the de facto standard for healthcare interoperability (exchange of information) in India. Hospitals only need to integrate this framework with in-house software. Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital, one of the biggest Covid hospitals in Pune, said, “We certainly would like to connect with other Covid hospitals in terms of data sharing. In fact, this is the way forward to succeed as a community. We will definitely consider integrating the HL7 framework with our in-house software.”Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India (HBI), said, “It is time that all hospitals in Pune integrate this feature (HL7) and come on the same platform for faster exchange of information.” The HL7 framework has the potential to connect all hospitals and bring in uniformity in data,” Patil said. Most city hospitals have robust electronic medical record systems (EMR). “The integration of their EMR systems with HL7 shouldn't be an issue. We are going to discuss this matter with the PMC officials on Monday (May 24),” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-prod-for-use-of-hl7-software-for-sharing-data-on-available-beds/articleshow/83046737.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The PM visited Odisha and West Bengal on Friday to assess the damage caused by the cyclone.

The scheme has been drawn up following an advisory issued by the central government’s skill India initiative.The state government, through department of skill development, employment and entrepreneurship, has launched the dual-purpose scheme through ‘Chief Minister Mahaarogya Kaushalya Vikas Prashiskhan Karyakram’ for creating a pool of trained manpower like oxygen technicians, operation theatre assistants etc, who would be ready to handle responsibilities during the projected third wave later this year. This will also provide job opportunities in the pandemic-hit economy. Collector Ravindra Thakare, accompanied by assistant commissioner, skill development, employment and entrepreneurship, PG Harde, Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) president Dr Anup Marar and Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr Sanjay Deotale, said during a press conference on Friday that administration aims to induct educated, but unemployed, segment of the population into the mainstream of the health sector where skilled manpower would be required to face the challenges of the forthcoming Covid third wave.Harde said all hospitals can directly empanel and affiliate with Maharashtra State Skill Development Society (MSSDS) through it’s website and upload their requirements of manpower. “State government has created a green channel facility for hospitals which can immediately start training as soon as candidates are available and ready for the specific courses,” he said.Dr Marar said every hospital would get some amount per candidate for training from which the trainee can be given some conveyance amount. “Even existing staffers can get certificates on ‘recognition of prior learning’ basis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hosps-with-20-beds-to-be-training-insts-to-tackle-3rd-wave/articleshow/83044997.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Open Panaji mkt, waive civic tax of vendors: Congress||Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) should allow vegetable and fruit vendors at the Panaji municipal market complex to do business along the Inox road that connects DB Marg to the market complex, Congress said here on Friday. The party has also demanded the municipal tax levied on market vendors should be waived for a period of four to six months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Party functionary and former CCP councillor Menino Da Cruz said with the city’s market complex being shut vendors and local residents were facing hardships. “I am not saying that the entire market should be opened. But the small vegetable vendors who are hand-to-mouth should be allowed to operate. They can be moved to the Inox stretch,” said Da Cruz. Three weeks earlier CCP shut down the market as Covid-19 cases were rising and CCP had given a month’s extension to market vendors to pay tax for the current financial year. “If there is no business then on what grounds can CCP demand tax from these vendors and shop keepers when CCP itself has shut them down. I demand that the municipality to waive off the tax fees for a period of four months as has been agreed through a council resolution. I also demand that this waiver should be extended for six months,” said Da Cruz. CCP had passed a resolution during the previous term of the council allowing for waiver of fees for four months during the lockdown. The decision was never implemented. Da Cruz, a former BJP member, has also criticised the appointment of an officer on special duty (OSD) for mayor Rohit Monserrate. Da Cruz alleged that permission from the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) has not been sought for this appointment. “The person has not been officially appointed as an OSD as no letter has gone from the DMA or from the CCP appointing the person as OSD. It has been a month that the person is there, dictating terms and now transferring people between departments,” said Da Cruz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/open-panaji-mkt-waive-civic-tax-of-vendors-congress/articleshow/83049329.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U’khand to request Centre to remove Hemkund Sahib, Ghangaria and Lokpal Temple from the purview of Valley of Flowers Eco-Sensitive Zone||Dehradun: To facilitate infrastructural works related to basic amenities, the Uttarakhand cabinet has decided to request the Centre to remove the unpopulated areas of Hemkund Sahib, Ghangaria and Lokpal Temple from the purview of Valley of Flowers Eco-Sensitive Zone. An amended proposal in this regard would be soon sent to the Centre. Uttarakhand agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “These three areas do not have any population but they are important from the point of view of religious tourism and other sports activities. With Hemkund Sahib, Ghangaria and Lokpal temple included in the Eco-Sensitive Zone, it is not possible to carry out the smallest of works like road repair. Therefore, the cabinet has decided to send an amended proposal to the Centre, requesting it to remove these three areas from the jurisdiction area of the Eco-Sensitive Zone.” Meanwhile, under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, the Uttarakhand cabinet has fixed penalties for violating norms in residential, commercial and industrial areas. “To ensure that the norms are followed, the cabinet has approved strict penalties on first-time violators. A fine of Rs 1,000 would be imposed on the first-time offenders (individuals), Rs 5,000 from marriage organisers, Rs 10,000 from hotel owners and Rs 20,000 for those involved in mining activities. As for the proposed Herbal Eco Park at Muni-ki-Reti, the cabinet has approved a proposal to run it on a society mode. “There will be a governing body for the Herbal Eco Park. This body will be headed by the chief minister. Besides, there will also be an administrative body, to be led by an additional chief secretary and the head of the forest force. In other decisions, the MLAs were allowed to use Rs 1 crore from their fund for efforts to fight Covid-19. “We realise that these works will help fight Covid-19 and strengthen the health infrastructure in rural and far-flung areas. The cabinet has withdrawn the upper limit of Rs 25 lakh for a single project. Now, the legislators can use an amount above that for healthcare measures,” said the minister. The cabinet has also given a green signal to service manuals for review officers and assistance review officers of the Revenue Board. The municipal authorities of Nainital had been asking for land at Ramnagar to develop a parking slot. The cabinet, on Friday, gave its approval and the land would be given free of cost to the municipality. The state also decided to increase its budget for the medical college being constructed in the Jagjitpur area of Haridwar. The Centre is to provide 90% funding for the project and the state has to incur the remaining 10%. While the Centre gave its nod to release Rs 325 crore for the project, the cost of building the college was assessed to be Rs 538 crore. Now, the state has decided to bear the remaining cost — Rs 213 crore, which is above its 10% share. The minister said that the Centre had released Rs 75 crore for the project last year. Also, the cabinet has approved a proposal to provide Rs 2 kg sugar each month to ration card holders for three months. In yet another significant decision, the health authorities have been directed to first take permission from the Centre before bringing an MRI machine from Delhi for Haridwar Mela Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-request-centre-to-remove-hemkund-sahib-ghangaria-and-lokpal-temple-from-the-purview-of-valley-of-flowers-eco-sensitive-zone/articleshow/83044999.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Worker shortage, closed markets huge hurdles, say factory owners||NEW DELHI: While factory owners and industrial area associations have welcomed the announcement of opening of factories from Monday under the graded unlocking of the city, they also point out that there are many hurdles in restarting the operations. Raghuvansh Arora, vice-president of Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, “About 70% labourers belonging to eastern UP and Bihar have already left the city. They cannot be called back just for a week’s work. Also, factories can’t operate without spare parts and raw materials, which are difficult to procure unless shops open. The government should have an integrated and holistic approach to things.” Shreesh Sharma from Mundka Industrial Area Welfare Association, who operates factories related to metal furniture and related goods, said that only 30% of workers were accessible. Most of them are from nearby areas such as Aligarh, Haridwar, etc. “Managers have contacted the workers, but there are no clear indications that they will return. Spare parts, safety gear and even nut bolts can’t be procured now,” he rued. “The government should at least open industry related markets on an odd-even basis,” Sharma suggested. Rakesh Sachdeva from Naraina Industrial Association said that opening of industries was a welcome move, but the government should not impose more restrictions. “It should not put conditions like cap on number of workers, access control, etc as they mar the unlocking process. We will ensure Covid protocol is followed,” he added. “Labour and raw material procurement are our major concerns as the shops will still be closed.” The industrial area has 900-1,000 factories and used to employ over 50,000 workers in the pre-pandemic era. Sunil Malhotra, who heads Okhla Industrial Association, said unlocking guidelines were still not clear on several issues. “Since the announcement of allowing factory operations has been made, we are asking the workers to return. But 70% labourers have already left the city. It will take 1-2 months for the situation to normalise. It is a catch-22 situation,” he added. Malhotra said that many labourers were scared to return as they feared another lockdown. Also, there is no clarity on whether godowns and offices can be opened. “All these points need to be clarified to avoid harassment of industrialists and workers.” Praveen Shankar Kapoor, BJP spokesperson and secretary of Chandni Chowk Nagrik Manch, said that the proposal to open wholesale markets should also be considered by the LG. “Wholesale markets and retail markets can be opened on alternate basis for three days each in a week,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/worker-shortage-closed-markets-huge-hurdles-say-factory-owners/articleshow/83049360.cms||Paras Singh

The centre, adjacent to Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, will treat anyone who is aged above 10. ICICI Lombard will contribute Rs 1.5 crore to set up this Rs 6-crore facility. Ambuja Neotia chairman Harsh Neotia said the group has also introduced 70 beds in its hospital in Siliguri. According to him, the New Town centre, which Neotia termed as a field hospital, will be operational for six months from now and if the Covid situation continues after that, it may continue to run beyond the stipulated period. “We have got all the clearances from the state government,” he added. According to him, since it is a field hospital, those with oxygen concentration level below 82% would not be treated here and will be referred to other hospitals.

The fare will be similar to executive chair class fare in a Shatabdi class train. Railways wlll not provided concessional fare facility to any category of passengers. Vistadome coach had made its debut in Mumbai in September 2017 on the Dadar-Madgaon Janshatabdi Express. From June 10, this express train between Mumbai and Goa will operate from CSMT and not Dadar. The AC-fitted Vistadome coach has glass-dome roof, a single lookout window at a special observation lounge to provide a panoramic view, LED lights and GPS-based information system. Built at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore, one coach can accommodate 40 passengers. The first such coach, running between Visakhapatnam and Araku Valley hill station, was built at the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-to-attach-vistadome-coach-in-deccan-exp/articleshow/83049381.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Pune||Nashik police to inquire into graft allegations against minister Anil Parab, 6 officials||NASHIK/PUNE: Nashik city police commissioner Deepak Pandey has set up a three-member panel of officers of the rank of deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to inquire into the allegations of corruption and bribery levelled by a suspended motor vehicle (MV) inspector from the Nashik regional transport office (RTO) against state transport minister Anil Parab, transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne and five other senior department officials. Parab and Dhakne have termed the allegations as “baseless, motivated and aimed at “maligning” the department’s image and demoralizing the staff. Gajendra T Patil, the MV inspector from Nashik RTO who was placed under suspension on January 20 over charges of alleged corruption, e-mailed his complaint application against Parab, Dhakne and the five others to the Panchavati police station on May 16 with copies to the Nashik police chief, the DG of the state anti-corruption bureau, central probe agencies like the CBI and the ED and the state deputy chief minister seeking registration of an FIR under the provisions of various acts. In his complaint application, Patil has prima facie accused a senior official from the RTO, Wardha, of being the “kingpin behind a syndicate operating in the transport department.” Patil alleged that there was “rampant corruption” in transfers and postings “with multiple crores of rupees collected and distributed among a chain of individuals from top to bottom”. Further, he alleged corruption in the functioning of border checkposts, settlement of cases against transport owners and illegal registration of BS-4 vehicles even after the March 31, 2020, cut-off date set by the Supreme Court. Taking prima facie cognizance of the complaint application, Nashik police chief Pandey passed an order on Thursday setting up the inquiry panel under DCP (crime) Sanjay Barkhud with DCPs Amol Tambe and Vijay Kharat being the other members. “I have asked the panel to submit its report to me within the next five days. But, if needed, it will be allowed to take a few more days to complete the inquiry,” Pandey told TOI on Friday. Pandey said the Panchavati police had called Patil to the police station on May 27, but he did not come. "Still, we have decided to inquire into his complaint," the police chief said. Patil told TOI, “I have said whatever I wanted to in my complaint application mailed to the police. I have nothing further to say on the issue at this juncture." When contacted, Parab told TOI, “The allegations stem from a political vendetta against me to tarnish my image. Patil has been suspended since there were several charges against him. Just like in the case of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, there is an attempt to somehow demand a CBI investigation against me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nashik-police-to-inquire-into-graft-allegations-against-parab-6-officials/articleshow/83046763.cms||Abhilash Botekar

However, some experts say this could be a cause for concern as such crowds need to be regulated to prevent any spread of Covid-19.More than 1,000 people attended the camp conducted by the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Friday. A long queue with people jostling with each other was seen at the TNCCI auditorium. “People standing in these queues could be infected. These are the places where covid norms have to be followed strictly with physical distancing,” said S Sasikumar, from Anna Nagar, who decided to opt for a paid vaccine, after seeing the crowd.At the Madurai Corporation’s Elango School, more 1,000 people reached the school premises early in the morning. A doctor on duty said that these free camps were a big hit unlike in March when it difficult to even get ten people at a time to open a single vial to avoid wastage. “Today hundreds of vials can be opened, but regulating the crowds even with the help of the police is a big challenge,” said a medical professional.As private hospitals are specifying that beneficiaries should register on the cowin website and book a slot before coming for the jab, there is not much crowding. However, these are not free as recipients will have to pay around Rs 1,000 for a shot.Dr K Kolandasamy, former director of public health, said that these vaccine drives should be done on priority for the 18-44 year category, including health workers and their families, families of pregnant women, auto drivers and bus drivers who are transporting public including covid patients, domestic workers, market workers, traders, shopkeepers etc. “There should be a system in place with tokens and timings so that crowding is minimized as a single positive person participating in these camps could be dangerous,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/spl-vaccination-camps-see-crowding/articleshow/83049340.cms||---

GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat also said that the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education should immediately convene a meeting to formally approve the government’s call for the SSC exams to be cancelled. “Every student is charged Rs 1,500 for exams and this comes to approximately Rs 5 crore. Our party demands that this money be refunded to each student immediately,” said Kamat. The state government, said Kamat, may utilise the Rs 5 crore for other expenditure and to bridge the revenue shortfall. He pointed out that the government had on an earlier occasion repurposed the corpus of Rs 19 crore collected by the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. On May 23, chief minister Pramod Sawant announced that SSC board exams would be cancelled because of the second wave of the pandemic. Sawant also said that a decision regarding the HSSC exams would be taken later. While supporting the move, GFP did say that the announcement should have come from the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education and not from the chief minister. Kamat said that Sawant was trying to supersede autonomous bodies and other ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/refund-ssc-exam-fees-to-students-says-gfp/articleshow/83049358.cms||---

Khaunte has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant saying that higher level of precautionary measures need to be taken so that Goa does not face hardships during the coming monsoon and the Covid pandemic. “I strongly recommend that the MPCS and fire station at Porvorim be completed on priority which otherwise is due for completion on May 31,” said Khaunte. The Porvorim MLA said that opening the fire station at Porvorim with all infrastructural facilities, vehicles and machinery will ensure that the Porvorim constituency is prepared to tackle any natural disasters. Khaunte also said that the MPCS could be converted into a specialised Covid Care Centre with a separate paediatric wing in anticipation of the third wave which is likely to affect children below 18 years. “The Centre should be equipped with necessary infrastructure, staff, medical professionals and medicines which will ensure that all medical emergencies in and around the constituency can be attended with minimum turnaround time,” said Khaunte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/prioritise-cyclone-shelter-fire-station-rohan/articleshow/83049392.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Most of the more than 1,000 courier agencies functioning in Madurai and the surrounding districts have been closed.Courier agents said that there is a lack of clarity on their functioning, resulting in the closure of most of the agencies. The service was allowed during the 14-day lockdown that started on May10. While e-commerce activities are allowed to operate, private courier agents say that they too should be allowed to function.They have urged the state government to allow the service. Many smaller hospitals too are depending on the private couriers as a convenient option. In the absence of couriers, the only option now is the postal service. But, accessing them is not easy as restrictions are in place for vehicle movement. S Balakrishnan, who runs a courier agency at K Pudur, said that hundreds of agents like him in the southern districts have not opened the agencies for the past four days. Some of them are operating at risk. “Allowing private courier services will not create any confusion as it would only add a few vehicles on the road. A large number of people and smaller hospitals would be benefitted by the service,” he said.J Amalraj from Anna Nagar said a large number of parcels, including medicines, received before the lockdown are piled up in the godowns. Madurai being the hub for the entire southern districts, parcels are received and segregated here before sending them to other places. With the agents unable to open the agencies in the southern districts, parcels are stuck at various places. Courier agents requested the district administrations to issue them passes to function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/lockdown-impacts-courier-service-in-madurai-agents-seek-govt-intervention/articleshow/83049370.cms||V Devanathan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Special vaccination drive for people with disabilities||KOLKATA: Parents of youths with disabilities have had a trying time getting their wards vaccinated against Covid, especially at a time when the city has been witnessing a rush for a jab. Often unable their express their fears and anxiety at not being able to figure out why they were being injected, these youngsters have been jittery, leaving their parents feeling helpless. To address the issue, ICanFlyy — an institute for children and youth with autism, Down Syndrome, intellectual challenges and learning disabiliites — on Friday organized a vaccination for differently-abled youths. More than a hundred received the jab. Minu Budhia, psychotherapist and founder of ICanFlyy, pointed out that special children were very apprehensive about taking an injection. “But coming to ICanFlyy was like coming to their second home. Their familiar classrooms, friends, teachers and staff members comforted them and gave them the much-needed security that eased their nerves and made the inoculation look like a normal exercise,” said Budhia. Vinita Singhania, parent of a specially-abled youth, was relieved that she was finally able to vaccinate her son Anshuman. The 22-year-old’s mother was finding it difficult to get a slot for him and his caregiver. On Friday, Anshuman was eventually vaccinated at ICanFlyy. Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, too, vaccinated more than 50 differently abled individuals recently. Smriti Saraogi, mother of 27-year-old Madhu Kanoria, said she had been apprehensive about taking her differently-abled daughter to a hospital during this pandemic. “It was a great relief to finally get the vaccine for her,” said Saraogi. A photo booth had been set up where the youth posed and got clicked after being vaccinated. “Getting this vaccination drive conducted is my small contribution to my children who hold a very special place in my life and my heart and to my employees who are my backbone,” said Budhia. “These people need to be treated patiently, which can’t happen in a hospital environment. They can’t realize why they are being injected and get anxious and could even get traumatized. So, making an effort to get them vaccinated in a familiar or friendly environment is a laudable move,” said psychiastrist J Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/special-vax-drive-for-people-with-disabilities/articleshow/83046854.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

The victim’s wife also told Sujit’s brother that she had no idea where her husband had gone,” assistant inspector Laxman Ukirde of the Chatushrungi police said. Car driver Varun Kulkarni (26), employed in a private company, was on his way home in Bavdhan after meeting his ailing father-in-law, near Balbharati along the SB Road. “Victim Joshi had reached Vetalbaba Chowk via Deep Bungalow and Kusalkar Chowk, when Kulkarni’s car, heading towards the Savitribai Phule Pune University Chowk, hit him.

---||Lucknow||Holistic care a must for cancer treatment, says onco-surgeon||LUCKNOW: Cancer patients on chemotherapy or immune-suppressing treatment should wait for at least four weeks from their last session for getting vaccinated against Covid-19, said Delhi based onco-surgeon Dr Anshuman Kumar on Friday. Similarly, after taking both the doses, they should wait for two weeks before starting chemotherapy or immune-suppressing treatment, added the cancer specialist who is also a Covid-19 expert. Onco-surgeon Dr Anshuman Kumar “In fact, cancer patients should consult their treating doctors before getting vaccinated because the type of cancer and its treatment also determines the risk factors, benefits and vaccination timeline,” said Dr Kumar, who was in the city for the launch of Holistic Cancer Centre at Altis hospital. However, cancer survivors, who have completed treatment six months ago, can go for vaccination without any hesitancy, said the onco-surgeon. Dr Kumar said that patients suffering from three types of cancer — Lymphoma, multiple myeloma and blood cancer (leukaemia) which affect the body's germ-fighting network, plasma cells and blood cells respectively — must be extra careful. They must consult an oncologist before getting the jab because both the vaccine and these cancers affect the immune system, he added. “Cancer patients, who acquired Covid-19, must avoid living in rooms and places with damp walls during the sickness and for at least four weeks after recovery to prevent fungal infections, including black fungus,” he said. He also advised cancer patients to wear N-95 masks all the time when they are stepping out of their house or meeting someone. Dr Kumar said “Holistic care is required for not only treatment of cancer, but also prevention and fast recovery. For this, we can take help from various medical and healthcare streams, including Yoga and Ayurveda. A classic Indian diet with green vegetables, turmeric with a balance of protein and carbs is the best for a cancer patient.” He said that pandemic induced restrictions on public movement and conversion of super-speciality hospitals into Covid care centres are posing a major challenge in management of cancer patients. In some cases, the cancer has reached an advanced stage due to delay in treatment, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/holistic-care-a-must-for-cancer-treatment-says-onco-surgeon/articleshow/83049375.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Separate exam for some students of LLM in Mumbai: Univ to HC||Mumbai: The Mumbai University on Friday told the Bombay high court that it will conduct separate first semester exam for students who took admissions to the LLM course in the sixth round. Hearing a petition to postpone the exam, a vacation bench of justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Madhav Jamdar were informed by the university’s advocate, Ashutosh Kulkarni, that exams for the first five admission rounds would proceed according to the schedule on June 1. “Exams for the sixth round admissions will not be conducted on June 1, but by July-end or August first week,” he said. A petition on behalf of two students was mentioned for urgent hearing by their advocate, Uday Warunjikar, stating that the sixth round of admissions concluded on May 20. “It is virtually impossible to complete the curriculum and to appear in the exams,’’ he said. The petition by Rachana Karnik and Navinkumar Saini said that the LLM admission process has not been conducted fairly by the university. They scored 82 and 76 marks out of 100 in the common entrance test. Admissions began in December and the fifth round got over on April 16. The University of Mumbai issued a public notice on May 5 for vacant seats and there were 400 applicants. The applicants were asked to remain present on May 20 at an online meeting. “During the meeting, the respondents were calling those who were not present and telling them to take admission immediately,” the petition alleged, adding that when the petitioners and some others protested, they were removed from the meeting. The petition said that the merit list showed many applicants were selected contrary to stipulations in the public notice. There were names of those selected in previous rounds and also some were adjusted against disabled and reserved categories. The petitioners urged Bombay high court to quash and set aside the sixth round of admission and direct that it be held in a fair manner. Also, to cancel admissions of those less marks than them and admit the petitioners in their place. Kulkarni said the petitioners are even otherwise not eligible as they do not meet the cut-off marks. Warunjik-ar, however, disputed this statement. The judges directed MU to file its reply and posted the hearing for June 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/separate-exam-for-some-students-of-llm-in-mumbai-univ-to-hc/articleshow/83050786.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Way behind schedule, key infra projects are clutching at straws||New Delhi: After over six weeks of closure to contain the spread of Covid-19, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal finally announced partial relaxations beginning from Monday. The first sector to be allowed to recommence operations is construction in consideration of the labourers’ need to earn a livelihood. However, a big challenge for construction companies is how to begin work when most of their workers have gone back to their villages due to the lockdown. Delhi government’s Public Works Department is helming key projects such as the construction of the 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila Road and Ring Road, all a part of the India Trade Promotion Organisation’s Pragati Maidan redevelopment project. PWD is also working on the Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor, the Ashram underpass and the Benito Juarez Road underpass. PWD officials said that the major infrastructure projects in the city were already running foul of the deadline. Due to last year’s lockdown, these would be delayed by at least five months. To add to that, work was against stopped this year through another lockdown triggered by the ongoing Covid crisis. The officials breathed a sigh of relief at construction work being given the go-ahead signal, but it would still take some time to create momentum. One, the labour force has to return to Delhi and two, new hirings may be required because many skeptical workers may not come back since they have vulnerable children and elders in their families. Officials say that these delays had not crippled road traffic, but also impacted the work budgets. A senior PWD official said, “We will start work on the major projects first so their deadlines are not stretched further. The inauguration of the Chandni Chowk pedestrianisation project was delayed all this while, but now we will inaugurate it at the earliest. Projects like Barapullah corridor and Rao Tula Ram Phase II will also be prioritised.” Acknowledging the significant decline in the number of workers during the lockdown, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation executive director Anuj Dayal hoped to have adequate workforce available for the Phase IV construction work. “During these difficult times, we took care of medical and other needs of the workers who stayed back,” he claimed. “With the lifting of restrictions, we hope more workers will gradually rejoin work. Apart from carrying on with whatever physical work we could, we used the lockdown for important preparatory works such as the floating of tenders for JICA-funded sections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/way-behind-schedule-key-infra-projects-are-clutching-at-straws/articleshow/83049451.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

The antibody cocktail was administered to a 65-year-old man who responded well and was discharged after an hour of observation. It was administered to patients with mild and moderate Covid and at high risk of developing severe Covid, officials said. The antibody cocktail was launched on May 24 in India by Roche after receiving Emergency Use Authorisation from Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation. Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals, said that “monoclonal antibodies bind to and ‘neutralise’ the SARS-CoV-2 virus.” “We are confident that this treatment option will significantly boost our efforts to bring the pandemic under control and will help prevent progression of the disease in those with mild to moderate Covid-19.” Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, says that the reason why this therapy is termed as an antibody cocktail is because it comprises a mixture of more than two biological drugs that mirror the human antibodies in the immune system, which consequently help fight the infection, similar to the natural antibodies produced when one gets infected with Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/apollo-hospital-first-in-city-to-administer-antibody-cocktail/articleshow/83046878.cms||---

Mukhtar, who was in Ropar jail in Punjab for the last two years, was brought to UP and lodged in Banda jail in April this year. During his stay in Punjab, Mukhtar had been using an ambulance, which had the registration number Barabanki, to travel between Ropar jail and Mohali court for hearing. The ambulance was later found to be registered on forged documents. Superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad, said: “The investigation officer in the case, Mahendra Singh, visited Banda jail to record Mukhtar’s statement. He is not cooperating with the police.” Sources in the police department said the cops prepared a list of questions like why Mukhtar procured an ambulance, and where was the vehicle used other than ferrying him from jail to court and from Ropar to Supreme Court in Delhi. Police also asked Mukhtar why he chose Barabanki district for the registration of ambulance. Sources said Mukhtar kept on repeating that everything was done with the permission of the police and they should be asked about it. Senior officials said Barabanki police would seek the court’s permission and visit Banda jail to question the don again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/using-ambulance-since-2013-ansari-tells-cops/articleshow/83049422.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Curbs affect mfg this month; MSMEs, services worst-hit||PUNE: The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA), in its latest monthly survey, has found that economic activity in the Pune Metropolitan Region continued to suffer because of the lockdown-like restrictions. The survey found that MSMEs — especially the smaller units — and services were disproportionately affected. Employment across the board was flat compared to April, but was down 16% since the end of March, with the lockdown-like restrictions causing a drop in productivity and employment capacities. Industries have also blamed disrupted supply chains, spiralling costs of raw materials such as metals and polymers, and the near stoppage of industrial oxygen supply, though there were no restrictions on operations. The surveyed companies reported an average production level of 70% — nearly the same as in April, but lower than the 83% in March. MCCIA expressed concerns about the disproportionate effect on MSMEs. The current survey has micro units operating at only 49% of their pre-pandemic capacity, down from 68% in March. “Many of these units are operated by people like homemakers, and often sell their wares at pop-up exhibitions. Due to the restrictions, they are not being able to sell their products. Similarly, for a micro unit in manufacturing which welds parts as a tier-3 supplier with two or three clients, a disruption in demand further up the chain will give it no option but to close down,” Prashant Girbane, director-general of the MCCIA, said. He expressed similar concerns about the stressed food and beverage and hospitality sectors. Girbane said they await the government allowing “step-by-step” unlocking so that productivity, employment, and supply chains can be restored. The MCCIA has also called for the gradual resumption of oxygen supply to industries. Meanwhile, the Pune Platform for Covid Relief (PPCR), a multi-stakeholder civic initiative led by MCCIA, has proposed a graded reopening plan, based on the burden on health facilities, case fatality rate and positivity rate. Further, it has asked for the reopening of the retail sector and to allow those fully vaccinated to go to the workplace in the manufacturing sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-affect-mfg-this-month-msmes-services-worst-hit/articleshow/83046864.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid takes toll on health workers’ mental state||KOLKATA: For over a year, critical care doctor Dipshikha Ghosh has been on Covid-19 duty and has treated over 1,000 patients. On Thursday night, she, along with 40 doctors, came together on Twitter’s live audio chat to discuss mental health issues of healthcare workers. Among the various concerns raised was the psychological impact of the spike in the number of deaths in the second wave. Ghosh was in the news recently when she had made the video call to a dying patient’s son who sang ‘Tera mujhse hai pehle ka nata koi’ to his mother. According to her, some of her colleagues often talk about taking a sabbatical “after all this is over”. Compared to pre-Covid times, Ghosh estimates that an ICU doctor saw thrice the number of deaths in the first wave. In the second wave, the number has gone up six to eight times. Added to this are the expectations of critically ill patients’ relatives who want doctors to do a miracle. “Initially, they want us to be objective but right before hanging up, they say things like ‘please treat him as your parent’. You don’t know what to say to that,” she said. There have been days when she has written five death certificates. "The pressure of deciding which relative will be able to handle the news in the event of a death is also immense because often elderly patients have their spouse or siblings listed as next of kin. All that has to be done while simultaneously looking after nine other critically-ill patients," she added. Milan Balakrishnan, a Mumbai-based psychiatrist who was also part of that Twitter Space, said that meta-analysis of current available data reveals that 25% of healthcare workers are suffering from depression while 70% to 80% suffering from distress. “The latter would be sub-clinical restlessness, dissatisfaction and unhappiness. They are more prone to developing depression,” he said. Psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra points out that breaking bad news several times through a day is “affecting their psyche”. “This emotional counter-transference is leaving many with stress, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. I will not be surprised if more than 50% to 70% of the frontline healthcare workers in future suffers from any of these illnesses,” he said. Doubling the process of grief is the loss of their own family members. “Many are frightened of bringing back the viral infection from their workplace into their homes where their families and loved ones are,” Mitra added. Sujit Sarkhel, the associate professor of psychiatry at SSKM, has multiple cases of colleague sharing their “helplessness” with him. “Many are finding it difficult to accept deaths of people below 40. Witnessing such a death means 20 or 40 years of productivity gone in just one second,” Sarkhel said. Helplessness also creeps in when the flow of patients overwhelms the capacity of the ICU. “Some doctors, who head the ICU, have to relegate work downstream. They can feel helpless if there is resistance or reluctance on the part of the workforce,” he added. According to psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram, frontline workers who are going through this will not be the same people anymore. “Social media is helping in community ventilation. Some are using healthy denial to continue functioning. But the paradox is that most are not reaching out to us for professional help,” he said. Sarkhel points out that there is a big gap between identification of burnout and seeking help. "Lack of motivation and cynicism are symptoms of burnout. Unfortunately, healthcare workers don’t seek help early on unless the problem is very acute," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-takes-toll-on-health-workers-mental-state/articleshow/83046909.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Members of MSME bodies — a crucial part of the local auto industry supply chain — said the prices of certain raw material had shot up, forcing them to consider shutting shop. “The welding industry has no oxygen supply. Those who can afford them use the expensive plasma cutters. On top of that, prices of raw materials, such as mild steel, have more than doubled in the past year. The goverment should impose price controls,” Sandip Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association, said. “There has been a 40 to 60% hike in raw material prices such as steel and aluminum, and sourcing these from the manufacturers has been difficult. The productivity levels are already low. A few of members have stopped production as a result,” Anil Howale, president of the Pune chapter of the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said. Industry observers said the Centre needed to be “watchful” and encourage increase in production of these materials to avoid price hikes. “There is a high demand for these raw materials all over the world. In India, domestic demand far outweighs the supply. Imposing export control isn’t a pragmatic, sustainable solution. The government should continuously encourage them to increase production,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enterprises-seek-reduction-of-raw-material-prices/articleshow/83046905.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The drive will end on Sunday. Vaccines are being administered at two centres— Saraswat Vidhyalaya, Khorlim, and the old Asilo hospital. D’Souza said, “It will be the task of every councillor to see that those people who have not yet taken the vaccine are brought to the centres to do so. We are expecting a good turnout from the people.” The drive, organised by the Mapusa BJP youth mandal in collaboration with the Mapusa Urban Health Centre, was inaugurated by D’Souza on Friday. Also present was newly-elected MMC chairperson Shubnagi Vaiganakar.

The group, comprising councillors Shashank Narvekar, Dr Nutan Bicholkar, Anvi Korgaonkar, Sudhir Kandolkar and Kamal D’Souza, assured the people of Mapusa that they will work in the interest of people to provide a clean, transparent and efficient administration. Hectic backroom negotiations resulted in Vaigankar shifting allegiance to the Mapusa Development Front. She was one of the first to move and since the chairperson’s post was reserved for a woman, she fitted the bill for the top post. Four independent candidates, Benkar, Tarak Arolkar, Vikas Arolkar and MGP candidate Viraj Phadke also joined the panel. “The silver lining was that out of the 16-member panel floated by the Mhapshekarancho Ekvott, nine councilors were elected, while nine were elected from the 20-member Mapusa Development Front, indicating clearly that the mandate was in favour of the former to run the affairs of the civic body for the 2021-2026 term,” Narvekar said.

On May 18, an FIR was registered against three private Covid hospitals on similar charges. ACMO filed complaint against one hospital in Gomtinagar and two on Rae Bareli Road. As per the complaint, the hospital in Gomtinagar was charged Rs 3,000 for a RT-PCR test and forced the patient to pay up via cash and online transaction but did not give the original bills. In a joint investigation by OSD Revenue Board Apoorva Yadav and medical officer Dr Shailesh Parihar, it was found that the hospital had charged the patient under various heads, including ward charge, physician’s visit, oxygen handling, nursing, ICU. Similarly, a private hospital in Mohanlalganj, which was run by one BAMS, charged Rs 50,000 per patient for 24 hours for Covid-19 treatment. Investigation by SDM Sarojninagar revealed that the doctor was ICU incharge in hospital records and during the probe no other staff was found. However, the hospital claimed that there were nine other staff. Further, the hospital never provided a medical bill against the payment. Between April 1 and May 20, the hospital admitted 58 patients, out of whom 13 died during treatment. The third hospital, located in Utretia, was a non-Covid facility, but still treated a Covid patient who later died. The family of the deceased paid Rs 6.6 lakh for the treatment but the hospital gave a bill of Rs 3.93 lakh only. Further, it was found the hospital was charging Rs 15,272 daily for various tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3-more-hosps-face-fir-for-fleecing-corona-patients/articleshow/83049455.cms||---

Director D R Bhagat has said that schools should follow strictly the circular on Covid-19 vaccination issued by the general administration department of Goa government. “With several states experiencing a second wave of surge of Covid-19 cases, the government of India has allowed vaccination for every person above the age of 45 from April 1, 2021. Vaccination is a safe way to build protection and hence an important tool to stop the pandemic,” states the advisory. It says that Goa government advises all its employees in the state government departments, semi-government organisations, autonomous bodies and aided institutions to stress on vaccination of its employees. “All employees above 45 years of age, irrespective of having any comorbidities or not, working in any of the above entities are advised to vaccinate themselves at the earliest by visiting the nearest vaccination centres,” the circular states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-teachers-above-45-yrs-must-get-jabs/articleshow/83049469.cms||---

The utility charges of Rs 25,920 include the use of the university’s infrastructure like internet, sports facilities and cultural activities. Since the university is shut and classes are being held online, the component has been dropped. Another reason is that several students had requested for fee concession since their parents are facing salary cuts or have lost jobs amid the pandemic-triggered economic slump. A notification from RMLNLU on its website stated that the waiver is valid only till August 29 and if the university resumes on-campus classes before or after August 29, then students will have to pay the utility charges. The waiver is for all students, said RMLNLU vice-chancellor Prof SK Bhatnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rmlnlu-waives-rs-26k-from-sem-fee/articleshow/83049490.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Snatchers who evaded cops by changing hairdo arrested||Mumbai: Three snatchers who frequently changed their hair-do to avoid getting caught were finally nabbed by a team of Aarey Police recently. The gang is believed to have robbed more than 100 citizens in the past year. The mastermind, Arif Khatik, 19, also has a criminal record as a juvenile. Three bikes and 14 stolen cellphones, collectively worth Rs 3.2 lakh, were recovered from them. On May 24, plainclothed policemen were patrolling near Virvani Industrial Estate in Goregaon East when they noticed two men on a motorcycle moving in a suspicious manner. The cops gestured at them to stop but the snatchers realised they were in trouble and tried to escape. The cops chased and nabbed them and later caught their third associate as well. “Khatik was the mastermind; the other two are Raghav Chavan, 19, and Abdulrab Khan, 21. Khatik had bragged to acquaintances that he would become Mumbai’s number 1 snatcher. The gang would target pedestrians and flee on their motorcycle,” said detection officer Ulhas Kollam. The gang operated in Andheri, Goregaon East, Kandivli East, Kandivli West, Malwani, Malad East, Bangur Nagar, Borivli and Marine Drive. They have been active for seven months and have admitted to targetting pedestrians outside popular malls on Malad Link Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-snatchers-who-evaded-cops-by-changing-hairdo-arrested/articleshow/83050836.cms||---

HC refuses to entertain plea||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday refused to go into allegations of “media trial” against wrestler and Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar, saying let the affected person come if he has a grievance. It declined to entertain a plea to restrain the media from “sensationalising” the case of the death of a 23-year-old man where Kumar is an accused. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said the petition had been filed on behalf of a “vigilant person” claiming that the media had defamed Kumar. “You cannot file a PIL for an individual. We see no reason to entertain litigation on behalf of a vigilant person,” the court said and disposed of the plea by a law student who argued that Kumar’s career and reputation had been damaged by the media’s reporting of the case against him in connection with the Chhatrasal Stadium brawl that led to the death of the 23-year-old man. Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted wrestler Sagar Dhankar (23) and two of his friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, at the stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5.

With the vaccination centre located next to the school’s playground, which has been converted into a parking area for those receiving the vaccine, many senior citizens have also come for drive-in vaccinations and receive the jabs while seated in the car, thereby eliminating the need for them to step out of the vehicles and walk to the registration counter. At least 20 senior citizens have received drive-in vaccinations so far, according to the Calangute panchayat. Differently-abled persons also do not have to stand in a queue. However, the focus at the Calangute vaccination centre, set up in association with the Candolim primary health center, was to vaccinate the youth. Ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said at the launch, “We have to get all youth vaccinated to win the war against Covid-19, because they’re the biggest part of the population.” But the vaccination for the 18-44 years age group soon ran into a wall because of a shortage of vaccines. “We were administering 150 vaccines per day from May 15, but after that the vaccines got over and now we’re vaccinating 50 persons per day,” Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-950-get-vax-at-calangute-20-opt-for-drive-in-inoculation/articleshow/83049549.cms||---

On the first day of the campaign, at least 1,904 units of blood were donated. UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh said that by doing ‘seva’ (service to people), state BJP workers have changed the image of political party workers. “Political party workers are considered only election workers but our party workers have tried to change that image,” said Singh. State BJP general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal said that party workers, without caring for their own safety, have distributed food packets, ration kits, masks, sanitizers and medicines along with other essential items among those in need. Campaign in charge JPS Rathore said that various frontal organizations of the state BJP had come together for the campaign which will continue on May 29 and 30. Lucknow Mahanagar Yuva Morcha had organised the camp at KGMU. Unit president Mukesh Sharma said there is a shortage of blood donors due to the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, Atal Bhojnalaya started by Atal Bihari Memorial Foundation is also distributing sanitizers and masks among people along with food. The foundation is also making people aware about black fungus by holding health camps. The initiative was launched by law minister Brajesh Pathak on May 21 in the name of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Pathak is the president of the foundation that runs Atal Bhojnalaya. It feeds at least 900 people everyday. These include daily wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, street vendors, taxi drivers and others. Till now, more than 7,000 people have been given food by Atal Bhojnalaya. “The foundation will provide food free of cost to people till there is a need for it,” said Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/blood-donation-camps-held-to-mark-7-yrs-of-modi-govt/articleshow/83049554.cms||---
---||Dehradun||City docs remove 8.5 kg ovarian tumour from a 50-yr-old woman||Dehradun: Doctors at Shri Mahant Indiresh hospital on Friday removed a large benign tumour, weighing 8.5 kg, from the ovary of a 50-year-old woman who hails from Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh. The surgery lasted for over two hours. According to the hospital authorities, the patient had been visiting various doctors with complaints of abdominal distension and inability to eat for the past two years but her problem remained undetected. “She was admitted to the hospital on May 26. After investigations, she was found to be having a large ovarian mass which was occupying almost the whole of the abdomen, compressing the intestine. In medical terms, this condition is called ovarian cystadenoma. She was operated today and the tumour weighing 8.5 kilograms was removed,” said Bhupendra Raturi, public relation officer at Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital. The surgery was conducted by Dr Rubina Makkar and with Dr Vandana from the anaesthesia team, Dr Sanal from the surgical oncology team, and Amit and Pooja from the nursing team under the leadership of Dr Pankaj Kumar Garg. In general, ovarian cystadenoma is common in middle-aged women. Usually, they are of a small size and do not weigh more than 500 gm. However, if the women do not seek medical treatment on time, these tumours continue to grow and may attain huge sizes. “In this case, it is disheartening to see that even in the 21st century patients still seek treatment in advanced stages of the disease. The lady had been having progressive distension of the abdomen for two years and neglected it. It must be highlighted that most of the tumours, if detected early, can be completely cured. Any women who have excessive bleeding, abdominal distension, feeling of mass, or any other abnormal symptom must consult a doctor immediately for early diagnosis and treatment. Carelessness or delay in seeking treatment can prove disastrous and fatal at times,” said Dr Pankaj Kumar Garg, senior cancer surgeon at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/city-docs-remove-8-5-kg-ovarian-tumour-from-a-50-yr-old-woman/articleshow/83045223.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||SSC score to be based 50:50 on IXth & Xth marks, CET for FYJC||Pune/Mumbai: SSC students of the Maharashtra education board will be evaluated for 100 marks per subject — 50% marks from Class IX, 30 marks based on their year-long performance and the remaining 20 marks on assignments, orals and practical work. This year’s SSC results, which school-level committees will oversee, will be announced by the state board by June-end, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said. The evaluation method was announced by the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training on Friday, somewhat easing the pressure on students, parents and educators. For admission to first-year junior colleges for Class XI, though, the state will give more weightage to scores of a common entrance test (CET) it will conduct, even though it is optional. The first round of online admission will be open only to students with CET scores. SSC exams were cancelled last month due to the second Covid-19 wave and now all students have been promoted to Class XI. More than 16 lakh students had registered for the exams. Meanwhile, the state will take a call on conducting higher secondary certificate (HSC) exams after the central government decides on holding Class XII exams, the state informed the Bombay high court on Friday. A petition seeking cancellation of Class XII exams is in the Supreme Court. The state also sought two weeks’ time to file its affidavit in response to a petition challenging the state’s decision to cancel SSC exams. The court had passed a detailed order on May 20. The next hearing is on June 1. The CET will be held for Class X students of all boards seeking admissions in state colleges. The 100-mark CET will be optional and based on the Class X state syllabus. The CET will be announced based on the Covid situation in the state, said the minister. The state had sought the opinion of schools and students on the methodology for the SSC results. Students had responded positively to an entrance test for Std XI admissions. Schools had given their nod to the assessment using last year’s internal exams and projects. Gaikwad said the record of all Std IX students and their marks is with the government through the SARAL software system provided to schools for data entry. Only 50% marks of the total scored in each subject would be taken for assessment for SSC, she said. For the remaining 50 marks, schools must consider the marks of the written examination for 80 marks and convert these marks to 30. The first-term exams, mock exams and prelims could be considered by the schools for conversion of 80 marks to 30 marks. If any school is unable to conduct the first term or prelims for SSC, they could consider revision tests, home assignments and projects for assessment of 30 marks. For the remaining 20 marks, the oral, practical or internal assessment conducted by the schools should be considered in the results. Schools that failed to conduct these internal exams for orals or work assignments should complete them now. The state’s formula to award marks for SSC students this year has its critics. Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired professor who has filed a PIL against the state government’s decision to cancel the SSC exams, said Friday’s decision is adding to the students’ confusion. The court had pulled up the state for not drawing up a plan to announce the SSC results. “The government is going to conduct assessment of students based on internal marks and at the same time have an entrance exam. Those unhappy with the marks have been given the option of taking another exam. This means that the government is not convinced about its previous assessment method. This matter is in court and we have given appropriate answers about it in the court. The final decision will be the one given by the high court,” he said. H M Gaikwad, president of the District Principals’ Association, said passing SSC students based on internal assessment is not a good option. “Exams must be conducted even if it is for a shorter duration. The SSC is an important milestone and this kind of assessment is ruining the future of students,” he added. “Students will welcome this decision, as the board has kept them in mind.The good students shall be disappointed as it is their first time to prove their merit.We had followed the instructions and guidelines given by the authorities for the assessment and evaluation of Std IX students,” said Manisha Minocha, headmistress of New English School||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-score-to-be-based-5050-on-ixth-xth-marks-cet-for-fyjc/articleshow/83046994.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: TOI curbs spread of 1,500 viral fake news, vaccinates you with the truth||Like actors Mukesh Khanna and Paresh Rawal, Major General G D Bakshi, too had to recently reassure the public that he wasn’t dead. “To all my worried friends and those not so friendly. IM ALIVE please no panic.. (sic)”, tweeted the former army officer following rumours of him having “lost the battle” to Covid started floating on WhatsApp. That rumour was among the 1,500 forwarded messages ranging from “People recovered from COVID to change toothbrushes immediately” to news about IIT-Bombay and IIM having started a new initiative titled HelpNow that TOI busted as fake through its new campaign ‘Times Verified’. Since its launch on April 17, the initiative—that aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation—has received over 4,000 unverified or suspicious messages from readers for verification on the WhatsApp number 9819432222. And our expert panel—made up of reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government —have been busy clearing the air by tapping into their credible bank of sources. In the last few weeks, the panel has not only called out misinformation regarding free tiffin services for Covid patients, but also dismissed absurdities such as “Mike Yeadon, former chief scientist at Pfizer, declares vaccine as a threat to human life” with a bold red stamp that cried: “This message is fake.” “The rapid spread of false information during a pandemic can cost people their lives,” said US-based physician Dr Seema Yasmin whose recent book speaks about how misinformation spreads faster than microbes in times of crisis. “In the last year we’ve seen people write Facebook posts from their hospital beds saying they didn’t believe the pandemic was real because of what they’d read on social media and now they were infected,” added Yasmin, stressing on the need to identify red flags such as information that is packaged to be “very certain”. Leave it to TOI to identify such red flags and vaccinate you with the truth. Forward all dubious, anxiety-causing messages to our expert panel, and let the green tick in the ‘Times Verified’ logo counter the tyranny of the grey curved arrow of forwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-toi-curbs-spread-of-1500-viral-fake-news-vaccinates-you-with-the-truth/articleshow/83050901.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Less than 1 lakh each inoculated in 11 districts||HYDERABAD: Less than one lakh people each were inoculated in 11 out of 33 districts in the state even as the state government ramped up the vaccination drive for various risk groups on Friday. Narayanpet has the lowest numbers of those who got the jabs. The district, which is located 120 km from Hyderabad, has just 39,082 people vaccinated till now. For a population of 5.70 lakh, the district’s vaccine percentage is absymally low. Jogulamba-Gadwal district gave jabs to 60,000 people only and Kumaram Bheem Asifabad too fares poorly with 50,194 getting the vaccines. Health officials attribute the poor vaccination to short supply and apprehensions among people on taking the jab. In a bulletin on Friday, government officials said 57 lakh people have been given the shots in the state since the beginning of vaccination drive. These include people aged above 45 years, those with comorbidities and frontline workers. Adilabad, which is the oldest district in the state, is also lagging behind in vaccinating its people. The district with seven lakh population gave jabs to 65,770 — sixth lowest in the state. Remote districts such as Jayashankar Bhupalpally vaccinated 86,000 people and Mahabubabad 1.18 lakh in the past three to four months. The vaccination drive has not picked up even in districts where the positive cases have seen a surge. For instance, Nalgonda, which registered 229 cases on Thursday, was able to vaccinate only 1.50 lakh people. Similarly, Khammam district, which recorded 228 cases, inoculated 1.68 lakh. In Nalgonda and Khammam districts, elections were held in April and there were superspreader events leading to a huge spurt in cases and casualties. Among the districts, Hyderabad stands at the top with over 9.60 lakh receiving the jabs, followed by Medchal district with 5.25 lakh and Rangareddy district at 4.77 lakh. Interestingly, though Warangal is the second biggest city in Telangana, the health department was able to vaccinate only three lakh — 2.34 lakh in Warangal urban and 66,000 in Warangal rural districts. A senior health official in erstwhile Adilabad district said many people in the rural areas were not conversant with CoWIN portal. “They do not know the registration process. Secondly, there are a lot of misconceptions about the vaccines.” Another official said several districts continued to face vaccine shortage. “Some districts managed to get more vaccines allocated thanks to the efforts of local elected representatives,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/less-than-1l-each-inoculated-in-11-dists/articleshow/83047048.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Lucknow||Sero survey in Uttar Pradesh districts from next week||LUCKNOW: The UP government will launch the Covid-19 sero prevalence survey in all 75 districts from next week. The survey involves lab tests to find the presence of antibodies against coronavirus in humans through blood samples. The survey is crucial in finding whether immunity against the pandemic virus is developing in the population and to what extent. Many states, including New Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra, have released the results of their sero surveys. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that sample collection for the survey will begin from next week. A similar survey was carried out in 11 UP districts in September last year. The districts covered were Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Agra, Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Baghpat, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Meerut. The exercise, conducted by KGMU, found that one in five persons in the state had developed antibodies against the pandemic virus. Sources said CMO in every district has been told to form teams for collection of samples from rural and urban areas. Microbiologists explained that when infection attacks, the body combats with a protective immune response producing an antibody (a kind of protein) called immunoglobulin (IG). In case of Covid-19, scientists can look for IG-M and IG-G from the host of IGs present in the body. While IG-M indicates a current or recent infection, IG-G indicates past infection. In sero-surveys, scientists will look for IGG against Covid to find out percentage of the population that has developed immunity against the pandemic virus. Public health specialists pointed out that the fact that majority of cases are asymptomatic and therefore liable to be missed by RT-PCR testing, sero-prevalence surveys could be a significant step in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The findings will help the state in planning for the anticipated third wave as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sero-survey-in-up-dists-from-next-wk/articleshow/83049596.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Goa||Ivermectin is not harmful: Goa government to HC||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa asked the state government to clarify whether it is using Ivermectin for positive patients or as a prophylactic. The bench stated that it shouldn’t be promoting it as a prophylactic unless it has scientific data. The high court repeatedly asked the state government on Friday why it couldn’t get the present expert committee to vet its distribution of Ivermectin. The committee is purely a professional body, formulated on May 21, which has the holistic task of tackling the third wave, the government said. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that it is a decision taken by doctors and deliberated by the expert committee, and that there was an unnecessary uproar created about its use. Pangam said the drug has no side-effects and has been advised by doctors. Stating that the petitioner has referred to the WHO directive recommending against its use, the court stated that the expert committee can apply its mind and vet this. Pangam stated that the WHO initially said coronavirus was not contagious, not airborne and not transmissible, and it took six months to inform the people that it was a super spreader. The state government stated that it decided to give Ivermectin to all suspected and symptomatic cases, and to positive patients, in home isolation kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ivermectin-is-not-harmful-govt-to-hc/articleshow/83049569.cms||---

The court drew the state’s attention to the “important guidelines” during the hearing on Friday, and directed the state government to get each panchayat to fill in and submit a checklist on its community preparedness for Covid-19 by the next hearing. The bench stated that while the focus till now has been on oxygen availability, Covid management must percolate to villages with screening and surveillance. The checklist provided by the ministry will help assess the panchayat’s preparedness for timely action for prevention of Covid-19. The 59-point checklist focuses on preventive measures for control of the pandemic, addressing stigma associated with coronavirus, surveillance, monitoring of those in home isolation, continuing to provide routine essential services at the village level, prompt response when Covid cases are detected, hygiene and sanitation in the panchayat, and vaccination. The health ministry guidelines also gives a list of equipment and consumables that Covid care centres must have. Advocate general Devidas Pangam stated that the health centres in all talukas have testing facilities, and in some places these have been moved away from health centre to an isolated place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-tells-govt-to-follow-centres-sop-on-covid-mgmt-containment/articleshow/83049589.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Under Mission June, 1 crore people to get vaccinated, contain 3rd wave||LUCKNOW: Setting a massive target to vaccinate over 1 crore people in the 18-44 years and 45-60 years categories, the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday announced to launch a dedicated Covid-19 vaccination drive in June. Termed Mission June, the drive will emphasise that vaccination will play an important role to contain the spread of the third wave. “Our goal is to administer 1 crore doses in June. We have adequate stock of vaccines for the target,” chief minister Yogi Adityanath said at a high-level meeting on Covid-19. Officials said this is arguably the biggest Covid-19 vaccination drive in the country. “The effort is an outcome of the state’s commitment to leave no stone unturned to combat and control the pandemic,” said additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal. Since the launch of the vaccination drive in UP on January 16, 2021, 1.76 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in UP. While 34.23 lakh have been fully vaccinated, 1.42 crore people have been given the first dose. The 1-crore target over a month’s time means that health teams will conduct over 3.4 lakh vaccinations every single day. Earlier, health minister Jai Pratap Singh had said that the state is trying to vaccinate over 90% of the population in the 18-44 years age group in the next few weeks. To achieve the target, the government will also hold dedicated camps for large groups like state employees, teachers, traders associations and very large community groups. Health officials have also issued instructions to hold drive-in vaccination camps and workplace camps to facilitate the process. In another decision, the government had announced that parents of minor children will get jabs in special booths. This is being done in wake of the anticipated third wave affecting minors. Each district has been told to set up two such booths called ‘guardians vaccination booth’. For rural areas, the state government has decided to take the help of Jan Suvidha Kendra to facilitate registration. Officials in the health department assured that the government has enough stock of vaccines. The government is most likely getting a bounty of 48 lakh doses by the end of May. In addition, a global tender to procure 4 crore doses has been floated. Speaking from different platforms periodically, the CM has also appealed to people to get themselves registered for vaccination and take the jab in individual and social interest. “Vaccine and Covid prevention protocol are the only ways to keep the virus away. All eligible persons must shun fears and take the vaccine,” he appealed to people in Siddhartnagar on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/under-mission-june-1cr-people-to-get-vaccinated-contain-3rd-wave/articleshow/83049634.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Hyderabad||Lab technician held for forging RTPCR||Hyderabad: Jawaharnagar police arrested a lab technician for cheating a businessman and his family members by giving them forged RTPCR test results. The accused, S Kiran Kumar, 26, is a lab technician at a private hospital in Nacharam. On May 27, businessman, D Sunil Kumar, 44, of Dammaiguda in Keesara lodged a complaint with police alleging that Kiran Kumar has duped him for Rs 18,500 by providing forged RTPCR test reports for him and his family members. About a month ago Sunil Kumar contacted the accused to collect samples for RTPCR test after developing symptoms of Covid-19. On April 29, Kiran came to Sunil’s house and collected swabs of four family members. On May 1, Kiran gave test reports indicating that Sunil tested positive for Covid-19 and the remaining members tested negative. As Sunil’s wife, Naga Laxmi and their daughter Yashvi continued to have symptoms, Sunil again called Kiran on May 4 to collect samples of them and on May 7, Kiran gave test reports which indicated that both of them also tested positive for Covid19, Jawaharnagar inspector M Madhu Kumar said. Subsequently, Kiran also brought two doctors to the house of Sunil and collected Naga Lakshmi’s blood samples as she complained of stomach pain and Sunil paid Rs 7,500 to Kiran. On May 23, Sunil, along with his wife, two daughters and his brother in law, gave samples to Kiran and on May 25, Kiran sent them results indicating that all of them tested negative for Covid19. “Sunil had some doubts about the negative test result and tried to contact Kiran. However, Kiran lost his cell phone during the same time and his phone remained switched off. Sunil contacted the lab whose forged RTPCR test certificates, Kiran, provided and found out about the fraud,” the inspector said. Based on Sunil’s complaint, police registered a case under section 420 of the IPC and Section 51 (B) of Disaster Management Act. “We have arrested Kiran and he confessed to have forged the test results in his computer. The victims underwent Covid-19 medication based on the forged test results and all of them currently tested negative for Covid-19.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Global tender for 1 crore vaccine doses||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has floated a global tender to buy 1 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines from international manufacturers to tide over the acute vaccination shortage the capital is facing.  The vaccination of young people (18-44 age group) has been on hold for the past five days due to shortage. Covaxin is not available with Delhi government for people aged 45 years and above. According to a tender floated by the health department, the government wants the vaccines to be delivered to it in a staggered manner within 45 days from the award of the tender. It wants the first supply within seven days and the second consignment within eight to 15 days. The vaccines need to have the approval of the drugs controller general of India. The government will not buy vaccines from manufacturers belonging to countries sharing border with India like China, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The tender was uploaded on the government’s website on Friday and also published in newspapers. Sharing vaccination bulletin on Friday, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said that for the fifth consecutive day, youth had not been vaccinated in government schools and added that people were forced to get vaccinated at private hospitals at expensive rates. “Vaccine doses for the youth are not being supplied to state governments, including Delhi government,” said Atishi asking why there is no shortage of vaccines in private hospitals administering vaccines at expensive prices. Vaccination in government-run centres is free. Due to lack of vaccines, only 39,020 people were vaccinated on Thursday. Until recently, over 1 lakh people were getting vaccinated in the capital. “Due to better vaccination process in Delhi, youngsters from NCR, including Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon, also got vaccinated till a few weeks ago. Forty-two per cent of people aged 45 years and above have been vaccinated, but now, the vaccines are not available. We would like to appeal to the central government to provide vaccines to the youth of Delhi at the earliest,” Atishi said. “We do not have any clarity on how many doses will be supplied to us in the near future. Vaccination is the only way to combat the virus, and Delhi has faced the most hardships because of the pandemic. Hence, it is our appeal to the Centre to make vaccines available at the earliest for the people of Delhi,” Atishi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/global-tender-for-1-crore-vax-doses/articleshow/83047150.cms||AlokKNMishra

It all began in 2019 when Verpo Edna Magora from the Philippines became friends with Pawan Kumar of Hardoi, who used to work in a hotel in Delhi. Narrating the sequence of events, SP, Hardoi, Anurag Vats, said: “Love blossomed during social media interactions after which Magora decided to fly down to India to meet Pawan.

Pawan lost his job and decided to return to his native village Bagarpurwa in Hardoi with Magora.” The couple continued to stay in Hardoi since then but did not inform the local police or the district administration about her stay. “Her visa had expired long back. She tried to get it extended but failed. She contacted a friend on Facebook who got in touch with her family and contacted the embassy in India,” Vats said. The embassy got in touch with the local administration. Pawan was served a notice for not informing the police about the Filipina’s stay in the village. The woman was allowed to visit a family friend in Dehradun with the help of the embassy. Meanwhile, Edna told media persons in Hardoi that she was in a relationship with Pawan and nobody had forced her to come to India. “I stayed here on my own will but now it has become very difficult to stay in the village. The financial situation of Pawan is very bad,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/from-philippines-to-india-back-a-love-story-cut-short-by-harsh-reality/articleshow/83049651.cms||---

Action against such hospitals can include severing their water and drainage connections and others steps. The fire department has also issued notices to the hospitals regarding the absence of fire safety nodal officers and first respondents. These are persons from the staff of the hospital who are trained by the fire department. One of the three first responders at the hospital has to be compulsorily on duty at any given time.

During the GST council meeting with Union finance ministry on Friday, he said that the Centre should immediately release Rs 218 crore as state’s share from Rs 13,000 crore Integrated Goods & Services Tax (IGST) funds received by Consolidated Fund of India. He pointed out that state got Rs 2,638 crore as ISGT fund. “Due to Covid-19-induced economic slowdown, the state suffered income loss and expenditure has gone up, in view of this it is better to increase the borrowing limit for states under Finance Regulatory Budget Management Act (FRBM Act) from three per cent to five per cent,” he said. He said that the state is spending a lot of income on health expenditure. The finance minister also appealed to the Centre to not include neutral alcohol under the GST. The Centre is getting 18% income from surcharge and cess. “The Centre had received Rs 3.99 lakh crore as surcharge and cess out of Rs 22 lakh crore income,” he pointed out. Telangana is also losing Rs 3,439 crore income which would mean 2.02% income. “Please don’t include alcohol and neutral alcohol in GST and permanently remove neutral alcohol from GST,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-must-release-rs-218-crore-harish/articleshow/83047225.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The state sought these relaxations in the national GST council meeting which was held virtually, and the council has agreed to do the needful, said deputy chief minister Nitin Patel Patel, who is also the state health and finance minister, along with top officials of the state finance department attended the online meeting. The state wanted the GST rates cut on ventilators, other equipment, and medicines used for Covid-19 treatment. Patel said, “The meeting of the GST council went very smoothly. He added, “The council has also promised to give Rs 13,000 crore this year as the GST income gap to Gujarat.” Patel added: “Last year, the amount of the GST income gap was Rs 9,200 crore. “Like other states, we requested the GST council to reduce the GST rates on medical oxygen plants, oxygen generators, concentrators, and oximeters.” He added: “The council agreed to reduce the rates from the present 12%.” The DyCM said, “We asked the council to reduce GST rates on life-support machines like ventilators and on medicines to lower cost of Covid-19 treatment.” Currently, the rates on these essentials range from 12% to 18%, he said. “The council decided to appoint a ministerial committee with representation from various states,” he said. “The council requested the committee to submit its views by next week’s meeting.” Patel further said: “We are hopeful of a significant reduction in the GST rates on life-support systems and other Covid-19 essentials.” The stte government had also sought a cap on late fee payment charges as many dealers and GST card-holders requested relaxation.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot dismisses BJP’s charge of vaccine wastage||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday rubbished the allegations of the BJP that 11.5 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines in the state have been wasted. He said the BJP is trying to play politics by spreading lies and bringing down the morale of frontline workers. “The news reports alleging that 11.5 lakh corona vaccines got wasted in Rajasthan are untrue,” Gehlot said in a statement posted on his Twitter handle. “As of May 26, over 1.63 crore people have been vaccinated in the state. Out of this, 3.38 lakh doses got wasted, which is just 2%. This is much lower than the national average of 6% wastage. The Centre has kept the wastage limit of 10%,” he further said. Gehlot added, “It seems that deliberate attempts are being made to mislead public during the pandemic. We are working to fight the coronavirus by taking everyone along, but the BJP is trying to bring down the morale of the corona warriors who have been working day and night for the last14 months.” The CM said the entire nation is watching the ‘politics of lies’ being done by the BJP at the time of the raging pandemic. “I will appeal the opposition leaders of Rajasthan that instead of creating all kinds of controversies, pressurise the Centre by looking at the interests of the state so that the state can get more vaccines,” Gehlot said. Gehlot urged the state-level BJP leaders to push the Centre for free vaccination. “Rajasthan has received 14,94,750 vaccine doses for the age group of 18 to 44 years, so far 15,07,830 people have been vaccinated. In this age group, extra doses in vaccine vials have also been used, which has given additional vaccine to 13,080 people,” he added. Previously, due to the condition of the central government, only those registered on the CoWIN app could get the vaccine. The central government removed this condition, which made zero wastage of vaccine possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-dismisses-bjps-charge-of-vaccine-wastage/articleshow/83047221.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Jaisalmer district makes full use of Covid vaccine doses||JAISALMER: At minus 10.4% doses, the desert district of Jaisalmer has recorded the least wastage of vaccines in the state. The district administration and the health department formulated a four-level monitoring system which helped bring down the wastage of doses. Churu tops in wasteage with 39.37%, Hanumangarh at 26.40%, Bharatpur at 17.13%, Kota at 16.71% and Chittorgarh at 11.81%. On the contrary, some districts recorded the wastage in the negative, Sriganganagar -0.26%, Udaipur -1.27%, Banswara -1.93%, Jhunjhunu -3.32% and Jaisalmer -10.24%. Collector Ashish Modi said till now 1.19 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in the district. Each vial contains 11 doses, and considering one dose as wastage, only10 doses are administered. But in Jaisalmer, the wastage was strictly controlled and all the 11 doses were administered. The doses have to be used up within two hours opening the vial, otherwise it gets wasted, he added. Committees were formed in each village consisting patwaris, ANMs, Asha workers and others to monitor the vaccination drives. Achieving this feat in a district like Jaisalmer was remarkable as, unlike other districts, the villages are far-off. It was expected that the district would report the highest wastage, but due to the efficient micro-management by the teams, not a single dose was wasted in Jaisalmer, said district vaccination in-charge Dr Kunal Sahu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaisalmer-logs-least-wastage-of-vaccines-in-state/articleshow/83047192.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal accuses Centre of not helping non-BJP ruled states||JAIPUR: In the GST Council meeting on Friday, UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal, along with finance ministers of states like Punjab and West Bengal, raised objections to the taxes on Covid vaccines, medicines, oxygen machines and related medical equipment and urged the Centre to bring down GST rates to zero on these products. He also accused the Centre of supplying enough oxygen, tankers, medicines and vaccines to BJP-ruled states and treating non-BJP ruled states with indifference. During his address, Dhariwal, who represents Rajasthan in the Council, said the Centre left the onus on the states of vaccinating people in the 18-44 year age group and allowed the companies to fix three rates for the same vaccine which is not appropriate. He said, “We have decided to buy vaccines worth Rs 3,000 crore. But the Centre is collecting GST on vaccines at 5%. Also, the medicines and equipment are levied 12% tax, which is not right.” He said the chief minister has already written to the Centre to free the vaccines from GST. Raising the issue of compensation, he said that the Centre is bound by the GST law to compensate states for the shortfall in revenue arising out of GST implementation at a time when the own tax sources of the state during April and May have fallen by 80%. “So far the Centre has given Rs 7,561.36 crore, out of which GST compensation is Rs 2,957 crore and compensation loan is Rs 4,604 crore in 2020-21. But instead of Rs 4,604 crore loan, it should have been compensation for the loss of revenue. The Centre should release Rs 4,635.29 crore as compensation for revenue loss in 2020-21,” added Dhariwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhariwal-accuses-centre-of-not-helping-non-bjp-ruled-states-wants-no-gst-on-vaccines/articleshow/83047227.cms||---

The residents claimed that several parts of the city face water scarcity during the summers and have to arrange tankers to get sufficient water supply. Vijendra Batra, a resident of Dalanwala, said, “Not just scarcity, people in the locality have faced issues in the past where water supply was cut off for days due to some fault. The adequate pressure of water to reach the household is also a concern. While saving water should be done by all, the authorities must take other relevant steps.” Meanwhile, a brief spell of heavy rain a few days ago had exposed the state of the city’s roads. The officials from Dehradun Municipal Corporation have claimed that drains will be cleaned before the monsoon as a regular practice to avoid waterlogging. When contacted, executive engineer, Manish Semwal from Jal Sansthan, said, “Though we are monitoring the situation regularly, so far the requirement is being met due to good rainfall and lockdown as commercial units are closed. We have enough means to take care of the need for water for all.” Brigadier (retd) KG Behl told TOI, “It is important to store rain water and ensure ground water recharge. Once that is achieved the tube wells and other water resources will never dry up. It is a joint initiative. People will have to play a crucial role at individual levels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/double-challenge-for-civic-bodies-to-avert-waterlogging-ensure-enough-water-supply/articleshow/83045448.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The reservations will be implemented for all the categories of Backward Classes i.e., BC-A 7%, BC-B 10%, BC-C-1%, BC-D-7% and BC-E-4% in respect of reservation of seats in educational institutions and reservations in services. The extension orders include the percentage of reservations and also age concession of 5 years for the purpose of recruitment, in order to facilitate their adequate representation and also for upliftment and overall development. The existing reservations for BCs were extended in the undivided Andhra Pradesh in May 2011 for 10 years up to May 31, 2021. Then the reservations were extended to 112 castes and later orphaned and destitute children category was included as the 113th group in 2015. More recently in September 2020, the government accepted the recommendations of Telangana State Commission for Backward Classes and included 17 new castes in the list of BCs under group-A and Group-D, taking the total number of communities under BC reservations to 130. Backward Classes principal secretary B Venkatesham issued the orders and stated that the quota in favour of BC E group comprising socially and economically backward Muslims would be subject to the outcome of civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court. The reservations for BCs are being extended for time to time. The quota was introduced on the recommendations of KN Anantaraman commission in 1970. This is the fifth extension.

Speaking during the signing of an MoU between the Uttar Pradesh Institute of Forensic Sciences (UPIFS) and Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, the CM said the forensic science institute which was coming up in Sarojininagar area of Lucknow should be completed at the earliest and made functional within a year. He said the institute should be affiliated with the National Forensic Sciences University of Gujarat. “Both judiciary and police have acknowledged the importance of forensic science in crime control. The nature of crime has undergone a change and criminals are using technology to commit misdeeds. To crack down on criminals, it is necessary that investigation is upgraded and made scientific,” Yogi said. He added that the need for a forensic science institute in the state was felt to ensure quick resolution of cases. Stressing on the need for good faculty for the institute, Yogi said that along with theory, focus should also be on its practical application. “Courses should be designed in such a manner that we can train capable manpower which will be helpful in solving crimes,” the CM said. A senior official in the home department said that the purpose of the institute was to provide training in police administration, forensic science, behavioural science, advances in technology and management. “With this MoU, innovative education, training and research in the fields of science and technology can be provided to the society. Centres of excellence and innovation and other facilities will also be developed for the benefit of students and faculty of the institute and the university,” he said. “It will also provide mutual benefit of different technologies. The two institutes will jointly develop methods for application of latest technology in police and forensic sciences and formulate standard operating procedures,” he added. The institute is coming up on a 50-acre land in Sarojininagar tehsil. A centre of excellence is also being set up which would provide facility and training in scientific investigation.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government undecided over vaccinating Pakistani migrants||JODHPUR: Uncertainty over vaccination of Pakistani Hindu migrants prevails as the state government has sought more time from the court to file a reply pertaining to identification of this community for vaccination. Division bench of Justice Vijay Bishnoi and Justice Rameshwar Vyas observed during the hearing of the matter on Friday that despite the central government provisioning in its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) about vaccination to those with no prescribed identity cards, the state government was yet to take steps about their identification for vaccination. After this observation, the additional advocate general (AAG) sought some time to furnish the details about the steps taken by the state government for every district in this regard. The court granting him time, has listed the matter for hearing on June 3. Before this, AAG K S Rajpurohit submitted before the court that the SOP issued by the Centre on May 6 was silent about the Pakistani minority migrants and clarification in this regard has been sought from the central government for their vaccination, who have not yet been granted citizenship. Replying to this submission, additional solicitor general (ASG) Vipul Singhvi stated through an affidavit that the central government has already issued detailed SOP on vaccination of the persons without prescribed identity cards through Co-WIN on May 6 and after receiving the requisite information from the state and district administration regarding the groups included in the SOP, the vaccines would be provided to them. With this, the court observed, “We have also noticed that several directions regarding identification of groups of people including in the SOP have been given, but the state has not submitted any details regarding the identification of such groups.” Listing the matter for hearing on June 3, the court has directed AAG Rajpurohit to submit a detailed report regarding compliance of the guidelines of SOP in the state. Referring to the matter, president of Seemant Lok Sangthan, Hindu Singh Sodha said that the SOP has mentioned 7 categories, with no specific mention of these minority migrants. “But the SOP mentioned ‘other vulnerable communities’ and these minority migrants are a vulnerable community. So, there should not be any confusion on the identification of these people for vaccination as per this SOP,” he said. He also reiterated the need to include these migrants as beneficiaries under National Food Security Act or PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana of the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-undecided-on-vaccinating-pak-migrants-seeks-time-from-hc/articleshow/83047247.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab cuts power tariff for domestic users||Chandigarh: In a move that is likely to benefit 69 lakh domestic consumers in Punjab ahead of the 2022 assembly polls, the per unit power tariff has been slashed 50 paise to Re 1 per unit in some categories. The tariff for the commercial consumers and small and medium industry remains unchanged, while there is a negligible (less than 2%) rise in tariff for large industrial consumers. In its power tariff order for 2021-22, Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) said, "In view of the hardship faced by weaker sections of society due to Covid pandemic, the per unit tariff for domestic consumers with load up to 2kW and consumption slabs of 0-100 units and 101-300 units have been reduced by Re 1 and 50 paise, respectively." For domestic consumers having loads between "2kW & up to 7kW and for consumption slabs of 0-100 units and 101-300 units, rates have been reduced by 75 paise and 50 paise, respectively. This will result in financial relief of Rs 682 crore to them." Reacting to the decision, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said the cut in domestic power tariff will provide major relief to poor domestic consumers during Covid. "This is the second year in a row that the power tariff for domestic consumption in the state has been reduced…," he said. Amarinder also hailed the regulator’s decision not hike increase tariff for commercial consumers as well as small and medium industry amid the pandemic. Even the increase in tariff for industrial users was quite marginal, he pointed out, adding that this would also come as a relief to industry, which had also been severely impacted by the lockdowns and demand crisis as a result of the unprecedented contagion outbreak. "The industry has been getting power subsidies from the state government since 2017, when tariff was reduced to Rs 5 per unit as variable cost... subsidy provided to industry by the state government for FY 2021-22 will be Rs 1,900 crore," he said. Amarinder also said that despite the revenue shortfall in the state exchequer due to the Covid crisis, his government was committed to continue giving free power to the farmers and subsidized power to the industry. The tariff for agricultural power (AP) consumers has been increased marginally by 9 paise. For the FY 2021-22, the Commission has determined ARR (after adjusting gap of previous years) of PSPCL as Rs 32982.49 crore which includes ARR of Rs 1331.71 crore for PSTCL to be recovered through tariff. On the demand of the industry, the facility for use of electricity by the night category consumers, during the extended 4 hours at normal tariff, has been extended for the whole year. Concerns over “costly power” were earlier flagged by a few Congress MLAs during their meetings with CM’s principal adviser Prashant Kishor and opposition parties like AAP too have been raising the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cuts-power-tariff-for-domestic-users/articleshow/83047251.cms||---

Of these, 17,000 beds will have oxygen facilities. In the second wave, many Amdavadis had to hunt for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders, line up at crematoriums and see their kin lose lives to post-Covid complications. To prevent this during the third wave, Ahmedabad is likely to need 800 tonnes of oxygen per day, equivalent to the state’s total medical oxygen use in March. The AMC is procuring 3,800 jumbo 70-litre oxygen cylinders, in addition to the 1,200 procured earlier. “These 5,000 cylinders will help us lay oxygen lines at community, exhibition and banquet halls. In the April-May wave, the city’s requirement was 320 tonnes,” said an AMC official. Community halls and banquet halls which normally host weddings and social functions will also have Covid beds with oxygen lines. The AMC plans to keep 2,500 beds at these community halls. Eight major AMC community halls have been identified for this repurposing, while private banquet halls are being roped in the South, West, North West and South West zones to host oxygen beds. “The medical staff at these halls will be provided by private nursing homes and hospitals. AMC will pay for these services,” said a senior AMC official. All 1,200 beds at SVP Hospital in Ellisbridge will be converted to oxygen beds. Similarly, 500 oxygen beds are being arranged at VS Hospital, 800 beds at LG Hospital and 300 beds at Shardaben Hospital. “We expect the arrangements to be over by first week of July.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-gathers-breath-for-third-wave/articleshow/83047295.cms||Paul John
---||Hyderabad||SC stays ACB court trial, relief for Revanth||Hyderabad: A day after the Enforcement Directorate filed a chargesheet against him in the cash-for-vote scam case, Congress MP A Revanth Reddy got relief when a vacation bench of the Supreme Court on Friday directed the ACB special court in Hyderabad not to cross-examine witnesses in the case until further orders. A bench of Justice BR Gavai and Justice Surya Kant gave the interim direction while hearing a petition filed by Revanth Reddy. It stayed the trial court process and the session of cross-examination. This would mean that the ongoing ACB court trial against the accused in the case will come to a halt. Revanth and others were charged by the ACB with bribing then Anglo-Indian MLA Elvis Stephenson to influence him to vote in favour of a TDP candidate in the 2015 MLC elections. The SC bench also issued notices to the Telangana government, ACB and others asking them to reveal their stand on the plea of Revanth within four weeks. However, it asked the high court which is slated to hear the matter on June 18 to decide the matter on that day itself or within a week from then. Revanth was contending that he was aggrieved with the action of the trial court in asking him to cross-examine the de facto complainant against Stephenson. Since the main examination of Stephenson was over and his deposition was recorded, the trial court asked Revanth, prime accused in the case, to cross-examine him. Revanth was apprehensive about doing that now. Aggrieved by the trial court order, Revanth approached the high court saying that an investigation officer (IO) is a key witness and hence he wants to see his deposition also before venturing into cross-examining the de facto complainant. “The IO may revise his version later if I reveal my defence during the cross-examination of Stephenson,” he said. The high court did not stay the trial court process and adjourned the case to June 18 for hearing. Revanth then approached the apex court seeking a stay on the trial court proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-stays-acb-court-trial-relief-for-revanth/articleshow/83047263.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Schools, students split on evaluation & CET weightage||Mumbai: Schools and students are divided over the state’s Class X assessment methodology and the weightage to the optional common entrance test for Class XI admissions. “Will a student who secures 90% in school assessment and decides not to appear for CET lose a college seat to one who secures 40% in CET?” asked Fr Flovi D’souza, principal, Don Bosco School, Borivli. He said the government should have simply made CET mandatory. The state has decided to give more weightage to a CET score in Class XI admissions. While the first round of Class XI admissions will be open only for CET scorers, the state has to still draw up details of what happens to students who scored well in Class X but did not take CET. Education department officials said if a CET is made mandatory, all 16 lakh students who had registered for SSC will have to appear for it. “The exams were cancelled to avoid overcrowding,” said an official. Shirley Pillai, principal, Powai English High School, said holding a CET after announcing Class X results based on internal assessment shows lack of trust in schools’ marking methods. Makarand Dharmadhikari, a parent from Kalyan, shared the view. “And what about students from rural areas? Is it a given that students from rural areas will not appear for CET and be content with school marks?” Those in favour of CET said internal assessment by boards would be based on different methodologies. “The CET will allow a level playing field,” said the principal of a city college. Radhika Shah, a parent, too said she is glad about CET. “School assessment marks can be inflated,” said Shah. Sunita George, principal, Bombay Scottish School, Mahim, said a multiple-choice question (MCQ) exam should be the norm. “The concepts on which the Class X syllabuses of all boards are based are the same. A CET is the best solution.” At Bandra’s Anjuman School, all the 400 students were told to prepare for CET. “Our assessments are in place and the girls are prepared for CET too. The state has done its best in the given situation,’ said principal Saba Patel. Suresh Nair, principal, Vivek College, Goregaon, though, said, “Many of our students went to their native towns during the lockdown and are unreachable. How do we assess them?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-students-split-on-evaluation-cet-weightage/articleshow/83047271.cms||---

Revanth is among the front-runners for the post of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president along with party veteran and MLC T Jeevan Reddy, former minister and MLA D Sridhar Babu and MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy. Appointment of a new TPCC president is due soon and the change of guard may take place in June. Sources in the AICC said Revanth is also being considered for the crucial post of leading the party in 2023 assembly elections as chairman of the Congress campaign committee. Though a section of senior party leaders have floated a group “Congress Loyalists Forum” and have been writing to the party high-command in Delhi to give the TPCC chief’s post to only loyal Congress leaders and not to those who came into the party recently, a senior leader in AICC said there are several leaders at the national level against whom ED is investigating. “None of the aspirants are ruled out of the race as on date. AICC president Sonia Gandhi will take a decision. For now, she has called upon the party leaders to focus on helping the Covid-19 patients. Whenever she finalises a name, the rank and file of the party have to abide by it,” a senior AICC leader said. Interestingly, Revanth himself had told a private television channel in January that he was more suitable for the post of the chairman of the Congress campaign committee, as it suits his temperament, mindset and personality. However, this was said by him based on the talk that Sonia Gandhi had finalised Jeevan Reddy for TPCC president’s post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-in-race-for-tpcc-chiefs-post/articleshow/83047273.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Lucknow||Finally, Ayodhya Mosque Trust gets tax exemption for donations after 9 months||AYODHYA: Nine months after Ayodhya Mosque Trust — Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) — applied for tax exemption under Section 80G for donations to the mosque-hospital project, it finally received approval from Central Board of Direct Taxes on Thursday. The nod came after a rejection, a re-application and an appeal to the Union finance ministry. The Trust, which was constituted following Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict, was starved of funds without Section 80G certification that exempts tax for donations to charitable institutions. IICF was formed on July 29, 2020, and applied for tax exemption on September 1, 2020. Talking to TOI, Ayodhya Mosque Trust secretary Athar Hussain, said, “Objections and queries raised by the income tax department and the procedural delay impeded donations for construction of the mosque-hospital complex. Contributions from abroad too were choked in absence of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) approval, which makes Section 80G a mandatory prerequisite. Till now, we have received Rs 20lakh as donations and we haven’t launched a crowdfunding campaign. Well-wishers have voluntarily donated. After the tax exemption nod, we will now seek contributions from select donors and apply for FCRA approval,” said Husain. Talking to TOI, Zafar Farooqui, chairman of IICF, said, “We applied for tax exemption on September 1 last year and our application was rejected on January 21, 2021. We re-applied on February 3 and submitted a reply to queries on March 10.” IICF Trustee Captain Afzaal Ahmad Khan, who had sent a request to the Union government and ministry of finance to intervene on non-issuance of tax exemption, has thanked the finance ministry and income tax department. The Ram Temple Trust, which was formed on February 5, 2020, had bagged the tax exemption clause within 2 months of applying for 80G certification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/finally-ayodhya-mosque-trust-gets-tax-exemption-for-donations-after-9-months/articleshow/83049741.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Over 30% black fungus patients underwent jaw removal surgery||JAIPUR: Of the 700 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus), at least 30% patients needed jaw removal, 10% of them were affected in the eye and in 5% of the cases it impacted the brain. Now, government and private hospital doctors, especially those with ENT and eye specialisation, have come together to share knowledge on treatment through video conferencing and constant meetings. TOI on Friday spoke to the authorities to know the severity of black fungus. Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS hospital, said, “Not every patient needs jaw removal or has major impact in the eye. Our doctors here are working day and night to ensure they can avoid jaw removal or eye surgery. But that depends on the impact of the infection.” He added that SMS is receiving patients from across the state with black fungus. “We are in touch with specialists from private hospitals. We need to make collective efforts.” Elaborating more on it, Dr Sunita Agarwal, head of the department, SMS Medical College, said, “For doctors, knowledge sharing is an effective way to get expert opinions of various doctors for effective treatment. In black fungus we are sharing everything with the private hospital doctors. Those who’ve had their jaw removed can use a prosthetic one so that he/she can eat properly.” Attributing the black fungus to the use of steroids and low immunity Dr Satish Jain, a leading ENT specialist, said patients can eat properly once the effects of black fungus vanish. “I have operated upon at least 100 patients. We are in constant touch with specialists of SMS hospital and in case of emergency I am open to give my expertise to the government hospitals as well,” Jain added. 28 hospitals authorised to treat black fungus:Health department on Friday increased the number of hospitals for the treatment of black fungus from 25 to 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/30-black-fungus-patients-underwent-jaw-removal-surgery/articleshow/83047355.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: ‘Preparation for paddy season inadequate’||PATIALA: The power engineers association has written to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) about inadequate preparation for the paddy season following no material procurement, thus risking energy security of the state. The PSEB Engineers Association has warned the PSPCL management that non availability of critical materials like cables, poles, transformers and insufficient regular staff and lax ‘decision-making’ at the management level is detrimental to ensure energy security at this critical juncture. They said the shortage of material was highlighted during correspondence at various level but the management has repeatedly failed in procuring the same. Sources revealed that PSPCL would not be able to provide around 10,000 new domestic connections, over 1,000 commercial connections to shops etc and around 400 connections to industry this season. They said each year PSPCL purchases materials of around Rs 500 crores. PSEBEA general secretary Ajaypal Singh Atwal said, “Decisions on material procurement are being taken purely on the financial front, totally ignoring the fact that PSPCL is an ‘engineering company’ and a minor financial disadvantage at the time of procurement of engineering items may actually be a good decision if the cost to be paid by the company is calculated vis-a-vis loss that has to be incurred due to non availability of such materials and essential T&P.” “Now, in its attempt to hide its failures, has initiated disciplinary action against the same engineers. We demand that the decision to initiate disciplinary action against engineers be withdrawn immediately,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/preparation-for-paddy-season-inadequate/articleshow/83047393.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Shun ‘partybaazi’, work for welfare: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath to pradhans||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has exhorted the newly elected pradhans to avoid ‘partybaazi’ and work for the welfare of everyone without bias. Addressing the pradhans along with governor Anandiben Patel through a video conference, the CM said: “Now you are a pradhan. It does not matter who voted for you and who didn’t. You may have sympathy for the person who voted for you, but where the work is concerned, you have to do it for everyone without any bias,” he said, adding that their role in better governance is so crucial that both he and the governor were addressing them directly. It was also probably the first occasion when both the CM and the governor jointly addressed the elected pradhans. In her address, the governor asked pradhans to ensure that once the curfew was lifted and classes resumed, all children above the age of five were compulsorily admitted to schools. “There should be no child at home. Similarly, all children above the age of three should be enrolled in anganwadi centres,” she said. Patel added that the pandemic had taught people the importance of oxygen and therefore all villages should launch a green campaign and carry out plantations on war-footing. Addressing women pradhans, she said that they should work so well that they are re-elected unopposed at the end of their five-year tenure. She also appealed to pradhans to cooperate with the government in realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of a TB-free India by 2025. Both Patel and the CM encouraged pradhans to work with the government in implementing government schemes, saying that they had the support of villagers and could easily roll out various welfare programmes. The CM said that many of them had started working along with monitoring committees on Covid management even before they took oath. The result was clear for people to see as cases in UP have started dropping steadily. “UP’s recovery rate has been the best in the country. However, this is an unpredictable virus and we cannot afford to be negligent. Isolate people coming from outside. Carry out screening in villages every two to three days. All of you should make your village Covid free,” the CM said. He appealed to the pradhans to ensure that people wore masks and that there was no crowding anywhere. With the government going to expand vaccinations in June, he said that common facility centres should start the process of registering people on the CoWin app. “Focus should also be on sanitation as it would help in avoiding all vector and water-borne diseases. Work for the development of gram sachivalaya in villages which should become a centre for all kinds of work. These should be equipped with computers, internet and banking facilities. You can also play bhajans and desh bhakti songs but with everyone’s approval. If you do all this then your villages will be better than cities,” the CM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shun-partybaazi-work-for-welfare-yogi-to-pradhans/articleshow/83049782.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||ONV Award: Academy to review decision||Thiruvananthapuram: Unnerved by an avalanche of criticism, the ONV Cultural Academy headed by filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan has decided to review the academy decision to honour Tamil poet and popular lyricist Vairamuthu with this year’s ONV award. Ever since the award announcement, criticism has been pouring in from several quarters, questioning the rationale behind honouring Vairamuthu against whom several women had raised sexual harassment allegations in the past. Vairamuthu had always brushed aside such allegations, saying that it were aimed at maligning his reputation. “Following the recommendation of the award jury, the ONV Cultural Academy has decided to review the decision to present the award to Vairamuthu,” said a one-sentence communication sent out by Gopalakrishnan to media on Friday.  He had initially played down the criticism by saying that it was for his literary brilliance that Vairamuthu won the award and awards could not be given to people after checking their conduct. Members of the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) in Malayalam cinema were to first come outwith criticism against the jury decision. Actor Parvathy, director Anjali Menon, director-actress Geethu Mohandas took to the social media, terming the academy decision highly improper. The critics are of the view that Vairamuthu, against whom 17 women, including playback singer Chinmayi Sripaada, had raised sexual harassment allegations, shouldn’t be honoured with the award in the name of one of Malayalam’s greatest literary figures. Vairamuthu has received seven national awards for his film songs. He is also a recipient of Padmasri and Padmabhushan honours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/onv-award-academy-to-review-decision/articleshow/83043775.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Identify peak demand-supply gap during second wave’||GANDHINAGAR: A virtual conference convened by the state chief secretary Anil Mukim on Friday focused on identifying the demand-supply gap in various essential services in Covid-19 treatment. Collectors of all districts were participants at the conference. Sources close to the development said that the meeting was convened to chalk out a strategy to tackle possible third wave of Covid-19 cases. Gujarat on April 30 had recorded highest ever daily cases at 14,605 as the highest active cases in the state reached 1.48 lakh on May 4. Afterwards, the state has recorded a steady decline in both cases and mortality. The experts believe that the third surge could be in the second half of the year during or after the festivities. “The issues discussed during the conference included demand and supply of beds for Covid patients, oxygen requirement, personnel, ventilators, medicines, etc. The collectors were also asked to give an estimate of the surge and steps to ensure that the shortage experienced during the second wave can be averted,” said an official close to the development. The state government, in preparation to the third wave, has also requested the Centre to provide additional ventilators, said officials in the know of the development. “The state government has specifically requested the Centre to provide paediatric ventilators considering the possible impact of the third wave on children. Gujarat government has got 4,300 ventilators under the PM Cares Fund so far and expects the same number of ventilators from the Centre in the coming days,” said an official. Learning from the current surge in cases, the state government is determined to increase beds with oxygen support, said sources. “The first and second surge showed that the need for ventilators is going to increase. While the assessment of the third surge is still underway in coordination with the health department, we would need more ventilators than before,” said the official. “The state government has also sought increase in allocation of medical oxygen to Gujarat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/identify-peak-demand-supply-gap-during-second-wave/articleshow/83047397.cms||---

Government data indicates only four districts recorded more than 100 new cases — Lucknow (172), Saharanpur (154), Meerut (121) and Gorakhpur (116). The pattern shows a declining trend in 96% of 75 districts in the state. In all, 2,402 new cases were reported across the state. “New cases have dipped while recoveries have risen every day since May 1 and the state’s recovery rate went up to 95.7%,” said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. A strong recovery rate is indicative of mild cases and lower fatality, he added. Officials attributed the change in situation to aggressive ‘track, test and treat’ strategy. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal, said, UP’s aggressive testing drive continues despite a sustained fall in active cases. “Over 3.6 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in past 24 hours, of which nearly 1.5 lakh were RT-PCR examinations despite an active case count of 52,000,” he said. The state’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) has also come down to 0.67% and has been below 1% for three days. The weekly positivity rate stands at nearly 1.21%, which is one the lowest in the country. Compared to UP, the daily TPR for several states is as follows: West Bengal (22%), Kerala (20%), Rajasthan (18%), Maharashtra (16%) and Punjab (6%).

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Treat black fungus under free health insurance scheme, says Dr AK Goyal||DEHRADUN: Even though the Covid cases - with 1,942 new infections - have seen a drop in the last 24 hours, cases of mucormycosis or the black fungus in Uttarakhand has reached 179. Eighteen fresh cases were reported at AIIMS Rishikesh. Also, the state health authority on Friday issued a letter to four authorised private hospitals in Dehradun and Haridwar to treat patients with "golden card" under the free health insurance scheme. According to the letter issued by Dr AK Goyal, director - claim management at state health authority-Uttarakhand, mucormycosis is a severe fungal infection identified in association with Covid disease and requires to be treated aggressively owing to high morbidity and fatality. “As per the National Health Authority (NHA) guidelines, package for 'Covid-19' with stratification is available in the health insurance policy. However, this package does not have any provision for treating mucormycosis and there are no government guidelines for the same either. Therefore, we proposed the following procedure as an interim measure, so that the patient can get urgent treatment - free and cashless - on the basis of Ayushman Card,” Dr Goyal added. As per the NHA orders, all patients undergoing IPD treatment against the Covid package should be provided expensive drugs recommended in the treatment of mucormycosis as per ICMR/ GOI guidelines which includes Amphotericin B/ Posaconazole/ Isavuconazole. The hospital claims in respect of such medicines can be submitted to SHA in offline mode and the same will be settled as per actuals and submitted invoices. The NHA also stated that the "patients presenting to hospitals for secondary manifestation of Covid after initial treatment, the surgical treatment for the same disease can be booked as an unspecified package with due justification". “This agreement will be in force till government/ NHA fix the rates,” read the government order issued for Himalyan Jollygrant Hospital, Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital, CMI Hospital in Dehradun and Vinay Vishal Hospital in Haridwar. Meanwhile, a few patients' kin suffering from black fungus created a ruckus at the office of chief medical officer (CMO) in Dehradun on Friday as the officials there allegedly failed to give them Amphotericin B. The incident took place a day after the state received 15,000 doses of the medicine from a pharma manufacturing firm in Rudrapur. “Among the 15,000 doses we received on Thursday, 10,000 were allotted to Doon Medical College, 2,000 to Haldwani Medical College and 3,000 to the Directorate General of Health. The DG health was supposed to distribute them further to the CMOs who could give them to private hospitals. But, the 3,000 injections which were meant for DG health were yet to arrive which is why the CMO had no stock for distribution,” said drug controller Tajbar Singh Jaggi. He added that 3,000 injections will reach Doon later tonight. To resolve the matter, DG Health Dr Trupti Bahuguna spoke to the principal of Doon Medical College and took 2,000 injections on "loan". Moreover, among the 1,942 positive cases reported on Friday, 421 were from Dehradun followed by 295 in Haridwar, 204 in Nainital, 167 in Udham Singh Nagar, 154 in Tehri, 132 in Almora, 103 in Chamoli, 93 in Pauri, 93 in Bageshwar, 92 in Pithoragarh, 78 in Rudraprayag, 75 in Uttarkashi and 51 in Champawat. The state, till now, has reported 325,425 Covid cases. So far, 6,251 deaths have been reported in the state along with 52 in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate reached 85.8 percent with 7,028 patients recovered from the infection on Friday, taking the total tally to 279,516.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/treat-black-fungus-patients-with-golden-card-under-free-health-insurance-scheme/articleshow/83045488.cms||Ishita Mishra

The number of active cases, which has been on the rise since March 6, fell to 3,12,386 on Friday from 3,13,048 on Thursday. The city’s seven-day average test positivity rate (TPR) — which is the number of people testing positive for every 100 samples — dropped from 21.5% recorded in May 14-20 to 15.3% between May 21 and May 27. It was 23.2% a fortnight ago. An average of 30,000 tests are being conducted by the city corporation every day. Cases have dropped at two major disease hotspots in the state, Coimbatore (3,937) and Chennai (2,762), compared to Thursday. The state, however, witnessed its highest single-day toll of 486 deaths on Friday. This takes the total Covid deaths in TN to 22,775 — fourth highest in the country after Maharashtra (93,198), Karnataka (27,405) and Delhi (23,951). Chennai recorded a high of 7,564 positive cases on May 12, which dropped to 2,779 on Thursday, and 2,762 on Friday. Friday’s testing numbers were not declared yet. Active cases in the city dropped from 47,667 a week ago to 43,624 on May 27. Except Shollinganallur and Perungudi zones, active cases in the remaining 13 zones have dropped. Chennai has been under a strict lockdown for more than three weeks, with further increase in restrictions from Monday. Corporation officials said this is a result of multi-pronged strategy which includes door-to-door fever survey, around 400 daily fever camps to identify symptomatic cases, and home triaging to ensure patients don’t travel to triaging centres and expose themselves to others. Experts say that this is a positive trend, but we must also look at the availability of oxygen and ICU beds. Dr S Subramanian, an infectious diseases expert, said that he was cautiously optimistic that Chennai may have reached its peak. “However, with this virus, it is difficult to say. We must continue to remain vigilant for two more weeks. We should not be in a situation where we open up and cases increase again,” he said. He also pointed out that though Chennai’s cases were decreasing, those in the other districts were on the rise, which was another reason for Chennai residents to stay vigilant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennais-test-positivity-rate-dips-to-15-from-21-in-7-days/articleshow/83047508.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Lawyer Vimal Jha alleged that the Kharghar police detained him illegally from April 3 till his arrest. He also alleged he was illegally handcuffed while being produced in court on April 5. Judge R M Joshi will now probe into police’s defence that CCTV cameras installed inside the police station were not functioning. A vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawall and S P Tavade passed the order on May 21 in petitions filed by a voluntary group called ‘Lawyers for Just Society’. Jha himself alleged he was illegally detained in a “false case” over a flat in Vashi and sought a probe into police action. At the hearing via video conferencing, advocate Subhash Jha for the group had said that the time had come to “investigate the investigators”. Jha, through his advocate Prashant Pandey, alleged in his petition that he “is a victim of a well-orchestrated conspiracy hatched by complainant Navnath Gole in collusion and connivance with police officials of Kharghar police station.” Pandey also said that Jha had tested Covid positive and was shifted to a private hospital based on an April 11 order. Jha sought quashing of the FIR against him, saying he had himself seen the CCTV cameras inside Kharghar police station on April 3, and they were operational. He also sought directions for police to submit call data records of the complainant and Kharghar PI from April 2 to April 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lawyers-illegal-detention-in-mumbai-hc-transfers-case/articleshow/83051164.cms||---

This is the second time in the last one year that IMA has decided to tone down and restrict parents from visiting the POP - the most important day in the life of an army officer. This would mean that a major tradition of the POP – the pipping ceremony in which parents and family members of the gentlemen cadets (GCs) formally pin the stars on their uniform marking their transition from cadet to officer – will be sans the GCs’ families. IMA authorities said that the decision was taken to ensure the safety and health of the would-be officers and their family. PRO of IMA, Lt Col Himani Pant, said, “In view of prevailing Covid guidelines, parents and dear ones of the GCs shall not be able to participate in POP events. It is important that these events are extensively covered in real time for the nation to witness continued professionalism and commitment of the Indian Army despite the prevailing crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/parents-will-not-be-allowed-at-pop-due-to-covid-wave-ima/articleshow/83045527.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Lucknow||Rs 9 crore spent on 746 girl schools in Uttar Pradesh with no attendance record||LUCKNOW: The state government has sought a report from basic education officers in 18 districts over withdrawal of Rs 9 crore from banks meant for distribution of food, medicines and stationery to a chain of residential schools for girls — Kasturba Girls Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) — which has no record of student attendance in the last academic session. Officials said either girls didn’t attend class or their attendance was not uploaded online. The government-run school chain comprises 746 KGBVs for girls from economically weaker section. The basic education department, however, said, officials have recorded expenditure made by districts for food, stationery supply and medical aid, but they have no data on student attendance. Special secretary, basic education, Vijay Kiran Anand, said the department has sought details from 18 districts on student attendance between January and March this year. In his letter to BSAs, Anand stated that even when no attendance data was uploaded on the Prerna portal, there has been 100% payment for food, medical aid and stationery supply and this is clearly a pointer to irregularities. Talking to TOI, Anand said, “All basic shiksha adhikaris (BSAs) have been asked to send documents to the state project office of the Samagra Shiksha till June 15. Based on online feed, we can see the amount spent by districts, but funds utilisation needs to be substantiated by documents.” As per expenditure estimates, Rs 96 lakh was withdrawn for KGBV food supply, medical care and stationery in Gonda, Rs 84 lakh withdrawn in Bareilly, Rs 74 lakh in Bijnor, Rs 68 lakh in Deoria, Rs 31 lakh in Fatehpur, Rs18 lakh in Ghaziabad, Rs 32 lakh in Kanshiram Nagar, Rs 23 lakh in Mau, Rs 26 lakh each withdrawn in Meerut, Shravasti and Sonbhadra, Rs 63 lakh in Rae Bareli, Rs 76 lakh in Pratapgarh, Rs 38 lakh in Sant Kabir Nagar, Rs 47 lakh in Unnao and Rs 44 lakh in Sultanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-9cr-spent-on-746-girl-schools-in-up-with-no-attendance-record/articleshow/83049855.cms||Isha Jain

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Builder held for grabbing writer’s Khandala plot||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday arrested builder Yusuf Lakdawala in a money laundering case related to a Khandala land grab issue. He was produced before the court which remanded him in ED custody for five days. The Khandala property, which is worth Rs 50 crore, belonged to eminent writer Mulk Raj Anand who had purchased it from the Nizam of Hyderabad. A few years after Mulk Raj Anand’s death, Lakdawala, with the help of his accomplice Mohan Nair, had forged government records to show that Lakdawala’s father had purchased the land from the Nizam in 1949, and he was the owner. Earlier, Mumbai police had arrested Lakdawala in a cheating case they were investigating in the Khandala land grab allegation and he was released on bail a few months ago. After his release, the ED summoned Lakdawala for his statement, but he refused to appear due to the pandemic. On Thursday, a team of ED officials visited Lakdawala’s house and persuaded him to accompany them for questioning at their office in Ballard Estate. After several hours of questioning, the ED decided to arrest Lakdawala when he refused to provide details related to the case. During investigation, the ED learnt that Lakdawala had transferred Rs 2 crore into account of his accomplice Nair who had used the money to forge the documents and procure an NOC from family members of the Nizam after misleading them. ED officials stated they had earlier searched various premises of Lakdawala and collected several incriminating documents which indicated he had many shell and dummy companies. While examining the bank accounts of these companies, ED found they were not doing profitable business, but transactions worth several crores were made through these companies. It was also found that funds were layered through these shell companies to hide the original source and the money was used to purchase immovable properties. An ED official said scrutiny of the documents revealed Lakdawala occupies some properties, including one at Bandra, but they are not in his name. The ED is examining actual ownership details of these properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bldr-held-for-grabbing-writers-khandala-plot/articleshow/83051179.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Nagpur||NU warns colleges mandating fee payment before filling up exam forms||Nagpur: After receiving scores of complaints from students that colleges were forcing them to pay fees, and not allowing them to fill up examination forms without that, the Nagpur University has warned college managements of action. In a circular issued by students’ development director Abhay Mudgal, colleges were told to accept fees in instalments and allow students to fill up exam forms on priority. The move came after Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists demanded reduction in exam fees charged by NU, and also the college fees. A BJYM delegation led by BJP city chief Pravin Datke and former mayor Sandip Joshi met pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe last week after receiving several complaints from students, particularly from the engineering faculty. The activists requested NU administration to take action against colleges harassing students to pay fees and other charges. On Thursday, National Students Union of India (NSUI) coordinator Amin Noori led protests in front of VC’s office in NU’s old administrative building for the same reason. They later met the pro-VC and apprised him of the problems faced by students due to Covid-19 pandemic. TOI has been regularly highlighting the issue of students facing financial hardship after parents either lost jobs or salaries were reduced, or business had been adversely affected due to a series of lockdowns since March last year. Many students have also lost sole earning members. Citing circulars issued by UGC and AICTE, Mudgal said colleges must take into account the pandemic situation while charging fees from the students. “The colleges shouldn’t stop them from filling up exam forms even if they haven’t paid their fees. The principals and heads of department should take responsibility that students wouldn’t be deprived of the exams at any cost,” he said while reiterating his warning. The NSUI delegation comprising Nikhil Wankhede, Sayyad Farman Ali, Chetam Meshram and others informed that since NU was taking only online exams, it shouldn’t charge such hefty fees from students. “In pandemic times, NU should grant concessions to students on humanitarian grounds, as we all are suffering on the financial front. NU doesn’t have to incur expenses like evaluation of answer books, making arrangements at exam centres, and printing questions papers and answer sheets. So it must pass on these savings to students by reducing the fees,” they demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-warns-colleges-mandating-fee-payment-before-filling-up-exam-forms/articleshow/83045598.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The 44-year-old joined the doctor and nurses who was trying to revive a sinking Covid-19 patient albeit without much success. Wearing a PPE, Muthuraja was about to start his interaction with Covid patients when he heard the relatives of a 70-year-old critically ill patient screaming for help. While nurses and a doctor rushed to him, Muthuraja joined them. As the patient showed no sign of recovery, he was administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A video of the MLA administering CPR to the patient along with the nurses and doctor went viral on social media platforms later. The patient, however, lost the battle within a few minutes. Nevertheless, the MLA received appreciation for his efforts. “The oxygen saturation of the patient dropped below 50 and he was also showing symptoms of bradycardia where the heart rate lowers than normal,” said Muthuraja. “We tried to revive the patient by administering CPR, but could not revive him,” he said. Muthuraja said there are instances when patients survive after CPR but in this case he could not as the patient was about 70 with comorbidities like diabetes and high blood pressure. Dr Muthuraja is a diabetologist who runs a multispeciality hospital in Pudukottai. He was a public health officer for 15 years who served as block medical officer in Pudukottai before quitting the job six months ago to contest the assembly election. “I saw the nurses and doctors struggling to do the needful. Since I was wearing PPE, I decided to extend a helping hand hoping it may help revive the patient,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/doc-turned-mla-tries-to-revive-sinking-patient/articleshow/83047587.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She alerted the neighbours and the Bhandup police. The police arrested the couple from Uttar Pradesh as both were found to be missing from the vicinity since the murder last month.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 340 gm rare radioactive substance seized, 8 held||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow police on Friday arrested eight persons who claimed to have californium – one of the most expensive radioactive substances in the world – in their possession and were about to sell it in black market. Police have recovered 340 grams of the substance and said that according to experts, the value of 1 gram of californium is Rs 170 crore. Californium is used in treatment of cancer. The sample of the seized substance has been sent to IIT-Kanpur for identification. Police have not ruled out the possibility that the arrested conmen might have been trying to dupe some gullible buyers by selling an ordinary substance claiming it to be californium. Lucknow police commissioner, DK Thakur, said: “Prima facie it appears that the recovered substance has some radioactive properties but only experts can establish if it is actually californium or not.” The arrested persons were identified as Abhishek Chakraborty, Amit Kumar, Sheetal Gupta (all from Lucknow), Harish Chaudhary, Ramesh Tiwari and Shyam Sundar (of Basti) and Mahesh Kumar and Ravishankar Singh from Bihar. Police said Abhishek Chakraborty was the mastermind of the gang. “The mastermind of the gang, Abhishek Chakraborty, claims to have got the material from a coal field in Bihar. He was planning to sell it to a real estate agent and others,” said ADCP, north zone, Prachi Singh. The ADCP said the accused persons were nabbed after a man, Shashilesh Rai, who claimed himself to be a real estate agent, informed the police that Abhishek had promised to give the radioactive substance to him at a throwaway price. Rai said that Chakraborty had already taken Rs 1.2 lakh from him and was demanding more money before handing over the substance. “A police team in civvies reached the spot near Polytechnic crossing and nabbed eight men with the radioactive substance,” Singh said. The ADCP said the police sought the opinion of radiologists and chemical engineers in the city to ascertain the value of the seized substance. “Experts said that 1 gram of the substance costs Rs 170 crore. It is used in metal detectors for identification of gold and silver ores and also in treatment of cancer. Only Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) is authorised by the government to store the substance,” the ADCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/340gm-rare-radioactive-substance-seized-8-held/articleshow/83049866.cms||---

However, experts from the medical fraternity recommended that the state shouldn’t allow any super-spreader events such as political, social or religious gatherings for a couple of months. Some even asked the state to “take things slow till December”. Tope said the CM would assess the situation of each district and a fresh set of guidelines would be issued. While districts where cases continue to surge will see no relaxation, Tope said, “Those where incidence has declined and other parameters such as positivity rate and bed occupancy are looking better will be awarded some relaxations.” Decision on opening of non-essential shops too would be decided by the CM, he added. BMC has urged some relaxations for sectors that directly affect rain preparedness. “We have requested the state to consider opening home repairing agencies, carpenter and umbrella shops, and those related to monsoon readiness,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.There are no plans on starting local trains anytime soon though city’s positivity rate has been under 5% for over 10 days. On Friday, the rate was 3%. Although there is a demand from all quarters to reduce the restrictions given the decline in cases, medical experts have cautioned against it, said state officials. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical adviser to the state government, said the state has to go slow up to December in the wake of Covid virus mutations and continued transmission of cases. “If we open in a hurry, there will be an explosion of cases. The number of people susceptible to the infection is still very high and vaccination coverage is low,” he said. Salunkhe recommends against major opening up till 60%-80% of the vulnerable population has been vaccinated. “The monitoring too has to be daily at the district level. Interventions have to be at the micro district and taluka levels,” he added. Members of the state task force have called for a gradual opening up after close monitoring of new cases in the districts. “It’s purely an administrative decision, but the unlocking has to be smart and gradual,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member. Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the Covid death audit committee, said several districts are still seeing transmission in good numbers. “There shouldn’t be any hurry in resuming normalcy, else we may see a spurt again,” he said. “Largescale relaxations or re-opening of sectors will not be done. Minor relaxations are likely. With vaccinations slowing down due to unavailability of doses, the state is not comfortable unlocking at once,” said a senior state official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-curbs-extended-till-june-15-experts-say-take-it-slow-till-dec/articleshow/83051236.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Ludhiana||Think before you post content online||Ludhiana: The profession of online content creator is attracting youngsters who can earn money and fame by uploading videos on different social media platforms. However, with an intention to get maximum views, they may sometimes post content that can kick off a controversy and land them in a legal quagmire. In one such recent case, city-based YouTuber Paras Singh, 20, of Janakpuri was arrested by the Arunachal Pradesh police for posting a racially discriminating video against the people of that state and their MLA Ninong Ering. After the incident, the cyber cell of the Ludhiana police has started an awareness drive. Assistant commissioner of police (cybercrime) Vaibhav Sehgal said, “Many youngsters are adopting online content creation as a profession. However, they do not know about the risks involved. Besides the city-based YouTuber arrested for posting racially discriminating content, a YouTuber in Delhi was arrested on Friday for animal cruelty as he made his dog float in the air with balloons. Therefore, it is important to make people aware about content on social media that may invite a legal action.”“On Friday, we uploaded a video on the official page of the Ludhiana Police to create awareness about laws against child pornography. We have informed that any person sharing such content can be booked under the IT Act and may face imprisonment of seven years and a Rs 10-lakh fine. We are preparing more videos, especially related to YouTubers and other online content creators,” added Sehgal. When asked if the cyber cell would proactively keep a surveillance on social media, the ACP said, “Every person is active on social media and it is impossible to keep a check. But the cyber cell will take immediate action after receiving a complaint. People can complain to the cyber cell if they find anything offensive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/think-before-you-post-content-online/articleshow/83045600.cms||Payal Dhawan

She managed the feat by raising Rs 10.5 lakh through crowdfunding by running ‘Help Karur Breathe’ campaign three weeks back. One more oxygen concentrator sponsored by Karur-based Maatram foundation was also handed over on Friday, she added. The medical college already has 30 oxygen concentrators donated by Senthil Balaji foundation a few days back. “We had anticipated unprecedented inflow of Covid -19 patients at the Karur government medical college hospital three weeks back given the pace at which patients were flooding the hospitals,” said Jothimani. “We had decided to procure oxygen concentrators as a precautionary measure to ease the demand for oxygen cylinders. Oxygen concentrators are an intermediate effort which can help less critical patients who require oxygen support. Concentrators suck the air, purify it and provide oxygen with concentration of over 90%,” she said. Launching the fund-raising campaign on an online crowdfunding platform, she had asked people to donate generously towards purchasing the equipment. 198 people had donated Rs 10,45,700 with which 10 oxygen concentrators were purchased and it was handed over to the medical college on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-mch-gets-11-more-oxygen-concentrators/articleshow/83047585.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Dept action cannot be stayed till disposal of criminal case: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that when there is delay in the disposal of a criminal case against an employee, the departmental proceedings against such person can be carried on so that the conclusion can be arrived at an early date. Further making it clear that the departmental proceedings against an erring official can continue along with with criminal trial, HC held that the “department cannot be expected to wait endlessly for the trial to conclude”. HC was also of the view that the grant or decline of stay on departmental proceedings would always depend on the facts of the case and there can be no straight jacket formula. A division bench comprising Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sant Parkash passed these orders while dismissing the petition filed by Balwinder Kumar Sharma, the suspended former registrar (recruitment) of the high court and one of the main accused in leaking of the Haryana judicial services examination. The main question before the bench was to decide as to whether the departmental proceedings against him can be permitted to continue in the wake of charges framed by the trial court against him. Dismissing Sharma’s plea, the HC further held that the disciplinary authority has also charged Balwinder for immoral conduct and thereby violating the Government Employees (Conduct) Rules, 1966, Punjab as he had allegedly developed intimate relations with a woman (identity protected). “The petitioner has also been charged for failing to maintain absolute integrity as expected from a judicial officer and thus, has acted in a manner unbecoming of a judicial officer. These charges, by no stretch of imagination, can be gone into or enquired or punished by the criminal court. Hence, seen from this angle as well, we do not find any reason to stay disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner,” the HC held while clarifying that the departmental proceedings against Balwinder shall continue. The HC further observed that the petitioner, being a judicial officer holding the rank of additional district judge and posted as registrar (recruitment) was required to have the highest standards of propriety as well as moral conduct. “One of the documentary evidence that has come on record is by way of call detail record of petitioner – Balwinder Sharma whereby 726 and 34 calls /SMSs have been made between him and accused (his female friend), who incidentally was a topper in the HCS (Judicial) Preliminary Examination. This prima facie reflects towards a conduct not behoving the post that petitioner –Balwinder Sharma was holding,” held the HC. Balwinder had approached the HC seeking directions to quash the order dated November 6, 2019, whereby his request for stay on departmental enquiry till the conclusion of criminal trial regarding the case, was rejected. His main plea was that the criminal trial as well as the departmental proceedings against him is based on the same set of facts as well as documentary evidence and therefore both cannot continue simultaneously because the defence of the petitioner would be prejudiced in a criminal trial if the departmental inquiry is permitted to continue. He had also pleaded that in case the departmental enquiry cannot be stayed till the decision of criminal case, then till the examination of witnesses who are common to both trial and enquiry, the department enquiry be kept in abeyance. Not advisable to force employer to continue paying: HC “Where there is delay in the disposal of a criminal case, departmental proceedings can be proceeded with so that the conclusion can be arrived at an early date… In any case, the burden of proof and the manner in which allegations are to be proved, are different for criminal trial and disciplinary proceedings. The petitioner has been drawing salary, being an employee under suspension and it is neither desirable nor advisable for any Court of law in view of nature and gravity of allegations, to force an employer to continue paying an employee which the establishment does not deem fit to continue as its part by stalling the conclusion of departmental proceedings,” the HC stated in its order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dept-action-cannot-be-stayed-till-disposal-of-criminal-case-hc/articleshow/83047618.cms||Ajay Sura

A Duraisamy, 37 was beaten to death by his brother A Ayyappan, 36, who lived in the same house. Ayyappan, his father and wife were taking care of Duraisamy. Srirangam police said Duraisamy would attend his nature’s call inside his house instead of using the toilet. He did the same on Thursday morning. Ayyappan got angry and clobbered Duraisamy with a bamboo stick on his head. This caused severe injuries leading to his death on the spot. Acting on the complaint from their elder sister R Rani, 38, the Srirangam police registered a case and arrested Ayyappan.

---||Ludhiana||Punjab weekly positivity rate dips to 66-day low||CHANDIGARH: With Punjab seeing a downward trend in new Covid-19 cases, the weekly positivity rate -- the percentage of people who are positive out of the total tested --in the state, too, fell to 6.3%, the lowest in 66 days. The previous lowest weekly positivity rate of 6.66% was recorded during the seven-day period ending March 24. In an encouraging sign, the positivity rate has declined despite a steep increase in daily testing. Even as the state recorded a notable drop of 3.5% in comparison to the preceding week, the positivity rate is still above the 5% level recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Higher the positivity rate, the more difficult it is to control the spread of the virus. During the peak of the massive second wave that had rattled the state, the positivity rate of all the districts had crossed the double-figure mark. Now there are only three districts -- Fazilka (10.9%) Mohali (10.4%) and Bathinda (10%) -- having positivity in double figures while the rate has plunged below WHO's prescribed limit of 5% in five districts and five others have inched closer to the advised mark. After struggling for a long time, Punjab is conducting the fourth-highest tests per million population in the country. The number of tests per day has increased manifold from 28,280 on January 1, 2021, to 72,104 on May 27. As per the last seven-day average, Punjab conducted 2,497 tests per million population, but still behind Delhi (3,322), Uttarakhand (3,325) and Kerala (3,588). For early detection, isolation and treatment of infected people, the government has started screening people living in rural areas across the state. Health department teams have so far managed to cover about 38 lakh households, comprising a population of 1.50 crore. About 1 lakh people suspected to have been infected were tested, and 4,000 were found positive. With more recoveries than new cases in recent days, the active cases have plunged below 50,000 for the first time in over a month. The number of active cases fell to 48,231 on May 27. The number has fallen below 1,000 in six districts while less than 2,000 patients are undergoing treatment in six districts. The state has also recorded a slight drop in the number of Covid deaths. The weekly death toll has come down to 1,290 from 1,425 last week -- a period when the death count fell in 12 districts. Of the total deaths in seven days, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Amritsar and Patiala accounted for about 38% of patients succumbing to the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/punjab-weekly-positivity-rate-dips-to-66-day-low/articleshow/83054381.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Transport department now has surplus oxygen tankers||JAIPUR: In a positive news, the transport department now has surplus oxygen tankers after they had sent out an invite for proposals to get the tankers on rental basis. Officials claimed that they decided to pay a higher rent to ensure that there was no shortage of oxygen vehicles. Around two dozen oxygen tankers have been taken on rent from Gujarat. Rajasthan was also one of the first states to convert nitrogen tankers into oxygen ones. Mahendra Soni, transport commissioner told TOI, “We initially started out with six tankers and now have 54 after taking more on rent. However, fortunately now the requirement for oxygen for Covid-19 patients has decreased due to which many are lying unused. In fact, the ones being filled at Bhiwadi are also waiting to be delivered as the hospitals in the state are now self-sufficient in terms of oxygen supply.” According to officials, the tankers taken on rent are being paid at Rs 150/km. The department had issued an order earlier this month inviting applications for tankers on rent for transportation of liquid oxygen as the country is witnessing a shortage of the gas due to surge in Covid cases, but the department claimed that now they do not need to take more tankers on rent. There are four liquid natural gas (LNG) tankers out of which at least two have undergone a process called purging (cleaning it with oxygen) so that they can be used as well for transportation of oxygen thereby increasing the number of these vehicles to 29 which are owned by the state out of the 54, while the remaining are on rent. The cryogenic tankers used for transporting liquid oxygen are highly specialised and normal tankers cannot be used. The department was also in talks with a Dubai-based individual for providing oxygen tankers, but the plan was dropped as the provider did not have vehicles to transport the oxygen and only the tanks for storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transport-dept-now-has-surplus-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/83047621.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

---||Lucknow||RLD facing a crisis of confidence, will rejuvenate cadre, bolster farmers’ cause: Jayant Chaudhary||As he comes out of the political shadow of his father, late Ajit Singh, newly elected chief of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Jayant Chaudhary faces the mammoth task of resurrecting his party ahead of the high-stakes UP assembly elections next year. The 42-year-old post graduate from London School of Economics speaks to Pankaj Shah about challenges ahead and his plans to revive RLD, which has been facing an existential crisis since the drubbing in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Q: You are the third-generation in your family to head a political party founded by your grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh. How do you counter the nepotism narrative (parivarwaad)? It is a fair question, but I don’t need to counter it. My work will speak and people won’t raise that query. My party followed procedure before appointing me president and we added sanctity to the process. Also, I am not a greenhorn. I have been active in politics since 2002. Q: You face an enormous challenge of taking forward the legacy of your grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh and father Ajit Singh. How will you do it? Now, conditions are similar and so are issues taken up by my grandfather and father. The core issues remain and it’s pertinent to take these up in the wake of farmers’ agitation against new farm laws. Q: Your party has been facing a political crisis for seven years. In fact, your father Ajit Singh and you both lost Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and then in 2019. What are your plans to resurrect your party ahead of 2022 assembly elections? My first step will be to acknowledge the situation. We certainly face a crisis of confidence in our cadre. I will try my best to directly communicate with party workers through online meetings. My father may have lost the elections from Muzaffarnagar in 2019, but he won hearts. His idea was to contest from a place which symbolised politics of hate after 2013 communal riots. The ‘bhaichara zindabad’ campaign was envisaged to build harmony and this will continue in the time to come. Q: Would you bring back the old guard and cultivate a new breed of leadership? I have appealed to veterans, who earlier associated with RLD to return to the fold. I need their guidance. Also, mobilising young leaders is the key in the current political spectrum. There also needs to be a gender balance and more women should be involved in active politics. Q: What are your views vis-a-vis government’s response to the prevailing Corona pandemic? The government has been ill-prepared to face the pandemic. Most families, including mine (father Ajit Singh succumbed to Covid) have faced the brunt. The government mishandled the crisis and instead of providing a healing touch, it’s acting against those who are speaking out on various platforms, including social media. Q: Opposition raising its voice against a ruling dispensation is not new. BJP has been asking the opposition to support the government in this time of crisis. But that does not seem to happen. Your views. A full-fledged propaganda war is continuing despite bodies afloat in rivers and shrouds removed to mask reality. The Opposition is bound to take up the issues like this. It is our duty and responsibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rld-facing-a-crisis-of-confidence-will-rejuvenate-cadre-bolster-farmers-cause-jayant-chaudhary/articleshow/83049880.cms||Pankaj Shah

A Mohammed Ashiq of Malakadai in Coimbatore was picked up from a chicken shop at Needur near Mayiladuthurai around 2.30 am. Police said Ashiq had been working and staying at the chicken shop for the past six months. A special team sub-inspector of Mayiladuthurai aided the NIA in carrying out the arrest. Ashiq was taken to the special court for NIA cases at Poonamalle in Chennai. Police said Ashiq was the prime accused in a case registered by NIA, Delhi on October 30, 2018. He was one of the seven accused of forming a terrorist gang owing allegiance to ISIS. They were also charged with hatching a criminal conspiracy to kill some Hindu leaders of Coimbatore thereby threatening communal harmony besides the security and sovereignty of India. The court had already issued a non-bailable warrant against Ashiq. Initially, the cases were handled by Variety Hall Road police attached to Coimbatore city police. The police had also registered a case on September 1, 2018 on charges of unlawful assembly, criminal conspiracy under IPC and five other sections of unlawful activities (prevention) Act, 1967. Later, it was transferred to NIA since the central agency has been dealing with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nia-arrests-youth-over-plot-to-kill-hindu-leaders/articleshow/83047670.cms||---

The fatality figure in the preceding week (May 14 to 20) was 151, which is 13.3% more than the past week.During the first Covid peak, the number of deaths in seven days had crossed the 100-mark in September last. In the second wave, the highest weekly casualty count was 174 between May 7 and 13.The number of deaths was 134 between April 30 and May 6; 83 from April 23 to 29; 46 between April 16 and 22; 36 between April 9 and 15; 38 from April 2 to 8.On the state’s weekly Covid fatality chart, Ludhiana is at the top, Patiala second (120) and Amritsar third (119). Moga has the lowest number of 13.The health department officials said deaths are more because of the severity of the disease in many cases.“There has been a fall in deaths, as many people have started following the Covid-appropriate behaviour. The third wave is likely. As the virus is mutating and developing new strength, people should be cautious to save theirs and others lives,” said Dr Narotam Dewan, former president of Ludhiana IMA.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dist-tops-state-in-weekly-covid-19-casualty-count/articleshow/83045680.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Jodhpur||Jodhpur administration resumes oxygen supply to industries after a month||JODHPUR: With drastic decline in oxygen demand by hospitals, the industries are now heaving a sigh of relief. The administration had diverted the industries’ entire requirement of oxygen to hospitals as the Covid-19 cases surged. Production in those industries that needed oxygen had come to a standstill. “Now with the demand of oxygen in hospitals declining significantly, the administration has begun to divert the supply back to the industries,” said an administrative official. Major industries requiring oxygen in Jodhpur include handicraft, steel, fabrication etc. and due to non-availability of oxygen to them, the production had been halted for past one month. Some industrial bodies had also asked the administration to resume oxygen supply to these industries considering the improvement in situation. As an estimate, the industrial need of oxygen stands at 2,500 cylinders per day and a total production of the oxygen in the city by the generation units is 4,000 cylinders. From Thursday, the gas producers were given permission to provide oxygen cylinders to the industries in a controlled manner to begin with. By next week, industries are expected to receive oxygen as per their needs. During the crisis period, Jodhpur had even jumped to convert a nitrogen plant into oxygen generation plant and probably presented the first example of this crucial conversion following some mechanical alterations in the nitrogen plant. Meanwhile, about half a dozen oxygen generation plants are already established in different hospitals of the city and a few more are to come up soon. Current requirement of oxygen in the hospitals has fallen to about 60% of the peak time according to reports and with the positive cases sliding down, this need is expected to fall further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/jodhpur-admin-resumes-oxygen-supply-to-industries-after-a-mth/articleshow/83058274.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ludhiana||Bizmen fume as against demand of waiver, fixed power charges hiked||Ludhiana: City businessmen have termed the new power tariff approved by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) as eyewash. Their grouse is centred on the hike in fixed charges, which are applicable on the power connections regardless of the use of electricity.As per the order issued by PSERC on Friday, there has been an increase of Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kilovolt-ampere (KVA) in fixed charges in different categories of power connections. For a very long time, the industrialists have been demanding waiving of fixed charges, but instead these have been hiked. Besides, they are also irked over the increase in tariff of a few categories of power connections, including domestic and some industrial sets.Dev Gupta, vice-president of All India Induction Furnace Association, said, “The new tariff order is a huge setback for factories, especially those having large supply (LS) and power intensive unit (PIU) category connections. Furnace industry will be the worst sufferer as fixed charges have been hiked by Rs 15 to Rs 20 per KVA. It means that the power expenses incurred by us even when our factories are not running have been increased by 6% to 12%. A small furnace factory is billed Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12 lakh per month on account of fixed charges even if it is not doing any activity. Besides this, the rate of per unit of power has also been increase by 7 to 8 paisa, which is like adding insult to the injury.”According to Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners’ Manufacturers’ Association of India, “This is a very disappointing tariff order by PSERC and the commission has once again proved that it does not give any significance to the demand of the industry. Despite being aware of the situation being faced by us for the past one year and our constant requests to waive fixed charges, PSERC gave us a shock by increasing them.”Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Suppliers’ Association of Ludhiana, said, “The state government will pay a heavy price for this anti-industry power tariff in the next elections. The relief being propagated in this tariff was already existing. Businessmen have suffered a double blow as on one side power rates and fixed charges of LS and PIU connections have been hiked and on the other, the tariff of domestic consumers having connections of more than 7KW has been increased by 10 to 20 paisa per unit.

However, the Krishnanagar police busted the racket and seized 434 IMFL bottles and 235 beer bottles packed inside 80 such tins that were being ferried on a loading rickshaw. Inspector Amarsinh Chauhan said that the modus operandi of transporting liquor in grease tins is relatively new. Chauhan said, “The tins even had labels and were moved in a loading rickshaw. At first look, no one would imagine that the tins contained liquor bottles. There was grease smeared on the top or bottom of the tins to make it look as if it actually contained oil.”The police had specific information that liquor was being transported in the loading rickshaw as the informer had even passed on the rickshaw’s registration number. “Based on the information, we kept a watch and intercepted the vehicle. The tins were sealed. However, since the tip-off was accurate, we got a cutter to open the tins and found IMFL packed in boxes inside,” said police. The police have arrested Bipin Jadav, a New Naroda resident who drove the loading rickshaw. During interrogation, he revealed that he had been asked to load the tins but was not aware of its contents. He was given the consignment by one Rakesh Gupta who is on the run.Inspector Chauhan said that the police is searching for Gupta. “Once he is arrested, we will find out from where he got the liquor and where he was sending it to. We have registered a case under the prohibition act against Bipin and Gupta,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/liquor-hidden-inside-tins-of-grease-slips-into-police-net/articleshow/83047674.cms||---

The company has not entered into any partnership or collaboration with any other party for supplying the vaccine, it said. The Hyderabad-based company also said it has initiated legal action against unscrupulous elements committing fraud in the name of Sputnik V vaccine in India. In a joint statement issued on Friday, Dr Reddy’s and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said Dr Reddy’s has not authorised any third party or intermediary to supply Sputnik V on its behalf in India. They urged people to alert the authorities immediately if approached by such unscrupulous elements. “In the last few days, there have been several unsubstantiated reports and claims from various quarters in India on alleged tie-ups for the Sputnik V vaccine. Beware of unauthorised individuals offering fake deals or promising procurement of the vaccine posing as its representatives in India,” the statement said. “The company takes no responsibility for the consequences of unauthorised deals, fraudulent financial transactions or sub-standard products resulting from such fraud,” it added. Pointing out that Dr Reddy’s has the sole distribution rights of the first 250 million doses (first and second dose components included) of the vaccine in India, it said the company continues to engage in direct talks with the government and the private sector to explore partnerships ahead of the commercial launch of the vaccine in mid-June. Dr Reddy’s also said it has put in place cold storage logistics as well as track-and-trace arrangements for the vaccine that are absolutely imperative to ensure the safety and quality of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-warns-against-fake-sputnik-v-suppliers/articleshow/83047665.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

In government hospitals, though attendants are barred from visiting patients, people argue with hospital staff and get in. They should not continue this practice if we have to control the spread,” Nehru told reporters in response to questions. Trichy had recorded 1,617 fresh cases of Covid-19 On Thursday, next to Coimbatore, Chennai, Tirupur and Erode among 37 districts.The minister also mentioned about functionaries and cadres of political parties seeking details about vaccine stock from staff at vaccination centres. “Such information will be available only with the collector. If anyone is found disturbing staff at vaccination centres, they will face action,” he said, adding that Trichy received 52,000 vials recently. Nehru handed 100 oxygen concentrators worth Rs 1.2 crore donated by Metro Rotary Club, 30 more worth Rs 30 lakh on behalf of Blue Sun Foundation and 10 oxygen concentrators worth Rs 10 lakh on behalf of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital in the presence of district collector S Sivarasu and others. On the availability of oxygenated beds, Nehru said MGMGH had 432 of them of which 16 were vacant. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/attendants-getting-into-hosp-wards-spreading-covid-min/articleshow/83047658.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jodhpur administration resumes oxygen supply to industries after a month||JODHPUR: With drastic decline in oxygen demand by hospitals, the industries are now heaving a sigh of relief. The administration had diverted the industries’ entire requirement of oxygen to hospitals as the Covid-19 cases surged. Production in those industries that needed oxygen had come to a standstill. “Now with the demand of oxygen in hospitals declining significantly, the administration has begun to divert the supply back to the industries,” said an administrative official. Major industries requiring oxygen in Jodhpur include handicraft, steel, fabrication etc. and due to non-availability of oxygen to them, the production had been halted for past one month. Some industrial bodies had also asked the administration to resume oxygen supply to these industries considering the improvement in situation. As an estimate, the industrial need of oxygen stands at 2,500 cylinders per day and a total production of the oxygen in the city by the generation units is 4,000 cylinders. From Thursday, the gas producers were given permission to provide oxygen cylinders to the industries in a controlled manner to begin with. By next week, industries are expected to receive oxygen as per their needs. During the crisis period, Jodhpur had even jumped to convert a nitrogen plant into oxygen generation plant and probably presented the first example of this crucial conversion following some mechanical alterations in the nitrogen plant. Meanwhile, about half a dozen oxygen generation plants are already established in different hospitals of the city and a few more are to come up soon. Current requirement of oxygen in the hospitals has fallen to about 60% of the peak time according to reports and with the positive cases sliding down, this need is expected to fall further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jodhpur-admin-resumes-oxygen-supply-to-industries-after-a-mth/articleshow/83047657.cms||---

---||Trichy||Covid mgmt exposes lapses in Trichy’s public health infra||Trichy: The frantic search for hospital beds during the second wave of Covid-19 had exposed the lack of competent health infrastructure under the Trichy corporation to offer in-patient treatment.The city, which has a population of over 10 lakh, lacks a proper government health centre for in-patient treatment, other than the government medical college hospital. This has pushed the residents to choose private facilities. Even though the corporation was sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore under the smart cities mission fund, it failed to focus on the health sector.With 18 urban primary health centres (UPHCs) and three siddha centres, there are over 21 doctors and 100 urban health nurses taking care of corporation’s health centres. At a cost of Rs 15 crore, the corporation a few years back had proposed to construct a three-floor community health centre on West Boulevard (WB) road to serve as a referral centre for 18 UPHCs. While the project was under consideration for a facility at Kodumal hospital complex adjacent to the Ibrahim Park on WB road, the proposal remains only on paper.While the city’s population grew by 12% in the past decade, equal growth was not recorded in UPHCs infrastructure in the past four years. The inefficiency of UPHCs infrastructure came to the light while the civic body looking for establishing a step-down centre (a facility between normal ward and ICU) opted to convert a marriage hall as a Covid care centre. “At least one UPHC in each of the four zones could have been developed as a community health centre with bed facilities to treat residents tested positive,” K Suresh, general secretary, AITUC, Trichy said. There is also a shortage of staff in the UPHCs. “Woraiyur UPHC was recently developed and vasectomy was conducted there. Health infrastructure will be improved once we get adequate staff,” a senior health official with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covid-mgmt-exposes-lapses-in-trichys-public-health-infra/articleshow/83047695.cms||Deepak Karthik

The decision was taken as the special investigating team (SIT) formed January this year to review if the licences issued so far are on genuine grounds has not started the verification drive. First, the service was stopped till February 28, then till March 31 and now indefinitely till further orders. The SIT comprises joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezihan, deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Ashwani Kapur and assistant commissioner of police (licensing) Ranjit Singh. The city police had formed the team after receiving a complaint in which a man alleged that he was not issued a licence, while others had it even on fake documents. DCP Ashwani Kapur said, “We were supposed to call each licence-holder to the office for verification. We have prepared a list too, but after Covid cases increased, the SIT could not start work. Now JCP Elanchezhian has contracted the virus and is on leave. Once he joins duty, the SIT will start work.” The SIT is supposed to check all details under different categories, like gender, profession, income and educational qualification. It will also study the reason given for needing a licensed arm, and if the reason was threat perception, did it still exist.The officer said, “If SIT finds any discrepancy in information shared by the licence-holder or in the reason for getting a weapon, their licences would be cancelled.”There are approximately 18,000 arms licences in Ludhiana commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/wait-indefinitely-to-get-arms-licences-as-sit-yet-to-start-verification-drive/articleshow/83045697.cms||Payal Dhawan

IIL will start with 2-3 million doses per month of Covaxin drug substance, which it will be ramping this up to 6-7 million doses per month by the end of the year and eventually scale it up to 10-15 million doses per month, IIL managing director Dr Anand Kumar said on Friday. Dr Kumar said they are converting their Karakapatla manufacturing unit in Genome Valley, located close to the Bharat Biotech facility, into a Bio Safety Level -3 (BSL3) facility for manufacturing the Covaxin drug substance, even as they are taking up construction of another block on the same premises as part of the process to scale up the Covaxin drug substance output. The Karakapatla faclity is actually a BSL-2+ facility that makes rabies vaccines but the production of these vaccines have been shifted to another facility in Tamil Nadu to ensure the Genome Valley facility is dedicated to manufacturing the Covaxin drug substance. IIL, which was set up the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), was roped in for manufacturing the key Covaxin input by the Centre as part of efforts to rapidly ramp up production of the desi vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iil-to-begin-making-covaxin-drug-substance/articleshow/83047714.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

However, timely response by SDRF, police and fire department personnel helped contain the gas leak in just a few hours. During the operation, two persons working at the sewerage plant and one SDRF official were injured, who are out of danger now. Chlorine gas is used to treat water at the JMC, Heritage sewerage treatment plant at Brahmapuri. According to sources, the gas started leaking from the tanker at 1.30am. On being alerted about the incident, Brahmapuri police called up the control room and fire brigade regarding it. Ghanshyam Kumawat, incharge of the police station, said, “We just alerted them so that if the situation goes out of control, they could be evacuated easily. However, by 9.30am, the situation was under control.” The State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) reached the spot around 3.30am to cap the leaking tanker and put it in a water tank, which was the only way to dispose of the chlorine gas. However, the gas started leaking again and fire brigade was called in. ADG, SDRF Susmit Biswas said that SDRF officials are specially trained in tackling Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) incidents which was beneficial at this time. Additional SP of SDRF Lokesh Sonwal told TOI, “This was the first time we have dealt with CBRN emergency in the city. However, this was part of our training process.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Doctor couple shot dead on Bharatpur road||JAIPUR: In a case of revenge killing, a doctor couple was shot dead in their car on a busy road in broad daylight by two bike-borne assailants in Bharatpur on Friday. The doctor couple, Sudeep Gupta and Seema Gupta, faced charges of burning alive one Deepa Gurjar and her sixyear-old son in 2019. Sudeep was allegedly in an illicit relationship with Deepa. The assailants were the brother and cousin of Deepa, said police. The duo was tracked by Anuj Kumar and Mahesh Kumar, brother and first cousin, respectively, of Deepa to Shri Radhe Chowraha in Bharatpur on Friday afternoon and shot down. The incident, captured on CCTV, shows the face of one of the accused covered while the other is uncovered. After forcing the car to stop on the busy road, the duo parked their bike in front of the couple’s vehicle, walked up to the side of the driver and fired several shots from a firearm at the couple. The assailants then left in their bikes. In the CCTV footage, they can be seen approaching the car, knocking on the window and pumping bullets, first into Sudeep, who was driving, and then at Seema from close range. They then turn towards their bike, fire in the air to create panic, and disappear from the frame in less than 38 seconds. Sudeep died on the spot while Seema succumbed to injuries at a hospital. Seema along with her mother-in-law Sulekha are the prime accused in the immolation case. Seema came out on parole some days ago in the same case. “The incident happened in November 2019. Sudeep had provided an apartment to Deepa and her six-year-old son Surya in Bharatpur’s posh locality. Seema came to know about her husband’s illicit relationship after she received an invitation card from an anonymous person. It was an invitation for Deepa’s new beauty parlour, where Sudeep was to be the chief guest. Seema told her mother-in-law Sulekha about the goings on. In a fit of rage, Seema carried a bottle filled with an inflammable chemical and poured it on Deepa and her son. Both died on the spot,” said the police. Devendra Bishnoi, SP Bharatpur said that it was a case of revenge killing. “Both the accused were identified by us and we are tracking their movement in the city,” said Bishnoi, adding that both the parties were negotiating with each other as Anuj demanded a huge sum to recall his complaint. “It was learnt that Sudeep had agreed to pay Rs 50 lakh, but Anuj demanded more money,” said Bishnoi. Anuj was involved in a firing case some months ago and is wanted by the police. Sensing the seriousness of the incident, IG Bharatpur Range P K Khamesra held a press conference later in the day and assured that the accused would be behind the bars soon. “The case is related to a two-year-old incident in Bharatpur. The accused have been identified on the basis of the footage,” said Khamesra.

The women’s empowerment department will keep a track of the baby’s vaccination and brief the parents about the Chief Minister Rajshree Yojana. The initiative was started in Tonk district on Friday where district collector Chinmayee Gopal launched a book on child marriage free gram panchayat. Tonk is one district where many child marriages take place. Even this year eight child marriages were stopped by the district administration in May. Gopal said that it is a mother’s duty to take care of a girl child and educate her so that she can face any challenges in the world and be independent. She told mothers to be proud if they have daughters and appealed to them to educate the girls and not get them married at an early age. Bhanu Parkesh Yadav, additional director of women’s empowerment department, said that this innovative scheme will give mothers a sense of pride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/moms-of-girl-children-to-get-congratulatory-message-from-district-collector-in-tonk/articleshow/83047715.cms||---

JMC-Greater was trying to force the squatters to leave the corporation’s land, however, asking them to move out during pandemic is being seen as an inhuman act. NHRC has written to Jaipur collector Antar Singh Nehra stating that, “The public authority acted by adopting non-humanitarian approach as the affected families were left in an open jungle by shifting them through the garbage pickup vehicle. The complainant Puran Singh and others, are seeking commission’s intervention in this matter. The commission directs the registry to transmit the copy of complaint to the concerned authority calling for an action taken report within four weeks.” There had been a big tussle between JMC-Greater commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh and mayor Somya Gurjar with the latter alleging Singh had taken this decision against all advices of the mayor. Congress and BJP have blamed each other. Recently, Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra had also written to chief minister Ashok Gehlot asking him to act. Even the National Commission for Women (NCW) has written to police seeking an explanation over the urgency of getting the land vacated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nhrc-writes-to-collector-over-anti-squatter-drive/articleshow/83047755.cms||---

Vaccinated youths were given priority for the tasks involving checking the vital health indicators in the households. Officials said the people below 40 years of age were identified for the volunteering work and will be paid Rs 500 every day. The volunteers will be mostly working within the corporation ward they hail from to avoid travel. “Every volunteer will cover 40 houses per day. They were told to check the saturated oxygen level and body temperatures of all the residents,” a health official with Trichy corporation said. The contact details of residents with low saturated oxygen levels and high body temperature will be conveyed to the nearest urban primary health centre for follow-up. Such patients will also be asked to take RT-PCR test. The civic body has identified volunteers who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine against Covid-19. Youngsters with smartphones and two-wheelers who have completed SSLC were given preference. The identified volunteers will be given an oximeter and thermal scanner. “We had deployed animators and anganwadi workers for doorstep screening, but as they hail from rural parts it was difficult to continue screening during the lockdown,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/volunteers-hired-for-doorstep-screening/articleshow/83047724.cms||Deepak Karthik

While the discovery of oil in the midst of the desert was an unexpected bounty of nature, it did come with a challenge for transportation. The fact that the crude was waxy, it needed a different pipeline that could produce continuous heat to ensure the flow. “The pipeline is built both above and below ground and is equipped with the latest technology for tracking the flow of crude along its length between the two states. Motion sensors and drone technology are deployed to continuously monitor and take action against any unauthorized activity on the pipeline, said Prachur Sah, deputy CEO, Cairn Oil & Gas. The pipeline was recognised by the British Safety Council in 2020 and it is the first of its kind in India. It is equipped with a skin effect heat management system which keeps the crude oil at pre-determined temperatures and helps in the smooth flow. It is also insulated from the outside to guard against any temperature changes due to external factors such as the weather or other natural occurrences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oil-pipeline-from-barmer-to-guj-completes-11-years/articleshow/83047753.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||1 rape case, 3 FIRs: Acquitted man in jail||AHMEDABAD: Rasik Solanki, 24, from Kapadwanj had to rush to the Gujarat high court for bail once again after previously being acquitted in a rape and Pocso case. This happened after he was accused of rape by the sister of the complainant named in the first FIR. In this curious case, Kapadwanj police have filed three FIRs. This was because they came to know that the first FIR lodged by the accuser’s mother was false. The woman had on January 6 accused Solanki of raping her younger daughter and impregnating her. He was also accused of abandoning the baby girl under a tree on the day of her birth. The child was born on October 2020 and the FIR was lodged three months later. The reason for the belated complaint was that the family was concerned about its image in society. However, a DNA test proved the child was not born to the accuser, though it was established that Solanki was the child’s biological father. The cops summoned the woman and the accuser and they spilled the beans. Solanki had an affair with the woman’s elder daughter but to protect her, her mother had given the younger daughter’s name. To set things right, the cops summoned the elder daughter and registered a second FIR on February 26 against Solanki for raping her and against her mother for shielding Solanki. A day later on February 27, police registered one more FIR in this case, this time against the mother and her younger daughter for filing a false complaint. On the other hand, Solanki was prosecuted in a special Pocso court in Nadiad for the charges of rape and criminal intimidation involving the younger daughter. Police had by then booked the mother-daughter duo for the false complaint. All witnesses turned hostile and the DNA test led to Solanki’s acquittal. Meanwhile, charged again in the first week of May with rape and booked under the Pocso Act, Solanki was arrested and sent to jail once again. He has moved the Gujarat high court through advocate Vishal Anandjiwala for quashing of the rape charges and for bail. He has told the court that a settlement between him and the second complainant has been struck and the teenager has filed an affidavit to this effect in the high court. The court is likely to hear this case further on June 9.

---||Chandigarh||HC notifies 19 as senior advocates||Chandigarh: As many as 19 lawyers of the Punjab and Haryana high court have been notified as “senior advocate” by the high court administration. According to a notification issued on Friday, those who have been designated as senior advocates are advocate Sumeet Goel, who is standing counsel for the CBI in the high court; Jai Vir Yadav, former chairman of the state bar council of Punjab and Haryana; Rajvinder Singh Bains, rights activist and noted lawyer; Harpreet Singh Brar, former president of the High Court Bar Association and member state bar council; Pankaj Jain, senior standing counsel UT Chandigarh; Naresh Shekhawat, senior additional advocate general of Haryana; Amit Jhanji, son of former HC judge Justice V K Jhanji; Ashish Chopra, son of senior advocate Ashwani Chopra; and Gurinder Singh Attariwala. Some other names include advocate Baljit Kaur Mann, Gursharan Kaur, Baltej Singh, Tribhuvan Dahiya, Rakesh Nehra, Vinod Sharma Bhardwaj, Jagmohan Bansal, Gaurav Chopra and Pawan Kumar Mutneja. These lawyers have been designated as senior advocates in exercise of powers conferred under section 16 (2) of the Advocates Act 1961. As per the notification issued by the registrar general of the high court, these senior advocates have been designated subject to the condition that they would conduct 10 free legal aid cases pro bono every year. Importantly, it is after seven years that the advocates of the high court bar association have been designated as senior advocates. Some lawyers were designated as senior advocates in 2014. The designation of senior advocate is considered a coveted position as lawyers are conferred with this designation on the basis of their experience, expertise and knowledge of law and profession. The HC administration has prescribed a criteria for the redesignation of lawyers as senior advocate and this time around 113 lawyers were shortlisted for interaction with the high court judges. After the interaction, a tentative list of 27 lawyers was prepared by the HC administration, which was to be approved in the full court meeting of the high court judges held on May 26. However, during the full court meeting, several judges had reportedly red-flagged some names included in the tentative list. Thereafter, voting was done after which nine names from the first list of 27 were dropped and one more name of advocate Baljit Kaur Mann added. Finally, the much awaited list was notified on Friday and those designated as senior advocates were also individually informed by the high court administration. As of now, the HC administration has designated around 205 lawyers from the bar who have been designated as senior advocates since 1949.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notifies-19-as-senior-advocates/articleshow/83047791.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Stuck with faulty ventilators, BFUHS now looks to Army||Bathinda: Even though the demand for ventilators for Covid patients has gone down over the last few days, Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, a constituent college of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), is still waiting for the ventilators received under PM Cares Fund to be made functional. After service engineers from ventilator companies were unable to fully repair all the machines, university authorities claimed to have approached the Army’s Western Command, apart from employing a bio-medical engineer. The medical college received 113 ventilators under the PM Cares Fund. After repairs, 77 started working while 36 need more work. BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said, “After service engineers were not able to fully repair all ventilators, we appointed a bio-medical engineer and approached Major General Vijay Kumar Deshmukh from the Western Command to send experts for repairs. He has assured to get this done.” He added tidal volume is not working as per requirement and compressors as well as sensors are also not working the way they should have been. In all, the three medical colleges of Punjab received 320 ventilators. In early May, when these were very much in demand, only 83 were working. Many of them were not used over the apprehension that they might break down while in use. When the university raised the issue, a war of words broke out between the Centre and the state government. The Centre said flow sensors and bacteria filters of machines were not being changed on time and proper pressure was not being maintained in the oxygen gas pipeline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stuck-with-faulty-ventilators-bfuhs-now-looks-to-army/articleshow/83052864.cms||Neel Kamal

On Thursday as well, two children were discharged from the hospital after treatment. The doctors treating the two kids, Dr Satyender and Dr Priya, in the ICU also kept boosting the morale of the kids. “Today a Covid-positive girl aged 21 months was admitted in the ICU and we are happy to see her smiling even with fever,” said a nurse. The other child was a girl aged 14 years. Meanwhile, looking at children being infected with the virus, the hospital is preparing to deal with more cases and a separate 20-bed ICU has been prepared to treat patients less than 18 years. “We have started the process of bringing equipment for the ICU,” said Dr Anil Jain, superintendent of JLN Hospital. The separate children’s ICU ward will have centralised oxygen supply system. The children’s ward will have separate ventilators, infusion pumps, monitors, warmers and other equipment.

---||Jaipur||Yarn prices to remain stable: Riju Jhunjhunwala||Jaipur: During the lockdown last year, factories including the yarn mills had to shut down completely. When the restrictions were lifted, the demand rose suddenly both from Indian and overseas buyers, and the prices of yarn shot up. Also, the high cotton prices added to the uptick. Riju Jhunjhunwala, chairman and managing director of RSWM, one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of synthetic and blended spun yarns, said the situation is different now. He said that this time around the factories have been allowed to operate and they continue to meet the export demand. So there is less space for volatility and prices will remain stable, he said. “The exports are doing fine. The volumes are pretty much the levels we had witnessed previously. As the domestic demand has fallen substantially, we are diverting some of that capacity to the export markets as well. Our factories are running at 85% of the capacity. So, the supply side constraint won’t be there. Prices have already softened by 10-12% recently,” added Jhunjhunwala. He said since the mills are already in a production mode, ramping up will be quicker than last time. “All we need is demand to come back. We are optimistic that when the retail markets reopen, demand will bounce back sharply riding on the pent up demand,” said Jhunjhunwala. The fact that big companies in the US and other global markets are diversifying some of their sourcing from China, India is going to witness huge demand as well, he added. “The overseas buyers, especially in the textile sector, have made policies that they will not buy 100% of their requirements from China. They will divert some of their sourcing, in the range of 20-30%, to other countries, including India. Some of that capacity will create huge demand in the country,” added Jhunjhunwala. Giving insights into the emerging trends, he said that casualwear has found new interest, while formalwear as a sector has taken a big hit globally. “We are also trying to change our product mix to cater to the new demand from the casualwear side. Another sector is witnessing a big uptrend is home textiles,” added Jhunjhunwala. He said they are expanding denim capacity from 20 lakh meters a month to 27 lakh meters to meet the additional demand for casualwear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/yarn-prices-to-remain-stable-riju-jhunjhunwala/articleshow/83047789.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to organise special camps to vaccinate people with disabilities||JAIPUR: The state’s health department has issued an order to organise special vaccination camps for persons with disabilities (PwDs) who are above 18 years at centres run by NGOs or private organisations after registering 100 or more such people. The decision follows a notice sent by the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) which took cognizance of the matter. The order also stated that if an NGO or a private organisation manages to register only less than 100 PwDs, they will be given special priority to get inoculated at the nearest Covid vaccination centre. The order has been issued to all chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) and district reproductive & child health officers. “Special Covid vaccination centres (for those above 18 years of age) could be set up at those NGOs/private organisations on registration of 100 or more PWDs. If less than 100 specially-abled persons are registered with an NGO/ private organization, special priority will be given to them at the nearest Covid vaccination centre for vaccination,” the order said. The SHRC had issued a notice to the principal secretary, medical and health department, on the matter. Chairman of the commission Justice Gopal Krishna Vyas had demanded special arrangements for vaccination of PwDs and asked the government to send a report within a week. There are about 21 lakh specially-abled persons in Rajasthan. “Based on my petition, the human rights commission had issued a notice to the principal secretary, medical and health, and given directions to resolve the problem faced by specially-abled persons regarding vaccination. The commission has also asked the department to submit a report within a week after resolving the issue. The next hearing is on May 20,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh. “I had written that it was a risky task to take specially-abled persons to vaccination centres. There are 21 categories of specially-abled persons in the state, including intellectual disability, severe disability, blind and others with mental disease. Also, they are dependent on others for any kind of work. Hence, there is a risk of infection spreading among them,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-organise-special-camps-to-vax-people-with-disabilities/articleshow/83047817.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rs 100cr Gandhi museum, institute for socialsciences planned at Lakshmi Vilas Palace||Jaipur: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is planning to set up a Mahatma Gandhi museum and an institute of governance and social sciences at Lakshmi Vilas Palace in the premises of the Central Park at a cost of Rs 100 crore. Called the Gandhi Darshan Museum and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences, the project was announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the 2021-2022 state Budget. The civic body will soon appoint an architectural and engineering consultant, based on quality and cost-based selection system (QCBS). On May 23, at its executive committee meeting, JDA had tabled the proposal to seek approval for consultancy work. “In compliance with the Budget announcement, we need to engage an engineering and architectural consultancy service. Based on planning and design, the tender for executing the work will be floated. The consultancy cost will be approximately 2-3% of the project, which will be decided at a higher level,” an official source said. According to officials, Lakshmi Vilas Palace and the adjoining marriage garden together occupy an area of about 18,000sqm. The previous BJP government had decided to auction Lakshmi Vilas Palace, which had been turned into a hotel, to the hospitality industry after it was acquired by the JDA, sources said. This was based on a recommendation by a three-member committee constituted to define the usage of prime land at the Central Park. However, the project did not see the light of the day after the government changed. The new Congress government decided on a multi-crore project dedicated to Gandhi in the heart of the city. The JDA had taken possession of Lakshmi Vilas Hotel, Kanak Bhawan and a horse stable at Central Park, spread across nearly 35,000sqm, following a Supreme Court order on May 5. “The decision to develop a museum was taken as the land has been earmarked as commercial/recreation in Master Plan 2025. The plan for Kanak Bhawan, spread across 3,890sqm, has not been made as it falls in the ecological zone," sources said. Surrounded by greenery and jogging tracks, a golf course, a polo ground, Lakshmi Vilas has been a popular tourist destination ever since it was converted into a heritage hotel in the early 1970s. Under the Rajasthan State Land Acquisition Act, the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) had acquired 322 bighas of land in the Rambagh Complex for public utility in 1973. As per UIT claims, these two prime buildings were part of the ‘acquired’ land. In May 2010, an attempt was made by the JDA to take possession of these buildings after the Rajasthan High Court gave a favourable order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) that sought the court’s intervention on JDA’s failure to take physical possession of the acquired properties. The JDA initiated an eviction drive after sealing the building. However, a stay was granted by the SC. It was then argued at the apex court that Lakshmi Vilas was originally an estate motor garage and constructed during the period of Sawai Man Singh II. It was later converted into a hotel by erstwhile ruler Bhawani Singh. In 1986, Bhawani Singh had sold both Lakshmi Vilas and Kanak Bhawan. The three families who owned the properties were using parts of it for residential and commercial purposes. However, the JDA challenged the sale of both the properties and received a favourable order from the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-100cr-gandhi-museum-institute-for-socialsciences-planned-at-lakshmi-vilas-palace/articleshow/83047848.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bharatpur BJP MP Ranjeeta Koli’s car attacked||JAIPUR: Bharatpur MP Ranjeeta Koli’s car was allegedly attacked by unidentified miscreants when she was returning from Weir tehsil in Bharatpur late on Thursday. The miscreants pelted stones on her car, following which she fainted and was rushed to a local hospital. Koli was heading back to Bayana in Bharatpur after inspecting a PHC in Weir. The attack has sparked an angry reaction from BJP leaders, including former CM Vasundhara Raje, who called the law and order situation ‘jungle raj’. Union minister Arjun Lal Meghwal held a press conference to highlight the incident. The incident happened at 11: 55pm on Halena Wier-Hatra Road after five miscreants standing on the road attempted to stop the car. “The driver sensed trouble and drove fast to bypass them immediately. The accused were holding iron batons and stones. They then pelted stones at the car. One stone crashed into the car from behind though no one was hurt. The driver drove the car towards Gharsoni village,” said the police. Three persons were present in the car—Koli, gunman Lokesh and driver Santosh. The gunman informed the local police which immediately rushed to provide security cover. Koli was taken to the RMB hospital in Bharatpur and after first-aid, she was discharged. Devendra Bishnoi, SP Bharatpur, said that they are working on important leads and will soon arrest the accused. “Nothing can be said at this moment,” said Bishnoi. Bishnoi told TOI that he has ordered an inquiry into the lapse in MPs security. “The case is being investigated by a senior police officer. I have visited the spot with the driver to re-enact the scene but the driver has failed to identify the exact spot. We have told him to think about the spot which will help us in drawing a route,” said Bishnoi. Raje in a tweet said, “The state government should arrest the culprits and give them harshest of punishments to restore faith among the people. I would like to remind Congress that we have handed over a peaceful Rajasthan, you are making it a state of the criminals. We will not let this happen.” Satish Poonia, BJP state chief demanded CM’s resignation. Meghwal accused the Gehlot government of being a mute spectator on series of attacks on women in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bharatpur-bjp-mp-kolis-car-attacked/articleshow/83047802.cms||---

Dr N P Singh, the deputy superintendent of sadar hospital, said the Covid-19 ward for children will have provision for indoor games, television and comics. At the same time, a separate OPD is also being arranged for children with Covid symptoms. Meanwhile, the Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) was making arrangements in anticipation for a possible third wave. A 50-bed jumbo Covid facility is being set up at the HRD Centre of BSL. It will start operations from next week. Vedanta ESL Steel Limited is also in the process of setting up a 100-bed temporary hospital at the Library Ground in Sector-V.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-sadar-hosp-gets-dedicated-cov-ward-for-children/articleshow/83046207.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

First, the cyclone was not associated with hail or high-speed wind which prevented major damage to vegetable crops. Last but not the least, Yaas was associated with a good amount of rainfall with almost even distribution throughout the state, which help the fields to retain the right amount of moisture. The ample amount of rain would also help the farmers prepare their fields for the Kharif crops well ahead of the monsoon’s arrival. Agromet advisor and weather scientist at the Birsa Agriculture University (BAU), Dr Abdul Wadood, said in the past few years, farmers in Jharkhand are unable to carry out timely sowing of Kharif crops for various reasons but this time, the atmosphere is conducive for the fields to be prepared for sowing by June 15, when the monsoon is also expected to reach the state. “Be it delayed arrival of monsoon, late distribution of seeds or intermitting dry spell, sowing of Kharif crops were delayed in the previous years. It was in 2011 when sowing could be completed on time and it usually results in good yield,” he said. Moreover, the timing of the cyclone’s entry into the state was such that most major foodgrain crops were harvested. It was just in a few locations, where late Rabi crops were cultivated, some damage was seen. Wheat and mustard were already in the farmers’ barn. “Since the cyclone was predicted long back, farmers had enough time to harvest their crop and cover their stock properly which considerably reduced the wastage,” Wadood said. Though district authorities across the state are assessing the crop losses, rough estimates put the loss in the range of 10%-20%. Experts believe that during the current season, farmers mostly grow vegetables and they had harvested them well on time and they have either sold their produce or stored them. The fields are mostly free and ploughing can start as the soil is already damp. “Though the monsoon is expected to arrive on time this year, the farmers need not wait for it and start sowing,” Wadood said adding that crop coverage should ideally be complete by July end or early August for better yield. In contrast, crop coverage was around only 25%-30% during the period in previous years. Additionally, the southern districts of Jharkhand which form a plateau, have the advantage of harvesting rainwater and farmers who have dug farm ponds (dobha) in previous years have good water storage. “They need not worry much if there is a dry spell,” Wadood said. Notably, BAU had issued an advisory to the farmers to ensure proper drainage in the fields ahead of the cyclone and store water in low-lying areas. the low lying areas. “Though water harvesting is not so common in the state yet, farmers who have the option to store water must conserve it for one or two rounds of irrigation during the monsoon season in case of a dry spell,” Wadood added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cyclone-leaves-behind-trail-of-destruction-but-farmers-rejoice/articleshow/83045472.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

This comes in the aftermath of cyclone Yaas-induced rains which left several areas waterlogged, thereby creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes. A letter in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh, directing all the civil surgeons to formulate a strategy to control the possible spread and implement that at the earliest. As per Singh’s letter, the civil surgeons have been asked to submit a detailed plan on containing the possible outbreak to the health department by June 10 and to start implementing the preventive measures by June 15. “We are already battling the pandemic and now if we do not take immediate steps for eliminating the risk of a possible outbreak of chikungunya and dengue, the situation will become even worse,” the letter read. The order also directed the authorities concerned to start preparing for conducting an entomological survey, making necessary arrangements for sentinel surveillance at the hospitals, routine blood examination of suspected patients and conducting proper IEC in the endemic areas. Upon contact, state entomologist Sagya Singh said, “We will start our statewide survey from June 15 to identify and analyse the larval density in suspected areas which will help us in eliminating the risk of a possible outbreak. We have roped in 127 volunteers across the state, who will work in co-ordination with our teams, so that we can assist the urban local bodies in source elimination.” Meanwhile, MD NHM in a directive issued a fortnight ago had directed all urban local bodies of state to start eliminating breeding grounds by taking appropriate measures such as spraying of chemicals for destroying the grounds. Upon contact, RMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar said: “We are working on formulating a SOP for conducting regular spraying and eliminating breeding spots. The SOP is being prepared based on our experiences of endemic areas in RMC limits. We had conducted a week long special cleanliness drive to ensure there are no breeding spots left and we will start that soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/civil-surgeons-asked-to-prepare-strategy-to-avert-possible-dengue-outbreak/articleshow/83046292.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The inquiry came in the wake of charges from residents and political parties that the bridge was constructed using substandard materials after syphoning off funds. In a tweet, Soren said, “I have ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident. I will not tolerate corruption and loot of public money during my tenure.” Portions of the Haradih-Budhadih bridge caved in after a pillar collapsed breaking it in the middle following the incessant rains on Thursday. Thousands of rural residents are affected by the collapse as now they have to take a detour and travel for around 30 to 40 kilometres to reach the nearby block headquarters, including Bundu, Tamar and Sonahatu. Soon after the collapse, several political parties demanded an inquiry. State Congress working president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh wrote a letter to rural development minister Alamgir Alam demanding a high-level inquiry into the incident. He said the guilty contractors must be blacklisted and pointed out that the bridge is the main connector to Mahamayi Mandir, an ancient worshipping place. It also linked a large section of the population to West Bengal through Saraikela Kharsawan, Kamlesh added. The CPI(M) also sent a mail to the chief minister demanding a similar inquiry into the bridge collapse. It stated that the bridge was completed merely three years ago and had no approach road. Alleging that inferior materials were used in the construction work, CPI(M) leader Sufal Mahto demanded action against the contractors and the officials concerned. He pointed out that the bridge was constructed at a cost of several crores of rupees of public money. Mahto stressed that hundreds of villages have been cut off from their nearest urban localities and said it is difficult for them to cross the Kanchi river by boat during the monsoon. Some residents pointed out that illegal sand mining is rampant near the bridge and could have affected the structural stability of the bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-orders-probe-into-bridge-collapse-during-yaas/articleshow/83046316.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The flood control cell of the dam also informed the administrations of Bokaro, Dhanbad and West Bengal alerting a rise in the water levels of the Damodar river due to the opening of the gates. Moreover, the district administration also appealed to residents not to venture out near the river for any activity. Tenughat dam has 18 gates, of which 10 are radial and eight are sluice gates. On Wednesday, a sluice gate was opened to maintain the water level at the reservoir. The dam authorities said they released 4,800 cusecs of water. Bokaro deputy commissioner Rajesh Singh said the gates were opened after continuous rain caused by Cyclone Yaas raised the reservoir’s water levels close to its maximum water storage capacity of 852 feet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tenughat-dam-releases-excess-water/articleshow/83045516.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Residents can requisition the mobile units for their respective localities by calling the district control room number: 7546028221, the district administration said in a statement. “Besides Ranchi and its urban areas, all other district administrations have been directed to launch similar mobile vaccination units to facilitate the population which face problems in coming to vaccination sites for their jabs,” Gupta said after the launch at CCL Jawahar Nagar Club premises. The district administration said citizens will have to collect at least 20 beneficiaries in one particular locality before requisitioning a mobile unit. “The mobile units will vaccinate beneficiaries above 45 years and also those who are aged between 18-44. However, priority will be given to beneficiaries above 45 years who cannot make it to the session sites due to old age and physical restrictions,” the administration said.  The Centre has recently cleared the decks for inoculating beneficiaries below 44 years through mobile vans, but the beneficiaries will be left out until the state has enough stocks of doses. The mobile units were launched at a time when as many as 18 out of 24 districts of the state have nearly exhausted their stocks for inoculating beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years. While the health department said it had over 7 lakh doses for beneficiaries above 45 years, there were 1.64 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group as on Thursday. “After Friday’s inoculation, we will be left with around 80,000 doses, which might run out in a day or two. As many as 18 districts are nearly on the verge of halting the programme until fresh consignment arrives in June,” state vaccine nodal officer A Dodde said. The department, however, did not make public the names of the districts where stocks are running out fast. Although Jharkhand is procuring vaccines directly from Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India, the orders are being controlled by the Centre. “We will not have more than 5 lakh doses in June either,” Dodde said. He added that a global tender is being floated for procuring vaccines from other global manufacturers directly. The state needs around 3.5 crore doses to inoculate 1.57 crore beneficiaries between 18-44 years.  The Centre on Thursday asked Jharkhand to ramp up the pace of vaccination of beneficiaries above 45 years. Out of 88 lakh beneficiaries, the state has been able to inoculate 29% of the targeted beneficiaries, which is lower than the national average of 34%. “We are setting a target of inoculating 1 lakh beneficiaries each day from next month,” Dodde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/banna-launches-mobile-vax-vans-in-ranchi/articleshow/83045726.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Yaas-induced rains eliminate water woes in Dalma sanctuary||Jamshedpur: The heavy rains caused by cyclone Yaas came as a relief for the Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) for all its water bodies – man-made as well as the natural ones -- are no longer parched, thanks to the Kolhan division receiving over 100mm rain in the past 72 hours. “The cyclone-induced rainfall filled up all the water bodies in the sanctuary and thankfully, now there’ll be no water shortage for the animals for at least a year,” Dalma divisional forest officer Abhishek Kumar told TOI. There are around 68 man-made and 36 natural water bodies in Dalma, all of which are regularly used by the sanctuary’s animals, including its 86 elephants. The forest officials were planning to fill up those water bodies with tankers, which are due to arrive next month, ahead of the monsoon season. While the natural ponds are 36ft wide and 10ft deep, the man-made ones are 30ft wide and 7ft deep. "The animals usually prefer a water body filled up to the surface as it helps them wade into it easily, however, that results in overcrowding around the pond. If there are enough number of ponds with water in them, then overcrowding can be avoided,” Kumar said. Besides, the filled up water bodies reduces the possibility of the elephants venturing into the villages located in the sanctuary’s foothills in search of water, a common occurrence during summers when all the ponds dry up in the heat, thus leading to frequent man-animal conflicts. In the past two years, 20 instances of man- elephant conflict have been reported from the adjoining districts of East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan. Between April last year and last month, four elephants were killed and six villagers died in Kolhan division as a result of such conflicts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/yaas-induced-rains-eliminate-water-woes-in-dalma-sanctuary/articleshow/83045668.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, no loss of lives were reported. The stalls, which are sandwiched between the temple complex and the banks of Bhairavi, sell puja items for devotees but since the temple complex is closed for visitors since April 22, the shops were closed as well. A senior priest at the temple named Ajay Panda said that this isn’t first time shops were destroyed in the rains. “More than a decade ago, the water of Bhairavi and Damodar rivers was on the swell due to heavy rainfall, resulting in the shops being washed away,” he added. Vinod Kumar, a local vendor, said that although seasonal rains almost always destroy the shops, this time the damage extensive. Uday Kumar, the block development officer of Chitarpur, said the vendors were asked not to set up their establishments near the banks of Bhairavi on many occasions in the past but they did not pay heed. While many vendors have moved to the shopping complex constructed nearby, others are still selling puja items by the river bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nearly-500-shops-near-rajrappa-washed-away/articleshow/83046237.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The is seems to be the mood especially in cities such as Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Vizianagaram where the sector has suffered a major blow. There has been a dip in property sales. Builders are not taking up new projects citing shortage of skilled manpower, restrictions on working hours, curfew and lockdown atmosphere in the city’s outskirts by administration to contain the virus spread. Till March-end, homebuyers were visiting projects to choose flats. However, from April onwards, prospective homebuyers turned cautions and started avoiding property visits even if they were interested in buying, said B Sunil, a developer in Visakhapatnam. The second wave of the pandemic has also made people wary of spending money on expenses such as buying a home. Consumers are taking a wait-and-watch approach and looking to save money to protect them in the eventuality of an emergency, he added. B Raja Srinivas, president of Credai, Andhra Pradesh, said that several real estate projects have got stalled in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Guntur, Vizianagaram and few other cities and towns as developers are delaying project site visits saying they do not want to get infected. Secondly, due to curfew from 12 noon to 6 am, working hours have decreased and availability of labour also has decreased. Nearly over 2,000 projects have been stalled in the state, he added. “We are expecting that the consumers will prefer ready to occupy projects after the end of the second wave and the real estate sector may get some boost after a few months. In big cities like Vizag where a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases has brought economic activity to a standstill, real estate developers are struggling as well,” said Srinivas. The demand for 3BHK units may witness a rise after the second wave in a few cities as the working from home culture is likely to continue for some more years. Developers are not in a hurry to finish projects as they say that they can’t risk lives .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/aps-real-estate-sector-in-doldrums-as-sales-plunge/articleshow/83044229.cms||Nalla.Babu

As per the new circular, bank branches will be open on May 29, as it is the fifth Saturday of the month. When contacted, Nabin Chandra Dash, convener of SLBC West Bengal, told TOI that there is no specific mention of bank closure on all Saturdays in the order of restrictions issued by the state government from May 16. But it specifically mentioned restricted banking hours from 10am to 2pm so as per usual rule banks will be closed on 2nd and 4th Saturday and will remain operational on 1st, 3rd and 5th Saturdays. The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherjee, said that transportation for bank employees is becoming a big problem and Indian Railways is also not allowed in most cases. SLBC and bank unions had earlier written to Indian Railways for allowing bank employees to board the special trains used to ferry emergency and frontline Covid staff like health workers during the lockdown period. The bank unions have also approached the state government for issuing special passes to bank employees so that they can commute without any hassle. The Mamata Banerjee government has started vaccinating all the bank employees and officers, who are yet to be inoculated. There are over 50,000 off bank employees in the state that include a few thousand casual staff. As per Indian Banks Association (IBA) direction, branches will now perform minimum activities like cash deposit and withdrawals, clearing of cheques, government transactions, remittances etc. The branch is now operating with 50% workforce. SLBC had earlier also clarified that it has stipulated some activities which branches have to carry out. Additionally, if any branch can offer any other services it is free to do that depending on staff strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-to-remain-closed-only-on-2nd-4th-saturdays/articleshow/83048100.cms||---

After a TTD experts committee led by National Sanskrit University vice-chancellor Prof V Muralidhara Sharma negated the Hampi seer’s claims, stating that he could not prove that Hampi, in the state of Karnataka, was the actual birthplace of Hanuman beyond reasonable doubt, Govindananda held a press meet on Friday where he accused the TTD of trying to distort history. “It is unfortunate that the TTD did not consult Hindu religious pontiffs on such an important issue and has on its own concluded Anjanadri hills as the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. While the great Indian epic Ramayana and several other references clearly establish the fact that Hampi was Lord Hanuman’s birthplace, TTD is trying to link up and distort Treta Yug historical facts with Kalyug,” the Hampi seer alleged. He further said that TTD has no solid evidence to back its claims. “Let experts like the Kanchi mutt Sankaracharya, Tirumala Jeeyar Swami, Ahobilam Jeeyar Swamy and others come on record and say that Anjanadri hills is indeed the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. Then only one and all will agree,” he added. The tussle over the issue started after the TTD declared Anjanadri hills as the birthplace of Lord Hanuman on April 21 this year. The temple body also issued an open appeal to individuals or institutions to step forward for a debate if they had any objections or evidences to counter its claims. The Hampi-based trust was the only organisation which challenged the TTD’s claims. The trust, represented by Govindananda, held an open debate on the issue with the committee of experts appointed by the TTD on Thursday, but the debate between the two claimants ended on an inconclusive note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-distorting-history-with-hanuman-birthplace-claims-alleges-hampi-seer/articleshow/83044353.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Felix Hospital in Sector 137 will also set up a 24-hour walk-in camp — a first in the city — and a pre-registered vaccine centre near the compound. At all three centres, Covishield will be administered to recipients aged over 18 years. Other than the three sites, the hospital has also partnered with RWAs to set up paid vaccine camps at various residential sectors and with corporate houses to inoculate their employees in offices. Officials at Felix said they aimed at vaccinating 10,000 people daily. A recipient taking a jab at a camp in a housing society will have to pay Rs 1,050 for each shot. Those being vaccinated at the 24x7 drive-through site and the other camps will have to pay Rs 900. This will be India’s first 24-hour functional drive-through vaccination centre, according to officials. “We will set up vaccine camps at various societies, residential sectors and corporate companies in Noida. The hospital will also provide a free full body checkup at these places. The aim is to inoculate more than 10,000 people every day for maximum coverage in the district. We want every Noida resident to be vaccinated at the earliest,” said Dr DK Gupta, chairperson of Felix Hospital. He added that the hospital would soon be getting Covaxin doses and had also applied for Sputnik V. A pilot for the drive-through was conducted on Friday with 1,000 slots, all of which were booked within an hour on the Co-WIN portal. The paid vaccination camps will come as a huge relief to many residents who have been finding it difficult to get slots on the portal. Government session sites, where jabs are free, are also battling shortage of vaccines. “In keeping with the extrapolated population of Noida, we need to vaccinate about 15 lakh people aged over 18 years. Of these, we have already vaccinated about 5 lakh people, which is one-third of the target. We now hope to inoculate the entire population as soon as possible,” district magistrate Suhas LY said. On Saturday, the 24-hour drive-through vaccination centre will be inaugurated by Suhas, chief medical officer Deepak Ohri and district immunisation officer Neeraj Tyagi. “The decision to administer vaccines round-the-clock was taken keeping in mind the people who work during the day and get time only at night. They face a lot of difficulty getting inoculated during the day,” said Gupta, the Felix chairperson. In terms of number of vaccinations, Noida has fared better than other districts of UP. According to officials in the health department, 10,000-12,000 vaccine shots are being given daily in Noida for the past one week. About 5.5 lakh people have been vaccinated so far. In the past one week, government vaccine sites have increased from 57 to 83 and the daily inoculations have also gone up from around 8,000 to 14,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/at-noida-hospital-24x7-drive-in-vax-shots-from-today/articleshow/83048352.cms||Snehil Sinha

Bozkir’s remark came during his visit to Pakistan. In a joint news conference with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Bozkir also called upon the two countries to refrain from taking steps that could affect the status of J&K even though he didn’t directly mention India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K in 2019. “We express our strong opposition to the unwarranted references made with respect to ...J&K by the president of the United Nations General Assembly Volkan Bozkir during his recent visit to Pakistan,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a statement, adding that the UN official’s remark was unacceptable. “Nor indeed is there any basis for comparison to other global situations. When an incumbent president of the UNGA makes misleading and prejudiced remarks, he does great disservice to the office he occupies,” he said. Bozkir also said in Pakistan that the UN’s position on J&K was governed by the UN charter, and applicable Security Council resolutions. “India and Pakistan’s Simla Agreement of 1972 which says that the final status of J&K is to be settled by peaceful means in accordance with the UN charter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-slams-unga-chief-for-jk-remark-during-pakistan-visit/articleshow/83053624.cms||---

Rising sea water level and mighty waves during Cyclone Tauktae caused more erosion to the already battered 200-m rubble wall. The issue was highlighted by TOI in Thursday’s edition. Villagers with houses along the riverside had raised fears of possible collapse of the rest of the barricade if temporary measures were not initiated. “We will first have to assess the damage and then prepare a tender,” said assistant engineer WRD Rajesh Tarkar. “The rubble wall had been erected many years ago after at least a 100-mt stretch of the beach was eroded and went under water.” WRD had plans to nourish the beach with sand and geo tubes under a project by the World Bank, but some locals and fishermen opposed it. Tidal action from the sea and force of water from Nerul and Mandovi rivers have affected the once sandy beach, locals said. “We have suggested to WRD officials to dump a few trucks of rubble as a temporary measure,” said Dorothy Ferrao, a local. WRD sources said that a bigger project to protect the shoreline would involve more funds and take time to be drawn up, Bonny Pereira, a villager said. “But they have assured us of putting the rubbles as a temporary measure,” Pereira said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wrd-assesses-damage-to-wall-along-coco-beach/articleshow/83019354.cms||---

According to police, thieves entered the house of Aftab Sheikh, a resident of Navagam (Ghed) in Jamnagar. Sheikh, who owns the Royal Rajput Security Agency, lived upstairs in his two-storey house, while his mother stayed on the ground floor. However, she passed away a few days ago, and the house remained closed for sometime. Two of his brothers also live in the same area. The entire family’s jewellery estimated to be around 100 tolas was being kept with the their mother, said cops. “The family was busy in post-death rituals of their mother and thieves took advantage of it. They broke only the cupboard and took away the jewellery worth around Rs 46 lakh,” police sources. Cops suspect an insider’s role in this burglary and have launched a probe after filing an FIR in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gold-worth-rs-46l-stolen-in-jamnagar/articleshow/83048281.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Withdrawal of liquor ban lifts spirits in Chandrapur||CHANDRAPUR: The announcement by the state government to revoke the liquor ban in Chandrapur district has lifted the spirits of people. While people in general looked enthused with the decision, erstwhile bar and wine shop owners are eagerly waiting for issuance of the government resolution by the state excise ministry. Commoners celebrated the revocation of the ban. While there were a few posts criticizing the government, memes celebrating the withdrawal of the ban dotted Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media platforms.There were 561 different types of excise licences in Chandrapur, including 110 country liquor retail (CL3), 24 wine shops (FL2), 318 beer bars (FL3) and 25 beer shoppes (FLBR2). With imposition of prohibition in Chandrapur back in 2015, the then BJP-led government had asked all liquor sellers to surrender their licence with the state excise office. However, after the liquor ban, 18 FL2 and 8 CL3 had transferred their licence out of Chandrapur to other places, while the rest remain suspended with the state excise office here. “We are waiting for the government resolution. It will have the formal date of reopening of the sale of liquor as well as the procedure that would be adopted to restore the suspended licences of beer bars, wine shops and other types of liquor outlets in Chandrapur,” said excise superintendent Sagar Domkar. Owners of beer bars, country liquor and wine shops too were seen excited with the government decision. “There will be lots of document work once the GR is issued. Those whose licence has been suspended will have to submit the requisite documents, no-dues and no-objection certificates to the excise department. After proper scrutiny of documents, the district collector would consider our suspended licence for revival,” said president of Chandrapur Liquor Association Parvindarsingh Bhatiya. The state government has stopped issuing new licences to wine shops and country liquor retailers since decades. However, there is no restriction on issuance of licence for beer bars. It is likely that all the earlier beer bars in district would resume their businesses. However, it is not clear whether those who transferred their FL2 and CL3 licences would return to Chandrapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/withdrawal-of-liquor-ban-lifts-spirits-in-chandrapur/articleshow/83048567.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||India||35 years on, Supreme Court plugs gap that aided dowry death accused||NEW DELHI: Nearly 35 years after Parliament enacted Section 304B of Indian Penal Code to punish those accused of dowry deaths, the Supreme Court on Friday plugged a much-exploited legal loophole aiding acquittals while expressing anguish that the law had so far failed to serve as a deterrent, leading to an unacceptable rate of dowry deaths in India. Section 304B, inserted in the IPC in November 1986, provides, “Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called ‘dowry death’, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.” The law punishes convicts with minimum seven years imprisonment, extendable to life term. However, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose found that most accused exploited the “shown that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment” part in the provision to escape punishment. Writing the judgment, CJI Ramana noted the disturbing trend of dowry deaths accounting for 40-50% of homicidal death of women in India and said it was because of the “pestiferous nature of dowry harassment, wherein married women are being subjected to cruelty because of covetous demands by husband and his relatives”. “The latest data furnished by the National Crime Records Bureau indicates that in 2019 itself, 7,115 cases were registered under Section 304B IPC. Considering the significance of such a legislation (Section 304B), a strict interpretation would defeat the very object for which it was enacted,” he said. The bench said, “The phrase ‘soon before’ as appearing in Section 304B cannot be construed to mean ‘immediately before’. The prosecution must establish the existence of ‘proximate and live link’ between the dowry death and cruelty or harassment for dowry demand by the husband or his relatives”. It advised trial courts not to take a pigeon-hole approach to Section 304B in categorising death as homicidal or suicidal or accidental. While tightening the procedure to be adopted by trial courts in deciding dowry death cases, including confronting the accused with evidence, the bench took care to ensure that its endeavour to close the chink in Section 304B did not result in unnecessary harassment to the husband’s relatives, who ordinarily did not reside with the couple in question.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/35-years-on-supreme-court-plugs-gap-that-aided-dowry-death-accused/articleshow/83053652.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Nagpur||Revoke decision to lift liquor ban: Activists urge guv||Yavatmal: Activists of Yavatmal District Swamini Darubandi Andolan Samiti have on Friday approached Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari with a plea to direct the state government to revoke its decision to lift liquor ban from Chandrapur district. Samiti convenor Mahesh Pawar criticised the state for lifting the ban, which was imposed by the BJP-Sena alliance government in April 2015. “The prohibition in Chandrapur was effected following intense struggle by the samiti activists, particularly women, who had marched on foot over 135km to stage dharna at Nagpur during the winter session of the state legislature,” said Pawar.“Liquor lobby succeeded in winning over Chandrapur guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who convinced the state cabinet to pass a resolution to lift the ban,” he said. He also pointed out the adverse impact of liquor addiction leading to increase in suicides, leaving many young girls as widows, apart from rising family disputes and health issues etc. “We are agitating for liquor ban in Yavatmal district, which now, it seems, is a remote possibility,” he said and cautioned of launching a vigorous agitation against the government. The government has failed to enforce the ban effectively for which lifting the ban is not the only solution, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/revoke-decision-to-lift-liquor-ban-activists-urge-guv/articleshow/83048639.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Fly ash mismanagement posing serious threat to people near power plants||Nagpur: While many Indian cities celebrated improvement in air quality during the lockdown, those having coal-fired power plants nearby continued to suffer. Between April 2020 and March 2021, 17 major incidents related to fly ash pollution occurred in seven states, putting public health at risk.This was revealed in a report ‘Coal Ash in India – Vol II: An environmental, social and legal compendium of coal ash mismanagement in India, 2020-21’ released by the Healthy Energy Initiative India and Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE).Of the 17 major incidents, one took place in Nagpur, when fly ash from Khaparkheda power plant was discharged in Kanhan river, one of the sources of water supply to the city, in December 2020. TOI had then reported how fly-ash is carcinogenic and can cause many health ailments. “Areas like Vidarbha are already water-starved. If drinking water sources get contaminated due to fly ash, it would have a major impact on public health and agriculture,” said Shweta Narayan.Apart from this, other incidents were reported from Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra. “Ash pond collapse, air pollution from ash ponds and discharge of coal fly ash into rivers, streams and other water bodies were the most prevalent incidents, indicating the dismal state of coal fly ash management in the country. Most of these locations are regions where coal fly ash disposal is a perennial problem and leaks, and accidents are routine,” the report stated.While big cities like Delhi celebrated clean air and blue skies during the Covid lockdown, experts found that many regions reported multiple incidents and accidents related to fly ash mismanagement. In West Bengal, two Bangladeshi barges ferrying fly ash sank in Hooghly at South 24-Parganas in April 2020.At Singrauli In Madhya Pradesh, the ash dump yard of Reliance Power’s Ultra Mega Power Project in Sasan area collapsed in April 2020. In Tamil Nadu, toxic fly ash slurry from busted pipeline of North Chennai thermal plant flooded the village in April 2020. In October 2020, fly ash from power station leaked into Ennore creek. “We also found that residents from coal hotspots reported that many power companies used the Covid-19 lockdown to dump waste indiscriminately in water bodies, villages and around the highways, causing irreparable harm to the environment and public health,” said Pooja Kumar of Healthy Energy Initiative India.Stating that Korba has witnessed unprecedented coal fly ash pollution in the last one year, local activist Laxmi Chauhan said, “We have been living here for decades but have never seen a sight like this before. The power companies have used Covid-19 restrictions to dump coal fly ash wherever they could. Piles of fly ash can be found along the entire highway and ring roads and in villages everywhere. With summer winds, we are seeing the entire city covered in fly ash and we are breathing fly ash. Despite several complaints, no action has been taken on the errant companies.” Advocate Ritwick Dutta of LIFE said, “Coal ash is the most ignored threat to the health of the community and the environment. India’s regulatory mechanism has failed to deal with the problem, which continues to increase every passing year; while courts are yet to hold a company criminally liable for the toxic pollution caused by callous approach of power companies.”This report also focuses on an in-depth legal and policy analysis and gaps in implementation of emerging trend of courts imposing environmental compensation for violations on the issue of coal fly ash. “The legal position is clear with respect to the liability of project proponents responsible for breach of fly ash – they are absolutely liable for both the damages and cost of restoration. Despite this clear judicial precedents, the courts and tribunal have rarely fixed the liability on the violators, which reflects in both, the damage caused and the cost of restoration,” it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fly-ash-mismanagement-posing-serious-threat-to-people-near-power-plants/articleshow/83048752.cms||Manka Behl

The complainant Dinesh Suryavanshi, former member of the varsity’s management council, alleged that the VC Murlidhar Chandekar and pro VC RS Jaipurkar had awarded a contract illegally to a local company of their favour. Suryavanshi claimed the VC and the pro VC misused their powers to favour city’s Dot Com Infotech Pvt Ltd for the installation of web-based integrated university management system (WIUMS) at a cost of Rs72 lakh. Suryavanshi also demanded registration of criminal offences against Chandekar for allegedly cheating the search committee in getting shortlisted for the appointment as VC and then getting selected on the strength of false information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/complaint-against-amt-vc-pro-vc/articleshow/83048790.cms||---

On Friday, 22 new patients of the fungal infection were admitted in the district while 18 were discharged.Awareness campaigns and capacity building of existing medical professionals and healthcare staff have already started to improve the rural healthcare infrastructure. District collector Ravindra Thakare has deputed 26 officials on special duty in 13 talukas to raise awareness regarding Covid and mucormycosis.According to Thakare, farmers are likely to be the most vulnerable section of population during the projected third wave. “We would conduct urine sugar test with Uristix on around 92,000 Ccovid recovered patients. Glucometer would not be used for testing as there are apprehensions regarding pricking of fingers,” he said. Explaining why farmers could be the most vulnerable to mucormycosis, Thakare said they work with the soil and manure which are the two of the most common places where the fungal growth is observed.“Once the sugar is detected in a Covid recovered patient, s/he will be monitored for any early signs of mucormycosis. Prompt treatment will be given to prevent the fungal infection from increasing,” said Thakre adding that officials are reaching out to the grass roots health workers and the masses to spread awareness.The collecter also said vaccination drive would be intensified among the rural population, especially the tribals, under special initiatives. “We had approached the local representatives and civic body officials to motivate the population but that did not work as expected. Now we are approaching the local doctors and hakims who are often approached by the rural population. The local doctors and hakims would be roped in to motivate the rural population, including the farmers, for taking the jab,’ he said.Thakare also stated that several educated tribal youngsters would be approached to motivate their community for vaccination.Meanwhile, the task force on mucormycosis was held a meeting on Friday regarding the distribution and allocations of Amphotericin B in the district.The task force chairman Dr Prashant Nikhade, and well-known ear, nose and throat surgeon, said Genetek Lifesciences from Wardha would release its first batch of Amphotericin B (emulsion) next week. “Since the drug was manufactured in Vidarbha, we expect the region to get a bigger share in the statewide distribution as the demand is more,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sugar-test-for-92k-covid-recovered-patients-in-ngp-rural/articleshow/83048818.cms||Soumitra Bose

The issue came to fore after an audio clip was circulated by one of the students, where a teacher of ‘Kirsan Mission’s College of Management’ at Goregaon asked him to pay money to clear the papers.A two-person inquiry panel was set up by NU Board of Examinations and Evaluation (BOEE) during its meeting on Thursday. It would be headed by commerce faculty dean Sanjay Kavishwar and Management Council member Urmila Dabir would be its member.“After receiving complaints against Kirsan Mission Institute of Management, I had a talk with students and they confirmed that one of their faculty members had offered to help clear their exams in lieu of money. We asked panel members to submit their report within a week. The report would be placed before the BOEE, which would decide the further course of action, including punishment for the college,” BOEE director Prafulla Sable told TOI.College president Namdeo Kirsan refused to take repeated calls for his comments, and neither did he respond to the text messages by TOI. Though offering an MBA course, the college has only two faculty members. One teacher abruptly disconnected the call when TOI asked him who had asked for bribe from students to clear them in exams. He then did not pick up calls.Former Management Council member Mahendra Nimbarte, who sent the audio clip to BOEE director, claimed that many students had deposited money in the concerned teacher’s account. He alleged the college management had clandestinely taken permission from NU to conduct offline exams, by falsely claiming that they were facing connectivity issues.“NU should have taken action against the college management and disaffiliated it for such serious offences. The students told me that such acts were common in their college. After my complaint, the teachers warned all students against revealing anything to NU probe panel members, and also threatened to ruin their career by failing them in all subjects,” Nimbarte told TOI.He also demanded a probe into how NU officials granted permission to the college to allow all students to appear in offline exams despite Covid-19 cases spiralling in the district. “I request NU to immediately stop allowing colleges to conduct postgraduate exams, as the majority of them help students to clear it. Such acts are rampant in absence of any monitoring. I wonder why NU can’t conduct PG exams when they have a proper system in place,” he said.TESTED, NOT OKAY* Teacher demands bribe from a student to clear exam* Student recorded conversation, sent it to other friends* Management Council member Nimbarte forwards it to BOEE director Sable* Latter speaks to students, who confirm bribery allegations* Issue placed before BOEE members for further action* Two-member panel set up to probe allegations against college||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-to-probe-mba-inst-teacher-demanding-bribe-to-clear-students-in-exams/articleshow/83048883.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||India||Supreme Court: HCs can’t refuse pre-bail & stay arrest||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday resolved a dichotomy in approach of high courts and ruled that they can’t reject anticipatory bail plea of an accused and at the same time grant protection from arrest for a specified period. A bench of CJI NV Ramana and justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose gave this ruling while dealing with two orders of the Allahabad HC, which, while dismissing anticipatory bail applications of the accused, had granted them 90 days to surrender before the trial court to seek regular bail and protected them from coercive action during this period. Writing the judgment, Ramana said the sole issue requiring adjudication “in the present appeals relates to whether the HC, while dismissing the anticipatory bail applications of the respondents, could have granted them protection from arrest”. The bench set aside the HC orders but proceeded to interpret the jurisdiction of the HCs in granting pre-arrest bail. The CJI said the HCs and SC were given powers to grant anticipatory bail to the accused because of the premium that the Constitution places on the right to liberty guaranteed under Article 21. “The grant or rejection of an application under CrPC has a direct bearing on the right to life and liberty of an individual,” he said. “The provision needs to be read liberally, and considering its beneficial nature, the courts must not read in restrictions that the legislature have not explicitly provided for. Any ambiguity in the language must be resolved in favour of the applicant seeking relief,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-hcs-cant-refuse-pre-bail-stay-arrest/articleshow/83053699.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Goa||Primary health centre, Ayush hosp will share space at old GMC premises: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday visited the old Goa Medical College (GMC) complex at Ribandar and said that a primary health centre (PHC) and an Ayush hospital will co-exist at the premises. “Ribandar will have an Ayush facilite and a PHC, there is enough space for both the facilities,” he said. Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate said that the PHC’s out-patient department would commence from August 15. Monserrate and his son, Panaji mayor Rohit, also visited the premises along with the chief minister. “We had gone there for an inspection as the CM had promised to allot us space,” said the Panaji MLA. “He has already allotted a place for the PHC, and has promised that the functioning of the health centre (will start) by August 15. Work will start now. The OPD will function from August 15.” On May 24, the state government announced that a new Ayush hospital would come up at the building that earlier housed GMC and then Goa Institute of Management (GIM). The building has been allotted for the Ayush hospital for 30 years at a nominal rent of Rs 100 per sq m per month. This prompted many Ribandar residents to complain that the state government had reneged on the promise to convert the historic building into a 30-bed full-fledged PHC, to cater to medical emergencies of the residents of Ribandar, Chimbel, Merces, Divar, Old Goa and surrounding areas. “Our proposed health centre file was approved by the health minister six months ago, but was stalled by the chief minister due to opposition from Union Ayush minister Shripad Naik, who wants his Ayush centre there,” said advocate Aires Rodrigues, who has been part of a local effort to set up a PHC at Ribandar. Locals said that Monserrate and the government are paying lip service and are not serious about setting up the PHC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/primary-health-centre-ayush-hosp-will-share-space-at-old-gmc-premises-cm/articleshow/83048983.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Despite Covid horror, NMC gives less than 2% for health infra||Nagpur: Despite the coronavirus pandemic having exposed the inadequacy of healthcare infrastructure in city, Nagpur Municipal Corporation seems to have learnt no lesson. In its budget 2021-22 budget, NMC has earmarked just 1.96% of its revenue towards augmenting medical facilities. Though the mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar both claimed civic body has geared up for the anticipated third wave of Covid, they allocated a paltry Rs 55 crore for improving health infrastructure. They admitted it was a meagre allocation. “If needed, we will divert funds from other heads for strengthening the city’s health infrastructure,” Tiwari said. NMC has earmarked a separate Rs 10 crore for procuring Covid-19 vaccines. However, requirement is of Rs 30 crore for procuring vaccines through global tender. “Besides, NMC has also appealed to elected representatives including corporators, MPs, MLAs, MLCs to donate their discretionary funds towards procuring vaccines,” the mayor said. To tackle 'third wave', 100 beds in its three hospitals – KT Nagar, Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya and Pachpaoli Maternity Hospital will be reserved for Covid-19 positive children, Bhoyar said. NMC will also hold post-Covid health checkup camps in six assembly constituencies in the city. Patients who tested positive between April and May will be screened by ENT, dental specialists and pulmonologist at this camp, Tiwari said and added that the civic body was collecting data of such patients. The camp will focus on post-Covid health complications like mucormycosis. With increasing demand for breast milk for newborns whose mothers are either infected or have died due to Covid, a human milk bank was an option, said Bhoyar. In the pandemic, parents of many newborns faced hardship in feeding babies, said Tiwari, who suggested to the standing committee chairman to include this project in the NMC budget. “If the city had a human milk bank, this could have helped many affected newborns,” he said adding, “Many metro cities in the country already have such banks.” NMC will also set up a research centre for sickle cell patients at Pachpaoli Maternity Hospital. With the help of a central government scheme, the NMC will develop a day care facility and provide other medical services like blood transfusion, counselling etc. Free cataract treatment among other health related facilities will be in the offing this financial year, the mayor said. Bhoyar also earmarked funds for setting up 75 Vande Bharat health clinics announced by the mayor. NMC has already shortlisted 89 places across the city where these centres will come up. “The civic body has already invited expression of interest from NGOs and doctors wishing to provide free medical treatment to the citizens,” said the mayor. NMC will also procure 1,000 oxygen cylinders and has also received oxygen concentrators from many donors. These will come in handy in times of crisis, the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-covid-horror-nmc-gives-less-than-2-for-health-infra/articleshow/83048942.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He said water and power supply were the two major issues Navelim constituency faced when he got elected as the MLA in 2017. Speaking at a function held to inaugurate five new transformers in Navelim in the presence of power minister Nilesh Cabral, Faleiro said, “When I took over as MLA of Navelim in 2017, the power supply from KRC substation was 6.3 MVA. I don’t know what magic the electricity engineers were doing all those years to supply this limited power to all four panchayats of Navelim constituency. We then installed additional 10 MVA transformer and increased the supply to 16.3 MVA. With a new 40 MVA substation coming up at Davorlim, we will have 56.3 MVA power supply soon.” Faleiro was effusive in his praise for the electricity department personnel for working hard to restore power supply in the entire Navelim constituency, which was hit by Cyclone Tauktae recently. As a token of appreciation, Faleiro presented several linemen of the electricity department with a commendation certificate and a gift. “I would like to place on record that had it not been for your commitment to duty before self, sense of public welfare, display of leadership in an emergency situation, sacrifice of personal interests in the face of calamity of huge proportions, we would not have been able to restore electricity and bring about normalcy within a span of three days,” read the citation signed by Faleiro. Cabral said administration sanction has already been granted for underground power cabling in Navelim and the proposal was pending financial approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navelim-witnessing-power-infra-upgradation-faleiro/articleshow/83049164.cms||---

Currently, the counselling is done at the counselling centre at VNSGU. City police have started a campaign on social media to create awareness about its new initiative. “Our aim is to prevent suicides. Under this programme people can get help over call or can opt for personal counselling. We are working to reduce the number of suicides,” Surat police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI. He also held meetings with representatives of Vandrewala Foundation and expert psychologist from VNSGU while planning for the programme. The counselling began on Thursday. Under the existing setup, any person rescued from a suicide bid by police is taken for counselling along with his family members. Dr Bali Bhadani, counsellor at VNSGU, does the counselling of the individual and his or her family members separately. “I have counselled six individuals and all of them had different issues. As a counsellor I try to convince them that they are important for their family and society,” said Bhadani. “It is a good initiative by the police where VNSGU is also supporting the department,” said Dr Rudresh Vyas, head of the psychology department at MTB Arts College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-cops-counsel-those-rescued-while-attempting-to-end-life/articleshow/83047228.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The council said that if an explanation doesn’t come through it will move court pointing to the lakhs of public money spent on this project. “Electricity/public utility ducts consisting of two 300mm diameter concrete pipes on either side of the road were provided supposedly for laying electricity cables. These ducts which cost the public exchequer over Rs65 lakhs were never used as they didn’t match the specifications required by the electricity department,” Savio Coutinho of the Shadow Council told reporters on Friday. Coutinho has demanded that the government and the Public Works Department (PWD) as well as the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) come clean on “this criminal wastage of public funds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-water-provision-lying-unused/articleshow/83049228.cms||---
---||Goa||Digital meters reimbursement scheme launched||Panaji: The state government has notified a scheme to provide financial support to taxi operators and autorickshaw owners for installation of digital fare meters. Titled ‘Goa State Public Transport Reimbursement of cost of Digital Fare Meter 2021’, the scheme covers the cost of digital meters borne by existing taxi/rickshaw owners for vehicles registered on or before March 31, 2021. The notification read that taxi and autorickshaw operators in the state are currently “facing challenges mainly due to the burden of rising cost of operations” owing to which the scheme has been launched to “alleviate them from this problem” by reimbursing the cost of device purchased by vehicle owners from vendors approved by the state government. They operators will receive reimbursement of the cost of the device upon fitment of a digital fare meter with printer and Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking device. “The amount will be reimbursed in two instalments. The first instalment of Rs 4,290 after three weeks from the date of installation and operation of digital meter, and the remaining Rs 4,289 after one year after renewal of the yearly data charges and furnishing of proof,” the notification read. The reimbursement scheme will be valid for a period of two years – 2021-22 and 2022-23. Applicants have been directed to install the digital fare meters within six months from the date of publication of notification of the scheme and claim for reimbursement within the period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/digital-meters-reimbursement-scheme-launched/articleshow/83049311.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘367 genome sequences of B.1.617 variant reported from Gujarat’||AHMEDABAD: The B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, first reported from India and currently the dominant variant in several other countries, has reported 3,316 genomic sequences from the country according to GISAID portal, an international platform to report the genomic data. According to the platform, Gujarat recorded 367 sequences of the variant, second only to Maharashtra’s 1,289 among Indian states. The GISAID data claimed that in the past four weeks, 71% of the total sequencing from India indicated B.1.617 variant. In fact, the analysis by Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) – available on its website – indicates that among the sequencing carried out during the second wave, B.1.617.2 is found to be dominant. It confirms the national trend where states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Bihar, etc. are recording more cases of the sublineage of B.1.617.2. The GBRC data indicated that the B.1.617.2 is found from the samples taken from Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Gandhinagar, Tapi and Navsari, whereas B.1.617.1 is found in samples from Surat, Vadodara and Gandhinagar. The third sublineage B.1.617.3 is not reported in Gujarat, and is seldom seen in India, said experts. So does the sublineage change the virus’ property? Dr Urvesh Shah, professor and head of the pathology department at GCS Medical College, said that T478K mutation is found on the genome of B.1.617.2 and not on other B.1.617 variants. “The mutation takes place on the S1 gene of the virus. The overall variant is more virulent and infectious compared to other variants – but when it comes to sublineage, it doesn’t make much difference in terms of symptoms or medical treatment,” he said. “Having said that, understanding the sublineage can help understand the spread of a specific mutation, and it should be studied.” Along with Gujarat, several other parts of India reported change in pattern of the pandemic where the entire families got infected – something not seen during the first wave – along with higher infectivity among working age population, changed symptoms like diarrhoea and several patients having negative RT-PCR reports but treated for Covid due to lung infection. Experts attributed the change to new variant.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘Federalism’ row after PM-CM ‘brief’ interaction||KALAIKUNDA/KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday took an aerial survey of Cyclone Yaas-ravaged parts of East Midnapore and announced a Rs 1,000-crore package in immediate relief for three states, 50% of which would go to Odisha, the rest divided between Bengal and Jharkhand. The state’s assessment of immediate damage caused by the cyclone, as presented by CM Mamata Banerjee to the PM, was Rs 20,000 crore. The amount will be released “on the basis of the damage” assessed by an inter-ministerial team which will tour the three states. The PM was told that the maximum damage due to the cyclone occurred in Odisha and partly in Bengal and Jharkhand, according to a release. The PM assured the people of Odisha, Bengal and Jharkhand that the Centre “would closely work with the state governments” and extend all possible assistance to restore and rebuild infrastructure. . However, the PM’s review meeting at Kalaikunda Air Force base — attended by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Debasree Chaudhuri, state opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari and the PM’s adviser, Bhaskar Kulbey — sparked heated political debate, with BJP accusing the CM of prioritising politics before people. Earlier, Banerjee and CS Alapan Bandyopadhyay had met the PM and submitted reports on preliminary losses. The entire schedule of the PM-CM meet was coordinated with the PMO, Nabanna officials said. It is learnt that the CM’s chopper reached Kalaikunda around five minutes after the PM flew in from Odisha. Bandyopadhyay said the CM first flew to Hingalgunj — bordering Bangladesh — and then to Sagar Islands. “After meeting the honorable Prime Minister in Kalaikunda, she reached Digha to gain a hands-on knowledge from the district officials,” he said. Sources said Banerjee’s schedule had been fixed on Wednesday, whereas the PM’s schedule was known only on Thursday. Later, Nabanna was first informed that the review meeting would include the governor, and the Union ministers. Suvendu Adhikari was included even later. On Friday, the CM flew in to meet Modi without disrupting her meetings to take a first-hand knowledge of the worst-affected zones. The schedule was known to the PMO. When the CM reached Kalaikunda, the PM was reportedly in a meeting. She sought time to meet the PM, interacted with him, and left with his permission to keep her commitments. Emerging from the meeting, Adhikari and Chaudhuri told reporters that it was time for all to rise above politics, but as the day wore on, BJP functionaries — including Adhiukari and even home minister Amit Shah — launched into a fusillade against Banerjee. This prompted Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray to say: “Three weeks ago the people of Bengal showed them their place. Today, central ministers gang up on Twitter (yes!) to give sermons to the Bengal CM. Some people never learn. After murdering federalism, they must know that federalism is not one way traffic. LEARN from her, don’t lecture her”. Adhikari had earlier said: “I will not neither wade into any controversy, nor will I attack anyone politically. It was my responsibility to take our collective demands to the Prime Minister. I was in touch with the PMO and the Union home minister’s office. I had also spoken to the Union home minister. I was asked by the PMO to attend the meeting. I saw the CM meet the PM and hand over reports.” Asked whether his presence and the CM’s absence were linked, Adhikari said: “Did she say that? Did the state say that? Why will I respond to imaginary questions?” Chaudhuri, too, said it was time to rise over politics. But later, Suvendu wrote on Twitter: “Today is a dark day in India’s long-standing ethos of cooperative federalism, a principle held sacred by PM Narendra Modi. The way Didi behaved with PM reflects her dictatorial nature and lack of respect for constitutional values. Instead of working with the PM for the betterment of West Bengal, she is indulging in petty politics.” Suvendu’s statements was backed by Union home minister Amit Shah, who posted on Twitter, “Mamata Didi’s conduct today is an unfortunate low. Cyclone Yaas has affected several common citizens and the need of the hour is to assist those affected. Sadly, Didi has put arrogance above public welfare and today’s petty behaviour reflects that.” BJP national president JP Nadda also posted on Twitter, “When Hon PM Shri @narendramodi stands strong with the citizens of West Bengal in wake of cyclone Yaas, Mamata ji should also set aside her ego for the welfare of people. Her absence from the PM’s meeting is murder of constitutional ethos & the culture of cooperative federalism.” Governor Dhankhar too posted: “Certainly by such actions neither public interest nor interest of state has been served.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/federalism-row-after-pm-cm-brief-interaction/articleshow/83050188.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Initial Cyclone Yaas damage Rs 20,000 crore, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee tells PM Modi||KOLKATA/KALAIKUNDA/DIGHA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee handed over a preliminary Yaas damage estimate of Rs 20,000 crore to PM Narendra Modi on Friday after surveying the devastation left behind along Bengal’s coastal zone by the cyclone on Wednesday. Banerjee also gave Modi two “long-term assistance proposals”, seeking Rs 20,000 crore more from the Centre for ecologically sustainable rehabilitation packages for the ecologically fragile Sundarban and Digha belts. “I told the PM to ‘please do whatever you feel is needed’ before taking his permission to leave,” Banerjee said later. “But we will probably not get anything at all,” she added. “The PM called for a meeting (in Kalaikunda). But I had a meeting in Digha that was scheduled earlier. So I went to Kalaikunda along with the state chief secretary, met the PM and handed him a report (on the damages). I also proposed two schemes. I told him that I had flown down from Sagar because he wanted to meet me and then took his permission to leave (for Digha),” Banerjee said. The CM, who went to Hingalganj in North 24 Parganas and Sagar Island in South 24 Parganas earlier on Friday, repeated the timeline for “duare tran (doorstep relief)” and warned that complaints of discrimination of relief and denial (of rightful claims of damage) would not be tolerated. All claims should be made to state officers, she said, adding that there should not be any misuse of funds. Cyclone victims should be able to submit their applications at their village or block office from June 3 to June 18, she said. “There were some irregularities during Amphan, which brought us disrepute. This will not be tolerated. There will be direct bank transfer of compensation this time,” Banerjee added. The CM’s brief meeting with the PM in Kalaikunda, where she was accompanied by state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, was followed by a scheduled administrative meeting in Digha to assess the extent of damage in East Midnapore. She visited the ravaged Digha coast and announced that Bandyopadhyay would oversee the Digha Development Authority’s functioning and head a committee to suggest long-term sustainability programmes on how the coastline could be better insulated against the repeated battering from cyclones. Banerjee also directed East Midnapore district magistrate Purnendu Majhi to ask private contractors to repair at their own cost the roads, dykes and bridges that been damaged within three years of construction. A dozen administrative blocks along the coast and rivers were under water and 18 lakh people had been directly affected by the cyclone, Majhi told the CM, adding that 7000 hectares of agricultural land — some with standing crops — and fisheries could have been damaged by saline water. The CM’s next aerial survey will focus on Nandigram, Khejuri and Ramnagar on Saturday. The CM focused on security of women and children staying in relief camps in North 24 Parganas and asked district magistrate Sumit Gupta to arrange for adequate relief and ensure pregnant women did not face any problem. In South 24 Parganas, she told district magistrate P Ulganathan to ensure money was not wasted on mud embankments that could not protect villages from heavy rains and cyclones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/initial-cyclone-damage-rs-20k-cr-cm-tells-modi/articleshow/83050098.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Centre calls West Bengal chief secretary to Delhi, state sees red||KOLKATA: The Centre on Friday shifted state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay to New Delhi and asked him to report at the North Block by 10am on Monday. The order, which seniors in the Bengal government called “unexpected, unprecedented and reeking of vendetta politics”, came four days after the Centre approved a threemonth extension for the 1987-batch officer. A letter signed by an undersecretary from the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions reached Nabanna on Friday evening, asking the state government to “relieve Bandyopadhyay with immediate effect”. The state chief secretary was scheduled to retire on May 31 but Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to PM Narendra Modi on May 10 — five days after taking oath as CM for a third straight term — requesting that Bandyopadhyay be allowed to continue in his current post for three more months because of the ongoing pandemic. The Centre intimated its approval of this request on May 24, four days before the new order reached Nabanna. Bandyopadhyay, on a tour of Bengal’s Yaas-ravaged coastal zone with the CM, did not react to the order but seniors in the government called the Centre’s flip-flop “unexpected and unprecedented”. “It is not clear how this type of a ‘central deputation order’ applies to IAS officers who have not applied for any central deputation,” an officer said. CM Banerjee, too, did not react immediately to the central order but people close to her said she was “clearly unhappy”. “She cited Bengal’s Covid battle in her letter to the PM and felt it was important that Bandyopadhyay, head of the state disaster management authority, continue. The situation has not changed in four days. And, along with Covid, Bengal is now battling the impact of Yaas. So, very clearly, this decision is not administrative but entirely political, aimed at harassing Bengal when it is facing multiple problems,” a senior aide said. Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray asked “how low the Modi-Shah’s BJP could stoop”. “Has this ever happened since Independence? Forced central deputation of a state CS.... All because people of Bengal humiliated the duo and chose Mamata Banerjee with an overwhelming mandate,” he added. Other Trinamool seniors accused BJP of “very clearly indulging in vendetta politics” and “prioritising politics over people”. “The chief secretary is on the verge of retirement. His commitment to work and his dedication, especially after losing his younger brother to Covid, is exemplary. The BJP wants to keep Bengal disturbed,” party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu, however, refused to see any politics in an “administrative decision”. Central government rules say an officer can be deputed to the Centre or any other state and, if there is any “disagreement”, states must obey the Centre’s decision. The Centre last year invoked a similar clause to transfer three IPS officers but the Bengal government refused to release them. All three officers still serve in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centre-calls-state-cs-to-delhi-bengal-sees-red/articleshow/83049932.cms||---

Work commenced on Thursday and one lane of the road leading towards the lake was asphalted. However, due to the instructions issued, the other half of the road, which has damaged patches, remained undone, resulting in difficulty of vehicular movement. PWD has been instructed to halt all road work till further orders due to the rain brought in by cyclone Yaas. Officials in Vasco said that if they had got just one more day, they would have at least finished the other side, leveling the road. Now, if the work does not restart soon, the asphalting will be taken up only after the monsoon. TOI had highlighted the road work issue in its edition on May 24. It may be recalled that movement of traffic on the main road, near the Vasco KTC bus stand has been hampered due to the ongoing work by the sewerage department. According to officials the sewerage department had undertaken work of changing the old pipeline from Chicalim to Harbour, Sada, to a new high-density pipeline. Road cutting permission was issued with a clause that it shoule be completed by March 31 to enable the hot-mixing work. The sewerage department has now said the work not be complete this monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/incomplete-road-work-hampers-vasco-traffic/articleshow/83049371.cms||---

The first is against J Anand, a teacher of Maharishi Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School in Chetpet who has been suspended, and the second against P Nagarajan, an athletic coach who is a superintendent in the GST Commissionerate. Meanwhile, sexual harassment complaints against school teachers are pouring in from different parts of the city since the arrest of PSBB’s G Rajagopalan. Of the 30 complaint petitions received by police across the state, Chennai accounted for15. In the case of Anand, with social media flooded with posts of personal experiences of survivors of harassment, Kilpauk deputy commissioner Sasi Mohan gave directions and the jurisdictional allwomen police contacted the former students who made the allegations. A senior police officer said, “We are recording the statements of the complainants.” The school management, which suspended Anand, issued a release stating that a committee had been formed to inquire into the charges made against him by some of the institution’s alumni. In the other case, 59-yearold Nagarajan, who is set to retire from service in aboput six months, is accused of making sexual advances towards a triple jumper and touching her inappropriately under the pretext of administering physiotherapy. A police officer said Nagarajan, after realising he was booked, attempted to end his life by consuming sleeping pills and was admitted to the Government Royapettah Hospital. The officer said deputy commissioner (crimes against women and children-CAWC) H Jayalakshmi, who has been assigned to investigate the case against Rajagopalan and the others, can be reached on her mobile phone number 9444772222. The complainants’ details will be kept confidential, the officer said. The CAWC team has been flooded with complaints against many teachers for sexually harassing them and is looking into every case. The team probing the Rajagopalan case has received two more complaints against the teacher, claiming he harassed them too. Investigators have taken note of the formal complaints and will soon record the complainants’ statements as per provisions of the Pocso Act. Commissioner Shankar Jiwal, who on Friday visited the residence in Kilpauk of Satish Babu, a policeman infected with Covid-19, later told reporters that the cyber crime wing is keeping tabs on the sexual harassment complaints pouring in against school teachers in the city.

Sources in the district health department said unfounded fears, compounded by shortage of vaccine, was the key factor for hesitancy in the village.Gopinatham gram panchayat, comprising Gopinatham and seven remote tribal hamlets, has had 66 Covid cases and one death since the pandemic broke out in March 2020. The panchayat currently has 16 active cases. Source said 60% of the residents in the area are 45+, making them eligible for vaccination. But the vaccine coverage in this part of the district is so poor and patchy that just three persons have been administered vaccination in the deep forests of MM Hills. Sources said nearest primary health centre is 43km away, and health personnel from there visit Gopinatham once in two weeks. They have so far made two visits and a third is due in the next week. Panchayat development officer SR Kiran Kumar told TOI that they have been trying to convince villagers about benefits of vaccination and spike rumours of possible side effects. On the brighter side, he said all panchayat officers and ASHA workers have been vaccinated. After the district minister, deputy commissioner and chief executive of the zilla panchayat launched an awareness campaign recently, some 100 villagers have expressed willingness to participate in the next vaccination camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-only-3-jabbed-in-veerappans-village-in-chamarajanagar/articleshow/83053764.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Goa||NIH scientist conducts summer salinity test on Mandovi river||KERI: The Roorkee-based National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) on Friday collected water samples of the Mandovi river and its tributaries to measure their salinity. The Union ministry of water resources had ordered the salinity test of the river, which is known as the Mhadei in its upper reaches, on a request by chief minister Pramod Sawant in light of the ongoing dispute over water-sharing between Goa and Karnataka. “I have visited different locations of the Mandovi river, the Mhadei and the Valvonti to collect water samples to measuring salinity. We drew samples of water during the monsoon last year too. It was essential to study the salinity in the summer before the onset of monsoon,” NIH scientist Gopal Krishan told TOI. The Goa government had expressed apprehension over the diversion of water for the Kalsa-Bhandura project into the Malaprabha basin from the Mhadei basin. The water diversion would lead to heightened salinity in the Mhadei, thereby causing ecological imbalances, the Goa government has held. There would be increased tidal base water flow due to which villagers would suffer environmental problems as well as depletion of underground water. Shrikant Patil, chief engineer of Goa’s water resources department told TOI, “For Goa, situated on the west coast, the fresh water flow of rivers coming from the Western Ghats is important to maintain ecology during the monsoon. Diversion and damming under the Kalsa-Bhandura project will have serious implications on Goa’s ecology, environment and wildlife. That is why we have given importance for the study of salinity by the NIH.” The NIH scientist was accompanied by Goa’s WRD assistant engineer Dilip Naik and junior engineer Agnelo Fernandes. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa in March had made a budget allocation for the Kalsa-Bhandura project after the award of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal was notified by the Centre. The hearing before Supreme Court in the matter of the special leave petitions filed by Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka could not take place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Samples were last taken in February 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nih-scientist-conducts-summer-salinity-test-on-mandovi-river/articleshow/83049489.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Bengaluru||Vax officers in Karnataka flooded with wish lists from VIPs, netas||BENGALURU: While the Covid-19 vaccination drive is not yet fully open to all in the 18-44 age group, nodal officers in charge of government vaccination centres say they are flooded with recommendations from politicians and VIPs seeking the jab for anyone they refer. Many nodal officers are yielding to the pressure. They ask the vaccine-seekers to fill up the eligibility certificate and that has to be duly signed by designated authorities. Most vaccine-seekers end up claiming to be Covid volunteers or healthcare workers or those with comorbidities. The officers maintain a list of persons who were given vaccine out of turn and who they were referred by. "We don't take the risk of signing on the eligibility certificates. If it's a government employee covered under the priority group, that needs to be supported with documents," said a doctor. When contacted, Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka, said the officers should go by the guidelines. Vax drives causing more stress: DocSome nodal officers who strictly adhere to the guidelines say they are facing the wrath of their own staffers. “Vaccination drives have been causing more stress,” said an officer, explaining the non-cooperation faced at work.“As per the government directive, family members of healthcare workers are not included in the priority groups. This is known to doctors and nurses. But they want their children, spouses, nieces and nephews in the age group of 18-44 to be vaccinated. When I decline, they get angry and disappointed,” the doctor said. Another nodal officer in a government hospital said some requests are to issue certificates for the vaccines taken elsewhere. “Some people have accessed the vaccine out of turn, but have not received certificates as they were not eligible. Now, they ask us to issue certificates, which is strange,” said the doctor. The vaccine certificate carries the batch number of the vaccine, name of the nurse who gave the vaccine along with the date and place where the vaccine was taken. This is required to ensure tracking the vaccine record in case adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is reported. Vaccine-eligibility certificates are uploaded on Co-Win portal, but it is a blackhole as no one further checks their authenticity. “The eligibility certificate is accessed only if the person develops an AEFI. Hence, there are many fake comorbidity certificates on Co-Win,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vax-officers-in-karnataka-flooded-with-wish-lists-from-vips-netas/articleshow/83053805.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Active cases have been rising since March 6 and on Thursday, the state had 3,13,048 patients under treatment. On Friday, it dropped to 3,12,386. Also for the first time in four weeks, the discharge count (31,255) outpaced the fresh infection count (31,079). For the seventh consecutive day, new cases registered a decline. The major hotspots — Coimbatore (3,937) and Chennai (2,762 — recorded a decline compared to Thursday. On the flipside, TN on Friday recorded the highest single-day tally of 486 deaths, taking the total to 22,775 ₹ fourth highest in the country after Maharashtra (93,198), Karnataka (27,405) and Delhi (23,951). Among the 486 who died in TN on Friday, almost onefourth (117) had no comorbidities like diabetes or hypertension. Coimbatore had more cases than Chennai, but had 33 deaths against 107 in Chennai. The death count remained the same in Chennai’s neighbouring districts of Chengalpet, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, which together reported 3,314 cases, 10% of TN’s new cases. The infection curve rose not only in Coimbatore but also in Tirupur (1,823), Erode (1,731 new cases), Madurai (1,140 cases) and Theni (576). Health minister Ma Subramanian said two ministers and one IAS officer were deployed to monitor the situation in Coimbatore. Black fungus The state has so far reported 400 mucormycosis (black fungus) cases, with Chennai having the most (113) followed by Vellore (74) and Coimbatore (43).

Of 3,200 ventilators granted under the PM Cares Fund last year following the first wave, 1,400 have been used so far, according to health department officials. Around 2,000 were received after the first wave and the rest during the recent second wave. Only 150 ventilators were in use till the second wave hit the state, and the government distributed 1,400 ventilators among private and government hospitals only in the past few months. At the deputy commissioners’ video conference recently, CM BS Yediyurappa directed them to make best use of ventilators supplied under the PM Cares Fund. Deputy CM Ashwath Narayana, after being appointed task force chief, ensured districts made best use of ventilators. Of the 1,800 ventilators, majority have been lying idle in hospitals for want of skilled staff, including technicians, doctors, anaestheticians and nurses, to operate them. Some have technical defects. Dearth of trained staff main challenge: ExpertThere were certain issues regarding utilisation of new ventilators which are being addressed. While almost all ventilators have been installed, about 10% have technical problems and repair work is going on,” said health department director Dr Patil Om Prakash R. Health officials said they’re getting reports from districts that several ICU beds with ventilators have been activated in the past couple of days. “We’re making the best use of ventilators supplied under PM Cares Fund. We have used 300 ventilators in government and private hospitals in Mysuru,” said Mysuru deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri. Another deputy commissioner said he received 28 ventilators recently. “They are lying idle since other ICU equipment such as multichannel monitor, infusion and suction pumps and desimulation units were not supplied,” he added. Ventilators are useless in many hospitals since they don’t have the required ICU cots. Reports from other districts are not encouraging. “We were given 20 ventilators, of which six are dysfunctional,” said Dr S Naveen, principal, Rajarajeshwari Medical College and Hospital, Bengaluru. The main challenge is the dearth of trained staff, according to Dr MK Sudarshan, chairman, Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee. He said there’s an acute shortage of manpower — a ventilator unit needs two doctors, two anaestheticians and three nurses. “Now that DCs have been asked to hire doctors and other staff locally on contract, the situation is improving,” he added. Narayana said distributing ventilators among private hospitals was to make use of their manpower and infrastructure. “Doctors are critically needed and we’re able to see more admissions into ICU beds with ventilators after taking private hospitals on board,” he added. As on Friday, 599 of the 620 ventilator beds in BBMP limits were occupied. Officials said the list excludes those which have not been used yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/more-than-50-of-pm-cares-ventilators-in-karnataka-unused/articleshow/83053787.cms||B V Shivashankar
